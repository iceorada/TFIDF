<LD>The Argyle Hotel was buzzing as BMG Entertainment execs and their
friends awaited the night's big winner: Alicia Keys. The 21-year-old
songstress earned five Grammys Wednesday night, marking a major win
for Clive Davis. Carlos Santana was on the patio taking in the view.
Jimmy Jam was checking out the buffet. Davis, the founder of J
Records, was halfway through his victory lap when a friend tapped him
on the shoulder. "Alicia's here," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Davis immediately excused himself and headed through the thick
crowd. He didn't get very far. Every few steps he was stopped by a
well-wisher. "The Bigwig!" one man shouted to Davis. "She's
wonderful!" a woman exclaimed. Another man chimed in: "You did it!"
Davis offered thanks and kept moving. The closer he got to Keys'
corner of the room, the more densely packed the dark suits. But the
crowd parted for Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Keys sat on a purple couch, under a large photograph of Marlene
Dietrich, her braids covered by a pink scarf. Despite the noise and
activity around her, she seemed perfectly calm, just taking it all
in. Davis went straight to her, and Keys stood as he whispered to
her--something about hard work paying off and savoring "the lifetime
moments." (It was a big moment for Davis, as well, who's credited
with discovering Keys. He signed her to Arista Records, then took her
with him when he founded J Records.)</LD>
<TE>   Keys listened, closed her silver-glittered eyes and said, "Wow."
And then, "I'm very happy." They hugged. Then they sat down to eat
salad from Chinese takeout boxes (a caterer's clever idea), while
Keys' bodyguards kept fans at bay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities Indulge in Martinis and Comfort Food</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, things were just gearing up a few doors down at the
Mondrian Hotel party sponsored by the Warner Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   At one end of the hotel's restaurant Asia de Cuba, KISS guitarist
Paul Stanley grabbed a handful of chocolate-covered strawberries. At
the other, Kid Rock, accompanied by Pamela Anderson, appeared content
as the sole smoker in the no-smoking restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance to the restaurant, Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob
Thomas was locked in an embrace with a young woman, blocking traffic.</TE>
<TE>   From the top of the Sunset Strip to downtown restaurants, the
Grammy parties were scaled back compared with last year, when labels
invited thousands of people to attend their celebrations. Guests
appeared more intent on networking than letting loose, a logical
shift considering the music industry's recent struggles and massive
layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the downtown parties, EMI had invited guests for an
evening of comfort food and martinis at the Park Plaza. Outside, on
the outdoor patio that became the epicenter of the party, women in
minuscule dresses and men in tight shirts pretended not to notice the
sudden explosion of camera flashes that signaled the arrival of
singer Nikka Costa, concentrating instead on flagging down waiters
who milled around offering drinks to wash down Americana fare of
macaroni and cheese and mini cheeseburgers.</TE>
<TE>   A 35-year-old transplant from Chicago was one of several guests
who had brought a disposable camera to document her first Grammy
party. She didn't try to shoot Beck,  who had made a cursory stop
earlier in the evening, she said, but rather, she aimed for shots of
strangers. "Unposed photos to get the essence of what the party [is]
like," she said, adding that she preferred to be known only as an
urban tourist. "It's very eclectic," she said of the EMI party,
"really young people with celebrities--the artists--sprinkled
throughout."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, Downstairs at Staples Center</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier at the Staples Center, there were two distinct
experiences of the Grammy Awards. On the lower levels, the event had
the aesthetic of a sporting event, despite the cocktail dresses and
tuxedos. Guests--including some of the nominees--prepared themselves
for the 31/2-hour telecast by eating their fill of hotdogs,
hamburgers and Cracker Jacks, which they bought at concession stands
along with beer and wine in plastic cups. Grammy souvenirs, T-shirts
and show programs were hot sellers.</TE>
<TE>   But no one was buying beer or trinkets upstairs in the sky boxes,
where executives from Pepsi, Westwood One, Budweiser and Wells Fargo,
among others, went to enjoy the Grammys. Buffets were stocked with
lobster and caviar, sushi, steak sandwiches and private bars featured
top-shelf vodka and special reserve wines. Around the corner in the
private Grand Reserve Club, an invite-only crowd (friends of the
Staples Center owners) could gawk at the red carpet from a balcony
while sipping champagne and nibbling on foie gras.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nominee Fashions Range From Haute to Handmade</TE>
<TE>   During the commercial breaks at the awards show, the best
entertainment was the crowd. The black-tie dress code seemed to have
a different meaning for every one of the thousands of guests.</TE>
<TE>   One woman wore pants covered in giant, sequined butterflies.
Another wore a black dress positioned so carefully on her body that
from the side, she appeared to be nude. There were red feather halter
tops, ball gowns and lots of cleavage.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this fashion fanfare, Juaquin and Jennifer
Hamilton-Youngbird managed to stand out. The couple came to Los
Angeles from Shawnee, Okla., because their drumming group, Youngbird,
had been nominated for a Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer wore an electric blue, satin dress and a wrap with bright
sunbursts on it. Juaquin, 27, wore an orange hand- beaded vest, the
same one he got married in, he said. Both outfits were decorated by
sunburst symbols significant to the southern Cheyenne, Juaquin said,
touching his black cowboy hat.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out a month ago that we were coming," Jennifer, 25,
said. "We were so excited we made all our own outfits.... We tried to
do glamour our own way."</TE>

<LD>THE AMERICAN SOUL</LD>
<LD>   Rediscovering the Wisdom of the Founders</LD>
<LD>   By Jacob Needleman</LD>
<TE>   Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam</TE>
<TE>   372 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The writing of American history flourished ever more strongly as
the 20th century unfolded. American historians, building on the work
of their often illustrious predecessors, looked at the story of this
country with ever-increasing sophistication and depth.</TE>
<TE>   So it is startling to encounter a book whose author says he wants
to "remythologize" the story of America, to rebuild its "mythic
meaning." Joseph Needleman, the writer and popular professor of
philosophy at San Francisco State, has in "The American Soul" served
up a messy soup of vague religion, patriotism and questionable
readings of the American past.</TE>
<TE>   Needleman asserts that the founding basis of this country was "not
land or tribe, but the call for people to assemble together and work
together for the Good." This call, which he implies had a religious
basis, has been lost, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly why it has been lost, Needleman does not say. He implies,
though, that this "loss" had something to do with the Vietnam War,
and says bluntly that "the war [in which he did not serve] destroyed
the meaning of America for millions of the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   What, in fact, is the "meaning of America" that was destroyed?
Needleman does not say, directly. Instead, he gives long quotations
from Walt Whitman's essay "Democratic Vistas," in which Whitman waxes
lyrical about the potential individual improvement of men and women,
"bearing golden fruit."</TE>
<TE>   From Whitman's prose he proceeds to his own:</TE>
<TE>   "The teachings of wisdom bring us," Needleman intones, "to the
idea that it is through [the] inner power of intelligence and
conscience that the Good can enter the world of man and, through
humanity, the world of the earth. Wisdom teaches us that the world
has become what it has become, human life has become what it has
become because man has lost contact with this consciousness and power
of understanding within himself.</TE>
<TE>   "What is sometimes called God, so the teachings tell us, acts in
the world to help the world--yes, but not as some fairy-tale father
figure with a white beard moving the chess pieces of history, but
through the authentic consciousness of man.</TE>
<TE>   "It is that consciousness--morally asleep in us though it
be--through which the helping powers operate. Through us, and into
the earth, and from the earth back to the Source as man's genuine
help for the creator. The Founders of America were passionately
oriented to teachings that in some distinct and significant measure
reflected those ideas."</TE>
<TE>   So that's it? "The meaning of America" somehow, perhaps, reflects
some Divine Plan? Throughout "The American Soul" Needleman hints at
such a meaning, but he is never explicit. (Just what are those
"helping powers," anyway?) Needleman's prose brings urgently to mind
Mark Twain's 12th rule of writing in his 1895 essay "Fenimore
Cooper's Literary Offenses": The author shall "say what he is
proposing to say, not merely come near it."</TE>
<TE>   Needleman addresses slavery, by focusing on Frederick Douglass,
and the American Indian, through tales and legends. Both are gripping
subjects, but Needleman diminishes both by his exaggerations. " ...
America was built," he writes, "on the destruction of its native
peoples and on the institution of slavery....To a great extent, the
material success of America rests on these crimes and others like
them."</TE>
<TE>   Economic historians would differ. Slavery did not advance but
retarded the economic growth of the slave states. The lamentable
destruction of the Indian way of life was not a cause but a
consequence of the spreading flood of white settlers across the
continent. And what those other crimes were, Needleman does not say.</TE>
<TE>   More often a bull session than reasoned discourse, far more
emotional than analytical, "The American Soul" obscures its subject
by a verbal blizzard in which both writer and reader lose their way.</TE>

<HD>Extreme Fashion Needs No Censor</HD>
<DH>Musicians show their fun side at the Grammy Awards but
avoid the skin-baring shockers of ceremonies past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Musicians are a crazy, uninhibited lot, full of rebellion and often
scandalous in their actions and attire, but they were better dressed
than ever at the 44th Grammy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The stars walking the red carpet at Staples Center on Wednesday
lacked a single jaw-dropping outfit that pushed the limits of bad
taste, but they didn't disappoint fans of extreme fashion. You gotta
love that Elvis Costello and Erykah Badu can show up in snowboarders'
footwear, and that Alicia Keys can reignite the sparkly makeup craze
just by batting her glitter-encrusted eyelids. Of course, it was more
fun when Jennifer Lopez or Toni Braxton tweaked the censors with
their revealing gowns in past years.</LD>
<LD>   This year, though, the fun was in the spectacle of it all--from
Tony Bennett to OutKast and 'N Sync to Dr. Ruth Westheimer, who was
nominated for narrating a children's album. Where but the Grammys can
you encounter Tim Curry discussing how to wear platform shoes (take
them off!), Miss Laura of the Queens of Comedy sharing shopping tips
(go to L.A.'s Fashion District) and Costello explaining why he drinks
sparkling water now ("You have a certain amount of drinks you can
have in your life, and I had those").</LD>
<TE>   With such a crowd as that, it's no wonder that the fashion on
parade was a grab bag of glad rags. Unlike movie stars, who are the
shape shifters of entertainment, musicians can stick with a
well-defined look. If Lil' Kim didn't show her midriff, we might not
recognize her, though in $1.7 million of Harry Winston diamonds and a
red leather Chanel motorcycle outfit, she's hard to miss. Soul man
Bootsy Collins wouldn't be Bootsy Collins if he wore a suit. He
personally designed his winged-lapel leopard jacket, swinging flared
pants and towering top hat. Dressing in outrageous costumes is just
part of life for him now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing it so long, I probably couldn't leave home
without it," he said, adding that he's more careful what he wears
around his Great Dane and Rottweilers. "If I wore this," he said,
"they'd probably think I was some sort of bad animal."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike years past, however, more stars presented a toned-down
image. Mya may have worn a super-short Versace mini with sheer lace
insets, but it wasn't as bare as it could be: Sleeves covered her
arms. Britney Spears abandoned the ultra-low hip-huggers for an
evening dress that was, by her standards, conservative. Musicians in
all aspects of the industry, whether they sing gospel, country or
rock, seemed to be casting off trashy for classy.</TE>
<TE>   "Gaudy is not cute," said R&amp;B singer Blu Cantrell, who wore a
ruffled Diane von Furstenberg tiger-print evening gown. "I think you
should be funky, but also classy." Others seemed to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "When I feel like I want to get dressed up," said Rob Thomas of
Matchbox Twenty, "I want to get swanky. I don't want to do it
halfway." Thomas, whose wife, Marisol, is a model, flashed the purple
lining in his rust-colored Ozwald Boateng suit, complete with shirt
and tie.</TE>
<TE>   Trendsetting singer Mary J. Blige explained that she, too, is
feeling a new compulsion toward sophistication. She wore a pinstripe
denim Dolce &amp; Gabbana pantsuit and floral corset that showed off her
svelte new self, and her more classic leanings.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a grown-up right now," Blige said. "I'm movin' on. I
get tired of sitting down and having your thong hanging out."</TE>

<LD>What do you think the American West looked like in the 1800s? Before
television, computers and even photographs, people experienced the
West through paintings. Many artists painted pictures of rugged
mountains, wild rivers, and the people who lived there.</LD>
<LD>   Take a look at this painting about the American West. See if you
can figure out what the artist was trying to say.</LD>
<LD>   * Study the painting. The artist is trying to persuade people to
do something. What is the first thing you notice about this painting?
What are the people doing? What are they carrying?</LD>
<TE>   * Look at the details. What types of symbols are used to describe
the West? What difficulties do you think people faced when they
traveled west? What do you think the people are feeling?</TE>
<TE>   * Draw conclusions. How do you think the arrival of new people
affected the West? How did their arrival affect the people who
already lived there?</TE>
<TE>   This is an 1872 painting called "American Progress" by John Gast,
who was hired by George Crofutt to paint the West. Like many people,
Crofutt thought it was America's "destiny" to move west. Who was
already living in the West when pioneers moved there?</TE>
<TE>   Now it's your turn. Draw what you think are the types of things
that you might find in the Old West. John Gast had never traveled
west when he painted "American Progress."</TE>
<TE>   Use your imagination. What groups of people will you encounter?
What types of things might you see? Will you remember to include
Native Americans, Chinese, Mexicans, African Americans, and others
who lived in the American West? How about such things as rugged
mountains, horse saddles, and Indian artifacts?</TE>
<TE>   The Autry invites you to bring your piece of art to the museum and
compare it to the reality of life in the West as shown at the museum.
Show the drawing and you will get free admission for you and one
adult. For more information, call (323) 667-2000 or visit
www.autry-museum.org.</TE>

<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those inclined to handicap this fall's publishing season already are
giving long odds that the year's most controversial nonfiction book
will be historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's "A Moral Reckoning: The
Catholic Church During the Holocaust and Today," which landed on his
editor's desk this week.</LD>
<LD>   The essential points of Goldhagen's 400-page manuscript were made
in an extraordinary 27,000-word essay recently published in the New
Republic magazine--"What Would Jesus Have Done? Pope Pius XII, the
Catholic Church and the Holocaust."</LD>
<LD>   In it, Goldhagen alleges that the church's basic theology and
essential symbols have always been and remain to this day
fundamentally anti-Semitic. He charges, among other things, that
Popes Pius XI and Pius XII were active anti-Semites and that the
latter "must be classified as a Nazi collaborator," along with
"Quisling in Norway, Petain and Laval in Vichy."</LD>
<TE>   Goldhagen describes the Roman Catholic Church as "this
pan-European institution of world-hegemonic aspirations," and alleges
that "it tacitly and sometimes materially aided [Hitler] in mass
murder."</TE>
<TE>   A former Harvard professor, Goldhagen also is the author of
"Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,"
a 1996 bestseller arguing that "eliminationist" anti-Semitism was
inextricably interwoven into the very fabric of German culture. As a
consequence, Goldhagen believes, average Germans at all levels of
society were not only willing, but also enthusiastic participants in
Adolf Hitler's attempt to murder Europe's Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitler's Willing Executioners," an expansion of his 1994 doctoral
thesis, was praised by such Harvard historians as Stanley Hoffman and
Simon Schama, as well as by many younger German scholars. The
response of many Holocaust specialists and German cultural
historians, by contrast, ranged from reserved to frankly critical.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to his New Republic essay was more intense. Andrew
Sullivan, the New Republic's former editor (anti-Goldhagen), and Leon
Wieseltier, the magazine's longtime literary editor (pro-Goldhagen),
engaged in an unusually sharp exchange on their publication's Diary
page. The Forward, America's oldest Jewish newspaper, published a
front page news story about the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The Forward reported that clerics and scholars engaged in
Jewish-Catholic dialogue had "found a rare point of agreement in
their criticism" of the essay. Rabbi David Rosen, international
director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee,
alleged that Goldhagen "has an unconcealed antagonism against the
Catholic Church, and it shows."</TE>
<TE>   Goldhagen does not intend to comment publicly until his entire
book is published. However, at least some scholarly and critical
reaction is likely to be influenced by the book's unusual genesis and
by the rapidity of its composition. According to Carol Janeway,
Goldhagen's editor at Alfred A. Knopf, he did not begin work on his
history until "last April or May," when he was commissioned by
Wieseltier and Martin Peretz, the New Republic's editor in chief and
chairman, to review 10 books on the subject, including such recent
titles as "Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews" by James
Carroll, "Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII" by John
Cornwell and Gary Wills' "Papal Sin: the Structures of Deceit."</TE>
<TE>   "Martin and Leon asked Danny if he would consider doing a long
review and essay on different aspects of this issue," Janeway said
this week. "At the time, he was deeply enmeshed in a book on genocide
for [Knopf], but he agreed to set it aside and to engage this because
they offered a proper amount of space. The more Danny read and
thought about the issue, the more strongly he began to feel something
considerably longer was required. We said he could set aside the
genocide project for now, because this question mattered so much to
him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Future Online</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kinsley, who stepped down last month as editor of Slate,
Microsoft's still-unprofitable online magazine, rather poignantly
compared himself to Moses, who glimpsed the promised land but was
unable to enter.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment neither Slate nor its major competitor, Salon, has
ever turned a profit, though Kinsley said his former publication is
close. Many online magazines of the future, he predicted, "will be
subsidized. Their small, steady losses will be made up by some rich
person, as occurs now with the New Republic or the Weekly Standard.
But there also will be profitable publications."</TE>
<TE>   The imminent arrival of new "tablet" handheld PCs, he said, will
make "the distinction between online and print magazines disappear.
You'll be able to take it to the john or on an airplane, just as you
do a paper magazine today." Time and Newsweek will be available on
tablet shortly and Slate has elaborate plans for a print-out version.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kinsley believes that online journalism's greatest
failure continues to be an insufficient application of multimedia
technology to cultural news and criticism. "If you're writing about a
book, you quote from it," Kinsley said. "The Internet makes it
possible to quote directly in the same way from the music, film or
art about you're writing. We don't do that now and it's everyone's
failure. Another way to think about it is to imagine what percentage
of the words in a music review are given over to haltingly describing
the music itself, when the Internet lets you quote rather than
describe" without the necessity of links. "The main reason it hasn't
happened," Kinsley said, "is that smart cultural writers weren't
interested in integrating quotations of this sort into their texts
and resisted using multimedia in the way we could use it.
Unfortunately, some writers think that what makes them serious is
their austerity about these things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Championing 'Real' News</TE>
<TE>   Though only recently published and spottily reviewed, "News About
the News: American Journalism In Peril" by Leonard Downey Jr. and
Robert Kaiser, who are respectively executive editor and associate
editor of the Washington Post, went into its second printing this
week. As the title suggests, the book takes a dim view of large
swaths of the contemporary journalistic landscape, including the
television networks and all-news cable channels, increasingly given
over to chat shows populated by empty nattering heads. The big
newspaper chains also come in for withering criticism for putting
profits ahead of quality. "Obviously, I'm biased," said Jonathan
Segal of Alfred A. Knopf, the book's editor. "But I think that in
this post-9/11 world, the reception this book has received is
particularly important because the authors' argument is not only that
real news matters, but also that serious news standards matter."</TE>

<DL>Milan, Italy</DL>
<LD>MILAN, ITALY--It's no Paris, no Florence; heck, this city isn't even
as attractive as Detroit. But it is a fashion capital, so the fall
2002 collections kicked off here earlier this week under
dishwater-dreary skies. After the first few days of shows (lesser
names, mostly), the mood here, as in New York during last month's
fall presentations, is a bit subdued. No big blowouts are planned;
even Iceberg isn't hosting its traditional after-show bash.</LD>
<LD>   But shopping is one thing Milan can be counted on for, and, after
11 years in business, 10 Corso Como is still the "it" place. Even in
a city crowded with designer boutiques, the store continues to stand
out with an eclectic collection of men's and women's clothing, books
and housewares. Housed in an airy temple to Italian design with
colorful modern light fixtures set against white walls tiled with
mitochondrial designs, 10 Corso Como is to Milan what the Colette
boutique is to Paris.</LD>
<TE>   There are plenty of deconstructed separates from Comme des
Garcons, Costume National and Viktor &amp; Rolf, along with less serious
looks from Emilio Pucci, John Galliano and Prada. What's nice is that
the clothes are organized into enclaves by designer, often with
corresponding designer books for sale. For example, "Radical
Fashion," a book from a recent exhibit at London's Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum, is thoughtfully placed in the section stocked with pieces
from the English line Preen and from Chloe, the label formerly
designed by Brit Stella McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   Only one complaint: Marc Jacobs is the sole American designer in
sight, and he is only represented by a few lone pairs of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Jewelry and decorative items are also available, along with select
beauty products such as scents from Courreges, Yohji Yamamoto and 10
Corso Como's own.</TE>
<TE>   There's an art gallery and bookstore upstairs, overlooking the
store's courtyard cafe, with loads of fashion, design and photography
titles, as well as Italian translations of such rebel classics as
"Catcher in the Rye" and a selection of CDs.</TE>
<TE>   This empire of hip is run by Carla Sozzani, a former editor at
Italian Vogue, who recently contributed to Time magazine's first
fashion supplement, along with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, stylist and POP magazine editor Katie Grand and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I said yes to the project because I thought it was so interesting
that Time wanted to do fashion," Sozzani said at a gallery opening
she hosted Wednesday for fashion-turned-art photographer Sarah Moon.
Time magazine's fashion supplement, available in Europe, features a
Tom Ford for YSL gown on the cover as the dress of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fiorucci Still Doing a Booming Business</TE>
<TE>   Fiorucci may be long gone from L.A., but it is still hopping here.
Just a few blocks from the Duomo, the store continues to sell its
signature cherub T-shirts like hot cakes, along with fun accessories
like Astro Turf covered flip-flops, rhinestone tiaras, studded
leather hippie belts and necklaces with charms emblazoned with images
of sexy pinups.</TE>
<TE>   And for those who are wondering, no, the recently opened SoHo
store in New York doesn't hold a candle to this one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home Away From Home for Angelenos</TE>
<TE>   On Via Sant'Andrea, near the famous Via Montenapoleone shopping
district, Banner is an Angeleno's home away from home. The blond wood
boutique is sparsely decorated with bamboo and other Zen
accouterments, and features a well-edited collection of looks from
Burberry, Dries Van Noten, Junya Watanabe and some great pieces from
Italian designer Daniela Gerini, including a coat hand-painted with
images of Picasso's Cubist masks and a swingy skirt with figures that
are pure Paul Gauguin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Driving Moccasin Hits Streets</TE>
<TE>   There's a new driving moccasin in town: Car Shoe, a company owned
by Prada, opened its first shoebox-sized shop this week on Via Spiga.</TE>
<TE>   The mocs, which look a lot like Tod's pebble-soled versions except
wider and with laces, come in every color of the rainbow for men,
women and bambino. And at $180 here, they cost about the same as
Tod's, too.</TE>

<HD>Leather: With Good Care, It'll Get Plenty of Wear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I just purchased my first leather jacket and am
unsure how to take care of it.</LD>
<LD>   Can it be worn in the rain? How should it be stored and cleaned?</LD>
<LD>   Any other hints would be welcome.</LD>
<TE>   --INTO LEATHER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Into: Congratulations on your entry into leather jacketdom.</TE>
<TE>   A leather jacket is a wardrobe staple, and if you choose a classic
style (which we recommend if it's your first jacket and your budget
is tight), it will get plenty of wear.</TE>
<TE>   Caring for leather garments is essential for prolonging their
life. If you treat them well, they'll treat you well.</TE>
<TE>   We spoke with Sandy Blye of the New York-based Leather Apparel
Assn., who offered these tips for caring for leather clothing:</TE>
<TE>   * "A leather jacket is not a raincoat," said Blye, although she
added that getting caught in the rain is sometimes unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   If the jacket isn't soaked, wipe it with a soft cloth and place it
in a well-ventilated area away from direct heat. Never use a
blow-dryer on it.</TE>
<TE>   If the jacket is completely wet, take it to a professional,
accredited leather cleaner (you can find one in your area on the
association's Web site, www.leatherassociation.com).</TE>
<TE>   * Hang your garments on wide or padded hangers, never wire ones.
This will help maintain their shape.</TE>
<TE>   Never store them in plastic, such as storage containers or those
plastic covers from the cleaners. These won't allow the leather to
breathe, and over time it may become very dry and eventually crack.
Cloth garment bags are OK.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep leather away from heat and sunlight and, if you live in a
cold climate, make sure you remove any salt deposits you might have
picked up while outside. Sponge with plain water, wipe with a soft
cloth and air-dry.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't use any products such as silicone or wax that will form a
seal on the leather and not allow it to breathe.</TE>
<TE>   * If wrinkles don't hang out, you can iron them by choosing the
rayon setting, then placing heavy kraft paper on the leather side of
the garment. Move the iron around; don't let it sit in one spot.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid using hair spray or perfume while wearing your jacket, and
don't stick name tags on or put pins in it. Both can do major damage.</TE>
<TE>   * Wearing a scarf around your neck can help prevent transferring
makeup and oils onto the garment. This is especially important for
light-colored leather.</TE>
<TE>   * Take good care of your leather clothes and you won't need to
make regular trips to a cleaner. Stains, dirt, rips and tears should
be taken care of by a professional.</TE>
<TE>   * Blye said that suede should be cared for the same as leather;
but instead of a soft cloth, use a suede brush to bring up the nap.
Those new washable suede clothes really are machine-washable (the
suede is chemically treated), and some are even machine-dryable. Be
sure to follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.</TE>
<TE>   She added that specially treated washable leather clothes should
be in stores soon.</TE>
<TE>   Blye called us from a leather apparel trade show, so we asked her
for some trend news. "Trends are really following ready-to-wear," she
said, "so we're seeing a lot of details like topstitching, patchwork
and clothes with a lot of shape. Lengths are all over, from a short
bellman's jacket to knee-length coats. The trend is really away from
black--everybody knows black leather. So there's a lot of brown, plus
red, yellow, light blue. Lighter colors will be big for spring."</TE>
<TE>   The association is happy to answer any questions from consumers;
you'll find its e-mail address on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FROM THE FASHION POLICE BLOTTER: Medical ID bracelets are a
necessity for many people with diabetes, life-threatening allergies
and seizure disorders. However, until now the bracelets themselves
have usually been utilitarian and not particularly fashionable.</TE>
<TE>   Parkville, Mo.-based Lauren's Hope offers a line of beaded
bracelets with a medical alert tag that combines style and function.</TE>
<TE>   A young diabetic girl named Lauren sparked the idea when she told
her mother she didn't care much for her clunky ID bracelet. Her
mother contacted two friends who were already turning out jewelry and
asked them to make something Lauren would wear. From there the
business grew.</TE>
<TE>   The bracelets have a stainless steel rectangular medical tag with
lobster-claw clasps on either side that enable the wearer to change
the beading. The bracelet choices include 14-karat gold filled beads,
sterling silver beads, Swarovski crystals, sterling block letters and
semiprecious stones. There are even beaded men's styles.</TE>
<TE>   The bracelets are custom-made to size and can be personalized for
any medical condition or allergy. Prices start at $39.95.</TE>
<TE>   Information on the bracelets can be found on the Web site
www.laurenshope.com, or call (800) 360-8680.</TE>

<HD>At Ease, Finally</HD>
<DH>After a six-month deployment, Marines and sailors relax
with family as they head back to U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD THE USS PELELIU, midway from Hawaii to San Diego--The
helicopters and jets in the hangar bay of this amphibious assault
ship have been repositioned to make room for the ship's band,
Midwatch.</LD>
<LD>   The band belts out the Carlos Santana anthem "Black Magic Woman,"
followed by Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the U.S.A.," while the
children of sailors and Marines get their faces painted in the
camouflage pattern of Force Recon, the Marines' special operations
troops. And for this trip, the stench of jet fuel has been replaced
by the aroma of fresh popcorn.</LD>
<LD>   The Peleliu--and its two smaller companion ships, the Dubuque and
the Comstock--are headed home to San Diego after six months at sea,
much of it acting as the "tip of the spear" in the U.S. war on
terrorism. Several hundred family members of the 4,000 men and women
of the Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group were allowed to board the three
ships in Hawaii for the journey's final seven days. But not spouses,
girlfriends or boyfriends. War or peace, the Peleliu is a war ship,
not the Love Boat--no conjugal visits allowed.</LD>
<TE>   Marines from the Peleliu group--the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit
from Camp Pendleton--were the first conventional U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, with 1,500 troops establishing a base Nov. 25 at a
deserted Taliban facility dubbed Camp Rhino and then pushing on to
the war-torn Kandahar Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Sea Knight and Super Stallion helicopters from the Peleliu ferried
troops and supplies throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Harrier
jets flew combat missions in support of U.S. and Afghan opposition
forces. The Peleliu brig housed American John Walker Lindh and
several other Taliban and Al Qaeda members for several weeks before
they were transferred.</TE>
<TE>   "We did whatever needed doing for America," said Sgt. Warren Ford,
25, of Philadelphia, a communications technician who doubled as a
brig guard.</TE>
<TE>   And their efforts were appreciated. On this day, a message from
Army Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command in
Afghanistan, is posted on bulletin boards throughout the ship. In it,
he congratulates the Peleliu group on a job well done, saying they
had "struck the first blow in what will be a long and arduous
campaign against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   When the ship was deployed in the Arabian Sea its flight deck
bristled with the movement of combat Marines being sent ashore and
air strikes being launched. But that's in the past, and the order of
the day now is relaxation; the job of maintaining the ship continues
but at a less frenetic pace. There is still busy work to get done,
inventories and reports and evaluations to complete, but, for most,
there is plenty of free time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Lt. Pitts, your bingo officer," blares a voice on the
ship's public address system. "Bingo starts at 1930 (7:30 p.m.).
Location to be announced. Stand by." For the competitive minded,
there are poker games, cribbage and, among younger naval officers, a
cutthroat game of Cranium, a cross between Trivial Pursuit and
Monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   Touch football games break out on the flight deck near a group of
sunbathers, and the computers are busy as Marines and sailors send
e-mails home. And, of course, there is karaoke night. There is time
now too for recreational reading: Tom Clancy, Dean Koontz and John
Grisham are popular. Lance Cpl. Garrett Clapp, 23, from East Lansing,
Mich., has been studying the swimsuit issue of Maxim magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, there is also considerable talk of the amorous
possibilities when the ship reaches Camp Pendleton on Sunday and the
32rd Street Naval Base in San Diego on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Cpl. Jahti Manselle, 22, an ordnance technician with a Harrier
squadron from Yuma, Ariz., plans to be married the week after his
return. He's considering Las Vegas, maybe at one of those chapels
with the Elvis look-alikes. "I'm ready to go home and be done with
all this for a while," Manselle said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they look forward to fun and freedom, there exists a sense
of uncertainty. After sailing from San Diego on Aug. 13 to begin a
routine six-month deployment to the Arabian Sea and western Pacific,
the Peleliu's Marines and sailors were enjoying liberty in Australia
on Sept. 11. Officers were dispatched to order everyone back to the
ship immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard that America has changed," said Lt. (j.g.) Dan Punt,
24, of Santa Monica, a surface warfare officer. Being home "may seem
weird at first."</TE>
<TE>   Some want to ease back into post-Sept. 11 America by visiting
places that are familiar and unchanged. "I'm going to Disneyland and
Universal Studios with 10 relatives," said Lt. (j.g.) Christina
Matos, 27, of Long Island. "First, I'm going to rest, then my mom and
I are going shopping," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Tori Tassone, 22,
of Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, demonstrations are being held to show visiting family
members, called Tigers (once the nickname for military kids, it has
caught on for all relatives), the capabilities of the ship, its crew
and its Marines. The Harrier demonstration and the Marine martial
arts show--Semper Fu--were particularly popular. Ditto the showing of
Disney's "Pearl Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred Marines flew home in advance of the ship, so there
are some bunks available for guests. Otherwise, the Tigers are put up
in the ship's hospital, in officers' staterooms, in the hangar
bay--wherever there is room for a cot.</TE>
<TE>   When up on the flight deck, the visitors are heavily supervised.
"We're very careful with our Tigers," said Capt. Dennis DuBard, the
ship's skipper. "We don't want to lose any overboard." Guests are not
allowed on deck at all if the wind is gusting too hard.</TE>
<TE>   For 9-year-old Trey Atkinson of Homewood, Ala., the demonstration
of the Harrier's vertical liftoff was a big hit. "Those Harriers are
really cool," he said. "None of the kids back home have seen that."
Trey's uncle is Staff Sgt. Brent Atkinson, who works in Intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Blomgren, 10, daughter of Petty Officer Boomer Blomgren of
San Diego, seemed taken with the martial arts demonstration. But when
asked what she liked best, she said it was simply seeing her dad. "I
miss my dad so much, it's so good to be with him finally."</TE>
<TE>   Terence Donigan, 57, a retired plumber from Syracuse, whose son is
a Marine captain, wanted to see the ship's boilers, normally
off-limits for visits. Call it professional curiosity. He was not
disappointed. "Very impressive boilers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trip home is not all fun and games. In anticipation of the
celebrating that will commence after the group gets home, sailors and
Marines get a lecture from Sgt. Rusty Burkett of the San Diego County
Sheriff's Department about the evils of drunk driving. Burkett adds a
cautionary note about Tijuana, a mecca for young service personnel
because of its permissive rules about alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them, unless you lost something in Tijuana, there's no
reason for you to go down there," Burkett said. "It's a whole
different country down there."</TE>
<TE>   There are also counselors on board to talk with the newly married
who will soon discover the strain that a six-month separation can put
on a marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Although the war on terrorism was its highest priority, the
Peleliu also provided dental, medical and construction aid in East
Timor, Qatar and Djibouti on the Horn of Africa before beginning its
mission in Afghanistan. "If you're not going to engage when you
deploy, you might as well stay home," said Col. Thomas Waldhauser,
commanding officer of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit.</TE>
<TE>   War is a group activity, with each Marine or sailor required to
coordinate actions with others. But returning home is a solitary
thing, filled with individual yearnings.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the other grunts are talking about hanging out and
partying all night," said Cpl. Jamie McDonald, 21, an infantry Marine
from Cabot, Ark. "But, you know, all I want to do is go home and see
my family. I never felt so homesick as I did in Afghanistan."</TE>

<HD>Meet Dr. Seuss</HD>
<DH>Part 5 /  The story so far: Ted Geisel, now known as Dr.
Seuss, has finally found success writing and illustrating children's
books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Geisel was asked by Random House to write a Christmas story. He
wrote all but the end in a week. It took 21/2 months to find the
right ending. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" was the result. Asked
where the name Grinch came from, he said, "I just drew him and looked
at him, and it was obvious to me who he was."</LD>
<LD>   Given a list of 225 words to use in writing an easy-to-read book,
Geisel studied the list until he found two words that rhymed, cat and
hat. "The Cat in the Hat" became the first of his many fun-filled
easy-reading books. One book, using only 50 simple words, was "Green
Eggs and Ham." Unfortunately, once that book came out, he often had
to eat green eggs and ham when invited to speak at a conference.</LD>
<LD>   Ted believed his books had to be funny. Humor, he believed, "is an
important way of keeping the right outlook on the world." His wife,
Helen, said, "His mind has never grown up."</LD>
<TE>   Helen's death in 1967 was a great loss. She was his editor,
business manager and love. He married again, to Audrey Stone Diamond,
but his lifestyle remained the same. He worked eight hours a day.
When not writing, drawing or gardening, he read four or five books a
week.</TE>
<TE>   In his late 60s Ted became concerned with the damage done to the
earth, water and air. From this concern came "The Lorax." "The Butter
Battle Book" was about the dangers of nuclear war. By his 80th year,
he had more than 40 books in print and had won a Pulitzer Prize for
his lifetime contribution to children's literature, a great honor.</TE>
<TE>   Theodor Geisel worked into his late 80s. He died in 1991 at age
87.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by a friend what message of wisdom he would like to
leave the world, he said, "Whenever things go a bit sour in a job I'm
doing, I always tell myself, you can do better than this." He
remembered his dad's words: "Whatever you do, do it to perfection."</TE>
<TE>   Kids, March is the fifth anniversary of the National Education
Assn.'s Read Across America project, which celebrates the joys of
reading and honors Dr. Seuss, whose birthday is Saturday. For more

<TE>   Gloria D. Miklowitz's biographies from the Kids' Reading Room will
be published by Dominie Press in the fall. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new five-part story begins
Monday.</TE>

<HD>KNBC Races to Top of the Sweeps Heap</HD>
<DH>Television* The local affiliate gains hugely from Olympic
coverage, despite tape delays. Rating results turn up a few
surprises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON  and DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC's hugely popular coverage of the Winter Olympics predictably
boosted the network's owned-and-operated local station, KNBC-TV, to
the gold-medal platform for the just-concluded February sweeps,
according to local Nielsen ratings data released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Games averaged a 19.5 prime-time rating locally, virtually
mirroring the NBC's national average. That was despite the decision
to delay coverage so it could play in prime time on the West Coast,
even though some events were seen live in other time zones. (Each
rating point equals a little more than 53,000 households, or 1% of
the more than 5.3 million homes with television in the Los Angeles
viewing area, the nation's second-largest market behind New York
City.)</LD>
<LD>   KNBC's 11 p.m. news, which traditionally beats rival newscasts on
KABC-TV and KCBS-TV, handily came out on top again with prime-time
Olympic coverage as a lead-in. Also, the station's special
early-evening newscast "Channel 4 News: Olympic Edition" triumphed
over KABC's syndicated "Jeopardy" and all other series at 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   KABC's "Eyewitness News," meanwhile, continued its domination of
the afternoon news race coming out of "The Oprah Winfrey Show,"
followed by KNBC and KCBS. KABC General Manager Arnie Kleiner said
the station succeeded overall despite the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't give up the ghost," Kleiner said. "Not everyone watches
the Olympics. And we didn't hold back. We introduced our Live Doppler
7000 [a real-time weather radar system], we went to Afghanistan, we
went to Cuba, we didn't spare expense to go where news was happening.
We treated this sweeps like any other month."</TE>
<TE>   KCBS continued to struggle in the afternoon, with ratings for its
5 and 6 p.m. newscasts down 21% and 18%, respectively, from last
February. In addition, KCBS' "Judge Judy," which was brought in last
year at 4 p.m. to help boost the station's afternoon news block, was
down 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Other local highlights included a new twist in the usually tight
10 p.m. news race between KTLA-TV (owned by Tribune Co., the owner of
the Los Angeles Times) and Fox's KTTV, as well as a shift in the
morning competition.</TE>
<TE>   KTTV's "Fox News at 10," which squeaked by KTLA's "News at 10"
last February, won somewhat more decisively this time around with a
3.7 rating to KTLA's 3.4.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the true success story at 10 p.m. belonged to KCOP-TV and
its "UPN News at 10." While KTTV and KTLA experienced ratings drops
of 16% and 19%, respectively, KCOP's newscast grew by 15% in the
ratings, benefiting from UPN's 22% increase in prime-time viewing
versus last February, thanks to series such as "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," "WWF Smackdown!" and "Enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   In the morning race, NBC's "Today" show came out on top locally
over ABC's "Good Morning America" and CBS' "The Early Show." All
three shows grew in viewership, with "The Early Show," which has
struggled to attract viewers, displaying a surprising 25% ratings
burst from last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The KTLA Morning News" had good and bad news in February. The
newscast edged KTTV's locally produced rival "Good Day L.A." with a
2.8 rating to a 2.7; however, the KTLA program dropped 26% from last
year, when Barbara Beck was an anchor along with Carlos Amezcua. Beck
left the station in May and was replaced by Giselle Fernandez in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Good Day Live," the syndicated version of "Good Day
L.A.," showed promise in its first major sweep, increasing the
station's time-period average at 10 a.m. by 50% from last February.</TE>
<TE>   "The media focus has always been on us versus KTLA, but we don't
think about that," said Jose Rios, KTTV's news director. "We launched
a new morning show, we're expanding our franchise, and it's doing
really well, particularly in [key demographics]."</TE>
<TE>   The new show is adding six markets to its lineup March 18,
bringing the total number of cities in which it will be available to
14.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics seemed to have little effect on Spanish-language
television, as prime-time viewing of both KMEX-TV (usually carried on
Channel 34) and KVEA-TV (Channel 52) both rose, compared with the
last major sweeps in November.</TE>
<TE>   KMEX's ratings grew from 4.5 to 4.8, while KVEA--the local home of
the Telemundo network, which was recently purchased by NBC but did
not get to enjoy any Olympic broadcast perks from its corporate
parent--went from a 1.8 rating to 2.1. Both stations lost ground,
however, from February 2001, with each down 10%.</TE>

<LD>Scrubbing hard won't erase all blemishes forever. From Jerry Falwell
to Monica Lewinsky, some disappear short term only to resurface
later, courtesy of the media.</LD>
<LD>   That also includes James Carville, who along with Paul Begala next
month will permanently succeed Bill Press on CNN, splitting duties as
the lefty component of a remodeled, expanded "Crossfire" opposite
conservatives Tucker Carlson and Robert Novak.</LD>
<LD>   As if "Crossfire" weren't predictable and mindlessly shrill
enough, the annoying Carville is such a relentless knee-jerk liberal
Democrat that he'd seem to be a candidate for knee replacement. As
for fundamentalist preacher Falwell, the Religious Right's Beavis and
Butt-head rolled into one? You'd think that he would lie low after
publicly:</LD>
<TE>   * Outing the purple-colored Tinky Winky of the PBS kids show
"Teletubbies" as a proponent of the gay "agenda."</TE>
<TE>   * Disclosing that there is a Jewish antichrist among us.</TE>
<TE>   * Blaming "pagans ... abortionists ... feminists ... gays ...
lesbians ... the ACLU [and] People for the American Way" for helping
to bring about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., a charge
Falwell later withdrew only after a public outcry.</TE>
<TE>   But him embarrassed? Him disappear? No way. Show this guy a
camera, and he'll streak across town to hug it.</TE>
<TE>   So there was Falwell on Monday's "Crossfire," debating Ibrahim
Hooper, communications director for the Council on Arab Islamic
Relations, on whether TV preacher Pat Robertson went too far recently
in rejecting President Bush's assertion that Islam, despite the
terrorism of some Muslims, is a religion of "peace."</TE>
<TE>   The issue here is not whether it is or isn't, but that "Crossfire"
suited up Falwell for this superficial duel with Hooper (who
denounced the kidnapping and killing of U.S. journalist Daniel
Pearl), affirming that appearing in a media Rolodex is as much a life
appointment as the Supreme Court. Falwell came through again, of
course, playing the role of ignorant stiff to perfection.</TE>
<TE>   He'll be summoned back, though, because he is famous and his media
fender-benders as an arbiter of morality generate curiosity the way a
crash on a freeway does.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Lewinsky returned to TV via her scheduled chat with CNN's
Larry King on Thursday night, in advance of Sunday's HBO documentary
"Monica in Black and White."</TE>
<TE>   You know how it is in this business. Her people talked to HBO's
people, and voila!</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky is shamelessly profiting from her co-starring role in
what became a national calamity. But so is HBO for agreeing to
present this one-hour-and-40-minute video memoir, a project she
proposed, and for which she has been paid an undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   "I would do anything to have my anonymity back," she insists here
while acknowledging the incongruity of that with seeking the camera.
She can't have it both ways.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how this works: HBO's agenda here is to induce viewers to
watch this shoddy number. To that end, it benefits from Lewinsky's
notoriety in exchange for a fee and exposure that she hopes will
improve her image and surely also draw attention to her line of
handbags--just as her appearance with ABC's Barbara Walters several
years ago was timed to publicize her book, "Monica's Story."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, everyone here has a vested interest. That includes
the now-entrepreneurial Lewinsky, who owes her celebrity--and
everything flowing from it--entirely to getting chummy in the Oval
Office with philandering Bill Clinton in an episode that disgraced
him, contributed to his impeachment and wounded the U.S. He's at
least as culpable, but she's the one with a documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Much of it is a tawdry rehash of the controversy surrounding those
sexual liaisons that Lewinsky had as a government intern in her
mid-20s, and the near constitutional crisis that ensued. This encore
also includes excerpts of those reliably titillating Lewinsky-Linda
Tripp dialogues, along with bits of Clinton's 1998 deposition before
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.</TE>
<TE>   In new footage, Lewinsky also criticizes her treatment by Starr's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Taped during a three-day period last spring, her interview
portions consist mostly of her answering questions from college
students and others at New York City's Cooper Union University. And
the affectionate reception she gets--loud applause, someone shouting
out "We're on your side, Monica," and even laughter when she talks
about helping Clinton cheat on his wife--is as much a comment on
those in the audience as on her.</TE>
<TE>   Did they check their values at the door? Just what did Lewinsky do
to earn their admiration and become their heroine?</TE>
<TE>   She gets one of her biggest laughs as she recalls telling Clinton
"I have a crush on you" when first meeting him in 1995, and him then
inviting her into "the back office."</TE>
<TE>   The presentation by filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato is
in artsy black and white, and staged with 27-year-old Lewinsky
sitting on the edge of a stage while pouring out her story (seemingly
wanting to blame everyone but herself for her former predicament),
with manipulative mood music edited in for dramatic effect. Yes,
let's make Monica a tear-jerky melodrama.</TE>
<TE>   As she did with Walters, she breaks down and weeps several times,
and at one point leaves the stage to regain her composure, returning
seven minutes later to more applause.</TE>
<TE>   If Lewinsky is contrite, she doesn't show it. "I do have remorse,"
she says at one point, but adds that her "stronger affinity" is for
her family and friends, not for Clinton's wife, Hillary, now a U.S.
senator from New York, and the couple's daughter, Chelsea. "I'm not
going to take equal responsibility for his family," Lewinsky says.
"They made their own choices as well." Choices? Which ones does she
have in mind?</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Lewinsky rejects being known as "the home-wrecker who
came to Washington with an agenda," suggesting that she is the true
injured party, and that if not for a previous fling with a married
teacher she says exploited her, she would not have been "comfortable"
being intimate with Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   There are two exceptions to the adoring crowd. Lewinsky appears
taken aback when a man asks how it feels to be America's oral sex
"queen." Another says: "You made this more about you and your pain
and not about your agency in having all this happen. You are not an
unwitting, silent, passive person who got caught up in something much
larger than you were."</TE>
<TE>   A woman defends her, telling her no one "should judge you."</TE>
<TE>   After pausing, Lewinsky gives her own response, telling her
accuser, "I'm just fuming."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, sure, all the way to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Monica in Black and White" premieres Sunday night at 10 on HBO.
The network has rated it TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children under
the age of 17).</TE>

<HD>A Flood of Familial Feelings</HD>
<DH>Director Mira Nair's romantic drama 'Monsoon Wedding' shows
one family's efforts to combine the traditional with the contemporary
in modern India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want to talk about the world, Anton Chekhov once said, talk
about your own village. In "Monsoon Wedding," director Mira Nair has
persuasively taken this advice, returning to India's Delhi and coming
up with an energetic and amusing romantic drama about the power of
love to make things whole.</LD>
<LD>   Nair, whose best-known work is the Oscar-nominated "Salaam
Bombay!," has said this film, conceived in a spirit of low-key
casualness, was meant to be no big deal. But because she and
screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan know their world so well and are so
comfortable in it, "Monsoon Wedding" has an engaging warmth and an
effortless sense of life. It also has an instinct for the humanity
and universality of situations that are comic, romantic and quite
seriously dramatic by turns.</LD>
<LD>   "Monsoon Wedding" takes place in an India that is finding a
balance between tradition and modernity, paralleling the way its
middle-class characters alternate between Hindi, Punjabi and English
in their everyday speech and fit venerated cultural practices into a
world of e-mail and cell phones.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, Nair's film, smartly shot by Declan Quinn in very
mobile Super 16 millimeter blown up to 35 millimeter, mixes the
reality-caught-on-the-fly techniques of independent filmmaking with
the always entertaining music and dance conventions of India's
mass-audience Bollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   Given how they combine passion, tension, unresolved emotional
issues and inevitable chaos, weddings are natural subjects for
filmmakers. Nair has upped the ante by making this a Punjabi wedding
as well. "The Punjabis are to India," she explains in a director's
statement, "what the Italians are to Europe: We party hard, work hard
and have a huge appetite for life."</TE>
<TE>   Rather like Robert Altman's "Gosford Park," "Monsoon Wedding"
begins with a welter of characters thrown at you all at once, so many
that it's understandable when one of the group confesses, "I don't
even know who's who half the time." Almost everyone onscreen is a
member of a very extended family that is gathering in Delhi from all
over the world to celebrate the arranged marriage of Aditi
(Vasundhara Das), the only daughter of Lalit (celebrated Indian actor
Naseeruddin Shah) and Pimmi Verma (Lillete Dubey), a ceremony that is
only four days away.</TE>
<TE>   All this chaos is especially hard on Lalit, responsible for
everything going smoothly as well as for paying the ever-increasing
bills. He snaps at a college-age nephew just back from Sydney,
calling him "bloody No. 1 most stupid duffer," and he snaps at his
own young son (Ishaan Nair, the director's nephew) for his
fascination with TV cooking shows. Most of all he snaps at P.K. Dube,
the wedding's caterer and event coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   As played by Vijay Raaz, Dube is a character of almost Dickensian
comic humanity. Excitable, brash, upwardly mobile to the point of
wearing an ascot, Dube is a parvenu entrepreneur who juggles the
truth the way he juggles his workers' schedules and continually
munches on marigolds, the Indian wedding flower.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all these preparations, Aditi is not at all sure she wants
to be married to Hemant (Parvin Dabas), the nice young Houston
resident she's only just met. It seems she's not quite over the
steamy affair she's had with a married man. She confesses her doubts
to her unmarried cousin Ria (Shefali Shetty), who, it turns out, has
been living with secrets of her own.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only Aditi who has barriers to overcome on the way to
potential romance, and, in the best Bollywood tradition, both the
attractions and the obstacles are partially worked out in song and
dance. The bloody No. 1 most stupid duffer catches the eye of a young
woman with a passion for Indian dance, something he knows nothing
about. And the exasperating Dube finds himself attracted to Alice
(Tilotama Shome), the family's quiet, unassuming maid. This charming,
unlikely relationship is "Monsoon Wedding's" secret weapon, the
pairing whose pitfalls and potential involve us the most.</TE>
<TE>   Because it starts out so frantic, "Monsoon Wedding's" later
moments of introspection and drama come as something of a calming
relief. And when the film's unexpected darker chords do manifest
themselves, they don't clash with the overall sense of accepting
humanity but rather extend and deepen it.</TE>
<TE>   Inescapably foreign yet endearingly familiar, "Monsoon Wedding"
manages to gather all its threads so satisfactorily that audiences
will feel like celebrating at the wedding as much as any of those
guests. "Life is such a comedy," a celebrant says, but its not often
as satisfying as the one we have here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for language, including some sex-related dialogue.
Times guidelines: a subplot involving abuse and another involving an
extramarital affair, but generally very discreet, appropriate for
older teen audiences. In Punjabi and Hindi with English subtitles.</TE>

<HD>Battle Saga at War With Itself</HD>
<DH>'We Were Soldiers' intends to pay tribute to military
heroism but delivers a viscerally antiwar message.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a simple-minded film, which is what it is, "We Were Soldiers"
manages to evoke a complex series of reactions. It both frustrates
with its unrelenting sentimentality and impresses with the
overwhelming physicality of its combat sequences. These in turn are
so powerful they take on a life of their own, sending a message that
is probably quite opposite to the one the filmmakers intended.</LD>
<LD>   "We Were Soldiers" is the first Vietnam War film with amnesia. It
stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, who in 1965 took on 2,000 of
the enemy with but 400 of his own men in the first major battle
between North Vietnamese regulars and American troops. It's the first
film to pretend that the national soul-searching the war caused--not
to mention the conflict-laden films from "The Deer Hunter" and
"Apocalypse Now" through "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July"
it inspired--simply never happened.</LD>
<TE>   Intent on celebrating the undeniable heroism of American fighting
men and taking advantage of the fact that the battle in the Ia Drang
Valley took place before the war was on most Americans' radars, "We
Were Soldiers" deftly sidesteps the messy question of why we were in
Vietnam in the first place in favor of giving deserving soldiers the
old-fashioned heroic warrior treatment. This is a film where men next
door to death say, "Tell my wife I love her" and "I'm glad I could
die for my country." Irony may not be dead nationwide, but it
certainly is here.</TE>
<TE>   In this, "Soldiers," written and directed by Randall Wallace from
the book Moore wrote with journalist Joseph L. Galloway, is smarter
than the Vietnam film it most resembles, John Wayne's 1968 "The Green
Berets." While that film is crippled by its determination to showcase
the plight of the plucky South Vietnamese and demonize the evil
North, "Soldiers" goes out of its way to paint the North Vietnamese
officers and men as equally heroic individuals who just happened to
be on the wrong side of the fence.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing wrong with celebrating genuine heroism and it's
hard to argue with Moore and Galloway's point, made in their book,
that not enough people were "sensitive enough to differentiate
between the war and the soldiers who were ordered to fight it." But
this film's sincere brand of retro revisionism and depoliticization
is going too far in the opposite direction, and Wallace's
wholehearted embracing of the extremes of corniness in the film's
noncombat sequences are certainly nothing to applaud.</TE>
<TE>   After a prologue showing French troops having their own troubles
in the Ia Drang Valley in 1954, "Soldiers" shifts forward a decade to
Ft. Benning, Ga., where Moore, assisted by leathery Sgt. Major Basil
Plumley (Sam Elliott) is a central figure in preparing junior
officers for the new air cavalry style of warfare that makes
extensive use of helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   It's unfortunate that Wallace, who wrote Gibson's "Braveheart" as
well as the recent "Pearl Harbor," has such an irrepressible passion
for sappy situations and dialogue. The gee-whiz soldierly camaraderie
he fondly depicts gets rapidly tiresome, as do the scenes of Moore's
idealized family life with wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and five of
just the cutest kids, including a little girl who winsomely asks,
"Daddy, what's a war?"</TE>
<TE>   Even in these situations, star Gibson is very much a strength,
bringing the requisite air of quiet command to one of the most
effective of his recent roles. Tough, brainy, charismatic, someone
who's as much a father to younger officers like Bruce Crandall (Greg
Kinnear) and Jack Geoghegan and his wife (Chris Klein and Keri
Russell) as to his own children, Gibson's Moore is a kind of John
Wayne for the new century, a man so indomitable it makes you wonder
how the North Vietnamese managed to win the war.</TE>
<TE>   Except for an unhappy sequence of wives back home dealing with
death announcement telegrams, "We Were Soldiers" becomes a very
different film once the men go into combat and find themselves
trapped and outnumbered like another 7th Cavalry, George Armstrong
Custer's, a century earlier. If not for the eventual presence of
reporter-photographer Galloway ("Saving Private Ryan's" Barry
Pepper), this story would probably have been even more unknown than
it is.</TE>
<TE>   The film's sentiments may be retrograde, but "Soldiers'" savage
action sequences, most impressively shot by Dean Semler using
anywhere from four to 11 cameras, are indelible, even as part of us
is saying, "Oh no, not another state-of-the-art battle film." There
has been a lot of memorable combat footage over the last several
years, from "Private Ryan" to the current "Black Hawk Down," but the
way Wallace and Semler have shot the multi-day battle that takes up
most of "We Were Soldiers'" screen time makes it stand out.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's idea was not necessarily to be as brilliantly artistic
as, for instance, Ridley Scott and cinematographer Slawomir Idziak
were in "Black Hawk" but rather to create, as he told American
Cinematographer, "a document of the battle taking place before us."
As a result, the combat in "We Were Soldiers" has a brutal, savage,
unrelenting quality, with enough of the blood, the screaming and the
life-and-death chaos of hand-to-hand combat to make the terror on the
soldiers' faces more than believable. A sequence of one soldier
trying to cut the burning parts off a comrade's face that's been
seared by a white phosphorous round is exactly as harrowing as it
sounds.</TE>
<TE>   As the battle goes on and more and more innocent young men are cut
down without a prayer, "We Were Soldiers" undercuts its avowed aims
and becomes, paradoxically, less and less the "tribute to the
nobility and uncommon valor of those men under fire" the press notes
say it wants to be and more like the classic antiwar films "Paths of
Glory" and "All Quiet on the Western Front."</TE>
<TE>   Heroism and courage are not the words that come to mind after
witnessing what we see here but rather slaughter and terrible waste.
We feel the pointlessness of these deaths, the awful devastation on
both sides. Especially because we cannot forget what this film
prefers to avoid knowing, that bravery and self-sacrifice without a
reason are not cause for celebration but rather one of the saddest,
one of the most regrettable of human activities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sustained sequences of graphic war violence
and language. Times guidelines: The level of blood and savagery is
extremely difficult to watch.</TE>

<HD>A Vivid Chapter in Hip-Hop History</HD>
<DH>'Scratch' is an engrossing documentary about the DJ
phenomenon, its seminal figures and its effect on pop culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Pray's "Scratch" does what a fine documentary does best: It
extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world, then illuminates
it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in
unobtrusively. In this instance, the world is that of hip-hop, and
its people are so likable and what they have to say so worthwhile
that they can be said to raise consciousness not only in regard to
their music, but also how it has affected their lives and those of
their fans all over the country.</LD>
<LD>   Pray begins at the real beginning by introducing us to the
still-young man who calls himself GrandWizzard Theodore. He is
acknowledged as the inventor, back in the '70s, of "scratching" a
record by moving it back and forth on the turntable and in the
process giving this backward sound a new, percussive, rhythmic
personality. As Naut Humon, co-founder of Asphodel Records, points
out, the listener now could become a participant in the music he was
listening to. We learn that scratching caught on fast with DJs, who
worked with rap artists, generally referred to as MCs. When rappers
started getting record deals, the DJs were left behind, only to
emerge eventually with their own recordings.</LD>
<TE>   The DJ phenomenon has now spread so wide that musical equipment
stores are complaining that the twin turntables and fader systems
needed for scratching are outselling guitars. Stashes of vinyl
suitable for scratching have become critically important, and access
to old records and the ability to select the best ones for effective
reworking are virtually as crucial to a successful DJ as his style
and scratching technique. Some DJs, such as the seminal Qbert and his
mentor, Mix Master Mike, are virtuosos who can transform a couple of
turntables, some old vinyl and a fader into an exciting electronic
instrument of seemingly infinite possibilities. Indeed, some DJs
speak of scratching as a new language.</TE>
<TE>   One of the film's key figures is Afrika Bambaataa, who in 1973
founded the Universal Zulu Nation in the South Bronx, where he became
a DJ and worked to bring together graffiti artists, DJs, MCs and
other street performers to create a positive alternative to gang
life. Bambaataa is credited as having the greatest influence in
shaping the culture of hip-hop. (Some DJs perform while a graffiti
artist works on stage.) What is so encouraging about hip-hop is that
it is all-inclusive and generous in spirit. Mix Master Mike says that
by encouraging Qbert, he in turn was able to learn from his protege,
who in turn has become a role model for young Filipino Americans.
Scratching is easy to do, and kids in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury
district can enroll in an after-school program in scratching at
Amoeba Records (which has a store in Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   At the very end of the highly entertaining and encouraging
documentary, GrandWizzard Theodore good-naturedly wishes that every
DJ would send him a dollar for every CD they sell, which reminds us
that hip-hop has after all become a lucrative endeavor. Theodore's
words have a familiar ring: Edward G. Robinson wished that every time
a viewer watched one of his old movies on TV, he or she would send
him a dollar too.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: The four-letter
words are fairly infrequent, and the film is otherwise ideal for
youngsters.</TE>

<HD>'Gentleman Bandit': Thief Has a Big Heart</HD>
<DH>Charlie Mattera pretty much plays himself in this estimable
tale of an ex-con with criminal tendencies and a sensitive nature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jordan Alan's "Gentleman Bandit" is a very good, satisfying B picture
with a lot of A virtues. Its lack of star power is actually a plus on
the screen but works against it at the box office. Even so, it
deserves the status of a theatrical release before moving on to
cable, a comfortable fit, and video stores.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Mattera in effect is playing himself in this film based on
his actual experiences. His Nick Vincent is a Brooklynite who seems
to have been a natural-born thief. At the same time he's a sensitive,
loving man with a generous heart. Even in high school he's presenting
his girlfriend with diamond earrings, expecting her to believe that
he paid for them with his paper route money. He has hooked up with an
equally larcenous but, in this case, craven-hearted pal Manny, who
years later sets him up for an armed robbery fall that sends him away
for eight years.</LD>
<LD>   Upon his release, he heads for California in search of that high
school sweetheart, Maria (Justine Miceli), who had married Manny
(Peter Greene), who in turn degenerated into an abusive,
hard-drinking, drug-taking husband and a violent cop. When Nick
finally tracks Maria down, he learns that she has divorced Manny,
gotten a good job and a small but comfortable apartment for herself
and her 8-year-old daughter, Ally (Kristina Malota). Maria is not
thrilled at seeing Nick again, but she lets him sleep on her couch.</LD>
<TE>   Menial jobs for an unskilled ex-con are not for Nick, who swiftly
returns to a life of crime, which provides him with the funds to
lavish presents, especially upon Ally, which allows him to melt the
mother's heart through her daughter. His kindness to Maria and Ally
and his all-around good manners do not go unnoticed by Maria's
avuncular, widowed landlord, Harry (Ed Lauter), who instantly
recognizes that Nick's hollow and vague talk about being a real
estate investor is persiflage. He, in fact, sees himself in Nick
because he has a criminal past as a cautious thief who never got
caught.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, "Gentleman Bandit" revs up as Harry comes out of
retirement to team up with Nick for a series of bank robberies during
which the older man tries to put a polish on Nick's rough edges, both
as a man and as a crook. The lonely Harry, furthermore, loves Maria
and Ally like a daughter and granddaughter, and he and Nick are in
accord in their determination to provide a better life for mother and
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Maria: She's adored by a pair of good-bad guys and still
dealing with an ex-husband who is a bad-bad guy through and through.
The strength of the stylish and efficient "Gentleman Bandit" is the
reality of these people. At heart they are ordinary and of ordinary
intelligence: Harry ought to be smart enough to not risk everything
with a loser like Nick but can't resist living through him
vicariously.</TE>
<TE>   Mattera proves to be a fine actor with a rough-hewn charm who
expresses perfectly the deep-seated conflicts within Nick that
reportedly he experienced in his own life. Miceli is totally credible
as a woman who is not at all blind in her love for a man in whom good
and evil take such outsized proportions. Always a splendid character
actor, Lauter has a resonance and presence that are key to bringing
the film alive, and Malota is appealing as bright and pretty Ally.
Greene reveals Manny to be a virtual psychopath but not without inner
conflicts of his own. Ryan O'Neal contributes a sharp cameo as an
affable Beverly Hills bank manager who has the misfortune to be the
target of Nick's first and last heists.</TE>
<TE>   A good-looking film, with Alan proving to be as adroit a
cinematographer as he is a director, "Gentleman Bandit" has as its
key strength an avoidance of special pleading; At no time do Alan and
Mattera suggest that Nick and Harry's good sides should absolve them
of responsibilities for their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: The film has standard bank robbery
action and some violence.</TE>

<HD>Are Pop Singles on the Way Out?</HD>
<DH>Music* Labels say they're unprofitable but retailers
disagree. One bright spot may be the 'maxi-single.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The first time you entered a music store, chances are it was because
there was one song you had to have.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it was "I Want to Hold Your Hand" by the Beatles, or Marvin
Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." Perhaps you obsessed over
"Night Fever" by the Bee Gees, "Hungry Like the Wolf" by Duran Duran
or 'N Sync's "Bye Bye Bye."</LD>
<LD>   These days, finding that song--without buying many more that you
don't want--is becoming increasingly difficult.</LD>
<TE>   Once the backbone of the business, singles sales totaled  31
million last year, down a whopping 41% from 2000, according to
Soundscan. It's believed to be the lowest sales figure since the late
1940s, when singles were introduced on vinyl.</TE>
<TE>   Singles aren't even made for many of the most popular songs
because music companies think they're unprofitable.</TE>
<TE>   Among Billboard magazine's 40 most popular songs the week of Feb.
23, only five were available as singles on compact disc. Eighteen
were on sale just as vinyl records.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen songs, including Creed's "My Sacrifice," No Doubt's "Hey
Baby," Enrique Iglesias' "Hero" and Alanis Morissette's "Hands
Clean," were only available if you bought a full album.</TE>
<TE>   Record retailers complain that this alienates fans, particularly
young ones, by forcing them to spend more than they want or--worse
yet--retrieve songs online.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're losing a whole generation of record buyers," said
Carl Rosenbaum, chief executive of Top Hits, a Buffalo Grove, Ill.,
company that supplies music to 15,000 stores nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "You either have to steal it off the Internet or you just don't
buy it at all," he said. "The other option is to buy a full CD for
$18. If you're just introducing yourself to an act, you don't want to
do that. It's hard to figure out what their thinking is."</TE>
<TE>   Music executives, in turn, blame retailers for discounting singles
so heavily that it's impossible to profit. "We can't work it out,"
said Val Azzoli, co-chairman of the Atlantic Group of labels. "We're
not an industry that works together."</TE>
<TE>   If the single dies altogether, the beginning of the end can be
traced a decade back to the start of Soundscan, which provided the
first precise measurements of music sales.</TE>
<TE>   Executives who long suspected that singles cut into sales of the
more profitable full-length CDs finally had evidence to back that up,
said Jordan Katz, senior vice president of sales at Arista Records.</TE>
<TE>   There's some debate about the extent to which that's true, though.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Higgins, chief executive of the Albany, N.Y.-based Trans World
Entertainment, which owns 950 music stores, said he believes singles
hurt album sales in only about 15% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelback's "Silver Side Up" album is currently in the top 10,
seemingly unhurt by the CD single for the song "How You Remind Me."
Santana sold boatloads of its most recent album despite a succession
of singles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s there was a brief period when record companies
put singles by singers such as Mariah Carey on sale for a
money-losing 49 cents, artificially boosting sales to secure flashy
chart debuts.</TE>
<TE>   CD singles, which usually have two or three songs, generally
retail for $3 to $4. Many retailers routinely discount them by 50% or
more, Azzoli said. And there are still music companies that encourage
this by secretly giving singles away to retailers to inflate sales,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Arista, Katz is sensitive to concerns on both sides and is
among executives experimenting with ways to make more singles
available, although maybe not in the way many consumers would want.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, singles are made available before an album's
release but pulled from stores when the album comes out. Arista also
makes singles for songs after they have cooled off as hits.</TE>
<TE>   And labels are experimenting with "maxi-singles." They may contain
five or six songs--often remixes of the same song--and are sold for
$7 to $8. Their manufacturing cost is close to that of regular
singles, so profits are higher.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get kids in the habit of buying music," Katz said.
"I'm trying to figure out innovative ways to have singles and albums
coexist."</TE>

<HD>NBC Skates to Victory During Latest Sweeps</HD>
<DH>Television*  The Games give the network an Olympic-sized
ratings boost during February.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventeen days of Winter Olympics coverage left little suspense as to
who would emerge victorious from the February ratings sweeps.</LD>
<LD>   With an estimated 84% of U.S. households viewing NBC at some point
during the Games, the network breezed to victory, with an estimated
24.2 million viewers per average minute of prime time over the
four-week survey, which concluded Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   NBC nearly doubled its average audience from last year's February
sweeps, when it finished second to CBS. The Olympics also inflated
NBC's performance among 18- to 49-year-old viewers, the primary
measure networks use to determine advertising rates.</LD>
<TE>   Fox--which benefited from  broadcasting the Super Bowl, which was
postponed because of the fallout from Sept. 11, during the first week
of the sweeps--placed second, with an average 12.7 million viewers.
Fox was up nearly 20% over last year in total viewers, while CBS and
ABC finished third and fourth, respectively, with both networks
seeing their February sweeps audience decline by double-digit
percentages.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't unexpected, as CBS and ABC sat out the competition on
certain nights, airing reruns instead of wasting original episodes of
popular series against the Olympics. In addition, CBS, which won last
year's February sweeps on the back of its popular show "Survivor,"
waited until the Olympics had concluded to begin airing its latest
installment of the staged, unscripted series. The network averaged
about 10.7 million viewers for the sweeps, down 22% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, meanwhile, continues struggling to regain its identity a year
after the ratings crash of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." The
network finished with an average 8 million viewers, down more than
35% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although CBS missed out on bragging rights, network officials
pointed to gains for the UPN network, whose management was
consolidated into CBS earlier this year by Viacom, the parent company
for both.</TE>
<TE>   Despite competition from the Olympics, UPN was up more than 20%
compared with last year, averaging 4.5 million viewers--its best
February sweeps performance in five years, with "WWF Smackdown!"
being joined this season by "Enterprise," the latest addition to the
"Star Trek" franchise, and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."</TE>
<TE>   "UPN has a much younger audience, which made it more protected
against the Olympics than CBS was," said David Poltrack, executive
vice president of planning and research for CBS Television.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, ratings for the WB were down a modest 6%, to 3.7
million viewers. Fox, UPN and the WB generally appeal
disproportionately well to teens and adults age 18 to 34 relative to
the better-established networks, the demographics traditionally less
likely to tune in the Olympics. (The WB is partly owned by Tribune
Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>

<HD>Lewinsky Tells More, but Show Isn't All to Her Liking</HD>
<DH>Television*  Hoping to clear her name, the ex-intern agreed
to answer questions for an HBO documentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monica Lewinsky, the world's most infamous intern, approached HBO
last year with what she thought would be an enticing offer: a
tell-all special that would begin the process of clearing her name
once the restrictions on her immunity deal with former independent
counsel Kenneth Starr expired Jan.22.</LD>
<LD>   At first, the cable network's executive vice president of original
programming, Sheila Nevins, thought the country had already heard
more than it wanted. There had been, after all, the news coverage,
the detailed Starr report, a 1998 Vanity Fair photo spread and the
widely seen Barbara Walters interview on ABC, in which Lewinsky
described, among other things, her experience with phone sex.</LD>
<LD>   But Lewinsky, 27, insisted there was more, and the pitch
ultimately persuaded Nevins to order "Monica in Black and White," a
100-minute mix of archival footage, soul-baring admissions, even an
imitation by Lewinsky of Clinton inviting her into a back room. The
project launches a new season of the cable network's acclaimed
documentary series "America Undercover" this Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   HBO will not disclose the budget of the documentary or how much
was paid to Lewinsky, who had no control over the final product. A
representative for Lewinsky said she was pleased with the documentary
but would have liked to see more time devoted to the ways in which
her privacy was invaded.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally, she had wanted to focus on the legal aspects of this
runaway investigation," said Fenton Bailey, who produced and directed
the documentary along with Randy Barbato. "But what was interesting
was that these law students [shown questioning her] wanted to know
about her relationships and dynamics with the president, not in a
prurient way."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey recalled Lewinsky being "very upset" when she saw the final
product. "When I asked her about it, she said one of the things [that
bothered her] was listening to Linda Tripp's betrayal--listening to
yourself on tape, having what you think is a private conversation,
exposing yourself completely, and then having it played to law
enforcement and over the Internet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, it's still hard for her. I think one of the reasons she
wanted to participate in this film was to reclaim her name.... It's
an open question as to whether or not people are willing to give her
the second chance she thinks she deserves."</TE>
<TE>   In the program, Lewinsky sits onstage at Cooper Union University's
auditorium, wearing a black pantsuit with an ivory-colored blouse and
her hair combed straight. It was a look the crew maintained over
three days in January during which she sat for a total of 10 hours of
questioning from an auditorium filled with HBO staff, professors and
students of American history, law, psychology and women's studies.</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky answered every question asked of her during production.
She also agreed to appear at an HBO news conference in January to
promote "Monica in Black and White" but, after tearing up under
questioning from reporters at that event, declined to be interviewed
for this story.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Lewinsky said that the documentary is "not
perfect, but it's an honest, objective account," adding that his
client would have preferred more time be dedicated to issues that
were "very profound to her."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Lewinsky was disappointed that in each of the five
taping sessions over three days, an audience member asked the same
question: "Have you apologized to Hillary [Clinton]?"</TE>
<TE>   "It betrayed a principal perception that Monica was the principal
wrongdoer, rather than the married man," Bailey said.</TE>

<HD>Kenner's Chopin Skilled but Can Be Hollow at the Core</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Kenner delivered a sometimes impressive and sometimes
disengaged display of Chopin playing Wednesday night at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. His recital concluded a three-week
piano festival, part of  the Rosalinde Gilbert music series in Leo S.
Bing Theater.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the concerts was assigned to an acknowledged specialist in
a particular composer. Kenner, who won the International Chopin Piano
Competition in Warsaw in 1990, followed players of Bach and
Beethoven. Wednesday's program touched on important peaks of Chopin's
output, though Kenner, 39, only intermittently delivered the
emotional core of this familiar music. When he did, however, his
success was real. And a large audience vociferously appreciated his
accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   Closing the first half of the program, the breadth of feeling and
aura of bravura in Chopin's two-part Opus 22, the Andante Spianato
and Grande Polonaise, emerged handsomely formed, Kenner's technical
resourcefulness and dynamic variety serving the piece well.</LD>
<TE>   The pianist also probed the depths of the slow movement of the
B-minor Sonata with great authority. Indeed, he laid out the entire
sonata stylishly and lucidly. The opening movement achieved a genuine
nobility of statement.</TE>
<TE>   One came away much less convinced in his shallow readings of the
Barcarolle, the F-major Ballade plus an A-flat waltz and the Nocturne
in D-flat. These were perfunctory, without strong characterization.
Kenner has yet to find a way to make these works his own.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Kenner plays a different Chopin program March 15, 8 p.m.,
Marsee Auditorium, El Camino College Center for the Arts, 16007
Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. $19-$22. (310) 329-5345.</TE>

<HD>'All Things Considered's' Noah Adams Takes Flight</HD>
<DH>The program's longtime co-host strays from radio for a
Wright brothers book.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Noah Adams had worked for nearly two decades as co-host of "All
Things Considered," it took two men and plane to carry him away from
National Public Radio. Yet the flight lasted only 12 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Adams is leaving for a year to write a book about the Wright
brothers, to be published in time for the 100th anniversary of their
short but groundbreaking flight on Dec. 17, 1903. He announced that
today will be his last on the NPR newsmagazine, and when he returns
after his sabbatical, it won't be as co-host of "All Things
Considered."</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed to be actually unfair to ask NPR for that. I thought,
'I'll just come back and be a reporter,'" he said, and let the
network solidify a new lineup for the show.</LD>
<TE>   The program's lineup had been rock-solid for 13 years, with
listeners comfortable hearing Adams, Robert Siegel and Linda
Wertheimer every weekday afternoon. But that stability was shaken
when NPR officials made Wertheimer a roving reporter in January,
saying they wanted to strengthen all of their shows with her pieces
from the road rather than confine her to the anchor desk of one
program. Now, two-thirds of the hosts have gone in two months.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unfortunate timing. With Linda leaving, it would have been
better if I could have stayed around for a year," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Drake, NPR's vice president for news, said he tried to
persuade him to stay but realized Adams faced a deadline driven by
the flight's anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "All things go through changes. 'All Things Considered' has been
remarkably stable for an awful long time," Drake said, adding that
the network encourages its people, when it can spare them, to take
time off to work on books because it rejuvenates them.</TE>
<TE>   Adams has written four books, including his most recent, "Far
Appalachia," a travelogue of the New River Valley that serves as a
microcosm of Appalachia. In an interview after that was published
last year, Adams said he had no immediate plans for another book,
saying he would "not worry about it and wait until a book demands to
be written."</TE>
<TE>   That compulsion came on a recent vacation to the Outer Banks of
North Carolina, where Adams stood on the dunes, felt the wind and saw
the stretch where Orville Wright took that first 12-second flight
nearly a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought, 'These are my guys.' I know these guys. They're
grinning and calling me," Adams said. "The farther I got into it, the
more I'm justified by the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said "The Flyers" will be a short, lively book that will
take him to Ohio, North Carolina and France.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go where they were and see it from their eyes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As devoted as many "All Things Considered" fans are, Adams said,
he doesn't think they'll be upset about the changes to the show. In
fact, he said, the e-mails he's received since he announced Monday
that he was leaving have been encouraging. "I always thought you were
a good reporter," said one, while another offered the use of some
French aviation magazines from the Wright era for research.</TE>
<TE>   NPR officials say they have no regrets about moving Wertheimer at
the same time they're losing Adams.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Linda is doing terrific work, and we're excited about the
pieces she's doing. It's an exciting opportunity for us to introduce
some new voices on 'All Things Considered,'" said Ken Stern,
executive vice president of NPR.</TE>
<TE>   Drake added that they hope to have one or both new hosts in place
by June, after an aggressive search inside and outside the
organization. Meanwhile, NPR hosts and correspondents Jacki Lyden,
Susan Stamberg, Liane Hansen, John Ydstie and Lynn Neary will join
Siegel and fill in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never good, undergoing this much change in such a short
window. But I'm not worried people will find it so jarring they would
leave and not come back," Drake said. "I'm pretty optimistic we're
going to uncover some pretty terrific people in the search."</TE>
<TE>   Siegel said he's disappointed about losing two-thirds of a trio
that trusted and complemented one other, but hopes that the new,
permanent hosts are hired soon so they can start working to create
their own chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've been part of a very strong team, and I feel like
the team is breaking up," said Siegel, who added that he's not
planning to go anywhere. He's slated to be on the show at least 18
more months and intends to stay beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   Although some critics contend that 13 years may be too long and
that a program risks getting stale with the same lineup, Adams noted
that the audience for "All Things Considered" has grown steadily
throughout its history.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 10 million listeners a week hear it on more than 500
stations, including KPCC-FM (89.3) and KCRW-FM (89.9) locally. It
remains one of the five most-listened-to programs on radio.</TE>
<TE>   Adams said he'll miss the camaraderie of the program, though, and
that he's glad he, Siegel and Wertheimer were able to work together
the week of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Another aspect of the show Adams regrets leaving are the
one-on-one interviews, which often turn into "a conversation that's
so quiet and so slow," he finds it jarring when someone walks into
the studio and breaks the intimacy of the moment, he said. "That kind
of conversation cannot be accomplished on anything but radio."</TE>
<TE>   It was hearing "All Things Considered" that got Adams involved in
public radio to begin with. He had worked as a deejay in the early
'60s, in and around his Kentucky hometown. But he was working in
construction in 1971 when a colleague invited him to listen to a
program that had recently debuted.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard the show, Adams remembers thinking, "That sounds
conversational, that they intend for me to be listening, that I'm
smart enough to be listening." It inspired him to start working at
the University of Kentucky's public radio station, and he moved to
NPR in 1975, working first as a writer and editor, then becoming host
of "Weekend All Things Considered" in 1978. Four years later, he
moved to the weekday show.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, Adams' co-host since 1987, said his colleague is one of
the network's most vivid writers, bringing a grab bag of interests
and experiences to the table.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a writer's eye, and I think you hear that when he's on the
air," Siegel said. "And he takes sound very seriously. When you
combine writing with sound, you can create extraordinary radio."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "All Things Considered" is heard locally weekdays on KPCC-FM
(89.3) from 3 to 6:30 p.m., and on KCRW-FM (89.9) from 4 to 6:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>'Chop Suey' Serves Up Some Eclectic Joys</HD>
<DH>Photographer Bruce Weber's appreciation of the young male
physique is well-represented, but there are a few surprises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Chop Suey" is an apt and delightful title for this artfully
assembled visual memoir from photographer Bruce Weber, whose
commentary is heard on the soundtrack.</LD>
<LD>   It is the most personal and accomplished of the several
documentaries Weber has made over the years, and, like the dish for
which it is named, it contains many ingredients. Weber is famous for
his celebration of youthful male beauty, and although "Chop Suey"
abounds in it, the film also reveals the photographer's interests and
acquaintances to be far-ranging.</LD>
<LD>   Weber's key model is Peter Johnson, an impossibly handsome and
muscular young Midwestern wrestling champion. As he has with
countless others before him, Weber films and photographs the
unpretentious Johnson in a wide variety of settings, sometimes with a
group of equally spectacular young males and sometimes alone,
occasionally nude. As sexy as Weber's models are, Weber tends to
treat them as part of a celebration of nature, emphasizing a natural
sensuality rather than a contrived eroticism.</LD>
<TE>   If Johnson is Weber's latest incarnation of male physical
perfection, the late cabaret singer-pianist Frances Faye is an
enduring passion in Weber's life. A singer's singer, Faye was a
sophisticated staple of nightclubs and the concert stage for decades
with her dynamic stylings of classics. Although her film appearances
were few--she played a bordello madam in Louis Malle's "Pretty Baby"
(1977)--Faye made numerous appearances on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Weber threads this archival footage throughout his film along with
the reminiscences of Teri Shepard, her personal manager and longtime
lover. The elegant Shepard sets a relaxed, low-key tone of openness,
camaraderie and enjoyment of life, values that Weber celebrates
throughout his work.</TE>
<TE>   Along with celebrating Johnson, Faye and Shepard, Weber pays
homage to his idol and subsequent mentor, the late fashion arbiter
Diana Vreeland, whom he filmed in her famous bright red, highly
ornamented New York living room in 1989.  Vreeland speaks with her
usual enthusiasm of surfing and skateboarding, two activities she
admits to having missed out on.</TE>
<TE>   In a linking typical of the film, her remarks are echoed in
Weber's section on the handsome skateboarders; Weber similarly
introduces us to the even more stunning family of Brazilian jujitsu
champion Rickson Gracie.</TE>
<TE>   Weber recalls with affection his working with Jan-Michael Vincent,
who is represented by the groundbreaking nude scene from "Buster and
Billie" (1974) and of his and Vincent's shared awe of Robert Mitchum,
who was photographed by Weber in 1974 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Weber reveals a wide and knowledgeable appreciation of his fellow
photographers, with special emphasis on Sir Wilfred Thesiger, an
adventurer and explorer who made a stunning series of photographs of
Bedouin horsemen. Tracking down the elderly Thesiger in Britain,
Weber felicitously describes the striking Sir Wilfred as possessing
"a Giacometti nose." (And yes, Sir Wilfred is related to the
ineffable Ernest Thesiger, the mad scientist of "Bride of
Frankenstein.")</TE>
<TE>   As the film unfolds, we learn that Weber made his way from the
farm town of Greensburg, Pa., to New York, but he tends to let us
know him through his passions rather than in a biographical outline,
which is ultimately far more revealing. Of the many remarks Weber
makes in the course of his beautifully fashioned film, none may be
more significant than his observation, "We photograph things we can
never be."</TE>

<HD>High-Voltage Vets  at the Jazz Bakery</HD>
<DH>David 'Fathead' Newman and John Hicks' trio prove to be
electric in an acoustic sort of way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An interesting thing happened at the Jazz Bakery on Tuesday night.
Saxophonist David "Fathead" Newman and pianist John Hicks' trio got
together to offer an evening of straight-ahead jazz.</LD>
<LD>   That may not seem especially unusual at the Bakery, which is,
after all, one of the city's major jazz venues. But the fact is that
it's become increasingly rare to hear bands in which the piano player
doesn't double on synthesizer keyboards, the drums are not surrounded
by microphones, and the bass player never lays down his acoustic
instrument to pick up an electric bass. Except for some modest
amplification of Hicks' piano and Jeff Littleton's bass, that's
what's taking place at the Bakery this week: an acoustic jazz set.</LD>
<LD>   Both Newman and Hicks have been solid, dependable jazz performers
for decades. Newman's career was kick-started by a 10-year stint with
Ray Charles in the '50s and '60s; he has backed Aretha Franklin and
Natalie Cole (on "Unforgettable") and performed with dozens of the
major names in jazz.</LD>
<TE>   Hicks has been a first call player since the '60s, his versatility
taking him through stints with the Jazz Messengers and Betty Carter;
his diversified resume includes work with stylists ranging from
Pharoah Sanders to Joshua Redman.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of firepower to put on the same stage, and the
combination produced some high-voltage musical results. Newman played
tenor and alto saxophones as well as flute in a program that ranged
from attractive originals to standards (including an unusual version
of "Willow Weep for Me" in 3/4). Deeply rooted in bebop, his
well-crafted solos, arching imaginatively through chromatic
harmonies, were enhanced by his warmly communicative sound.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks is a bopper as well, his playing filled with animated
passion, arms moving up and down as he worked the keyboard to produce
bright flashes of melody and harmony. And his interaction with
Newman, with fragments of melody tossed back and forth, was
marvelous--two veterans swapping imaginative musical ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Littleton and drummer Fritz Wise were solid and
supportive, diligent participants in an evening of low-decibel,
high-creativity music-making.</TE>
<TE>   David "Fathead" Newman with the John Hicks Trio at the Jazz
Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver City. Tonight through Sunday at 8 and
9:30 p.m., $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>NPR Reassessing Jazz, Classical Music Programs</HD>
<DH>Radio* An internal report questions their worth. Network's
programming chief says a revamp may improve cultural coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL FARHI</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Public Radio has begun an extensive review of its musical
programming, and is considering overhauling or eliminating some of
its venerable jazz and classical offerings.</LD>
<LD>   A strategy paper written by NPR's top programming executive says
some of the network's live performance and recorded music shows "may
disappear," although officials stress that nothing is final.</LD>
<LD>   The paper by Jay Kernis, NPR's senior vice president of
programming, is generally critical of the opera, jazz and classical
programs that the Washington-based organization produces and
distributes to its 680 affiliated stations. Commercial broadcasters
in many cities have abandoned these formats because of low ratings,
leaving public stations as the only outlets offering them.</LD>
<TE>   "Many [public] stations, including major markets, use NPR cultural
programming to fill holes in their program schedules, not as featured
shows," Kernis wrote in a paper distributed internally last month.
"Within NPR, this has created some dissatisfaction with cultural
programming and raised questions about the division's value to
[NPR-affiliated] stations."</TE>
<TE>   Kernis, in the paper and an interview, didn't identify the
programs NPR is considering dropping, saying such decisions are at
least six months away.</TE>
<TE>   But his report said station managers, in a survey, ascribed "the
lowest value" to NPR's national jazz programs, such as "Billy
Taylor's Jazz at the Kennedy Center" and "Jazz From Lincoln Center."
They assigned the highest value to NPR's newsmagazines ("All Things
Considered," "Morning Edition," etc.) and general entertainment shows
("A Prairie Home Companion" and "Car Talk").</TE>
<TE>   These preferences mirror trends in commercial radio. Public
stations have gradually moved toward news and talk formats because
they draw higher ratings, and thus bigger donations during pledge
drives.</TE>
<TE>   Kernis' report, which was obtained by the Washington Post, has
fueled concerns among NPR's 40-person cultural staff that the
organization is moving away from one of its basic programming
missions.</TE>
<TE>   "The talk here is that at the end of this [review] we'll end up
abrogating NPR's mandate to serve stations and listeners that aren't
being served by commercial radio," said one programming employee who
requested anonymity. "This is going to result in huge changes."</TE>
<TE>   But Kernis and Ken Stern, NPR's executive vice president, said in
interviews that a reorganization could result in more cultural
programming, not less.</TE>
<TE>   NPR is considering offering an all-day "stream" of classical
music, comprising recorded and live performances, plus interviews and
features, they said. Stations would broadcast any part of this stream
they desired.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to improve NPR's news coverage of cultural events
and artists, which Kernis' report said "too often takes a 'this is
good for you' approach, rather than 'this is really interesting' to
listeners."</TE>
<TE>   The paper suggests NPR's news staff examine popular culture more
closely: "We cannot sell out to popular culture," the report says,
"but we must recognize that something has become popular and embraced
by millions."</TE>
<TE>   Both men said the programming review was prompted by a desire to
produce high-quality programs within NPR's traditionally limited
budgets, not by financial and ratings pressures alone. "This is about
service to our stations," Kernis said this week.</TE>
<TE>   But in his report, Kernis stressed his desire to make NPR's
programs more popular, which would help local stations attract more
pledge dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "NPR will develop streams of  radio services that concentrate on
fewer, more valuable programs  designed to deliver audience and
warrant placement at prime times in the larger markets," the
programming executive wrote, adding that "NPR's music programming has
generally not been successful in terms of audience and financial
performance."</TE>

<HD>A Fierce, Life-Affirming Dance With Death</HD>
<DH>The stage version of 'Trainspotting' is an in-your-face
tale about heroin junkies that's as jolting as the movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would it be bad taste to call the stage adaptation of Irvine Welsh's
"Trainspotting"--first a novel, then a movie about dropout heroin
junkies in Edinburgh, Scotland--a shot in the arm? Sure--but no more
so than anything else about the fierce, bold, harrowing production
currently on stage at Hollywood's Theatre/Theater. If you prefer your
theater with expletives deleted and fully clothed, this is no place
to be.</LD>
<LD>   For those who recall graphic scenes from the equally jolting 1996
movie, the first thing that pops to mind before seeing the stage
version is: They can't really do that on stage, can they?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they can. Yeah, they do. The opening scene will make you
squirm in your chair, and you'll probably keep squirming until the
end.</LD>
<TE>   If anything, the stage version, a L.A. premiere directed by Roger
Mathey for seat of your pants Productions, is even more in-your-face
because, in this small theater on the fourth floor of a commercial
building on Hollywood Boulevard, it really is in your face. The dirt,
stench and body fluids that always seem to end up in inappropriate
locations are so close that there's a feeling the stuff is going to
get all over you. It's a spare, black comedy played out against a
spare, black set, with one door that opens to different locations,
most often to a toilet.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, the magic of special effects often takes the viewer
on a high along with the character who has just put a needle in his
arm. The stage version is less hallucinogenic, more real--less
effective at conjuring up the lure of addiction but more deft in
showing the damage done.</TE>
<TE>   Your guide through this world is Mark Renton, played by Ewan
McGregor in the movie and here by the engaging Justin Zachary, who
narrates the tale with a humorous but heartbreaking combination of
amorality and innocence. Zachary, as well as the rest of this brave
cast, provides a fragile humanity that renders this dance with death
ultimately life-affirming.</TE>
<TE>   The Scottish dialect, thick as oatmeal, is just as indecipherable
here as in the movie, but the program contains a "Trainspotting
Glossary" of idiomatic terms. After reading it, you'll be prepared to
offend everyone in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "Trainspotting," Theatre/Theater, 6425 Hollywood Blvd.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 6 p.m. Through March 30.
$15 (Sunday matinees, pay what you can). Reservations, (661)

<HD>A Little Bit Country and a Lot of Buzz</HD>
<DH>Norah Jones' first album just came out, but already its
songs are winning acclaim and its making has generated controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norah Jones leaned back in her chair, looked out the hotel window
toward the Hollywood hills, and yawned. If she was experiencing any
apprehension about how her first album, "Come Away With Me," is going
to be received, it wasn't showing. Mostly, she said, she was just
happy to have a few minutes to kick back and relax.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, she spent a full day at her first video shoot,
following a four-day run in San Francisco opening for Willie Nelson,
which followed a seemingly endless list of media interviews and photo
shoots related to Tuesday's release of her album. On Wednesday night,
she appeared on the "Tonight Show With Jay Leno," and she can be seen
tonight on "The Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn."</LD>
<LD>   Why all the attention for a virtually unknown artist? It's in part
because of buzz generated by reviews in the Boston Globe and the
Washington Post, selection as one of the "Brand New Heavies" in
Entertainment Weekly and inclusion in Rolling Stone's "The Next Wave:
10 Artists to Watch."</LD>
<TE>   Asked about the explosion of attention, Jones shook her head and
smiled. "It's a little strange," she said. "And a lot more work than
I thought it would be. Which is fine; I'm up for work. But it's
definitely not a side of music I ever thought I would have to deal
with. And I definitely don't want it to overshadow what I really love
to do or have it get to the point where music is secondary."</TE>
<TE>   That may take some doing, since Jones, 22, is an eminently
marketable talent. Her voice, tinged with the vulnerability heard in
the work of Eva Cassidy, is capable of expressiveness in almost any
musical idiom. And with her slender figure, luminous eyes and mane of
raven hair, Jones is the sort of subject that the camera loves.</TE>
<TE>   But neither talent nor looks can mask a certain amount of
controversy around Jones' first album, which was worked on by two of
the record world's most adept producers: Craig Street, who helped
vitalize the career of Cassandra Wilson, and Arif Mardin, responsible
for classic albums by singers ranging from Aretha Franklin to Dusty
Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   Street did the first version, recording, he says, as many as 22
selections. Jones recalled working with Street as "really fun" but
added a proviso.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't quite work," she added, "and it wasn't really
Craig's fault. We kept three of the songs we did with him, but the
rest of the tracks basically took me too far away from ... the sound
I was looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Street recalls the situation a bit differently. "Basically what
happened," he said, "is that Norah came to me and wanted to make a
record. She was very clear about who she wanted to work with; she had
some cool material and a fantastic voice. When we finished, everybody
seemed to be happy. She was happy, I was happy and that was that. But
I guess the label wasn't so happy."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently not, because Blue Note decided to bring in Mardin, who
had just made a production deal with the label. Reluctant to make any
comments about the work of a professional colleague, Mardin simply
noted, "After Craig did the whole album, the powers that be--the
record company and Norah-- were unhappy with some of the results. So
they kept three of Craig's tracks, although they were changed a bit.
And we redid the other tunes."</TE>
<TE>   Decisions to redo albums are hardly uncommon in the record
business, but the determination by a small record label to do so with
a first album by a young artist underscores Blue Note's belief in
Jones as a potential breakout act. It may also reflect the label's
having an album that doesn't quite fit its jazz offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of Jones' training is in jazz--she graduated from
Dallas' Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing Arts,
where she won Down Beat magazine Student Music Awards for singing and
composing, and attended North Texas State University--her album is an
eclectic mix of country (including Hank Williams' "Cold Cold Heart")
and pop. Perhaps to establish her jazz credentials, Jones has added a
final track in which she sings, to her own piano accompaniment, "The
Nearness of You."</TE>
<TE>   Jones admits worrying that this album's presence on Blue Note
might confuse some potential listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "I primarily did jazz for about six years," she said, "and it was
what I wanted to do when I was brought to Blue Note. But I was
getting into other things with my friends who are songwriters. When
we made some demos, they kind of came out like the record--in that
kind of style.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Note was reluctant, at first, because it wasn't really jazz,
but they finally came around, which was great. Because, at this
point, this is exactly the record I wanted to make --style-wise,
genre-wise."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Note executive Bruce Lundvall indicated that Jones' album is
a welcome challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "If jazz is going to grow, we have to be open to new approaches,"
Lundvall said. "I know Norah's recording is not exactly a jazz album,
but it is jazz-informed. I suppose the best thing is to say she's
beyond category. And we're trying to break down the old-school
thought that jazz singers can only do standard repertoire."</TE>
<TE>   Despite her relative inexperience, Jones is quickly becoming aware
of the complex currents beginning to surround her career, and she's
moving to keep them under control. Although it's unclear precisely
where the motivation to have Mardin rework the album came from, Jones
obviously agreed with the decision. It is one of many she has had to
learn how to make.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening to me is something that lots of people dream
about," she said, "and I feel very lucky that it's happening. But I
also don't want to be overexposed. It would be easy to just say to a
publicist, 'OK, I'll do what ever you give to me.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I've discovered that if I do interviews before I do a show,
it just sucks my energy dry. And then the music suffers, and I'm
right back to having to set my priorities and keep my boundaries. So
when they ask me to do something that doesn't feel right to me, I
just say, 'No way.'"</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the fast-moving youthful accomplishments mentioned in
Jones' media biography, one important bit of information is missing:
the fact that she is the offspring of a liaison between her mother
and the legendary Indian sitarist, Ravi Shankar.</TE>
<TE>   Jones did not hesitate to provide the information when she was
asked about the absence of any paternal reference in the bio.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a secret," she said. "But we really didn't have much of
a relationship at all until about four years ago. And I just don't
want that to be the focus. I don't want people to have that be the
first thing they know about me.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I'm rejecting my father. I love my Dad. But I
didn't grow up with him, and my music has nothing to do with him. We
have a relationship, we've seen each other now and then over the past
four years and it's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps so, but it's hard not to wonder how Jones feels when she
sees the close personal artistic attention offered to her half
sister, Anoushka (with whom she reportedly has a close relationship),
by her father. And it's not exactly rocket psychotherapy to speculate
that the inner toughness that drives her quest for creative
accomplishment might be energized by an urgent desire to prove she
can do it on her own.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones, reverting to a laugh, wasn't interested in any more
speculation about "all that personal stuff that's hairy and emotional
that nobody wants to hear about."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has a strikingly mature attitude to all aspects of her
budding career, including the potential tumble that could await an
unsuccessful album after all the media build-up. But she shrugged and
smiled a smile that managed to be both innocent and guileful.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I'm young," concluded Jones, "and it's OK if this one's not
a big hit, because I'm happy with it. It's already exceeded my
expectations in the response it's gotten from friends and from some
of the press, and that means that the people who are most important
to me liked it. Right now, that's enough."</TE>

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There is more to life than movie stardom, and there is more to a
comeback than applause.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1980s, Kelly McGillis was every inch a star. Three
pictures--"Witness" (1985) with Harrison Ford, "Top Gun" (1986) with
Tom Cruise and "The Accused" (1988) with Jodie Foster--attest to
that. Her subsequent films failed to achieve such status. There was
"The Babe" (1992), in which she played Babe Ruth's second wife. There
were some splendid little films--"Winter People" (1989), "Grand Isle"
(1991)--that attracted praise but little attention.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, she has starred in one small gem, "Painted
Angels" (1998), a wrenching tale about prostitution in the Old West,
but mostly she has worked on television and on the stage in New York
and Washington. McGillis, 44, appeared a few weeks ago on the stage
of the Shakespeare Theatre here in the title role of the Jacobean
tragedy "The Duchess of Malfi," a play that runs a full arc of
emotions and has a body count even higher than "Hamlet's."</LD>
<TE>   "Robust . . . noble, sensual," the Washington Post's Nelson
Pressley wrote of her performance. "McGillis goes to pieces very
well, with pride and pain mingling in her husky cries.... This
'Duchess' is powered by flesh." But where has she been? Before
"Duchess," she hadn't worked in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Pennsylvania," she said, seated in a favorite bookstore coffee
lounge on a recent morning. "I have a little house there, and I'm
getting settled so that my children can come up and live with me and
go to school. They're with their father while I do this job."
McGillis has two daughters: Kelsey, 12, and Sonora, 9. She married
her husband, Fred Tillman, in January 1989. A lifelong sailor, she
met him at a California yacht dealership where she had gone to buy a
boat.</TE>
<TE>   Her new little house is near Reading. "Circumstances just brought
me there," she said. "I decided that fate brought me to Pennsylvania
for a reason, so I should consider living there." What circumstances?
"That's personal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband are separated, and she's seeking a divorce.
Her physician father, with whom she used to sail as a child on the
Pacific Ocean, died last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I had life pressures," she said. "My marriage was falling apart.
I came into a period of introspection. I'm really grateful I didn't
have those distractions. It's so hard when you get caught up in the
whole whirlwind of work and that chaos."</TE>
<TE>   However, she is grateful for this play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having a blast doing this play," McGillis said. "It would
never have crossed my mind that I would be having a ball doing a
Jacobean tragedy. But I go to work every night and it's so joyful to
go. I have so much fun. It's so very free. It is dark in certain
parts. I don't know how to explain it. It's probably weird to hear,
but it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   There's a movie in the works for this summer, but she doesn't
think about that.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm really trying to focus on is the here and now," she said.
"My life has been in such turmoil and such chaos for so many reasons.
All I'm trying to do is simplify it and not worry about the future.
The future will take care of itself. It will be what it is."</TE>
<TE>   McGillis has been reading philosophy. She said she has found a
spirituality that transcends organized religions. There is a large
tattoo on her back in Chinese characters. As discreetly as one can at
a window table in a bookstore coffee lounge, she shows it. Roughly
translated, it means journey to peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I am on a spiritual journey," she said. "That's what works for
me.... I don't think true spirituality can be defined."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting there," she said. "It's quite a journey. When I'm
there, I'll be in the ground six feet under. I'll be a tree. I'll be
a tree next. Who knows what kind. It's not for me to decide."</TE>

<HD>An Enigma Above the Fray</HD>
<DH>Movies* LACMA's festival 'Garbo Rules!' celebrates the
films of the actress who conquered Hollywood but always held it in
disdain.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greta Garbo was one of the most complex movie stars embraced by
Hollywood--a town she loathed. In many ways she was ahead of her
time, a thoroughly modern woman who refused to buy into the Hollywood
star system. During her 16 years at MGM, Garbo looked upon the studio
and the industry with disdain. After her last film failed, she left
Hollywood and never looked back.</LD>
<LD>   Although she made her last film, "Two-Faced Woman," 61 years ago,
Garbo's legacy has endured. Her indelible performances in "Anna
Christie," "Flesh and the Devil," "Anna Karenina," "Camille" and
"Ninotchka" are as vibrant today as they were seven decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art film department
begins a four-week festival, "Garbo Rules!," which kicks off with one
of her greatest films, 1933's "Queen Christina" and the campy but
entertaining 1931 melodrama "Mata Hari."</LD>
<TE>   Jan-Chris Horak, a UCLA film professor and curator of the
Hollywood Entertainment Museum, said Garbo was most popular from 1925
to 1935. "I think after that she turned into this mythical creature,"
Horak said. "She has always been known as this aloof person who stood
above the Hollywood fray. All of that contributed to the mythology
around Greta Garbo."</TE>
<TE>   Although she lived until 1990 in New York, where she was often
spotted on her daily walks on the Upper East Side, movie audiences
never saw her grow old on screen. "I think we are dealing here with
the Marilyn [Monroe] factor," Horak says. "It is as if she died
young."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Jewell, associate dean of USC's School of Cinema-Television,
says the Swedish-born actress was the "ultimate contrarian": She
refused to do what the studio wanted her to do in "terms of their
whole machinery of publicizing stars."</TE>
<TE>   Garbo's refusal to play the game, Jewell says, was probably the
smartest thing she could have done "because it made her special. It
made her different from all the other stars and positioned her as
this woman of mystery."</TE>
<TE>   From Store in Sweden to Hollywood Stardom</TE>
<TE>   Garbo was born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson on Sept. 18, 1905, in
Stockholm. Her parents were from peasant stock that had recently
moved to the big city. The young Greta was discovered working at a
department store and was cast in a publicity film in 1921 called "How
Not to Dress."</TE>
<TE>   Tall, lanky and possessing one of the screen's greatest faces,
Garbo started appearing in silent features directed by the great
Mauritz Stiller. When Stiller went to work for MGM in Hollywood, so
did Garbo. She made her first film, "The Torrent," in 1926. That
year, Garbo also made the erotic melodrama "Flesh and the Devil"--the
first of four films she made with John Gilbert, who became her lover.</TE>
<TE>   Their realistic lovemaking and passionate performances put Garbo
on the map. Although many foreign film stars of the silent era found
their careers sputter in America when sound arrived, Garbo had no
problem making the transition. Her first talkie was 1930's "Anna
Christie," in which she uttered the famous line in her smoky,
accented voice: "Gimme a whiskey with a ginger ale on the side. And
don't be stingy baby."</TE>
<TE>   Although she made 16 films for MGM, the studio kept trying to
reinvent her image over the years. "At first they felt she was going
to be this kind of reigning sex goddess, the femme fatale figured
they developed with her in her silent films," Jewell says. "But then
at some point they kind of lost the compass as far as what she could
do for them. Probably the film where it happened [was the historical
drama] 'Conquest' [1937]. That was her first huge failure as a movie
star. Once they started scrambling to reinvent her with 'Ninotchka'
and 'Two-Faced Woman,' I think she just felt, 'I am not going to go
through this.'"</TE>
<TE>   Another problem after 1935 was that she was more popular
internationally, especially in Europe, than in America. When war
clouds began looming over Europe, the market closed to U.S. movies.
"She was never that big of a star in the heartland," Horak says.</TE>
<TE>   Garbo was not wiling to compromise and move to another studio or
do an independent production for less money, Horak says. "That is
another interesting thing about her allure. She made it very clear
from [the time] she stepped on American soil that she did not want
Hollywood. She was doing them a favor, so she was perfectly happy not
to make any movies after that."</TE>
<TE>   She Projected an Image of Independence</TE>
<TE>   Horak hopes that younger audiences who rediscover Garbo through
the festival will realize what a strong woman she was "given the
Hollywood mores of the time. She often had to play these fallen women
or women who were not quite acceptable in polite society, but at the
same time she always projected this image of being totally
independent."</TE>
<TE>   "For feminists of the 1970s looking for role models, when her
films were shown in retrospectives, people would zero in on what a
strong figure she was," Horak adds. "They were always love stories
[she appeared in] but somehow she never needed a man. A film like
'Queen Christina' especially is very clear in that regard. The men
are fashion accessories, so to speak, and all the kind of erotic
tension is focused on her."</TE>
<TE>   Jewell's favorite Garbo film is "Queen Christina," directed by
Rouben Mamoulian. "It is a story she very much wanted to do," he
says. "From everything you read, she kind of forced MGM to make it.
It's about a Swedish queen--a woman who is incredibly strong-willed
and defiant just as she was.... She brought back her lover [Gilbert]
and tried to revive his career. She basically got Laurence Olivier
kicked off the picture and put John Gilbert in his place."</TE>
<TE>   The final shot--a close-up of her expressionless face as she sails
off to meet her destiny--is one of the more memorable scenes in
cinema. Rumor has it that someone once asked Garbo what she was
thinking about during the filming of the finale. Hollywood lore has
it that she simply replied: "Lunch."</TE>

<HD>'Insurrection' Takes Provocative Look at Slavery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spirits are restless. The ghosts of slaves, they have been
conjured up by a 189-year-old man who has defied death in his long
wait for someone who will listen. Finally that person has arrived--a
great-great-grandson ready to hear his story ... ready to hear
history.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the fanciful nature of Robert O'Hara's powerful,
provocative "Insurrection: Holding History," receiving its Los
Angeles premiere after developmental presentations at Mark Taper
Forum New Work Festivals in the mid-'90s and after earning acclaim in
New York and San Francisco. The Celebration Theatre production is
being presented at the McCadden Place Theatre in Hollywood while the
Celebration's hit production of "Pinafore" continues in its home.</LD>
<LD>   Much like George C. Wolfe's "The Colored Museum," "Insurrection"
stares deep into the darkness of slavery and prejudice--and dares to
laugh.</LD>
<TE>   As time fragments around the old man and his great-great-grandson,
they find themselves on an 1830s slave plantation, where the weighing
of cotton is turned into a game show. If a slave's harvest is of an
acceptable weight, a bell rings; if unacceptable, a buzzer sounds.
Losers receive a whipping. In the present day, a white character
offhandedly spouts epithets, only to find himself ambushed by
hatchet-wielding revolutionaries from Nat Turner's 1831 slave
rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   This time-bending adventure begins when Great-Great-Grandpa (Wil
Bowers) insists that his descendant, Ron (Jeramie Gladman), take him
for a ride. Ron, a graduate student at Columbia University, protests
that he needs to be heading back to school to work on his doctoral
thesis about the Turner rebellion. But when he gives in, he finds
that the trip takes him to the time of the rebellion and transforms
Great-Great-Grandpa into his younger self.</TE>
<TE>   In this ghostly world (conjured up in shades of nightmare green in
Mercedes Younger's set design), Ron not only meets Turner (Mark
Anthony Hall, brimming with gospel fire) but finds a soul mate in
Hammet (Lonnie Simpson), a Turner follower with the soul of a poet.
In one of the most beautiful moments of Derek Charles Livingston's
staging, Ron discovers in Hammet's tender touch--and an innocent
exchange of breath--what it meant to be gay in the slave-era South.</TE>
<TE>   He learns still more about the legacy of slavery, which, now as
then, pits people against one another and gives rise to barbaric
behavior all around. As Great-Great-Grandpa says to Ron: "You live in
dangerous times, just like we do here."</TE>
<TE>   "Insurrection: Holding History," McCadden Place Theatre, 1157 N.
McCadden Place, Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7
p.m. Ends March 31. $15-$20. (323) 957-1884. Running time: 1 hour, 55
minutes.</TE>

<HD>A Cast of a Thousand Jamies</HD>
<DH>Television*  Morphing into various characters, Kennedy gets
a kick out of taking unsuspecting members of the public into his
alternate universe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRAZIER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In person, Jamie Kennedy displays the spiky haircut and informed
goofiness of a teen you might confront across the counter at a video
store.</LD>
<LD>   But forget what he's like for real, or that this rising
actor-comic is actually 31 years old. On "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment," his new sketch-reality show on the WB (which is
part-owned by Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times), he
disappears inside one of countless alter egos who meet, and beguile,
an unsuspecting public. (Two new half-hour episodes air Sunday at 8
p.m.)</LD>
<LD>   "I love playing characters, and the real test of being an actor is
to see if people believe them," says Kennedy, whose films includes
"Three Kings" and "Scream." "What better way to test this stuff than
to run it on real people?"</LD>
<TE>   Maybe he's an elderly, hopelessly addled TV judge who can't keep
straight the facts of the case. Or a rich-boy, Malibu-born rapper. Or
a roguish Hollywood tour guide who takes sightseers inside Bob
Saget's house--after he busts a window to gain access.</TE>
<TE>   When each situation can't get any loonier, Kennedy comes clean.
But instead of "Smile, you're on 'Candid Camera,'" he turns to his
befuddled "mark," breaks character and cackles, "You've been X-ed!"</TE>
<TE>   A recent segment found Kennedy transformed into a dweebish driving
instructor who subjects his student to lunatic banter, delusional
advice ("hands on the wheel at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock--but after 9
o'clock, at 11 o'clock and 3 o'clock"), and a side trip to the home
of his angry ex-wife, who storms the car with a baseball bat.</TE>
<TE>   If the driving-instructor gambit sounds familiar, you may have
seen a similar prank last summer on NBC's "Candid Camera" from hell,
"Spy TV." On that show, the point was to scare the daylights out of a
guy named Shawn by trapping him in a car with a stunt driver as his
instructor, then, when he was properly traumatized, springing
"gotcha!" on him.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, on "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment," the teenage
student wasn't a victim, but virtually a co-star. Radiating dread
mixed with amusement, she rivaled Kennedy's performance--and she
didn't even know she was performing.</TE>
<TE>   "She was just as much a part of it as me," Kennedy declares.
"We're in the car and at one point I say, 'Don't worry, calm down,
everything's gonna be fine,' and she says, 'OK.' She commits to this
bizarre world!</TE>
<TE>   "Then the driving instructor's brother gets in the car and he's a
transvestite. So she gives him fashion tips."</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration for what its star calls "the funnest job I've ever
had" draws from the art of Eddie Murphy and Peter Sellers, two of
Kennedy's idols. It also takes a cue from documentary films, which he
can't get enough of. (Two far-flung favorites: "Triumph of the Will"
and "Crumb.")</TE>
<TE>   For Kennedy, experiment means introducing an odd element (him)
into real life to see what happens. Or, put another way: steering his
marks into an alternate universe and seeing what role they claim when
they get there. While documenting the whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are challenging people's belief systems, and I think that's
pretty cool," he says. "They are thinking, 'This is weird, but I'm
gonna go with it and be accepting.' And then, after we reveal what's
going on, they can go, 'Whew!' Everything they believed before is
right, after all. They realize nothing would have been weird if we
weren't involved."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, their willingness to buy into the act depends on
Kennedy not blowing his cover.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been busted yet," he says proudly. "I have a malleable
face, and the makeup people are great. Except I have a big nose, so
the makeup man told me I could never play an Asian."</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves a lot of people he can play. But what becomes of
his covert comedy quest as he and the show grow increasingly
familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Not a problem, says the joker, who claims his only worry is a
backlash from the catchphrase "You've been X-ed."</TE>
<TE>   "Like, I could see girlfriends breaking up with me saying, 'You've
been X-ed!' Then I go to a Lakers game and Shaq says, 'You're X-ed!'
I mean, it's endless what could happen."</TE>
<TE>   He chortles with delight. "The biggest question I used to get was,
'Why did you get killed in "Scream 2"?' Now it's 'What are you gonna
do when people recognize you?'</TE>
<TE>   "First of all," he explains, "we should be so lucky to be that
successful. No. 2: Isn't that a true test, to see if we can keep
pulling it off? I would think we would just have to go deeper and
deeper, and just see how far we can take it."</TE>

<TE>   Ex-Destiny's Child Singers Claim Damage</TE>
<TE>   Two former Destiny's Child members filed a federal lawsuit against
the group, contending the hit song "Survivor," which won a Grammy for
R&amp;B performance by a duo Wednesday night, made derisive comments
about them.</TE>
<TE>   LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson contend the song is in
violation of a previous settlement, which precludes either party from
making "any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one
another."</TE>
<TE>   A line in the song, quoted in the lawsuit filed in Houston federal
court Wednesday, states: "You thought I wouldn't sell without you,
sold 9 million."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fulkerson, an attorney for Destiny's Child, called the lawsuit
"ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs seek a restraining order and an injunction to

<TE>   CBS' broadcast of the Grammy Awards Wednesday saw a drop-off in
viewership from a year ago, as an estimated 18.9 million viewers
tuned in, according to figures from Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   That's a 29% drop from the audience last year, when controversial
rap star Eminem performed a duet with pop superstar Elton John.</TE>
<TE>   CBS Documentary Worries 9/11 Families</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer representing families of the Sept. 11 victims sent a
letter to CBS Wednesday urging the network not to use graphic footage
of the World Trade Center attack in a documentary due to air on March
10, Yahoo! News reports.</TE>
<TE>   The material was shot by French brothers Gedeon and Jules Naudet,
who had been recording firefighters' training exercises when the
terrorists struck.</TE>
<TE>   "Any media event that indiscriminately broadcasts the graphic
horrors of that day will disrupt the healing process," said
prosecutor William Schmidt, writing on behalf of the American Red
Cross, United Way and other groups assisting families in New Jersey's
Bergen County.</TE>
<TE>   CBS spokesman Gil Schwartz defended the two-hour project as
"responsible and sensitive." Rumors that footage would show people
being killed, he said, were the result of "misinformation" and
"misapprehension."</TE>

British Academy Film Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does he think the scuffle will affect his Oscar chances, he
told "Inside Edition."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Oscars are supposed to be about the performance that
you've given, and I don't think I'm nominated for a 'Worst Argument
With an English TV Executive,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   According to People magazine, Madonna will make her London stage
debut in the London stage comedy "Up for Grabs." Her last theater

<HD>'Vacant' Fills a Space in the History of Urban Sprawl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY MYERS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Vacant: Recent Landscapes of Los Angeles," a small but articulate
exhibition of photographs curated by Chris Balaschak, is aptly
titled. If any one theme dominates these and most photographs of our
cityscape, it must be the nagging sense of vacancy that is generally
thought to imbue it. In photography, an art form raised largely on
the crowded streets of New York and Paris, urban sprawl is a
relatively new subject; it threads through recent photographic
history like the presence of a suspicious dinner guest. For some, it
implies spaciousness, freedom and independence; for others it
represents absence, loneliness and alienation.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Ruscha's early photographs are landmarks in the exploration of
this new topography and they're represented here by several of his
more famous books, including "Every Building on the Sunset Strip"
(1966), "34 Parking Lots" (1967), and "26 Gasoline Stations" (1962).
Ruscha's dry, unemotional style informs all of the show's younger
artists, who apply it in a surprising variety of ways.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Slade's quiet pictures of empty lots and raw hillsides around
Los Angeles take a melancholy view, revealing a sense of barrenness
and abandonment. Christina Fernandez's photographs of sweatshop
facades provide a sharp comeback: Though they appear as deserted as
Slade's empty lots, we know these downtown buildings are usually
packed to a dangerous capacity, albeit with a population that many
would prefer to consider invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Karin Apollonia Muller evokes the presence of another invisible
population in "Civitas" (1997), a sweeping, aerial view of a
seemingly empty lot downtown, alongside the 110 Freeway. In the
center of this lot are a makeshift shelter and what appears to be a
makeshift bicycle shop, around which hundreds of bike parts are
scattered in a strangely beautiful arc.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith and David Kanegsberg find an appealing sort of
geometry in the landscape of sprawl: Smith in the plowed earth of
burgeoning suburban developments, which he conveys in a clean, if
somewhat uncaptivating, black-and-white style; and Kanegsberg in
abstracted fragments, such as a stretch of rippling, blue-black tarp
that reads like a seascape in his eloquently minimal composition.</TE>
<TE>   The only work in the show to contain a few rays of real sunlight
(the dominant atmosphere is pale beige and white) is Kaucyila
Brooke's large, lovely picture of a Griffith Park hillside. This
sunlight tickles the sparse shrubbery in the foreground and
illuminates the rolling grass of the hill behind, reminding viewers
that vacancy--space, openness, expanse--can also bring peace.</TE>

<TE>   Close-Ups of the Corporate Aesthetic</TE>
<TE>   In her third exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery, M.A. Peers has
taken a curious turn in subject matter from portraits of purebred
dogs--which she paints onto fragments of found upholstery--to
portraits of male corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   These new images are essentially head shots lifted from the pages
of trade magazines and transcribed by Peers in blue-gray tones and in
a flat, almost amateurish style. Some float freely on sheets of
silver Mylar, as though temporarily suspended in some promising new
corner of cyberspace. Others appear on large canvases against clumsy,
corporate logo-like backdrops. Each wears the sort of smug,
don't-hate-me-because-I'm-rich grin that has come to characterize
American wealth in the popular media. Their expressions are practiced
and deliberately casual. "I'm just an ordinary guy," they seem to
want to assure us, "Let me tell you how I made my first million...."</TE>
<TE>   Peers' title for the series--the "Overcoming Excellence
Collection"--epitomizes the peculiar balance of veneration and pity
with which she treats these men. They are clearly icons of power and
she gives them their due, identifying each by name and rank--"Alan
Webber: Founding Editor, Fast Company Magazine (2001)," "Scott
Bedbury: Senior VP, Brand Development, Starbucks Coffee (2001)," and
the most infamous, "Ken Lay: Former CEO, Enron Corporation
(2001-2)"--as well as basically honoring the terms of the corporate
aesthetic to which they belong. But by refusing to indulge them with
pull quotes, bar graphs or other concrete testaments of their
personal distinction, she allows the bland and ultimately
dehumanizing spirit of their imagery speak for itself.</TE>
<TE>   It is this corporate aesthetic--a branch of visual culture, like
pet portraiture, that sophisticated wings of the art world pride
themselves on ignoring--that ultimately seems to be the focus here.
And though the series is only getting off the ground with this
show--it brims with the sort of awkward enthusiasms and unresolved
curiosities that often characterize a new project--there's clearly a
future in it.</TE>

<TE>   Bennett Shows Her Less-Than-True Colors</TE>
<TE>   Restraint can be an admirable quality in a work of art, but
there's nothing quite like a good, over-the-top blast of outrageous
photographic color.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbi Bennett's current exhibition of saturated 30-by-40-inch
prints offers such a blast, several times over. As though
overcompensating for the pale banality of the everyday world, Bennett
exploits her film for all it's worth, eliciting greens, purples,
reds, yellows and whites that have no natural counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   They spread like liquid electricity across the pictures' surfaces,
often overwhelming the work's ostensible subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Larger Than Life," the exhibition explores issues of
fantasy through the mode of performance. The majority of the works
feature Bennett, but elaborate masks, costumes and sets, which she
constructs, obscure her actual form. The most identifiable
images--slick impersonations of Wonder Woman and Catwoman--are
perhaps the least interesting of the lot: They're a little too easy,
a little too sexy. Far more intriguing are the nearly abstract images
in the "Monster Series," which use color to articulate specified
emotions: "Stanley/Stress (2001)" is a hotbed of fuchsia and yellow
marked by the glimpse of a black cat mask; "Untitled/Stagnation" is a
swampy field of olive green and orange in which the figure is little
more than a faint blur. In these images, as well as in an unsettling
series featuring an ambiguous hospital scene (a web of clinical
white), color consumes the very objects it would seem to describe, as
though acting of its own free will.</TE>
<TE>   It may be a reckless technique in the long run, but Bennett's
display of whole-hearted abandon is difficult to resist.</TE>

<HD>Movies' Portents of Things to Come</HD>
<DH>Awards* Accolades given by actors', writers', directors'
and producers' guilds are considered 'the best tea leaves' for
predicting Oscar winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM O'NEIL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody's a brilliant Oscar forecaster after the awards by the
guilds--writers, directors, actors, producers--are bestowed. So even
though Roberto Benigni and Kevin Spacey failed to win any critics'
trophies or a Golden Globe for "Life Is Beautiful" or "American
Beauty," respectively, a few years ago, they were good bets at the
Academy Awards once they reaped Screen Actors Guild awards. After
all, in the seven years since the guild trophy was introduced, no SAG
best actor champ has  failed to strike Oscar gold next.</LD>
<LD>   The awards bestowed by the actors', writers', directors' and
producers' guilds, all of which will be doled out during the next 10
days, are considered mini-Oscars, in part because, like the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honor, they are peer-group prizes
but also because "they're the best tea leaves we have when trying to
predict who'll win the big Academy Awards,"  Entertainment Weekly
assistant managing editor Mark Harris says.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven of SAG's 14 best actor and actress champs have won Oscars
for the same roles. The forecast rate drops sharply in the supporting
actor races, but, Harris adds, "those are the categories where Oscar
voters love to shock us."</LD>
<TE>   Considering the overall similarities between the winners chosen by
all four guilds and the Oscars, how much  can be credited to a bump
that guild champs receive after winning--and how much is due to
similarities in the makeup of the two voting groups?</TE>
<TE>   There are drastic differences in the size of each electorate. The
Directors Guild of America, for example, has 12,000 members, many of
whom work in TV, while there are 360 film directors who choose Oscar
nominees. (All 5,700 academy voting members select the winners.) The
Screen Actors Guild sends ballots to all of its 97,000 members (the
guild will not reveal how many are returned); there are 1,300 people
in the academy's actors' branch. The Writers Guild of America has
11,000 members; the academy has 400 writers. The Producers Guild of
America has 1,500 members who work in film and TV; the academy has
450 film producers.</TE>
<TE>   There may be big differences in the numbers of people who pick
each award, but "they think the same way," Premiere magazine editor
in chief Peter Herbst says. "In many cases they're the same people
who belong to both organizations. I believe that's the key reason we
see so much similarity between the awards. In general, I think Oscar
voters make up their minds before the guilds pick their winners."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 53-year history of the DGA, Oscar voters have
rubber-stamped all but five guild champs. The Producers Guild has
correctly predicted the best picture Oscar 10 times in the past 13
years.  The Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards have had
parallel categories only for the past 17 years, but since then, 20 of
the 34 script Oscars have been won by WGA champs.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar voters are just now receiving their ballots, which are due
March 19. In the meantime there will be galas to bestow the WGA
awards on Saturday, PGA awards Sunday, DGA awards March 9 and SAG
awards March 10. How will those winners affect the Academy Awards on
March 24?</TE>
<TE>   "If 'A Beautiful Mind' wins the Producers Guild Award, you don't
have to worry about what's going to win best picture at the Oscars,"
Herbst says. "That'll mean that the race is probably decided, since
the guild usually goes for big blockbusters like 'Lord of the
Rings.'" The PGA demonstrated a sizable affinity for big films this
year when it opted to nominate box-office giants "Shrek" and "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" over two small, art-house best
picture contenders at the Oscars: "In the Bedroom" and "Gosford
Park." The Oscars and PGA agree on "A Beautiful Mind," "Lord of the
Rings" and "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   The Directors Guild and Oscars also only agree on three out of
five contenders, but one of the DGA snubs, that of Robert Altman for
"Gosford Park," could be significant. No one has ever won the best
director Oscar without scoring a corresponding guild nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if this is going to be the year it finally happens,"
Harris says, "because I think Robert Altman really has a serious
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, without Altman competing at the DGA, all eyes are
focused on how Ron Howard fares among voters who proclaimed him a
winner in 1996 for "Apollo 13" despite the fact that he wasn't
nominated at the Oscars. Howard was also snubbed by the academy after
receiving a DGA nomination for "Cocoon" in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ron Howard loses at DGA, it'll be a major signal that the
guild awards send this year," film historian Peter Hammond says.
"It'll not only tell us that Howard is in trouble among his peers,
but it'll reveal that there's probably less support for 'A Beautiful
Mind' than many people think."</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind" star Russell Crowe is considered one of the
front-runners for the best actor Oscar, but his actual level of peer
support may be witnessed at the SAG awards. "There may be some voters
who are reluctant to give Crowe back-to-back Oscars, but how many?"
Hammond asks. "Denzel Washington has been gaining momentum lately,
while this year's special Oscar salute to Sidney Poitier reminds
voters that Poitier is the only African American who's ever won a
lead acting award. SAG could tell us how people in the industry feel
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's guild and academy honors proved to be out of sync when
"Traffic's" Benicio del Toro won SAG best actor and Oscar best
supporting actor. This year "A Beautiful Mind's" Jennifer Connelly
faces the same category split--a SAG best actress nominee, an Oscar
supporting actress nominee. With the guilds, it's up to the studios
to decide which category their acting nominees are submitted for,
while at the Oscars it's up to the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosford Park" and "A Beautiful Mind" are major contenders at the
Writers Guild, but they're not competing against rivals that may
prove formidable foes later at the Oscars--"Memento" and "In the
Bedroom," which were shut out of the WGA honors because their
production companies are not guild signatories.</TE>
<TE>   "Some Oscar voters may want to rally behind 'Memento' and 'In the
Bedroom' because of the guild snub," Harris suggests.</TE>
<TE>   That's apparently what occurred in 1996 when "The Usual Suspects"
won the Oscar after being shut out of the WGA because of the
signatory glitch. Like "Memento," it was not a best picture nominee,
but it ambushed best picture winner "Braveheart," which won the
Writers Guild Award.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, the Writers Guild predicts one of the two screenplay
Oscars correctly," Hammond says. Oscar voters endorsed one of the two
WGA winners seven times in the past 10 years. They agreed on both
winners the other three times. Notes Hammond: "If Oscar voters are
going to stray this year, it'll probably be in that category for
original scripts."</TE>

<HD>Playboy Puts Jazz Back in a Familiar Festival Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lineup for the 24th annual Playboy Jazz Festival, which takes
place June 15-16 at the Hollywood Bowl, isn't going to surprise
anyone. The upside to the schedule is that it is more firmly within
the jazz arena than has been the case in recent programs. The
downside is that most of the acts have made Southland appearances in
one venue or another within the past year.</LD>
<LD>   But there's no denying the high quality of the talent on the bill.
The Saturday schedule is studded with major jazz artists: Wynton
Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval, Joe Lovano (with a salute to Enrico
Caruso), Nnenna Freelon, Marcus Miller and a Charles Mingus 80th
birthday tribute (performed by the Mingus Big Band). Etta James and
the Roots Band add some blues seasoning, with Lavay Smith and her Red
Hot Skillet Lickers recalling the swing era. The day's global jazz
outreach segment is filled by Cuban flutist Maraca and his group Otra
Vision.</LD>
<TE>   The Sunday bill is a much more eclectic smorgasbord of choices.
Herbie Hancock, Michael Brecker and Roy Hargrove reprise the
celebration of John Coltrane and Miles Davis presented at USC last
year. Patti Austin celebrates Ella Fitzgerald in what should be a
highly spirited encounter with the Count Basie Orchestra (directed by
Grover Mitchell), and bluesman Keb' Mo' does what Keb' Mo' does.
Smooth jazz makes an appearance via sets by Lee Ritenour and Chris
Botti, with Bill Cosby's Cos of Good Music VII gathering such diverse
talents as Ernie Andrews, Craig Handy, Monty Alexander and others.</TE>
<TE>   The funk and soul of Carl Denson's Tiny Universe should please the
festival's partygoers, with Tolu (with Justo Almario and Alex Acuna)
demonstrating, as it always does, how salsa can swing. Finally, in
Sunday's global jazz outreach, the gypsy rhythms of Les Yeux Noirs
will energize a completely different approach to foot-tapping
improvisation.</TE>

<HD>'Broadway's Best' a Little Off Broadway</HD>
<DH>In the Bravo special, artists from pop and other genres
sing show tunes-- with mixed results. The standouts are the real
stars of the Great White Way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's blame Reba McEntire.</LD>
<LD>   The country music star scored a big hit on Broadway in "Annie Get
Your Gun." Maybe she inspired other practitioners of other pop styles
to sing Broadway songs too.</LD>
<LD>   That they want to do so is the theory behind "Broadway's Best From
Bravo," on the cable network Monday and March 9 at 8 p.m. But some of
the singers on this show are not ready for Broadway--or even for a
local civic light opera.</LD>
<TE>   Let's start with the others, however. Opening the show, Cyndi
Lauper is the only performer in the entire two hours who genuinely
plays a character. She's even in costume, as a middle-aged Broadway
usher. She starts in the aisle, tentatively singing "There's No
Business Like Show Business" and finally goes on stage for a moment
of persuasive belting before returning to her duties.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Osborne's "Not While I'm Around" from "Sweeney Todd" sounds
pretty good too, although her habit of brushing her hair back with
her hand is annoying.</TE>
<TE>   A duet featuring Shawn Colvin and playwright-actor Harvey
Fierstein in "Do You Love Me?" from "Fiddler on the Roof" is by far
the funniest segment of the show. She sings Tevye's lines, while he
croaks the lines usually sung by Golde, Tevye's wife, complete with
pointed double takes.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the show's ringers--real Broadway stars who have
been incorporated into this format that's ostensibly devoted to
non-Broadway performers. They tend to look more confident and sound
more comfortable than most of the others.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Eder, best known for "Jekyll &amp; Hyde," is on hand--not
surprising in that her husband, "Jekyll" composer Frank Wildhorn, is
the show's "artistic director." At least Wildhorn refrained from
including his own songs. Adam Pascal and Daphne Rubin-Vega sing "What
You Own" from "Rent," in which they starred. In the most blatant
violation of the show's stated philosophy, the dancers from "Contact"
perform that show's "Simply Irresistible."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Bacon, who with his sibling Michael leads the Bacon Brothers
band, also happens to be on Broadway right now in the play "An Almost
Holy Picture." Here, the brothers sing "Easy to Be Hard" from "Hair."</TE>
<TE>   Trisha Yearwood, Darius Rucker of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Jill
Scott and George Benson all turn in respectable performances,
although Benson also stretches the concept of the show in singing "On
Broadway"--which was his own 1978 hit, years before it was literally
on Broadway in "Smokey Joe's Cafe."</TE>
<TE>   Loudon Wainwright III's two selections from "Guys and Dolls"
should deter him from doing his own solo version of the whole show.
Instead of singing "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat," he should
obey the command of the lyric.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse is Jamie-Lynn Sigler of "The Sopranos" singing "I Feel
Pretty" and "Give My Regards to Broadway" on the level of a high
school ingenue--didn't Meadow graduate and go on to Columbia last
season?</TE>
<TE>   But the nadir of the show is in two selections sung by Mandy
Moore. She recalls how she did "Adelaide's Lament" from "Guys and
Dolls" in sixth grade, and it sounds as if she hasn't made much
progress since, especially in figuring out Adelaide's New York
accent. She teams with Pascal for "Suddenly Seymour" from "Little
Shop of Horrors," "little" being an apt description of her voice.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was shot in an arena-style ballroom last November,
leading to plenty of varied camera angles that help distract us from
the likes of Moore.</TE>

<HD>'Victor' Richly Re-Imagines 'Frankenstein'</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Victor Frankenstein stands at the edge of a precipice, staring into
his future.</LD>
<LD>   Having discovered a way to animate dead tissue, he constructed a
creature from body parts and brought it to life. The hideous thing
has turned lonely and murderous, however, and to escape an advancing
mob, it has just scrambled down this rocky promontory, ordering
Victor to follow.</LD>
<LD>   This is where ambition leads, English playwright Alistair Faulkner
suggests in "Victor," his adaptation of Mary Shelley's
"Frankenstein."</LD>
<TE>   His rich, literate treatment of the material is given an
extraordinarily detailed staging at the Eclectic Company Theatre in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Every element fits beautifully in this eerily gothic staging by
Taylor Ashbrook, from the cold, dead feel of John J. Grant's lighting
to the giant sutures in the stage floor that stitch the rocky
promontory to an adjoining setting inside a rustic cottage, a
wonderfully subtle touch in Jeff G. Rack's set design.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching this well-known story from a different angle, Faulkner
sets his version on a remote island at the northern tip of Scotland,
where, in 1810, the handsome, brooding Victor (James Castle Stevens)
thinks he has found sanctuary with the quietly adoring Agnes
(Elizabeth Dement); her doctor brother, James (Brian David Pope); and
James' lovely if conceited wife, Freya (Alison Robertson).</TE>
<TE>   The creature (a hulking, shrouded David Reynolds) will find Victor
here, however, and soon, death will haunt a place where the tormented
scientist had found such abundant life.</TE>
<TE>   In our current age of cloning and other forms of genetic
engineering, the warnings of Shelley's "Frankenstein" echo anew. As
Victor warns here, the question "What if?," asked too many times, can
precipitate a downfall.</TE>

North Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends

<TE>   A Strange Triangle at</TE>
<TE>   the Heart of 'Destronelli'</TE>
<TE>   A love-starved gay man, the idol of a love-starved widow, is
stalked by a love-starved admirer who may or may not exist only in
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   That's the bizarre triangle around which Dennis Miles'
"Destronelli" at Theatre of Note revolves. Miles' intriguing but
occasionally overwrought new drama concerns the human hunger for
love, and the strange permutations into which raw need can twist that
tender emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Ustin Staymansion (Dan Wingard), a bright, intellectually
inquisitive gay man who can't sustain a romantic relationship, finds
solace and fellowship with his widowed elderly neighbor Millie
Lepidus (Pamela Gordon). Ailing in body but earthy in appetite,
Millie loves Ustin with a sensual and hopeless passion he suspects
but can never return.</TE>
<TE>   For nine years, Ustin has gotten phone calls and love letters from
an anonymous stalker. When the stalker, Pietro Destronelli (Dean
Lemont), introduces himself to Ustin at a gallery opening, they
connect on a deep psychic level. All too soon, the appropriately
named Destronelli proves a destroyer, an agent of psychotic sensual
force threatening to unhinge Ustin's life and sanity. Whether the
threat is real or the pathological product of Ustin's emotional
despair remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Destronelli's derivation, he is the engineer of tragedy.
Under the keen-edged direction of Kiff Scholl, the actors deliver
finely rendered, emotionally layered performances that largely
compensate for the play's stylistic excesses. Wingard strikes an
impressive balance of feyness and masculinity as Ustin, while the
bluff and imposing Lemont keeps us vertiginously off-guard in the
volatile title turn. However it is Gordon's Millie--needy, defiant
and unabashedly sensual--who most excites our admiration and pity.</TE>

<TE>   Light Touch, Fine Timing</TE>
<TE>   Buoy Simon's 'Fools'</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of Blue Sphere Alliance's blithe staging of Neil
Simon's "Fools," ending Saturday at Hollywood's Lex Theatre, comes
Actors Co-op's effervescent production of the comic fable, at the
Crossley Terrace Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   In this affectionate bit of frippery, based on the Jewish folk
tale "The Wise Men of Chelm," a Russian village is cursed with
stupidity. The shepherd (Jarret Lemaster) waits for his missing sheep
to write home, the vendor (Linda Kerns) confuses flowers for fish,
the magistrate (Jim Custer) is time-challenged, the mailman (Gary
Clemmer) is address-challenged and the butcher (Mick Montgomery)
sports prodigious self-inflicted wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the village doctor (Greg Baldwin) and his wife (Brenda
Ballard) burst with pride when their grown daughter Sophia masters
the art of sitting.</TE>
<TE>   Young schoolmaster Leon (Jeff Charlton, an irresistible
combination of eagerness and awakening passion), arriving to take up
his new teaching post and playing perplexed straight man to all the
lunacy, is soon smitten with beautiful but dim Sophia (played by Amy
Landers with droll sincerity) and determines to break the curse.</TE>
<TE>   He only has 24 hours to do it or he'll lose his wits too.
Complicating matters, villainous Count Yousekevitch plans to marry
Sophia himself. (Thom Babbes' single-eyebrowed Count is a hoot in red
velvet Cossack garb with gigantic gold epaulets. He's hilariously
insecure about his short stature and totes a little gold platform to
stand on.)</TE>
<TE>   Without an essential light touch and tight timing, the nonstop
silliness--visual and oral--would wear thin fast, but director Henry
Polic II and his assured ensemble expertly navigate the zany twists
and turns with buoyant charm. They are complemented by Robert
Bingham's dappled, woodsy fairy tale set with its comic touches, Dana
Kilgore's warm lighting, Geoff Green's playful sound design and Dana
C. Litwak's colorful folk costumes.</TE>

<HD>Living With Temptation for '40 Days and 40 Nights'</HD>
<DH>Josh Hartnett plays a single guy who delves into the deeper
meaning of celibacy in this frothy comedy with subtext.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A romantic comedy about a hunky guy who gives up sex for Lent sounds
smirky, and "40 Days and 40 Nights" is that--but it offers more.
That's because it was directed by that most subversive of filmmakers,
Michael Lehmann ("Heathers") from a script by a terrific first-time
writer, Robert Perez, who's in tune with Lehmann's dark, gleeful
sense of humor. "40 Days and 40 Nights" can be taken as a mildly
risque frothy date movie, but there's serious subtext for those who
choose to look beneath surface sheen.</LD>
<LD>   Josh Hartnett stars as Matt, a San Francisco dot-com wiz whose
gorgeous girlfriend, Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), has dumped him. Matt is
so devastated that casual sex leaves him depressed and feeling like a
black hole is opening up to engulf him.</LD>
<LD>   After a series of confessions to his priest brother, John (Adam
Trese), he sees the advent of Lent as the opportunity to make a
sacrifice that will help free him of his obsession with Nicole and
regain his self-control.</LD>
<TE>   Matt's idea may sound a bit unrealistic amid the myriad
temptations of these free and easy times, but it certainly seems
worth a try. But that is not how Matt's planned abstinence is
received in his world of good-looking, in-shape, pleasure-seeking
singles. Even John scoffs at Matt's declaration of resolve, and
Matt's crass roommate Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) does much worse: He lets
Matt's co-workers in on his vow. They respond with considerably more
than mere derision.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on here between the lines of the sex jokes? It would
seem that the notion of a young man discovering that sex can become
meaningless without love is a truly threatening proposition to a
bunch of people who've become conditioned to viewing sex as a
competitive sport in which performance is everything and emotions
beside the point. Although Matt proves resilient to those who
underestimate his seriousness and determination, something gets in
the way of his plan in the form of Erica (Shannyn Sossamon), a young
woman of imagination and intelligence whom he meets about two weeks
after his vow of abstinence.</TE>
<TE>   The way Matt's fate plays out is consistently engaging, at once
clever and insightful. Matt is caught up in no less than a journey of
self-discovery, with Nicole resurfacing in a manner that leaves him
surprised to discover why he may have lost her.</TE>
<TE>   Hartnett is the film's star through and through, and he reveals
his versatility as a sophisticated, urbane male challenged by the
depth of feeling he discovers within himself--a discovery that is
totally at odds with the aggressive hedonism that rules his rigidly
conformist world.</TE>
<TE>   Hartnett is fortunate in his leading ladies. Sossamon's Erica is
believably captivated and then puzzled by Matt's unexpected reserve.
Nicole could so easily have been unsympathetic, but Shaw has the
chance and ability to suggest that she might well have welcomed being
treated like a woman instead of being worshiped like a goddess.</TE>
<TE>   Costanzo is nimble at keeping up a steady supply of
obnoxiousness--exactly what is required. Griffin Dunne is Matt's
boss, who's inspired to try abstinence himself, hoping to energize
his lackluster married life, and Barry Newman and Mary Gross are
amusing as Matt's parents.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: R, for strong sexual content, nudity and language.
Times guidelines: The sex talk is extremely frank, and there's a fair
amount of kinkiness as well.</TE>

<HD>'Grace' Stumbles in Season Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"State of Grace," ABC Family's re-imagining of the boomer-centric
series "The Wonder Years," makes its second-season debut tonight with
an effort that's something less than graceful (8 p.m.). The series,
which originally was given a 13-episode commitment for 2002, recently
got the go-ahead for 13 more in the belief that this coming-of-age
story of two young girls and their families, set in North Carolina in
the turbulent '60s, had tapped into something special.</LD>
<LD>   The network's instincts are sound. Although tonight's episode,
"Get Me to the Church on Time," doesn't show off the series' charms
to their best advantage, the ingredients are there for a decent run.
But the half-hour dramedy needs to know when to jog instead of
sprint, and tonight's episode simply tries to cover too much ground.</LD>
<LD>   Picking up where the show left off last season, widow Tattie McKee
(Faye Grant) is preparing to remarry, leaving her 12-year-old
daughter, Grace (Mae Whitman), deeply resentful of the change her
life is about to take.</LD>
<TE>   Grace's best friend, Hannah Rayburn, (Alia Shawkat), whose Jewish
family has undergone some turmoil of its own in moving from Illinois
to the Deep South, provides some comfort, but it's not nearly enough.
Besides, a garish new presence has invaded the Rayburn household in
the form of color television, and family members are quickly enslaved
to the magic box. But not to worry--this intense fixation doesn't
even last to the end of the episode.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar winner Frances McDormand ("Fargo," "Almost Famous") has an
off-camera role as the adult Hannah, narrating the proceedings a la
Daniel Stern in "The Wonder Years," and '60s musical hits provide
some added resonance.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's episode, "Of Diamonds and Deli Meats," has more of the
warm, deft touch that is the show's strength, but for the
uninitiated, tonight serves as an acceptable introductory course.</TE>

<HD>Chilling Spirits Lend a Haunting Power to 'Wendigo'</HD>
<DH>A city family experiences strange incidents in the country
in the final entry of Larry Fessenden's spooky trilogy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Fessenden is a filmmaker with an uncanny gift for the creation
of unsettling moods, capable, among other things, of bringing out the
spookiness and menace inherent in a bleak winter landscape. He makes
unusual, almost handmade art horror films, of which the eerie
"Wendigo" is the latest example.</LD>
<LD>   "Wendigo" is the third film (the excellent Manhattan vampire film
"Habit" was the first, "No Telling" the second) in what the
writer-director-editor calls "a trilogy of revisionist horror movies"
that take a fresh, unencumbered look at some of the classic fright
film themes.</LD>
<LD>   In this, Fessenden is an interesting successor to producer Val
Lewton, whose much-admired low-key 1940s horror films such as "I
Walked With a Zombie," "The Body Snatcher" and "Bedlam" have been
enormously influential and admired. And, reminiscent of recent
non-American horror films such as Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others"
and Guillermo del Toro's "The Devil's Backbone," Fessenden's films
depend on atmosphere more than shock to unnerve us.</LD>
<TE>   "Wendigo" is named after a terrifying creature out of Native
American mythology that has been utilized by everyone from poet Ogden
Nash to the creators of "The X-Files" and Marvel Comics. As described
in the film by a mysterious tribal elder, this half-man, half-deer
shape-shifter is "always hungry, never satisfied. There are spirits
to be feared because they are angry. He who hears the cry of the
Wendigo is never seen again." If that sentence sends a bit of a chill
down your back, you'll appreciate this kind of filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly psychoanalyst Kim McClaren ("High Art's" Patricia
Clarkson), her photographer-husband, George (Jake Weber), and their
8-year-old son, Miles (the self-possessed Erik Per Sullivan), are not
thinking of dreaded mythological beasts as they drive through upstate
New York on the way to a vacation weekend at a friend's borrowed
country house.</TE>
<TE>   Then, suddenly, a large deer bounds out of the woods and is hit by
their car. Almost immediately, a trio of ragged local hunters emerges
in the animal's wake, and their leader, the in-your-face Otis (John
Speredakos) uses a pistol to kill the buck in front of an unnerved
Miles. This causes a disturbing confrontation between the family and
the hunters, which gets even creepier when it turns out Otis lives
very close to their destination farmhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Though they try, it's hard for the family to have a relaxing time
after what has happened, with Kim still angry and George, the kind of
guy who has a deer on his sweater, not in his rifle sights, looking
especially overmatched. The incident has the strongest effect,
however, on young Miles. He's a worried, susceptible child, prone to
checking closets for dangerous creatures and in fact visited by
ghostly apparitions when the lights go down.</TE>
<TE>   Even in daylight, however, strange incidents begin to happen both
around the house and in the town. Is this a case of excitable city
folks being unable to cope with the solitude of rural life, or is
something strange, something truly sinister, about to go down?</TE>
<TE>   Working with cinematographer Terry Stacey and having the benefit
of a wonderfully eerie score by composer Michelle DiBucci, Fessenden
is the right director to capture the nuances of this sum-of-all-fears
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Making a virtue of necessity, Fessenden manages to use snow, light
and wind to create a potent, chilling dreamscape. He employs jagged,
almost experimental camerawork in the film's creature sections, which
he says he approached "as if I were embarking on an art
installation."</TE>
<TE>   Though "Wendigo" has weak spots, including an ending that is not
as satisfying as it might be, the film remains memorable despite its
flaws. This is a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to
influence us whether we believe in them or not.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for a strong sex scene, language and violent
images. Times guidelines: rich in atmospheric uneasiness but not
overly graphic.</TE>

<HD>Why the Saudis Are Warming Up to Idea of Mideast Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie, a senior adjunct fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., is a
syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Saudis know that they need peace more than the Israelis and the
Palestinians, if they want to survive. Allow me to explain.</LD>
<LD>   During an off-the-record meeting with President Reagan in 1983, he
gave me this simple assessment of the Soviet economy: "It's like a
giant hole in the ground, and the Communists have nothing to fill it
with."</LD>
<LD>   Several years later I met with President Gorbachev in Moscow, when
I was collaborating with him on an internationally syndicated column
(he wrote, I drew) and quoted President Reagan. Gorbachev stared at
me with some anguish, and confirmed Reagan's assessment, albeit with
more gentle words.</LD>
<TE>   "I simply knew that there is no way that we can compete with you.
We hardly had money to buy diesel for our tanks, let alone confront
the U.S. with a very expensive 'Star Wars' of our own.</TE>
<TE>   "What amazed me," continued the Soviet leader, "is that no one in
the Soviet Union besides me would readily admit this, and that you in
the West were generally ignorant of identifying our terrible economic
situation as well."</TE>
<TE>   A similar situation is starting to unfold now in the Middle East,
especially in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The only revenue it has is from oil.</TE>
<TE>   This rich country, which exports fanatic Islam propaganda and some
of the finest terrorists available on the suicide market, has nothing
but unemployment, poor education, population explosion and a religion
that forces half of its work force--women--to stay idle.</TE>
<TE>   The only item that separates Saudi Arabia from total economic
disaster is oil.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a nation that manufactures or produces. Because of its
oil riches, no one even thought about an economic infrastructure
other than oil production, and no one bothered to teach the younger
generations how to make a living outside of the oil wells.</TE>
<TE>   And here comes the bombshell: Unlike the West, the Saudis did
identify the forthcoming economic disaster that will hit their
country like a meteor the size of Pasadena. Global warming is already
devastating the sea levels all over the world, and low elevation
islands north of New Zealand had to be evacuated because of the
ocean's flooding and covering homes.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful pictures of a new sea, born at the North Pole after the
glaciers melted, sent shivers down the spines of the rulers of Saudi
Arabia. Boy, did they see the writing on the ice!</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad al Sabban, head of the Saudi delegation to global warming
conventions and the senior economic advisor to the Saudi oil
ministry, declared openly that the world is shifting away from fossil
fuels.</TE>
<TE>   "We are assuming that only for another 15 years, maximum, will we
have oil as a big share of the energy mix," he said. "We are very
concerned about this."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Saudi oil chief made a devastating statement: "For all
its prosperity," he said, "Saudi Arabia will still need help in
developing new industries and job sources for its growing
population."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis know that every emission cut not only diminishes the
oil market but also encourages the countries that were sitting on
huge oil reserves (like Mexico, Russia and China) to pour into that
market every barrel they have before their Cinderella-like wells turn
into greasy pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   That is why we don't hear drumbeats of "oil embargoes," "oil
retaliation" and "oil blackmail" anymore.</TE>
<TE>   This is why oil prices are dropping very gently and will continue
to do so forever, especially after President Bush touted new American
cars that run on hybrid energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia knows it will need a solid, quiet and peaceful
environment if it wants to structure a new economy from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   It knows it will have to beg for a Marshall Plan, which only the
West will be able to assist it with.</TE>
<TE>   It already knows that, like it or not, it will need Israeli
know-how in the form of instructors, engineers and water specialists
to turn its country green.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing Saudis need right now is an exploding Middle East
that will multiply their forthcoming problems to a degree that
everyone in the world will be licking their own wounds and simply not
have the time, money or energy to help Saudi Arabia, which will be
sinking in its own useless oil.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Saudis have initiated the peace move between the
Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>

<AU>MARC I. MACHIZ</AU>
<BD>Marc I. Machiz, a Washington attorney, was the
associate solicitor for the Department of Labor's Plan Benefits
Security Division from 1988 to 2000.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush and his advisors have stared into the Enron abyss and
have seen only a pothole. Their myopic view of the disaster has led
them to recommend repairs to our retirement system that are less
wrong than irrelevant.</LD>
<LD>   They proclaim the need for freedom and flexibility--for instance,
the right to sell shares after three years in a 401(k) plan--when
only diversification, disclosure and strong legal remedies will
prevent another Enron debacle, or at least assure some recourse if
one does occur.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush team claims to believe that the bosses at Enron
handcuffed their employees. The employees were stuck with Enron
shares either by the now-infamous lock-down or because they held
employer-contributed shares that could only be sold by employees who
had reached age 50. By contrast, the brass, who were in the know,
sold their shares for tens of millions.</LD>
<TE>   It's a great story, but it's nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron officers and directors didn't need to shackle the
employees to their shares. Even while the officers were selling, the
employees were eagerly buying new shares inside the 401(k) plan at
fraud-inflated prices. Employees "bought high" because they weren't
told the truth: Enron was smoke and mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile the insiders were selling, but at high prices available
months before the lock-down kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   There is not a shred of evidence that more freedom to sell shares
would have helped matters. Almost 90% of the shares in the Enron
401(k) plan were subject to sale except during the brief lock-down
that occurred after the stock had already collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's other proposals are equally beside the
point.</TE>
<TE>   Regular account statements are a friendly service, but at Enron
these statements would have merely reinforced the employees'
misimpression that they were getting rich, not robbed.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the administration's proposal to encourage employers to
provide investment advice to employees in 401(k) plans misses the
mark.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal allows employers to hire advisors subject to
conflicts of interest who might, under the law now in effect, be
prohibited from advising employees.</TE>
<TE>   No one believes that if these rules had been relaxed, Enron would
have hired an advisor to persuade employees to sell their company
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Real reform requires that employees hear the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Employees should have a right to know the material facts possessed
by their employer and anyone else responsible for running their
benefit plans. There is no reason to limit this right to employer
stock investments in 401(k) plans. Rules against lying found in
current law are not enough. The law should impose a clear,
affirmative duty to disclose important information.</TE>
<TE>   The administration proposal does no such thing.</TE>
<TE>   Current law will not assure the Enron employees and other victims
of pension plan misconduct meaningful remedies.</TE>
<TE>   Benefit plan managers who violate the law and anyone who helps
them injure employees--be they lawyers, accountants or the bagmen who
set up phony partnerships--should be required to make whole the
employees and the plans they injure.</TE>
<TE>   The government should have even harsher remedies at its disposal
to deter future misconduct, and whistle-blowers should have real
protection from retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   The administration experts know that the law omits these rights
and remedies, yet their proposal is silent on these legal gaps.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to say that tax-advantaged retirement plans are not the
place for employees to risk everything on a single roll of the dice.
Americans can invest in whatever they please, but the retirement
system is heavily subsidized by the taxpayers to provide our citizens
with a secure old age.</TE>
<TE>   We receive value for our tax dollars only if we insist, not merely
advise, that when employees take advantage of taxpayer-subsidized
retirement vehicles, they do so responsibly. We must place reasonable
limits on retirement plan investments in employer stock.</TE>

<HD>Government Should Steer Clear of the Fuel Economy Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM A. NISKANEN and PETER VAN DOREN</AU>
<BD>William A. Niskanen is chairman of the Cato Institute,
and Peter Van Doren is editor of Cato's Regulation magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congress is about to consider increasing the "corporate average fuel
economy," or CAFE, standards--provisions first enacted in 1975 as a
policy response to the 1973 oil shock. The idea is to conserve
gasoline by making automobiles more fuel-efficient. But why is it
important to reduce gasoline consumption? As long as consumers pay
the market price for gasoline, why should the government dictate how
much a vehicle uses?</LD>
<LD>   The CAFE standards now mandate that the fuel economy of new cars
sold by companies equal or exceed 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger
vehicles and 20.7 mpg for light trucks, a category that includes
minivans and SUVs, vehicles that didn't exist in 1975. These
standards are enforced by imposing large fines on automobile
manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) has proposed increasing the standard to
a 35-mpg average for all vehicles by 2013, and Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) has proposed a 36-mpg standard by 2016.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration opposes Congress mandating fuel
efficiency, preferring to let the Transportation Department set fuel
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The underlying premise of the existing system, as well as the new
proposals, is that it is important to reduce gasoline consumption and
that increased CAFE standards can achieve that.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of CAFE have argued that it would reduce our
vulnerability to oil shocks.</TE>
<TE>   But disruptions in world oil markets affect prices everywhere
regardless of our level of imports because oil is traded in world
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, increased fuel economy has not led to reduced dependence
on imported oil. Since the CAFE standards were introduced, the
average fuel economy has increased by 114% for new cars and by 56%
for new light trucks, but the U.S. consumption of imported oil has
increased from 35% to 52%.</TE>
<TE>   A more relevant impact is the effect of gasoline consumption on
air pollution or global warming. But if Congress believes that
gasoline costs are too low because they do not include funds to pay
for environmental damage, then it should increase the gasoline tax
and leave decisions about vehicle design and gasoline consumption to
the normal interplay of car manufacturers and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to a tax on gasoline, CAFE standards are an imperfect
and inefficient method of signaling drivers about the true costs of
the gasoline that they consume.</TE>
<TE>   First, the standards put a damper on new car sales by increasing
vehicle price or reducing size, and they reduce the per-mile cost of
using cars because the vehicles use less fuel per mile. The lower
sales of new cars means longer retention of existing cars. These
older cars pollute more and use more gasoline, undermining the
purpose of the CAFE standards. The new cars would use less gasoline
per mile, which leads people to drive more. The current best estimate
is that every 10% increase in the mpg standard results in a 2%
increase in vehicle miles traveled.</TE>
<TE>   A second inefficiency of the CAFE standards arises from the
interests of the auto unions. The United Auto Workers does not want
unionized U.S. auto makers to comply with CAFE by importing small
cars that use less gasoline. Under CAFE rules, gas-frugal imports
only offset the gasoline use of other imports. To offset the gasoline
use of low-mpg U.S. cars, high-mpg cars must be made in the United
States, presumably with higher-cost UAW labor that would increase the
price to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   A third effect of CAFE has been to reduce the weight of small cars
and subsidize their sales (because those are cheaper techniques of
improving mileage than retooling engines), which, in turn, has
increased auto fatalities. It has been estimated that the 500-pound
reduction in auto weight that coincided with the introduction of CAFE
has increased the fatality risk by up to 27%.</TE>
<TE>   A final effect of CAFE is to tax the production of low-mileage
vehicles differently depending on the product mix of the company.
Low-mileage vehicles, for example, produced by a company that does
not exceed the standards or has accumulated mileage credits face a
different tax than identical mileage vehicles produced by a company
with a different vehicle mix.</TE>
<TE>   Our conclusion is simple: If we want drivers to pay for the costs
of their pollution, increase the gasoline tax. CAFE standards are an
inefficient method of reducing gasoline consumption and have
undesirable side effects.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps you have seen USC's advertisements playfully objecting to the
"University of Spoiled Children" moniker that some had given the
institution in years past. The ad made me wonder: If the spoiled
children aren't at USC, where are they? They must be going to college
somewhere. I decided to find out.</LD>
<LD>   Since there is not a National Registry of Spoiled Children, there
is no list to match with college enrollment records. So the question
must be approached from the other direction: Which prestigious
colleges and universities across the country enroll the fewest
"working class" students--regular kids whose parents don't have fancy
degrees or European cars? Wherever those children aren't would
probably point to where the spoiled children are.</LD>
<LD>   Of the nation's top private universities, the University of
Southern California enrolls--by far--the most students from
lower-income families. By my measure, 27% of USC's undergraduates are
from roughly the bottom third of all families in terms of income.
Princeton has only about 7%; Stanford, about 11%; Caltech in
Pasadena, 16%.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA enrolls more poor and working-class students than USC--almost
35%--and more than any other top-ranked university in the country,
public or private.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley and UC San Diego are next in the rankings at about
30%, better than other flagship public institutions such as the
University of Virginia (9%), the University of Wisconsin (11%) and
the universities of Michigan and North Carolina (both about 12%).</TE>
<TE>   If there is a University of Spoiled Children, it's not in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   This is a good thing, because--call me a romantic--I would like to
live in a country where our education system is a route for upward
mobility, a way that children of the working class can work hard and
become leading scientists, educators or other professionals. If our
colleges simply recycle the upper class, further spoiling the spoiled
children, then they are not contributing to a healthy, democratic
society.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not always easy for working-class students to succeed at
elite colleges and universities. Too often they are such a rarity
that they have to hide the truth or risk painful silences when they
reveal the fact that their parents didn't go to college or they
almost never ate at a restaurant when they were growing up. Just as
resources go into helping ensure that other groups of students feel
welcome and understood on campus, students from lower-income families
need support too. But at most colleges it doesn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   It can be difficult to get college administrators to thoughtfully
include social class along with important issues of race. One reason
may be the lack of a yardstick for institutions to compare themselves
with one another.</TE>
<TE>   Yet by studying the percentage of domestic students who receive
federal Pell grant scholarships--which are awarded using a common
formula across institutions--data can be compiled that compare the
economic diversity of various colleges. The grants are not just
offered to dirt-poor students. They are also given to the children of
store clerks, bus drivers, nurses, police officers and small-business
owners.</TE>
<TE>   The nation has benefited greatly because colleges and universities
have sought to improve the racial diversity of their student bodies.</TE>
<TE>   With the new data that is available, higher-education leaders
should do more to ensure that diversity includes students who grew up
living in apartment buildings, using laundromats and riding in used
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The spoiled children could learn something from them.</TE>

<LD>In 1961, when I was 12 years old and dreaming of a career in cartoon
animation, I had the privilege of meeting my idol, Chuck Jones, in
his office on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank ("Wabbits and Opera,"
editorial, Feb. 26). He graciously took time out to give me a brief
tour and sent me off with words of encouragement and a few original
cels. Alas, the cels have long since disappeared, but that afternoon
has stayed with me.</LD>
<LD>   Jones was incredibly modest about his long and brilliant career.
He gave his characters all the credit--he called Bugs Bunny "that
Oscar-winning rabbit!" But it was Chuck Jones who gave the great
Warner Bros. cartoons their sense of humor.</LD>

<TE>   It is ironic that your editorial would rely so heavily on what
Jones did not create: the words of the classic cartoons "Rabbit
Seasoning" and "What's Opera, Doc?" The famous "pronoun trouble"
exchange between Bugs and Daffy Duck and the libretto of the
Wagnerian spoof were, like the language and story lines of so many
other "Chuck Jones cartoons," the work of writer Michael Maltese.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Corliss' tribute to Jones in this week's Time magazine
characterized Maltese as Jones' partner, and Jones himself was,
according to Charles Solomon's tribute in The Times, always ready to
credit Maltese's contributions. Why then did The Times fall into the
auteurist trap of thinking that the director did everything?</TE>

<LD>I have been having a problem understanding the Enron hearings. It was
just a few months ago that the politicians where standing in line at
the Enron money trough willing and able to perform whatever services
this corporate giant wanted for a few bucks. These are the same
people now investigating Enron.</LD>
<LD>   I am having a hard time distinguishing the bad guys from the good
guys. The politicians accuse Enron management of making bad financial
deals that forced the company into bankruptcy. Is this not similar to
deficit spending? If our country were a corporation and unable to
print money, would it not be bankrupt?</LD>
<LD>   The politicians accuse Enron executives of depleting the
retirement benefits of their employees. For years the politicians
have been stealing money from the Medicare and Social Security funds
to the point of bankrupting them.</LD>
<TE>   The politicians accuse Enron executives of shredding documents and
destroying evidence. Isn't Vice President Cheney's position on
disclosing the participants and the content of the energy meetings
the same thing? Is this not the old proverbial pot calling the kettle
black?</TE>
<TE>   Al Bergamo</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sad state of affairs regarding the unraveling corruption
scandal at Enron will now lead to new laws and regulations on how to
avoid a proliferation of these types of operations in the future.
With the system now in place and all politicians still feeding at the
same trough, I bet that nothing much changes. It takes people of
integrity to make the proper and right decisions. There appears to be
a distinct lack of that personal characteristic in corporate and
political America today.</TE>

Commentary, Feb. 22: I was born in Manhattan and raised in New York
City's borough of Queens. I don't recall any complaints or
controversy over the system of one mayor and City Council and five
borough governments. Los Angeles--and especially my neighbors in the
San Fernando Valley--need a well-informed discussion of the proven
borough system.</LD>

<LD>Re ''Lack of Police Recruits May Cost L.A. Millions in Federal Aid,''
Feb. 27: Police recruitment may be a problem but it does not have to
be. The Los Angeles Police Academy magnet schools are now on five
high school campuses and one middle school campus in Los Angeles.
Over 1,000 students are enrolled in the program.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD provides officers to bring the standards of the LAPD to
the students, to help them prepare for a rigorous and rewarding
career in law enforcement and to help them understand their role in
the community. Students wear uniforms, stand for inspection,
participate in community events and volunteer for community service.
All this while pursuing a rigorous college-bound program. These are
future officers who know, in advance, what is expected of them and
what they can expect. After high school graduation many apply for the
new student worker program with LAPD. That allows students to attend
college and work up to 20 hours a week in a police facility.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD and the LAUSD are giving these students the best in
education, training and commitment. This year the first class of
students will be able to enter the Los Angeles Police Department. It
will be a proud moment for the magnet schools and a defining moment
for the community.</LD>

<LD>Re "Juror Relief May Turn to Grief," Feb. 24: Since the Los Angeles
district courts can't get their prosecutors to begin trial on time,
jeopardizing the efficient "one-trial" jury system, they should model
the behavior of the prosecutors and calculate how many jurors will
really be needed each day. So long as the prosecutors' collective
behavior is consistent (e.g., 20% postponement rate on Mondays and
Fridays, 8% on Tuesdays through Thursdays), a demand-supply model can
be developed.</LD>
<LD>   Similar to how the telephone networks determine capacity needs
based on consumers' phone usage behavior, the courts can collect
statistics over a period of time and generate a fudge factor that
will adjust for the number of prosecutors that day or week who will
request a delay in trial. The number of requested jurors multiplied
by the fudge factor gives the number of jurors really needed for that
day. Problem solved.</LD>
<LD>   Nicola J. Peill</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After having "served" 10 days and feeling like bored pieces of
meat, jurors are usually much less sympathetic to the problems the
courts have with delays of any kind, let alone prosecutorial delays.
The time for jury panels of six instead of 12 is long overdue, be it
for one day of service or three weeks of an indeterminate jury
service sentence.</TE>

this agency shielding him and thwarting our efforts? Why don't we

its operatives? Until all the terrorist networks and the agencies

<LD>Re "Land for Peace Is a Losing Trade," Commentary, Feb. 27: As Frank
Gaffney Jr. points out, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah's
proposal to normalize relations between Israel and all Arab nations
in the region in exchange for all land gained by Israel in the 1967
Six Day War is sure to be a deal where Israel gives up land and loses
all hope of lasting peace and security at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   What Abdullah offers is not his to give. Do you think Iraq will
abide by it? Will Syria dismantle the Hezbollah terrorists it
supports in Lebanon? Will Arafat honor the agreement three months
after Israel signs? After Arafat and Abdullah are gone, will their
successors treat the agreement like toilet paper or the newest
vantage point from which to go after more?</LD>
<LD>   Americans can answer these questions easily by asking themselves
if Iran remained our ally after we helped to ease the shah out of
power.</LD>
<TE>   For Israelis there is no guarantee in any agreement that they
cannot guarantee on their own, or without the staunch support of
another strong Western democracy, the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Schoenwald</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gaffney's argument of Israel's security is the same old tired
justification that Israel has used for over 30 years to illegally
occupy territory and violate Palestinian human rights. And, as he
stated, the international community has repeatedly condemned such
actions, yet to no avail. Israel pays lip service to the peace
process while not proactively doing anything to support it.</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, in no way justifies the terrorist acts of
desperate radicals who take the lives of innocent Israelis. But how
do we continue to justify supporting Israel's continued terrorist
behavior toward innocent Palestinians? I guess Israel's tactics of
killing and punishing innocent Palestinians are justified since
Israel is just protecting its security.</TE>
<TE>   While Gaffney characterizes Abdullah's plan as coming from his
need for a "charm offensive," he misses the point that without land,
a Palestinian home, there will be no peace; after all, in 1948 Israel
wanted a homeland and was given one, despite the Palestinians who
were occupying the land.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Lost Year," editorial, Feb. 25: I was a student at a
multitrack school, and losing a whole year of school really surprised
me. I already knew that we had fewer days in school but longer hours;
I never thought that in the long run it would add up to a year.</LD>
<LD>   This struggle to build new schools has been going on for years,
but I still see nothing happening. If the government really was
worried and concerned about the students, action should have taken
place right away. There is all this talk about a budget and having
enough funds to build new schools.</LD>
<LD>   The government should start to build now.</LD>

<HD>Consumers Not as Bubbly About Soft Drinks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soft drinks continue to lose their fizz among consumers as bottled
water and other noncarbonated drinks gain popularity.</LD>
<LD>   Growth in the U.S. carbonated soft drink industry was relatively
flat during 2001, and per-capita consumption of the bubbly beverages
fell for the third year in a row, according to reports released
Thursday by market research firms.</LD>
<LD>   Traditional cola drinks continue to dominate the soft drink aisle,
but shelf space is under assault by noncarbonated beverages,
including the fast-growing bottled water sector. Market leader
Coca-Cola Co.'s soft drink volume fell by 0.2% during 2001, while
archrival PepsiCo Inc. earned a 1.3% volume increase, according to
Beverage Digest, a Bedford Hills, N.Y.-based newsletter.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, Red Bull, an energy drink popular with younger
people, registered a 118.8% increase in volume.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pepsi's existing diet drinks registered gains, the
company drove additional sales with its new Mountain Dew Code Red and
Pepsi Twist beverages, according to Gary A. Hemphill, vice president
of Beverage Marketing Corp., a New York-based research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Though best known for their carbonated brands, the nation's two
leading beverage companies got a huge boost from noncarbonated
beverages. Pepsi's noncarbonated sales, including juices and the
fast-growing water sector, grew by 35%, while Coke's noncarbonated
sales rose by 23%, according to Beverage Marketing Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Water brands provided most of that lift.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to use a bad pun, but water clearly is draining volume from
some of the other carbonated categories," said John Sicher, editor
and publisher of Beverage Digest. "The carbonated soft drink market
grew by 0.6% in 2001, but we estimate growth in bottled water at
30%."</TE>
<TE>   The flagship cola brands--Coke Classic and Pepsi--still account
for a third of all carbonated drink sales. Add the diet equivalents,
and colas contribute half of the industry's sales. But cola companies
are scrambling to get a piece of the noncarbonated market. PepsiCo,
for example, markets the Aquafina brand, while Coca-Cola sells Dasani
bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   Water, the trendy Mountain Dew Code Red and a growing number of
juice and energy drinks are the beverage industry's response to the
increasingly diverse tastes of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   During the early 1990s, the carbonated beverage industry enjoyed
year-to-year growth in the 2% to 3% range. In recent years, however,
the cola companies have been broadening their offerings to generate
sales growth.</TE>

<HD>Urgent Action Sought on Piracy</HD>
<DH>Internet:  Entertainment execs ask Congress to set deadline
for standard in anti-copying technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Alarmed by rampant online pirating of music and videos, Hollywood
executives urged Congress on Thursday to set a deadline that would
force the bickering entertainment and electronics companies to
develop an anti-piracy standard--before the government does it for
them.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner and News Corp. President
Peter Chernin told the Senate Commerce Committee that their industry
is losing money to unscrupulous Internet users and professional
thieves who can make perfect digital copies of digital TV, film,
music and other works at the click of a computer mouse.</LD>
<LD>   "The pressure of a timeline for eventual government action is
critical to getting the private sector to do what is needed," Eisner
told the panel.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the committee's chairman, has
proposed setting a date by which Congress would require digital
device makers to install government-approved anti-copying
technologies. The government standard would go into effect if
industry executives fail to agree on an alternative protection
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Hill battle over a digital anti-piracy technology is
the latest fallout from Napster and other computer file-sharing
services, which have allowed Web surfers to copy music and videos for
free.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate that more than 1 million movie files are copied
daily online. The problem has mounted with the spread of personal
computers and a federal government mandate that the nation's
broadcasters transition to a digital broadcast system by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But finding a solution has not been easy, given that computer
users can make perfect digital copies of films and music and zap them
to millions of people around the world over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the entertainment and technology industries are
bitterly divided over whether to give consumers or producers the
power to decide what can and cannot be copied digitally. For years,
consumers with analog equipment such as audio and videotape recorders
have had the freedom to make personal copies of albums and videos.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer electronics industry argues that overly restrictive
digital anti-piracy methods could thwart innovation and dampen the
consumer market for digital fare. But entertainment companies insist
the protection is needed and have pushed without success for more
control over digital works.</TE>
<TE>   "Negotiations are at an impasse," News Corp.'s Chernin told the
Senate committee. "If we cannot arrive at a voluntary industry
consensus very soon, broadcasters will be forced to ask for
legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Legislation may not be a panacea, however. Many technology experts
believe it is virtually impossible to develop a mass-market digital
anti-piracy technology that can't be defeated by computer experts or
hobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   "The perfect copy protection technology doesn't exist," said
Edward W. Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton
University. Felten, who attended Thursday's hearing and is an expert
on anti-piracy technologies, said the Internet and personal computers
are so flexible that they can be easily modified to circumvent most
digital anti-copying methods.</TE>
<TE>   If an accord between Hollywood and Silicon Valley is reached,
entertainment executives said they would be more willing to supply
high-quality digital fare. Experts say that would help accelerate
adoption of two key Information Age technologies: high-speed Internet
access and digital television.</TE>
<TE>   But many consumer groups as well as some politicians, oppose a
government-mandated anti-piracy standard, saying it could erode
long-held consumer rights--such as privacy and the fair use of
copyrighted material.</TE>
<TE>   "Copy protection must be effective ... but it must permit
consumers to continue to make recordings for their personal use
within their homes just as they have come to expect in the analog
world since the advent of the VCR," said written testimony by James
E. Meyer, an executive with Thomson Multimedia, RCA's parent company.</TE>

<HD>Skilling Involved, Enron Execs Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling oversaw the
reorganization of partnerships that figured in the energy trader's
bankruptcy, company officers told an internal review team.</LD>
<LD>   Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer, and other
executives told  members of Enron's board of directors that they kept
Skilling briefed on their efforts to salvage the finances of the four
so-called Raptor partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   The interviews, which were released by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, flesh out the conclusions of the board's Feb.2
report that said Skilling bore some responsibility for Enron's filing
the largest bankruptcy in history two months earlier.</LD>
<TE>   In two appearances before Congress, Skilling, who resigned as CEO
Aug. 14 after six months in the job, has said he relied on the advice
of Causey and auditors from Andersen in managing the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "My only recollection of the restructuring of the Raptors is that
I was told they were restructuring the Raptors," he told the Senate
Commerce Committee on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked if the accountants signed off and if it looked OK, and I
was told it was and went along with it," Skilling said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, documents disclosed that the government's top
energy regulator met with senior Enron executives last fall and
received a phone call from Enron's chairman, continuing a series of
contacts that began when he was head of Texas' public utility
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick H. Wood III, appointed by President Bush to head the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in August, told a lawmaker
Thursday that he first met then-Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in May
1996 at a meeting of the Governor's Business Council in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Between March 1997 and January 2001, Wood said, he had contacts
with Lay, Skilling and Enron Chief of Staff Steve Kean, who visited
Wood's office at the utility commission in January 1998, according to
documents released Thursday at the request of Rep. Henry A. Waxman
(D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   In all, Wood listed nine contacts with Enron executives. He also
listed a failed Nov. 8 attempt by Lay to reach him, which appeared to
have been a call to inform Wood of the proposed merger with Dynegy
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, congressional Democrats proposed legislation to
forbid accounting firms from providing consulting services for audit
clients, make them keep records longer and increase their liability
in shareholder suits.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation sponsored by Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) also would
establish a new accounting industry oversight board. The measure is
more extensive, he said, than a competing proposal by House
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an opportunity to adopt serious reforms to correct the
weaknesses that are undermining confidence in our capital markets,"
LaFalce, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services
Committee, said.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican and Democratic proposals come as Congress
investigates the bankruptcy of Enron and the role of Andersen, its
former auditor, in reviewing affiliated partnerships that played a
role in the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators said they are close to a deal with
Enron to allow public disclosure of the energy trader's tax records.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, expected before week's end, would clear the way for the
Senate Finance Committee to step up its investigation of whether
Enron improperly avoided paying federal income taxes or exploited tax
loopholes that may need to be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press, Bloomberg News and Reuters were used in
compiling this report.</TE>

<LD>Global Crossing Ltd.'s Asian unit, the company's most valuable
operation, is struggling with financial woes that could threaten the
bankruptcy reorganization of its parent.</LD>
<LD>   Asia Global Crossing, which is 59% owned by Global Crossing, saw
its stock delisted Thursday by the New York Stock Exchange, a day
after a major downgrade of its debt by Standard &amp; Poors Corp.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the company warned that its auditor, Andersen, will
probably express "substantial doubt" about the company's ability to
remain in business. On Wall Street, that pronouncement often is seen
as a precursor to a serious development, such as a bankruptcy or
buyout.</LD>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing is trying desperately to raise money. The
company said Tuesday that it expects to report a "material loss" for
2001, and that it may have to write down the value of some of its
assets.</TE>
<TE>   Its cash crunch significantly worsened in December, after Global
Crossing refused to honor its pledge to provide a $400-million line
of credit. In January, Asia Global hired financial advisor Lazard
Freres to drum up potential suitors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have already received a number of inquiries from potential
investors," said interim Chief Executive Jack Scanlon.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers, including other telecommunications companies, financiers
and investors, "are looking at this and saying this could be a heck
of a steal," said Sanjay Jindal of Chanin Capital Partners, a Los
Angeles investment banking house that is advising the unsecured
creditors committee in the Global Crossing bankruptcy. Potential
deals could include the entire company or parts of it.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe Global Crossing's most valuable asset is its
stake in Asia Global Crossing, which is smaller, but operates
fiber-optic lines in the Far East, where there is less competition
and more potential for growth.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global's problems were anticipated by the two Asian companies
that have a pending bid to acquire a 79% stake in Global Crossing for
$750 million. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. in Hong Kong and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia would have to be satisfied with the status of
Asia Global Crossing and any restructuring of the operation, Jindal
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're smart buyers," he said. "They know that one business is
dependent on the other, and they want all the pieces to stay whole."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison and SingTech  have participated in partnerships with
Asia Global Crossing. Their bid for Global Crossing is expected to be
followed by others.</TE>
<TE>   The two firms are inextricably linked by Global Crossing's
majority ownership, but they also share office space in Beverly
Hills, have overlapping boards of directors, and, at one point last
year, the companies shared a CEO.</TE>
<TE>   The two firms proposed a merger, but the idea was quashed in
November amid concerns the relatively healthier Asia Global Crossing
would be hurt by the marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing has been tainted by allegations that its
parent company used misleading accounting methods to boost revenue.
The accusations have been aimed primarily at parent Global Crossing,
but Asia Global Crossing used the same accounting methods and is
under suspicion too.</TE>

<HD>Leiner to Lighten Massive Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squeezed by a mountain of debt and shrinking sales and profit,
Carson-based Leiner Health Products Inc., one of the world's largest
vitamin and supplement makers, filed Thursday for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   The company's filing in Bankruptcy Court in Delaware listed assets
of $353.1 million and debts of $493.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   The privately held company said it is in discussions to lighten
its massive debt load by persuading bondholders to swap $85 million
in senior subordinated notes for $15 million in cash and preferred
stock. In addition, a group of investors led by North Castle
Partners, which holds a controlling interest in the firm, has agreed
to invest an additional $20 million in the company.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Kaminski, chief executive of Leiner, said the vitamin maker
was carrying too much debt in a market hamstrung by slow growth,
eroding profit margins and burgeoning competition.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of price pressure in our industry," Kaminski
said. "A lot of it is due to overcapacity."</TE>
<TE>   David Coles, Leiner's chief restructuring officer, described the
reorganization plan as a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy that has
already won the support of the company's major creditors. The
Bankruptcy Court must approve the plan. Still, Coles said he
anticipates Leiner will emerge from Chapter 11 within 45 to 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   The Chapter 11 filing comes on the heels of a major restructuring
at Leiner last year that saw the vitamin maker fire 800
employees--about one-quarter of them in California--and shutter three
manufacturing facilities in Florida, Michigan and Canada. The company
currently employs 2,000 workers. Locally, the company maintains its
headquarters, a research center and a packaging plant in Carson,
along with a tablet-making facility in Garden Grove and a vitamin E
soft gel plant in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   For the most recent quarter ended in December, Leiner posted
revenue of $146.4 million, down 8.2% from the same quarter in 2000.
Net income was $11.1 million, down 15.6% from the same quarter in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Leiner, along with many of its competitors, has been hammered by a
slowdown in the $17.6-billion U.S. market for vitamins, minerals,
herbs and other supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers said the slowdown has been particularly hard on
Leiner because of its huge debt load and concentration in mass-market
retailers, where the price pressure has been the most intense.
Likewise, the company's mainstay products are basic vitamins, a
segment that grew a sluggish 1% to 2% last year, according to Patrick
Rea, research director for the San Diego-based Nutrition Business
Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain categories such as sports nutrition and weight-loss
products are growing strongly," Rea said. "But that's not Leiner's
main business."</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Pressed to Prosecute French Bank</HD>
<DH>Insurance: State officials don't want Credit Lyonnais to
get off with fine in alleged fraud involving Executive Life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's attorney general and insurance commissioner are urging
U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to pursue criminal charges against
Credit Lyonnais, amid signs that the French bank may be near an
accord to avoid indictment for its allegedly fraudulent purchase of
the failed Executive Life Insurance Co.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, which was partially controlled by the French government
at the time, is accused in lawsuits of hiding behind front businesses
to illegally acquire the assets of Executive Life in 1993, making a
profit of at least $2 billion. Federal law at that time barred banks
from owning insurance companies. A separate California law still on
the books prohibits foreign ownership of insurers.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials are weighing the year-old
recommendation of the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles that the bank and
its affiliates be indicted on fraud, conspiracy and other charges.
The bank's license to operate in the U.S. also hangs in the balance.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department has refused to comment, and Credit Lyonnais
has denied reports in the French press that a deal is in the works
that would allow the bank to avoid criminal indictment in lieu of a
fine of $50 million to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal would amount to a "slap on the wrist," California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and Insurance Commissioner Harry Low wrote in
a letter sent to Ashcroft late Wednesday. "We disagree with any such
settlement."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer and Low are pursuing separate lawsuits against the bank
and its French affiliates seeking more than $2 billion in damages on
behalf of 330,000 policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   Legal sources familiar with the case said Thursday that the
Justice Department appears to be nearing a deal to resolve the
investigation after weeks of meetings between lawyers for the Justice
Department and Credit Lyonnais.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides are considering a deal that would include a fine
against the bank of up to $100 million and criminal charges against
at least one senior executive--but not the bank itself, according to
a lawyer familiar with the case who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   An official close to Credit Lyonnais who asked not to be
identified said, "There's no deal."</TE>
<TE>   George Terwilliger, a prominent Washington attorney representing
the bank, declined to comment on the status of the negotiations. But
he accused Lockyer and Low of putting pressure on the Justice
Department to "rescue their own floundering civil claims."</TE>
<TE>   "California sees an opportunity to enrich itself at the expense of
the taxpayers of France," said Terwilliger.</TE>
<TE>   Terwilliger said Credit Lyonnais did nothing wrong. Policyholders
were victimized not by Credit Lyonnais, he said, but by failed
regulatory policies that allowed the previous owners to invest
excessively in junk bonds and "drive them to ruin."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has never prosecuted a rehabilitated U.S. bank
for crimes committed by the management prior to rehabilitation,
because such a prosecution puts at risk the great public investment
that has been made in the rescue," he said. "Why punish an
institution that isn't really the wrongdoer? What good is
accomplished from that?"</TE>
<TE>   But in their letter to Ashcroft, Lockyer and Low suggested that
federal prosecutors and the FBI have obtained evidence they believe
would "undermine the arguments made by Credit Lyonnais and the bank's
American lobbyists that the bank's current management has
rehabilitated the bank."</TE>
<TE>   The question of what to do with the Credit Lyonnais probe has
provoked heated debate within the Justice Department for months,
fueled by the political sensitivities surrounding the case.
Department officials have assured Democrats in Congress, fearful of a
watered-down settlement, that they will decide the case based on a
careful, fair evaluation. But prosecutors have been unwilling to
discuss their deliberations in detail. The Justice Department refused
comment Thursday on the case or on the letter from Lockyer and Low.</TE>
<TE>   Former Executive Life policyholders allege they have suffered more
than $4 billion in losses and have asked Ashcroft for a meeting.
California Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and Howard L. Berman
(D-Mission Hills) sent a letter last week urging Ashcroft to listen
to the policyholders and share evidence with state investigators.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Drop Despite Positive Economic Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended a seesaw session on the downside Thursday as broad
market indexes ended their worst month since September.</LD>
<LD>   Positive economic news, including a report showing the U.S.
economy grew much faster than expected in the last three months of
last year, lifted the market in early trading. Upbeat remarks from
manufacturing heavyweights such as General Electric also helped boost
the blue-chip sector.</LD>
<LD>   But questions about the strength of the economy's anticipated
comeback, along with persistent jitters about corporate accounting,
tempered investors' enthusiasm. A dull financial forecast from
Genesis Microchip and a warning from computer maker Gateway cast a
pall over technology stocks.</LD>
<TE>   "Investors are fairly confident that there could be some recovery,
certainly in the blue-chip stocks and the traditional economy," said
Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView. "What is less
certain to them is what it means for technology, because the valley
in technology seems much deeper."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 21.45 points, or
0.2%, at 10,106.13, after rising as high as 10,238. The broader
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 3.16 points, or 0.3%, to
1,106.73. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 20.39
points, or 1.2%, to 1,731.49.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, but
losers held the upper hand by a 6-to-5 margin on Nasdaq. Volume was
moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq fell 10.5% in February--its worst monthly loss since a 17%
drop in September, when it slumped to three-year lows after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.1%, also its worst monthly
loss since September. But the Dow rose 1.9% in February.</TE>
<TE>   The leading indexes dipped after rumors of a possible hijacking of
a New York-bound Air India flight, which reawakened memories of the
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. U.S. law enforcement
officials later denied there was any fear of a hijacking, and the
plane landed safely.</TE>
<TE>   Semiconductor stocks fell after a report late Wednesday showed
sales of microchip-making gear tumbled 41% last year, posting a
bigger drop than the preliminary statistics released in December.</TE>
<TE>   Chip maker Intel fell $1.34 to $28.55 on Thursday, and the SOX
semiconductor index lost more than 3%.</TE>
<TE>   In other tech woes, Genesis Microchip plunged $17.51 to $23.49, or
nearly 43%, after the display technology company's financial forecast
showed no boost to results from a recent acquisition. Gateway fell 50
cents to $4.60 after the company warned of a wider-than-expected
first-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   Software maker PeopleSoft fell $2.77 to $29.07 on reports that the
Securities and Exchange Commission may be investigating the company.
PeopleSoft said it is unaware of any SEC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dow, American Express gained 68 cents to $36.45, while
Citigroup rose $1.01 to $45.25.</TE>
<TE>   GE, which said it sees stronger 2002 revenue than forecast, rose
to a session high of $39.62, but finished off 25 cents at $38.50.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury securities suffered as the day's economic news induced
fixed-income traders to seek corporate bonds. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.88% from 4.83% on
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Pirates Make New Use of Old Technology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While record companies and  film studios train their legal fire on
Internet file-sharing networks such as Napster and Morpheus, online
pirates have been making heavy use of a 14-year-old technology
invented to help far-flung researchers gather online to chat.</LD>
<LD>   Internet Relay Chat has become the tool of choice for many
consumers who make unauthorized copies of music, movies, pictures,
books and software online. Taking advantage of ultra-fast Internet
connections at universities and corporations, pirates use IRC
channels to distribute increasingly high-quality copies of
films--including some apparently made from the studios'
high-definition masters.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Jacobsen, director of worldwide anti-piracy efforts for the
Motion Picture Assn. of America, said his organization has yet to sue
anyone using the channels but has referred some of the evidence it's
gathered to law enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   The switch to IRC demonstrates the fluid nature of piracy on the
Internet. As copyright holders start to rein in one illegal
distribution channel, others steam ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Internet Relay Chat hasn't attracted a mainstream audience because
it's much harder to use than such wildly popular file-sharing
services as Morpheus and the free version of Napster. Users must find
and sign on to a channel, then use specific and not necessarily
intuitive commands to search for and download files.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, IRC has become a rich source for a variety of
published material, including movies that have yet to be released
commercially on VHS or DVD. Some of these files come from camcorders
sneaked into a cinema and pointed at the screen, but others are
"ripped" from DVDs sent by studios to film industry professionals
voting on the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Forest, an online piracy expert at consulting firm KPE, said
he's recently started seeing extremely high-quality movie files on
IRC channels, offering more picture detail than the files made from
DVDs. These include copies of movies yet to be released on DVD, such
as "A Beautiful Mind" and "Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   He speculated that the source was someone with access to the film
libraries of the major studios.</TE>
<TE>   Vidius Inc., an Internet security company, has found a handful of
extremely high-quality movie files on IRC channels that apparently
leaked out of an editing or mastering house, said Derek Broes,
Vidius' chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen said he hadn't heard any reports of high-definition
movies making their way onto IRC. But noting how large such files
would be--about 1.5 gigabytes, or 500 times the size of an MP3 music
file--he said, "There's very few people that are going to be able to
download it."</TE>
<TE>   In a related issue, the Morpheus peer-to-peer network remained out
of commission Thursday, two days after it inexplicably collapsed.
Steve Griffin, chief executive of Morpheus' parent company, said the
company hoped to have new software by the end of the week that would
enable users to resume their file sharing.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to hear a motion by
Morpheus' lawyers Monday to dismiss part of the copyright
infringement lawsuit brought against the company by studios and
record labels.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to seeking legal remedies, studios and record
companies have been slowly developing legitimate, fee-based
alternatives to the free sources of music and movies online. Sony
Music Entertainment on Thursday became the first major record company
to strike a deal with a file-sharing service, giving CenterSpan
Communications permission to distribute encrypted songs by Sony
artists.</TE>
<TE>   CenterSpan is a wholesaler, selling other companies a secure
peer-to-peer network that lets subscribers copy music and movie files
from each other's computers. The company agreed to pay Sony at least
$2 million over the next two years, give it about 5% of CenterSpan's
stock and provide warrants for roughly 3% more.</TE>
<TE>   Although the deal is effective immediately, CenterSpan has yet to
find any buyers for its peer-to-peer technology. By contrast, Napster
Inc. has already started trials with its new, secure peer-to-peer
network but hasn't won any deals yet.</TE>

<LD>Lillian Vernon, who got her start in 1951 selling purses and belts
through a magazine ad and became a household name with 169 million
copies of catalogs mailed each year, said that she plans to step
aside as the day-to-day leader of her company.</LD>
<LD>   Rye, N.Y.-based Lillian Vernon Corp. said its founder would
relinquish her role as chief executive when a replacement is found.
Vernon, 74, will continue as chairwoman of the company, known for its
moderately priced house, garden and children's products.</LD>
<LD>   Vernon will turn her attention to licensing the Lillian Vernon
name.</LD>
<TE>   "Licensing is such a natural thing for us, when you think of how
Martha Stewart has licensed her name," said David Hochberg, Lillian
Vernon vice president and son of the founder. "Our name is equally
renowned to the consumers of America."</TE>
<TE>   The firm also said it will end its quarterly dividend, which
already had been cut in half in December to 4 cents per quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Lillian Vernon fell 15 cents to close at $6.70 on the
American Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Chiron Wins Approval For Early AIDS Screen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chiron Corp. said U.S. regulators approved its test for early
detection in donated blood of the viruses that cause AIDS and
hepatitis C.</LD>
<LD>   The system, called Procleix, has been used, at cost, to screen
about 70% of the nation's blood supply since 1999. The formal Food
and Drug Administration approval will allow the company to charge its
full price of $10 to $15 per donation, a spokesman for Emeryville,
Calif.-based Chiron said.</LD>
<LD>   The nucleic acid test narrows the window between infection and
detectable virus levels to 11 days from the 16-day gap with the p24
antigen test and the 22-day window with earlier antibody tests.</LD>
<TE>   The company had expected the test to be approved by the FDA last
year, and the delay led some analysts to reevaluate price targets for
Chiron's shares. Shares of Chiron stock rose $1.79 to close at $43.42
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge dismissed lawsuits brought by Ecuador, Belize and
Honduras seeking to hold U.S. tobacco companies liable for tax
revenue allegedly lost as a result of cigarette smuggling, a Philip
Morris Cos. executive said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are pleased that the court dismissed these lawsuits in
accordance with long-standing principles followed in this country and
throughout the world," said William Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris
associate general counsel.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami based his ruling on a
well-established legal doctrine known as the Revenue Rule.</LD>
<TE>   "Though the complaint is pleaded under federal and state law
causes, the substance of the claim is to enforce Ecuadorean tax laws.
This is precisely the type of meddling in foreign affairs the Revenue
Rule prohibits," the judge said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., the largest U.S. maker of recreational
vehicles, said its fiscal third-quarter loss narrowed as sales rose.
The company doesn't expect a profit this quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The loss in the quarter ended Jan. 27 narrowed to $17.3 million
from $205 million, or $6.26 a share, in the year-earlier period,
including one-time charges. The maker of Pace Arrow motor homes and
Coleman folding trailers said the exchange of convertible bonds in
the last quarter put earnings at 31 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 1.5% to $522.4 million. The company replaced its
chairman and its chief executive this month after seven quarters of
losses, while rivals Thor Industries Inc. and Winnebago Industries
Inc. said sales and orders rose.</LD>
<TE>   Fleetwood shares fell 37 cents to $9.98 on the NYSE. The stock has
declined 17% in the last 12 months.</TE>

<LD>Discount chain Target Corp. and apparel retailers Limited Inc. and
Intimate Brands Inc. reported higher profits for their fiscal fourth
quarter, but all three sounded a cautionary note about doing business
in the wobbly U.S. economy in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Target said it would meet or possibly exceed Wall Street estimates
of $1.75 a share for 2002 unless the economy weakens significantly;
Limited and Intimate Brands forecast flat first-quarter earnings.</LD>

worse as consumers cut back on holiday purchases of high-end goods.</LD>
<TE>   Target said earnings rose 19% to $658 million, or 72 cents a

grew 7.4% to $13.24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Limited's net income jumped 37% to $326.5 million, or 75 cents a
share, even as sales declined 11% to $3.14 billion. Intimate Brands,
which is 84%-owned by Limited, said profit surged 76% to $299.9
million, or 61 cents a share. At Neiman Marcus, earnings dropped 40%
to $24 million, or 51 cents a share, as revenue slipped 1.7% to $908
million. Tiffany's net income was down 2% to $82.7 million, or 55

<HD>SAG Confirms It Hired Former Clinton Staffers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Underscoring the high stakes involved in its new agreement governing
relations with agents, the Screen Actors Guild on Thursday confirmed
that two former Clinton administration strategists are working for
the union as consultants on the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Crisis experts Mark Fabiani and Christopher Lehane were hired in
January to consult for the union in case either an impasse or
agreement was reached, SAG said. SAG and the agents struck a
tentative deal over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The SAG proposal would allow limited investments in talent
agencies by advertising firms and advertisers, although it has yet to
be approved by SAG directors and members. Presidential candidate
Valerie Harper opposes the deal, but her opponent, SAG President
Melissa Gilbert, supports it. Fabiani and Lehane worked in the White
House counsel's office, with Fabiani serving as one of Clinton's most
visible defenders during the Whitewater and Monica S. Lewinsky
investigations. Lehane is a onetime press secretary for former Vice
President Al Gore.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, SAG, seeking to bolster support for the deal, said its
studies show that 3,000 jobs for its members would be created over
five years by a provision requiring agents to make sure that foreign
productions employ actors under their SAG contracts.</TE>

<HD>Toyota Targets Youth With New Scion Brand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., unable to command the respect among young
car buyers enjoyed by competitors such as Honda and Mitsubishi, will
begin marketing a line of youth-oriented vehicles in the United
States as early as next year under the Scion brand name.</LD>
<LD>   The Torrance-based U.S. arm of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.
confirmed the new name Thursday, saying that it will give Toyota a
chance to approach the youth market with a fresh new image.</LD>
<LD>   Although Toyota is the biggest import brand and the fourth-largest
car brand overall in the U.S., its vehicles generally are thought of
as mainstream cars and trucks and have little appeal to buyers under
30. The company isn't alone in eyeing the large and growing youth
market but is unique in starting a new brand to serve it.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts generally applauded the move, saying Toyota needs to push
for a younger audience and is big enough in the U.S. to support a
third brand to go with its mainstream Toyota and luxury Lexus
marques.</TE>
<TE>   "They are like General Motors Corp. was 10 years ago, viewed as an
old people's brand," said Brett Smith, senior auto industry analyst
at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Separating the Toyota name from the company's youth marketing effort
is a smart move, Smith said. As Toyota, "they just don't have the
image, the cachet, in the youth market that Honda does."</TE>
<TE>   Toyota executives refused to discuss specifics of the company's
youth initiative, saying plans will be revealed next month at the New
York Auto Show. Toyota spokesman John Hanson did say Thursday that
establishing the Scion brand is part of an effort to build and sell
new types of inexpensive, youth-oriented vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Industry insiders say Toyota intends to use Scion to bring into
the U.S. the kinds of small cars and vans that sell well in Japan and
Europe but have not found a place here so far. Among them, insiders
say, will be a boxy four-door wagon-cum-van sold in Japan as the
bB--the initials stand for black box--and a sporty five-door sedan
called the WiLL that has been shown in the U.S. as a concept car but
has been sold in Japan since last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota also is expected to give Scion several new versions of the
Echo subcompact sedan it introduced in the U.S. as a 2000 model. One
of those could be the Yaris hatchback sold throughout Europe. The
Echo, which has failed to set sales charts afire, was part of a trio
of Toyotas, including the Celica and the Prius gas-electric hybrid,
that the company had hoped would start drawing young buyers into its
showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the average Toyota buyer is 48 while the industry average
is 47, said Jim Hossack, senior consultant at AutoPacific Inc. The
average Echo buyer is 43, he said. The average Honda Civic buyer is
37. Volkswagen's Jetta claims one of the youngest buyer groups with
an average age of 32.</TE>
<TE>   Because cars sold under the Scion name will be low-volume,
low-profit vehicles, Toyota isn't expected to make dealers who want
to carry the line build expensive, stand-alone facilities as GM did
when it launched the Saturn brand in 1990. Instead, it is likely that
Toyota dealers that also carry Scion will display the cars in a
separate area of their showrooms and on a separate part of their
lots. There might even be a separate entrance to the Scion section of
a dealership.</TE>

<HD>Universal Studying Park for Germany</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Site would give company another foothold in
a market dominated by rival Disney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Studios, encouraged by the success of its theme parks in
Spain and Japan, said Thursday it is exploring building a theme park
in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   The company, a division of France-based Vivendi Universal,
launched a feasibility study last month for a theme park near the
western German city of Krefeld, said Recreation Group spokesman Jim
Yeager. But Universal officials declined to discuss details.</LD>
<LD>   Yeager also dismissed a report that Universal has agreed to buy
land for the park from steel giant ThyssenKrupp, saying any purchase
would be contingent on the outcome of the six-month study.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an ideal location," Wilfried Hampe, a German investor and
consultant in the project, told Reuters. "There are 27 million people
within two hours' drive of it. Neither Paris nor London can match
that."</TE>
<TE>   If built, the park would give Vivendi another foothold in a market
dominated by Walt Disney Co., which in two weeks will open a second
theme park at Disneyland Paris.</TE>
<TE>   As the domestic theme park industry matures, entertainment giants
such as Disney and Vivendi are seeking out foreign locales to expand
their businesses, analysts say. Both companies opened theme parks in
Japan last year and are studying various sites for theme parks in
mainland China. Disney also is building a theme park in Hong Kong,
set to open by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed German theme park would be Universal's third overseas
and its second in Europe. Universal also operates a park outside
Barcelona, Spain, which drew about 3.3 million visitors last year.
And in Japan, Universal's new $1.4-billion theme park in Osaka has
been drawing 1 million visitors a month, bolstering support within
Vivendi Universal to expand its theme park business.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. [theme park] market is flat, if that, and the growth in
the entertainment business has to go elsewhere," said Steve Baker, a
theme park industry consultant in Orlando. But Universal officials
said the German project was not definite and the company also was
studying other sites in Europe and Asia for possible new theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   If Universal goes ahead with the park, it probably would seek out
local partners, as it has done in Japan and Spain. Universal owns 24%
of the Japanese park and a 37% interest in the one in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the German park would be movie-themed, but probably
not on the scale of the $1-billion-plus Universal theme parks in
Hollywood and Orlando, Fla.</TE>

<HD>IRS to Increase Number of Audits</HD>
<DH>Government: Agency chief tells lawmakers he hopes to
reverse a decline in taxpayer scrutiny that may be fueling an
epidemic of cheating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The IRS will audit significantly more Americans over the next three
years as the agency tries to reverse a decline in taxpayer scrutiny
that officials fear is fueling an epidemic of tax cheating, lawmakers
were told Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   To achieve that goal, the IRS has added more than 1,000 collection
agents and examiners and revamped its procedures, IRS Commissioner
Charles O. Rossotti told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Rossotti said he expects the changes to begin bearing fruit this
year.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that compliance activity levels will increase over the
next three years," Rossotti testified, referring to the number of
audits and collection actions the agency conducts.</TE>
<TE>   "We will also be able to better identify and focus on key
compliance problem areas."</TE>
<TE>   Rossotti, who plans to leave the Internal Revenue Service in
November when his five-year term expires, didn't provide an estimate
of how many more audits will be conducted in coming years. However, a
return to historical audit rates would mean hundreds of thousands
more Americans would be audited each year.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of so-called field audits--the in-depth face-to-face
examinations designed to catch tax cheats--continued to fall last
year, reaching an all-time low.</TE>
<TE>   The number of all audits conducted by the IRS actually rose
slightly last year when compared with 2000, but was still down by
more than half from 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is so critical to where we are fiscally in this
country," said subcommittee member Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). "We have
cut audit rates very substantially to the point where 99% of filers
figure they aren't going to get audited."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has been cutting audits for years in response to budget
reductions imposed by Congress in the mid-1990s, when the tax agency
fumbled efforts to modernize its technology and began attracting
harsh criticism over its mistreatment of taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The abuses led to a series of reforms, including a sweeping public
apology by senior IRS officials in 1998 for violating federal law by
dunning individuals for taxes that were not even owed.</TE>
<TE>   But no restrictions were placed on the number or scope of audits
and the continuing decline in such examinations appears to be eroding
tax compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Rossotti said Thursday that underreporting of income and
fabrication of deductions costs the Treasury an estimated $250
billion annually, up from an estimate of $195 billion made in 1998
and $170 billion in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The total number of audits conducted in 2001 was 731,756, down
from 1.9 million in 1996. The audit rate--the percentage of taxpayers
who are audited--fell during the same period from 1.7% of all
taxpayers to 0.6%. The number of field audits fell to 202,515 last
year, down 20% from the year before and off 73% since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   As manpower dwindled, the IRS increasingly has come to rely on
so-called correspondence audits. These reviews are done completely by
mail and deal primarily with such problems as math errors and failing
to report easily identified income.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to reverse the naggingly low audit rate, the agency
hired 568 collection agents and 733 tax examiners last year.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't boost the 2001 audit rate because some people were
hired late in the year and had to be trained before they were sent
out into the field, Rossotti said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time in six years that we were able to
replenish these critical compliance positions," Rossotti said. "The
full effect of these new workers will not be felt until fiscal 2002."</TE>
<TE>   News of the promised increase in audits comes only six weeks after
the IRS said it is reviving the old, dreaded line-by-line "taxpayer
compliance" audits.</TE>
<TE>   Rossotti said these compliance audits, which have been revamped to
be somewhat less onerous, are necessary to identify areas of
widespread cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the IRS and the Treasury Department announced the
formation of a joint task force dedicated to the earned income tax
credit, a tax break for the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   A Treasury study found that nearly one-third of the $31.3 billion
in earned-income-tax-credit refunds sent out for the 1999 tax
year--between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion annually--shouldn't have
been paid.</TE>
<TE>   The largest amount of bogus claims related to taxpayers claiming
children that did not qualify for credits under the program,
sometimes because they lived with another, higher-income parent,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   So-called overclaims reflect just a portion of the problem,
however. Rossotti said that about 4 million individuals who could
claim the earned income tax credit don't.</TE>
<TE>   The agency believes the credit is so complex and cumbersome that
many taxpayers simply err.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 tax law simplified some of the rules, and the IRS is
getting better at catching errors because it recently implemented a
data sharing program where it gets information about child custody
from the Federal Case Registry, Rossotti told the subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   However, the IRS-Treasury task force intends to look for
additional ways to improve the accuracy of the program for the earned
income tax credit, while reducing the complexity.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we can make some administrative changes to improve the
program, but it may require legislative changes as well," Rossotti
testified.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective is to see whether there's a better way to
supplement the income of low-income taxpayers through the income tax
system."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS in the past has been criticized for picking on
lower-income taxpayers, and subcommittee members warned Rossotti that
the agency's revitalized enforcement efforts shouldn't be focused
solely on catching lower-income tax cheats.</TE>

<HD>Enron Shareholders' Law Firm May Have Conflict in Andersen
Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Courts: Milberg Weiss could run into ethical trouble in
settling multiple class-action cases against the auditor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The law firm suing Andersen for its botched audit of Enron Corp. may
have a conflict of interest because it is also involved in four other
large suits in which Andersen is a named or likely defendant,
according to legal experts.</LD>
<LD>   Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach, the veteran shareholder
litigator, was named as the lead attorney representing the investors
who lost money in the Enron meltdown. Milberg also plays a role in
other class-action suits against Andersen for its accounting or audit
work involving Global Crossing Ltd., McKesson HBOC Inc., Hub Group
Inc. and Prudential Securities Inc.</LD>
<LD>   This potential conflict gained significance over the last week as
Andersen began settlement discussions with plaintiffs in Enron and an
unrelated case--and as the huge size of the potential settlements has
become apparent, according to legal experts.</LD>
<TE>   Milberg, the subject of an unrelated Los Angeles federal grand
jury probe that is examining whether the firm paid people to serve as
plaintiffs in shareholder class-action suits, did not return calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm took center stage in the Enron-Andersen case last
month when a Houston judge named the University of California system
the lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit. As the university's
attorney, Milberg became the chief law firm in the case, an enviable
position among numerous law firms looking to collect lucrative
billings from the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Milberg's experience as a class-action litigator was
praised by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon when she selected the
UC system as the lead plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   "In reviewing the extensive briefing submitted regarding the lead
plaintiff/lead counsel selection, the court has found that the
submissions of [Milberg] stand out in the breadth and depth of its
research and insight," Harmon wrote in her decision.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system said it was comfortable with Milberg's role in the
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen has a complex insurance policy for separate claims in
separate years," said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the UC system.
"Also, there has been no demonstration that Andersen does not have
the financial wherewithal to pay the claims."</TE>
<TE>   Davis declined to discuss the status of settlement negotiations
with Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   However, an attorney for another law firm involved in the Enron
negotiations told The Times that Andersen has broached a settlement
that would range from $600 million to $800 million. Other news
reports peg an initial offer at $750 million--$250 million from
insurance and five annual $100-million payments.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm, declined to
discuss its settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suits' Class-Action</TE>
<TE>   Nature a Factor</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Andersen is in settlement negotiations with Arizona
officials seeking to collect $600 million in the failure of an
investment fund operated by the Baptist Foundation of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   That case is scheduled to go to trial Monday but could be settled
for "several hundred million dollars" before then, according to an
individual familiar with the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials declined to discuss the settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these classes have interests that are adverse to each
other because of the limited amount of funds available for
settlements or judgments," said Dan Klerman, a USC law school
professor.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, a legal ethicist at the USC law school, said
that Milberg might not have a conflict at the start of its five
Andersen cases but that a potential ethical problem arises as it
enters settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney, he said, might ask for so much money in the first
case to be settled that there isn't enough for the second, third or
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The reverse also could be true. An attorney might not negotiate as
hard in the first case, hoping to leave money for the subsequent
cases. Yet in each case, the attorney is obligated to get the best
deal for the different clients.</TE>
<TE>   The class-action nature of the lawsuits complicates the issue,
said Martin Zohn, an attorney at Proskauer Rose in Century City.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were representing private parties, they would explain to
each that there is a competition for the same assets," Zohn said.
"The problem in this instance is that there are large public classes
rather than individuals, and that makes that sort of communication
much more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for lawyers to have multiple lawsuits against a
defendant. Some lawyers have filed 100 or more lawsuits against Ford
Motor Co. related to the Explorer sport-utility vehicle rollover and
Firestone tire controversies. Yet because of the auto maker's deep
pockets, no one has suggested that those attorneys have ethical
conflicts in serving multiple clients.</TE>
<TE>   What is different with the Milberg cases, the legal experts said,
is that real potential exists for Andersen to run out of funds, file
for bankruptcy or go out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials have declined to discuss their finances but
have said they intend to remain in business.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one attorney involved in the Enron case labeled
Andersen's recent settlement efforts as a "save-the-company
initiative."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm figures that if it doesn't get out from under
Enron's cloud, it will become increasingly difficult to retain its
staff and its clients, especially over the next several months, a
period when many U.S. companies select their auditors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Accounting Firm</TE>
<TE>   Has Few Hard Assets</TE>
<TE>   Andersen already is losing clients. Over the last three months,
Andersen has lost 32 audit clients and gained five for a net decline
of 27, according to Auditor-Trak, a service of Atlanta-based
Strafford Publications. During the same period a year ago, it had a
net loss of 16 clients.</TE>
<TE>   A professional services firm such as Andersen has comparatively
few hard assets that could be attached to pay a judgment or
settlement, said Zohn, a bankruptcy attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Any funds for a settlement or judgment would come from its $250
million in insurance, its future earnings and partners who could be
charged an assessment because of the firm's legal structure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Added Element</TE>
<TE>   of Gamesmanship</TE>
<TE>   John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor, said the
combined liability of the lawsuits against Andersen could reach
beyond its ability to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "While this has not been clearly addressed in case law, it is
correct as a matter of economic logic," Coffee said. "And it would
clearly be a conflict in a bankruptcy case. You can't represent rival
classes for limited funds."</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that the courts have to think about seriously,"
Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation that Andersen's combined legal liabilities could
overwhelm it has introduced a level of gamesmanship to any potential
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to get your money now, especially if you think there
might eventually be a bankruptcy," said Daniel Lefler, an attorney at
Irell &amp; Manella in Los Angeles. "And you have to believe that with so
many [suits], one of the cards Andersen has to play is the threat of
bankruptcy. It could be a powerful bargaining chip."</TE>
<TE>   "There is an absolute race for the money," Lefler said. "That's
not lost on any of these guys."</TE>
<TE>   An added wrinkle, Zohn said, is that bankruptcy law creates an
incentive for attorneys to reach settlements with Andersen quickly
and to get the money deposited.</TE>
<TE>   A Bankruptcy Court judge could unwind any settlements reached 90
days before an Andersen bankruptcy filing, Zohn said.</TE>

<HD>GDP Shows Recovery May Be Underway</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Boosted by consumer spending, the economy expanded
at 1.4% rate in the fourth quarter, leading some to ask, 'What
recession?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans are spending their way out of the recession, the government
said Thursday as it released figures showing the economy expanded at
a 1.4% rate during the fourth quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The revised growth estimate, up from last month's initial reading
of 0.2%, was higher than most economists had predicted, and provided
more evidence that a recovery already may be underway.</LD>
<LD>   The economy's ability to bounce back from Sept. 11 and resume its
growth after only one quarter of contraction is attributable largely
to a surge in consumer spending, particularly on durable goods such
as autos and appliances.</LD>
<TE>   "Where's the recession?" quipped Joseph LaVorgna, senior economist
with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in New York. "It's pretty remarkable.
We really had what appears now to be a very shallow recession."</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the broadest
measure of the nation's economic output, reached a record $10.3
trillion during the final three months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The 1.4% gain followed a 1.3% decline in the third quarter, the
first GDP contraction in nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter figures will feed a continuing debate over the
length and depth of the downturn. The popular definition of a
recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, and it
appears the latest slowdown was confined to one.</TE>
<TE>   But the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official
scorekeeper of U.S. business cycles, does not use GDP figures to
define recessions. Instead, it looks at four monthly indicators of
economic performance: employment, real income, industrial production
and wholesale-retail trade.</TE>
<TE>   According to the research group, the recent recession began in
March 2001, when U.S. employment began declining from a peak of
132.7million. The official end point will be whenever the group says
it is, and the group might not make that decision for months. (In
most cases, the downturns it designates as recessions coincide with
two consecutive quarters of GDP shrinkage. But not always: The
recession of 1960-61 was another exception.)</TE>
<TE>   A series of economic shocks, some dating back to early 2000,
contributed to last year's slump: higher energy prices, dot-com
disillusionment, stock market losses, business investment cutbacks,
inventory liquidation, manufacturing layoffs, tech industry failures
and, finally, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of a mild recession is the probability of a subdued
recovery, as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cautioned
Congress this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed expects economic growth to increase to an annual rate of
no more than 3% by year's end, far below the average 7% surge during
the first year of a typical recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at just GDP data, we never went down that
drastically," said Brian S. Wesbury, chief economist with Griffin,
Kubik, Stephens &amp; Thompson, a Chicago investment bank. "If you don't
drop a lot, then you can't bounce a lot either."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter rally reflects one of the defining
characteristics of the recent downturn: Consumer spending, which
normally collapses in the early stages of a recession, has remained
the economy's principal pillar of support during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   While businesses reacted to the gathering storm clouds by
curtailing investment, cutting costs and selling off inventory,
consumers kept right on spending, even in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
Tax rebates, interest-free financing and rock-bottom mortgage rates
helped keep their wallets open and charge cards in circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Overall consumer spending rose 6% during the final three months of
2001, the Commerce Department reported, providing the biggest single
contribution to fourth-quarter growth. Had consumer spending been
flat, the economy would have instead shrunk by 2.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items that are
highly sensitive to changes in the economy, soared 39.2%. It was the
biggest quarterly gain in 15 years and reflected the stimulative
effect of falling interest rates on sales of homes, autos, furniture
and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a logical consequence of the very low interest rates that
the Fed has engineered," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist with
DRI-WEFA, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "As people buy homes, they're buying curtains, they're buying
washers, they're buying refrigerators, they're buying furniture. All
this stuff has helped to keep the consumer buoyant throughout this
downturn."</TE>
<TE>   The economy also got a boost from government outlays, which rose
10.1% in the fourth quarter. Spending by households and government
more than offset the recessionary effects of corporate cutbacks.
Total business investment fell 13.1%, the Commerce Department said,
and the sell-off of inventories subtracted 2.2% from fourth-quarter
growth.</TE>
<TE>   In another positive sign, first-time claims for unemployment
benefits continued their downward trend last month, the Labor
Department reported. Although the number of new claims increased by
17,000 last week, the figure for the previous week was revised down
by 22,000, causing the four-week moving average to decline to
373,000.</TE>

<HD>SCE About to Repay Debts of $5.5 Billion</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison is expected today to repay $5.5 billion in
electricity and other debts lingering from California's nearly
two-year energy meltdown that pushed  the utility to the edge of
ruin, left Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. in Bankruptcy Court and saddled
the state with $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts.</LD>
<LD>   The payment of months of accumulated electricity bills and other
defaults, which were caused because SCE couldn't pass sky-high power
costs on to customers in 2000 and 2001, is a crucial step toward
returning the Rosemead company to the investment-grade credit status
that will eventually allow it to resume buying the electricity for
its 4.3 million customers.</LD>
<LD>   But the payoff, reached through a lawsuit settlement with state
regulators, also locks consumers and businesses in SCE's
50,000-square-mile territory into the high electricity rates they are
now paying until late next year.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first step in the process that will take some time to
get us back to a healthy financial condition to let us resume buying
power ... to more completely serve our customers," SCE President
Robert Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a much better alternative [than Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's
bankruptcy route] for our customers and for the state of California,"
Foster said in an interview. "We believe it will get our debts paid
down faster, and we believe it will get us back to buying power
faster."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates contend the SCE settlement is a bad deal for
ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Edison pretty much got their way," said Mike Florio, a lawyer
with the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer
advocacy group that is fighting the SCE settlement in court. SCE's
ratepayers "are pretty much left holding the whole bag, and the deal
that SCE got is better than the one that the Legislature failed to
pass."</TE>
<TE>   SCE  said the company anticipated closing on a $1.6-billion loan
Thursday from J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and other banks, which
along with cash on hand would allow the utility to cut checks today
to power suppliers, bank creditors and holders of SCE's commercial
paper and other notes. A spokesman for J.P. Morgan Chase said late
Thursday that the loan was on track to close as scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   After PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April, SCE took a different road to settle the massive
debts it had piled up, choosing to negotiate a settlement with Gov.
Gray Davis. But the state Legislature failed to pass an SCE bailout,
and the California Public Utilities Commission then secretly
negotiated an agreement with the utility to allow SCE to pay off its
electricity-related debts primarily using ratepayer funds.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, structured as the settlement of a federal lawsuit
that SCE had filed against the PUC to recover past power costs, was
made possible because electricity prices plunged last summer
significantly below what SCE was collecting in rates, giving the
utility leftover funds to pay its bills.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC agreed to keep those rates, which were increased twice
last year, until SCE recovers all of its past power-procurement
costs, which is expected to happen by late next year. However, if
electricity costs rise again, the rates could be retained for two
more years.</TE>
<TE>   SCE also agreed not to pay dividends to its parent, Edison
International, until the power costs are recovered. That amount,
which is expected to total $1.2 billion, would have been used to pay
dividends to shareholders of Edison International.</TE>
<TE>   SCE's $5.5 billion in debt payments break down this way, according
to Moody's Investors Service: nearly $2.9 billion to power suppliers,
$1.65 million to bank creditors, nearly $531 million to holders of
commercial paper and $400 million to holders of long-term unsecured
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Edison International shares Thursday slipped 5 cents to $15.80 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's recently raised the credit ratings
of SCE and its parent, but both remain firmly in junk-bond territory,
where they fell when the utility ran out of money to pay its bills in
January 2001. The state then stepped in to buy power on behalf of
SCE, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E remains under bankruptcy law protection as it tries to win
approval for a reorganization plan that would move much of its
operations outside the control of state regulators.</TE>
<TE>   But the PUC is crafting a reorganization plan similar to the
settlement it reached with SCE.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Stock Drops After Strategy Swing</HD>
<DH>Tech: Computer maker's shares fall to near six-year low as
Wall Street reacts skeptically to firm's return to its policy of
slashing prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gateway Inc. isn't in imminent danger of running out of money, but
the nation's fourth-largest personal computer maker is running out of
believers.</LD>
<LD>   Its shares fell to near a six-year low Thursday, the day after the
Poway, Calif., company said it will do an about-face and again slash
PC prices to recoup plunging market share. Only seven weeks ago,
Gateway said it was abandoning the low-price strategy to chase
big-spending consumers in a bid to return to profitability.</LD>
<LD>   But profit is at least a year away, and Gateway warned that its
first-quarter loss will be three times larger than Wall Street had
been expecting.</LD>
<TE>   "The revenue and profit slide continues, and until profitable
growth returns, we remain on the sidelines," wrote Lehman Bros.
analyst Daniel Niles, one of more than a dozen analysts with neutral
ratings on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders also weren't pleased, and they sent Gateway down 10%
to $4.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares hit $4.24 in
October, their lowest since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In the span of 12 months, Gateway's share of the U.S. home desktop
market skidded from 15% to 8.8% at the end of 2001, according to
researcher IDC. And the company has pulled back from sales overseas,
where the possibility of long-term growth is greater.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed price war, which echoes a 2001 promise to match
consumer offers by market leader Dell Computer Corp., puts Gateway
back on a collision course with Dell.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts don't see the point: Dell is bigger, profitable and
spends less for each PC sold because it has no store overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "I can almost see Michael Dell smiling like a Cheshire cat in the
background," said IDC analyst Roger Kay.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when asked Thursday why Dell has kept gaining share, Dell
Vice President John Hamlin said: "Unlike most of our competitors, we
don't change strategy every quarter."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Gateway Chief Financial Officer Joe Burke said
the new push to lure customers with bargain prices makes sense
because Gateway will then have the chance to sell more profitable
related goods and services, including Internet access and training.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we made a prediction of profitability in the fourth
quarter," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "We got back to profitability, but with a higher-price strategy.
We saw that was really not a growth strategy."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Gateway is trying to reshape itself as an IBM for
consumers. IBM has prospered by offering PCs as a convenience for
big-business customers that order the firm's higher-end machines,
integration services and consulting.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway wants to do the same for the little guy, selling PCs along
with consulting.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Burke said, Gateway is beginning to expand its retail
offerings beyond computers to digital cameras, hand-held devices and
other gadgets.</TE>
<TE>   "The core strategy is still the same, to be an integrator of
technology for our customers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's customer satisfaction figures have improved, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dell is finding tech-support calls more costly as it expands from
its base of business customers to the consumer market.</TE>
<TE>   But the reworked pitch to Gateway customers won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   The company's "only hope is to aggressively take share from
competitors armed with superior market and product mixes along with
greater scale," wrote Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Kevin
McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's lack of brand power outside the PC will make it that
much harder to gain back the lost profit, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Burke said Gateway will continue to cut costs. The company has
about $1.2 billion in cash, no outstanding bonds and untapped lines
of credit that are enough to last a long time.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy forecast that the company would lose $147 million this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's list the company's credit as
junk because of long-term concerns about Gateway's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a third of the company is owned by founder Ted Waitt, who
returned as chief executive one year ago after the firm's stock lost
three-fourths of its value, from more than $80.</TE>
<TE>   With the company trading near book value, or its assets minus its
liabilities, the best way out for shareholders might be a takeover.</TE>
<TE>   But with No. 3 PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co. poised to buy No. 2
Compaq Computer Corp., it's hard to see who would be interested.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft, Court Alter Settlement</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Changes are made to stem criticism that the
company is getting off too easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED BRIDIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. and the Justice Department disclosed significant
changes Thursday to the proposed settlement in their landmark
antitrust case, partly to stem criticism from many legal and
technology experts that the software giant was getting off too easy.</LD>
<LD>   The company and the government outlined the changes in court
papers filed in Washington with U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly, who must decide in the coming months whether to
approve the settlement. The Justice Department described the deal
Thursday as "a comprehensive remedy that puts into place meaningful,
effective and enforceable restrictions on Microsoft."</LD>
<LD>   The most significant change deletes an entire provision of the
settlement that some state attorneys general--and some rival
companies--accused Microsoft of manipulating so the company could use
valuable hardware technology patents from computer makers without
paying them.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft, which had fought for the provision during the
settlement talks, told the trial judge that it "continues to believe
that the provision was reasonable and justified," but that it agreed
with the government's request to drop it "in the interest of
eliminating confusion."</TE>
<TE>   Nine states that rejected the settlement had accused Microsoft of
using this provision to prohibit computer makers from enforcing their
patents against the software giant.</TE>
<TE>   Officials cited the recent deposition of Richard Fade, a Microsoft
executive, who told the states' lawyers that computer makers
particularly objected to Microsoft's interpretation of the provision
during recent contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Corp., for example, had complained to the government that the
provision "would diminish Sony's ability to assert its patents ...
and thereby may enable Microsoft to expand its power into new areas."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft described those complaints as "a great deal of
misunderstanding and wild charges that Microsoft would use the right
to misappropriate the intellectual property of others."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, acknowledged that changes to the provision had been sought
by the non-settling states but said none of the changes announced
Thursday were aimed at enticing more states to settle the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's toughest critics said they were unimpressed with the
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement is like a car crash, that's how bad it is," said
Ed Black, head of the Computer and Communications Industry Assn., a
trade group. "They've fixed a flat tire, but the engine is still all
over the highway."</TE>
<TE>   Other changes to the settlement include:</TE>
<TE>   * Broadening some technical definitions to clarify Microsoft's
responsibilities to ensure that rival software functions as well as
its own with its dominant Windows operating system.</TE>
<TE>   * Changing another key provision to expand the types of technical
information Microsoft must disclose to rival companies about how
software operates with business-level Windows "server" software.
Microsoft said this change would "make crystal clear what is now
clear."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also said the trial judge's role in approving the
settlement is "almost ministerial," and urged her to defer to the
judgment of the Justice Department about whether the agreement "is
the most appropriate mechanism to resolve the competing interests at
stake." To do otherwise, the company said, would risk constitutional
questions over the separation of powers between the executive and
judicial branches of government.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department also urged the judge to approve the
settlement but did not raise constitutional questions. Instead, the
government said the judge "should not lightly reject the government's
predictions" that the agreement would be effective.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>In 21st-century America, where major leaguers are not only athletes
but wealthy celebrities, managers and coaches aren't the only ones
preparing players for the season. Kevin Hallinan, the security chief
of major league baseball, met with Angel players Thursday as part of
his tour of spring training camps.</LD>
<LD>   Hallinan covered a variety of issues, including security at home
and at the ballpark, firearm safety and prevention of identity theft,
the latter a particular concern because criminals would love few
things more than discovering the Social Security number of a
millionaire athlete, assuming his identity and accessing his line of
credit.</LD>
<LD>   "We have noticed that phenomenon with professional athletes and
entertainers," Hallinan said.</LD>
<TE>   Hallinan distributed a card for players to keep in their wallets,
with numbers to call in case of any incident, at any hour. He also
assured players that officials were worrying about stadium security
so that players could focus on the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the highest alert, but we don't want to transfer that
paranoia to our fans and our players," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hallinan and his staff have met with officials from Edison Field
and every other venue in the major leagues, as well as with local
police agencies, the FBI, Secret Service and hazardous materials
experts in an effort to anticipate and prevent incidents as well as
respond quickly to them. The Angels, for instance, screen all mail
and thoroughly search Edison Field before gates open for each game.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to have a tank in front of every park," Hallinan
said. "We have to do the things behind the scenes before the fans
even get there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Smith, one of the Angels' new radio voices, was so excited
to get to spring training that he drove to Arizona from his Ohio home
and got here four days before his first broadcast. Smith got his
call-up to the major leagues after 19 years of broadcasting the
triple-A Columbus Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wondered if I was ever going to achieve my dream," he said. "I
had people tell me the only reason dreams don't come true is if you
give up on them. I never did. It's very gratifying."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' radio broadcasts start with today's Cactus League game
against the Seattle Mariners. Smith and Rory Markas handle the
English broadcast on KLAC (570), with KPLS (830) airing games when
KLAC airs the Lakers. Ivan Lara and Jose Mota handle the Spanish
broadcast on XPRS (1090).</TE>
<TE>   The Angels defeated Cal Poly Pomona in an exhibition Thursday,
10-2. Aaron Sele and Scott Schoeneweis each pitched a scoreless
inning, and Jorge Fabregas caught them both, but otherwise the Angels
gave their veterans the afternoon off and fielded a lineup of minor
league hopefuls.</TE>
<TE>   Sele needed only nine pitches to finish his inning, but he
wouldn't have been bothered if a couple of hitters had taken him
deep.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as you come out of spring training healthy, it doesn't
matter," he said. "In my first two or three outings, I'm just working
on what I need to work on. If I give up hits, I don't really care. If
I give up home runs, I don't really care. I don't need to come out of
spring training with a 3.00 ERA."</TE>

<LD>   DIVISION IV-AA</LD>
<TE>   El Segundo (27-4) vs. North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake (25-5),
8:30 p.m.: El Segundo, which hasn't won a section title since 1963,
is making its first appearance in a final since 1967. Each team has a
star or two, but the game might come down to whoever plays best as a
team. Dashawn Strong (22.4-point average) and Jeramie Hopson (17.5)
lead the way for top-seeded El Segundo, while sophomore Bryce Taylor
(21) is the only player to average double figures in scoring for
second-seeded Harvard-Westlake. El Segundo, which has nine seniors,
has the edge when it comes to experience, but both teams feature
solid depth.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV-A</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Verbum Dei (26-3) vs. Gardena Serra (26-3), 6:30 p.m.:
Serra would win in a blowout--if this were a football game. The
third-seeded Cavaliers feature five football players, including
UCLA-bound Eric McNeal, Arizona State-bound Loren Wade and San Jose
State-bound Jason Williams. Serra's top basketball player, point
guard Eugene Jeter, has committed to Portland. But first he wants to
lead the Cavaliers to their first section title since winning
back-to-back championships in 1999 and 2000. It won't be easy against
a top-seeded Verbum Dei team that features Utah-bound guard Richard
Chaney, one of the most versatile players in the region, and Martin
Starr.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-A</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Price (26-6) vs. Tarzana Stoneridge Prep (23-5), 4:45
p.m.: Price has been here, won that. The top-seeded Knights are
seeking their fourth consecutive section title, while second-seeded
Stoneridge Prep is making its first championship-game appearance.
Price's leading scorer, Derrick Williams, has only played eight
playoff minutes after spraining an ankle late in the regular season.
But Williams, who averages 15 points, is expected to return to a
lineup that has not been hurt without him, averaging 99 points during
its run to the title game. Stoneridge is led by junior swingman James
Spencer, who scored a career-high 41 points against Fullerton
Eastside Christian in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-AA</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates Rolling Hills Prep (19-6) vs. Los Angeles
Ribet Academy (20-8), 3 p.m.: These Harbor League rivals have already
met three times this season, with Rolling Hills Prep winning twice.
Sophomore guards Jason Daley and D.J. Wright run the up-tempo offense
for the Huskies, who seek their first section title since 1998.
Derrick Gaines (14-point average) and Shomar Thomas (13) lead
second-seeded Ribet, bidding for its first section title since 1991.</TE>

<LD>Colorado Manager Buddy Bell left spring training Thursday to return
to Denver for tests on his back and left leg.</LD>
<LD>   Bell had surgery on Dec. 11 to repair a disk problem and has
experienced discomfort in his left leg since then.</LD>
<LD>   He has been unable to take part in some of his usual
spring-training duties, such as hitting fungoes and throwing batting
practice.</LD>
<TE>   Bell expects to rejoin the Rockies in Arizona for Sunday's game
against the Milwaukee Brewers in Phoenix. Coach Toby Harrah will run
the team in Bell's absence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Pirate third baseman Aramis Ramirez, who hit .300 with
34 home runs and 112 runs batted in last season, agreed to a
three-year, $9.5-million contract.... Five major league umpires
regained their jobs after a 21/2-year struggle against the
commissioner's office. Gary Darling, Bill Hohn, Larry Poncino, Larry
Vanover and Joe West will start working spring training games Monday,
the commissioner's office said.... New York Yankee pitcher Mike
Mussina was scratched from his scheduled start Thursday because of a
middle ear infection.... Philadelphia Phillies reliever Turk Wendell
sat out practice because of tendinitis in his right elbow, the same
injury that ended his 2001 season three weeks early.... Cleveland
Indian infielder John McDonald had an emergency appendectomy and is
expected to be sidelined up to four weeks.... Dwayne Murphy, hitting
coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks, underwent an emergency
appendectomy and will miss four or five days.... The Cleveland

<LD>Gates Open: 10 a.m. Saturday First Post: Noon</LD>
<LD>   Big 'Cap Post: Ninth race, Approx. 4:15 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Net 2</LD>
<LD>   Listed in post position order (odds in parentheses):</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CAGNEY (8-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Stud T N T (Goncalo Borges Torrealba). Trainer: Richard
Mandella. Jockey: Mike Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: A five-time winner on the grass, Cagney has not raced on
the main track since he finished sixth in his career debut in Brazil
more than two years ago. A proven stayer, the 5-year-old should
relish the Big `Cap distance and a fast pace would play in his favor.
Mandella is a two-time winner of the race, having won with Siphon in
1998 and Malek in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FANCY AS (6-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: R.K. and Linda Smith. Trainer: Bob Baffert. Jockey: Gary
Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: Purchased for $3,200 as a yearling, the gelded son of
Dignitas has won 13 of 17 and earned more than $613,000. All of those
wins came in Canada, however, and he is winless in two starts in
California. He was third in the San Fernando Breeders' Cup and Strub
Stakes. Stevens will be seeking his fourth victory in the Big 'Cap,
having scored previously with Ruhlmann (1990), Farma Way (1991) and
Urgent Request (1995).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SKY JACK (5-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Ren-Mar Thoroughbreds (Rene and Margie Lambert). Trainer:
Doug O'Neill. Jockey: Laffit Pincay Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: Sidelined for more than 14 months after knee surgery and
a bout with colic, the 6-year-old gray gelding was beaten by a nose
in his comeback race on Feb. 9. A winner of six of 11 in his career,
he will be part of the pace and was entered in the Big 'Cap after the
defection of Mizzen Mast. Pincay has won the race five times, but his
last win came with Greinton in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GIANT GENTLEMAN (5-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Gary Tanaka. Trainer: Brent Sumja. Jockey: Alex Solis.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: Second to Mizzen Mast in both the Malibu and Strub
Stakes, the 4-year-old son of Montbrook has been worse than third
only once in his nine-race career. He was purchased privately last
week by Tanaka from former owners Robert Domush, Mark Moskowitz and
Nancy Clark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEINNE (30-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Nelson Bunker Hunt. Trainer: Ron McAnally. Jockey: Victor
Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: He will be a longshot in the Big 'Cap and for good
reason. He has won twice since arriving in the U.S. from Chile, but
has managed only fourth- and fifth-place finishes in his two tries in
graded stakes. Hunt, who has never had a starter in the race, won
Eclipse awards in 1976, '85 and '87 and owned and bred such stars as
Exceller, Dahlia and Estrapade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KUDOS (15-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss. Trainer: Mandella. Jockey: Eddie
Delahoussaye.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: A late nominee to the Santa Anita Handicap after winning
the San Marino Handicap on Feb. 17, a race moved from turf to dirt
because of bad weather. Has improved since being gelded more than a
year ago and is proven at the Big 'Cap distance and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAST PARADE (30-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Bill Currin and Al Eisman. Trainer: Currin. Jockey: Brice
Blanc.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: A winner only once in seven starts in this country after
winning three times in South America, the Brazilian-bred will be part
of the mutuel field. In three previous forays into graded stakes
races in the U.S., the best he has managed was a third in the Native
Diver Handicap on Dec. 9 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FREEDOM CREST (15-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Calvin Nguyen. Trainer: Richard Baltas. Jockey: Corey
Nakatani.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: The first horse owned by the Vietnamese-born Nguyen, who
claimed him for $32,000, the 6-year-old gelding scored his biggest
victory when beating two-time Pacific Classic winner Skimming and
eventual two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow in last fall's
Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap. This will be Freedom Crest's first
race since he finished last in the Breeders' Cup Classic, 33 lengths
behind Tiznow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EUCHRE (7-2)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Frank Stronach. Trainer: Bobby Frankel. Jockey: Garrett
Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: He may not be brilliant, but this 6-year-old Personal
Flag gelding is consistent. He has been stakes-placed four years
running and has been the runner-up in his last three races, including
a half-length loss to Redattore in the San Antonio Handicap, the last
major prep for the Big 'Cap. Frankel has yet to win with 10 previous
Santa Anita Handicap starters. His best finish was a second with 40-1
longshot Triteamtri in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FUTURAL (9-2)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Jack Weitz and Jess Miller. Trainer: Craig Dollase. Jockey:
Chris McCarron.TR</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: The co-starting highweight with Euchre at 118 pounds, he
was third in his first race of 2002, but his connections says he was
only about "75% ready" and expect big improvement Saturday. He won
the San Bernardino and Mervyn LeRoy Handicaps in 2001 but is best
known for his disqualification from first to second in last July's
Hollywood Gold Cup. McCarron has won the Big 'Cap three times,
including last year with Tiznow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIG FOR IT (30-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Bruce Headley: Trainer: Headley. Jockey: Jose Valdivia Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: The other half of the mutuel field, this gelding has
never won a stakes, but did finish third at 44-1--in a six-horse
field--in last year's Pacific Classic. This will be the first Big
'Cap mount for Valdivia and only the third starter in the race for
Headley. He saddled Stylish Winner to a third-place finish in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IRISHEYESAREFLYING (15-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Dolan Racing Stable, Alice Taylor and Lloyd Graham.
Trainer: John Dolan. Jockey: David Flores.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: A former claimer who has made good, the 6-year-old
gelding has won seven of 33 and banked more than $655,000. Fourth in
last year's Big 'Cap, his biggest victories in 2001 came in the
Longacres Mile at Emerald Downs and in the California Cup Classic.
Flores has a win and two thirds in four previous tries in this race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MILWAUKEE BREW (7-2)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Frank Stronach. Trainer: Frankel. Jockey: Kent Desormeaux.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: Coupled in the betting with Euchre, this 5-year-old
finished sixth in the Whirlaway Handicap at the New Orleans Fair
Grounds on Feb. 10 in his first race for Frankel and first in almost
seven months. He won the Ohio Derby at Thistledown and the Marine at
Woodbine as a 3-year-old but has lost eight in a row. Desormeaux
picked up the mount after the injury to Mizzen Mast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WESTERN PRIDE (15-1)</TE>
<TE>   Owner: Theresa McArthur and Carolyn Chapman. Trainer: James
Chapman. Jockey: Patrick Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   Lowdown: Labeled "great" by his trainer after his win over a
speed-biased track in the San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes, the
4-year-old Way West colt bombed in the Strub. He finished seventh,
beaten by nearly 21 lengths by Mizzen Mast. A nine-time winner, he
will be part of the early pace and is the first Big 'Cap mount for
Valenzuela since he won with Sir Beaufort in 1993.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Ends Irvine Bid</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach State never imagined playing the role of spoiler at the
start of the season. But the 49ers are embracing it now.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers ended UC Irvine's pursuit of first place in the Big West
Conference on Thursday by dealing the Anteaters their worst loss of
the season, 86-70, before 2,624 at the Pyramid in the regular-season
finale for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine (20-9 overall) finished with a 13-5 conference record and
will be the No. 2 seed in the conference tournament next week in
Anaheim. It means the Anteaters will face these same 49ers in the
first round. Long Beach (13-16, 9-9) will be the seventh seed.</LD>
<TE>   "The way we played against them tonight ... " Irvine Coach Pat
Douglass said. "There was a lot at stake. We practice hard. We played
hard. They were just better than us."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Kevin Roberts had a career-high 27 points and added seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Ron Johnson and forward Travis Reed, seniors playing their
final home game, added 20 and 19 points, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach shot 54.2% from the field and outscored Irvine, 46-31,
in the second half. Roberts sparked a 15-2 run early in the second
half with 10 points and the Anteaters could get no closer than nine.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin Roberts was unbelievable tonight," Long Beach Coach Wayne
Morgan said. "Travis was his usual steady dominating self and Ron
Johnson played 34 minutes without any turnovers."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers are the league's hottest team. They have won five in a
row and seven of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Harris led Irvine with 29 points and Jerry Green added 25.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge 63, Idaho 46--Senior center Jermar Welch
scored 12 of his 16 points on dunks and the Matadors (11-15, 10-7)
defeated the Vandals (9-17, 6-11) before 1,081 at Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 Welch and the Matadors capitalized repeatedly on a
size advantage, beating the Vandals' three-guard lineup inside to
take control of the game early with a 24-11 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to win," Welch said. "I was just trying my best to win.
You've got to give credit to my teammates. They hit me at the right
time, right place."</TE>
<TE>   With one regular-season game left against first-place Utah State
on Saturday, Northridge remained in a three-way tie for third place
in the conference with Pacific and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward Rodney Hilaire led Idaho with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara 54, Cal State Fullerton 52--Jacoby Atako made two
free throws and had a steal in the final 10 seconds as the Gauchos
(16-10, 10-7) defeated the Titans (4-22, 1-16) before 1,855 at Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Titan guard Ryan Dillon had tied the score at 52 with 29 seconds
left on his seventh three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Branduinn Fullove led Santa Barbara with 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Dillon, seven of 10 from three-point range, had a game-high 22
points for Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly SLO 90, Riverside 65--Varnie Dennis had 18 points as the
Mustangs (15-10, 9-8) used a 21-5 first-half run to beat the
Highlanders (8-17, 5-12) before 2,879 at San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Miller led Riverside with 17 points.</TE>

<LD>The Hagerstown (Md.) Suns of the South Atlantic League thought they
were onto something when they proposed an Osama bin Laden bobblehead
doll giveaway.</LD>
<LD>   Their fans told them otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The Suns, a class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, sought
opinions online before proceeding with the promotion, in which fans
were to be given the dolls and then invited to smash them.</LD>
<TE>   Of 194 responses, 72 percent considered the idea "way out of
line," according to the team's Web site. So the giveaway was
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really glad the fans got online and voted," team General
Manager Kurt Landes said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for assists in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Air is human: Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times, commenting
on the knee surgery that could sideline Michael Jordan, 39, for as
long as six weeks:</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Jordan, who never has had an archrival on the
hardwood--not Magic, or Bird or Isiah, not any of the players who
peaked before or after him--has been on a subliminal career quest for
that baddest dude himself, Father Time.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike knows, as we all do, who wins this shootout."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matter of time: Woody Paige in the Denver Post on the trade that
sent Nick Van Exel from the Nuggets to Dallas: "What's the over-under
on how many months until Nick the Quick demands to be traded from the
Mavericks?</TE>
<TE>   "The inevitable and unavoidable will happen as soon as Nick Van
Exel realizes his 50 touches and looks and airballs and outbursts a
game won't be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lovable guy: Randy Galloway in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "For
what it's worth at this early date: John Rocker has been in [Texas
Ranger] camp for two weeks, and he leads the clubhouse in most
autographs signed for fans, plus most hugs and handshakes for
teammates. Who does this guy think he is, Henry Kissinger?</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said, it's early."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Game plan: Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune, commenting on the
Mavericks acquiring new players with the hope of outscoring the
Lakers: "The Mavericks have lost 40 of the last 43 games they've
played against the Lakers, and the test of the new theory comes March
17 and 19 with a home-and-home set.</TE>
<TE>   "'If it's a mental thing, we better get a psychologist,' said
Maverick Coach Don Nelson."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast sweeper: Jay Leno has a final word on the Winter Olympics:
"There was a large curling scandal. I guess they tried to cover it
up. I don't know if you heard about this. Apparently a member of the
curling team was disqualified for using a cordless electric broom."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His legacy: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "A Stanford
scientist says that the Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs probably did not
run at all. In fact, they were 'plodders' that lumbered around the
earth.</TE>
<TE>   "Asked if there was an animal alive today that mimics the T. rex's
movements, the professor answered: 'Yes, Greg Ostertag of the Utah
Jazz.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Scott Skiles of Orlando, 30, against Denver on Dec.
30, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   (</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Sergio Garcia, 22, when asked by Golf Digest if he
felt he could challenge Tiger Woods as the game's best player: "He's
26. I think I can be as good as he is at 26 ... or hopefully sooner."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia, desperate for a victory to keep alive its NCAA tournament
hopes, wiped out a 12-point deficit over the final seven minutes and
defeated No. 3 Duke, 87-84, Thursday night at Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Cavaliers' victory enabled Maryland to clinch the Atlantic
Coast Conference regular-season title.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia (17-9, 7-8 in the ACC) began the game having lost seven
of nine. It seemed another loss was about to come as Duke (25-3,
12-3) took a 77-65 lead.</LD>
<TE>   But Virginia held the Blue Devils scoreless for more than 61/2
minutes as part of the game-closing 22-7 run.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Jenifer's basket with 1:13 to play gave the Cavaliers the
lead for good at 78-77. After they increased the lead to 85-82,
Duke's Jason Williams had a chance to tie the score with 12 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was fouled as he converted his miss, but missed the free
throw.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Mason Jr. rebounded for the Cavaliers and converted two free
throws for an 87-84 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Duke inbounded and Williams lost the ball, which was grabbed by
Mason. He was fouled and missed two free throws, but Williams' shot
from halfcourt missed badly at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Boozer scored a career-high 33 points for Duke, but didn't
get a shot over the last 8:47.</TE>
<TE>   Mason had 22 points for Virginia and Adam Hall had 21, 12 in the
closing run.</TE>

<HD>Maggette Is Worst of the Injured; Olowokandi OK</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers said Thursday that small forward Corey Maggette will be
sidelined up to six weeks because of two dislocated bones in his
right hand. Maggette also underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his
sore left knee, which will result in a recovery period of at least
three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Center Michael Olowokandi's MRI exam on his sprained left knee was
negative and, if all goes well at practice today, he will start
Saturday against the Golden State Warriors.</LD>
<LD>   "When I tried to exert myself, I felt some discomfort," Olowokandi
said after a light workout Thursday. "I'll just have to deal with the
pain. I plan on playing."</LD>
<TE>   An MRI exam of backup point guard Keyon Dooling's left ankle
showed slight irritation and he will be monitored daily. Dooling was
sidelined for 43 games after spraining his ankle Nov. 14.</TE>
<TE>   The team's medical staff also updated the progress of small
forward Lamar Odom, sidelined by a sprained right ankle and wrist.
The ankle injury is expected to keep him out four more weeks. His
wrist is expected to be sound in two.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers probably will sign rookie Tremaine Fowlkes to a
second 10-day contract when his first one ends next week. They also
could sign Fowlkes, who has become the starting small forward because
of the injuries, for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NBA standings tell a grim story for the Clippers. The Portland
Trail Blazers have won eight of 10, the Utah Jazz eight of 11 and
Seattle SuperSonics seven of 10.</TE>
<TE>   These are the teams the Clippers, ninth in the Western Conference,
are chasing for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, winners of five of their last 10, are 31/2 games out
of the eighth and final position.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers still have a shot at the playoffs because all but
four of their final 23 games are against Western Conference teams.
They do not play Portland again, but have two games remaining apiece
against Utah and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "We can still win our way into the playoffs," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "If we play at a high level, we can play our way into
the playoffs."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Herges Gets Perspective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIERA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger reliever Matt Herges' mood went from one of frustration
Wednesday to conciliation Thursday, a visit from his older brother, a
cancer survivor, and a meeting with General Manager Dan Evans
soothing the disappointment of his failed contract negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Talks between the Dodgers and Herges on a multiyear deal broke off
Wednesday afternoon with the sides far apart and Herges questioning
the team's evaluation of him. "They obviously think I'm just an
average reliever," Herges said, "and I don't think of myself like
that."</LD>
<LD>   Then Herges' older brother arrived in Vero Beach, Fla., from
Champaign, Ill., Wednesday night. Toby Herges, 34, was diagnosed with
an inoperable brain tumor two years ago and was given three months to
live.</LD>
<TE>   But he underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
on Feb. 28, 2000, a risky procedure in which doctors had to remove
part of Toby's skull to extract the tumor. The operation was a
success, and Toby is in excellent health.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up [Thursday] and honestly didn't have any hard feelings,"
Herges said. "My older brother came to town, and every time I see him
and we talk, it takes me back to reality and puts things in
perspective. I woke up and told my wife I wasn't upset any more."</TE>
<TE>   When Herges got to Dodgertown on Thursday morning, Evans pulled
him aside for a 15-minute private meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wanted to clear the air, and I said there were absolutely
no hard feelings, whatsoever," said Herges, who went 9-8 with a 3.44
earned-run average in 75 games as the Dodgers' primary setup man last
season but will probably be the team's closer in 2002. "I appreciated
him taking time to talk to me. It was very professional of him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Mark Whiten, a longshot to win a major league job, hit
a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning Thursday to help
the Dodgers to a 3-3, 10-inning tie with the Florida Marlins in a
Grapefruit League opener at Space Coast Stadium. The Dodgers had only
five hits, including Dave Hansen's solo homer in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Eric Gagne and left-hander Odalis Perez, who are
battling Omar Daal for the fifth spot in the rotation, each threw two
innings. Gagne gave up one hit in two shutout innings, striking out
two and throwing several excellent changeups. Perez gave up two runs
and three hits, including Mike Lowell's two-run homer, and struck out
three.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good; I just made one bad pitch, a hanging slider," Perez
said. "For me, I don't think there's any competition because Daal has
proved he's a good pitcher, Gagne has proved he's a good pitcher, and
so have I.</TE>
<TE>   "The only guy who has [minor league] options left is me. One way
or another, at the end of spring training, they have to make a hard
decision. I don't care if I'm a starter or reliever; I just want to
make the opening-day roster."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby continued to progress in his recovery from elbow
surgery, throwing 70 pitches Thursday, including 51 to Dodger hitters
during batting practice. Ashby said he felt great.... No structural
damage was found in Alex Cora's left shoulder after he suffered a
bruise while diving for a flare in Wednesday's intrasquad game. Cora
is listed as day to day.... Though most veterans don't travel to a
majority of the early Grapefruit League away games, Dante Bichette, a
13-year veteran, was told he will make most of the Dodgers' early
trips. "His response was, 'Hey, I'm trying to make a ballclub here,'"
Manager Jim Tracy said. "Our [bench] was fairly short from the right
side last year, and we didn't have a complement to [left-handed]
Hansen. We've got to get Dante out there, see how this puzzle fits
together and if it fits together, and he understands that."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris DiMarco would rather be leading the PGA Tour money list in
November than March, although it hasn't happened by accident.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask Tiger Woods, currently 29 places behind on the money list
and two strokes behind DiMarco after the first round Thursday of the
Genuity Championship at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "He's playing beautifully," Woods said. "He's hitting good shots
and he's rolling the ball well. There's no substitute for having a
lot of confidence."</LD>
<TE>   The PGA Tour left unusually dry California and moved across the
country to surprisingly chilly Florida. The one constant was DiMarco,
who opened with a seven-under 65 for his best round on the Blue
Monster at Doral and is once again the guy everyone is chasing.</TE>
<TE>   Opening with three straight birdies, DiMarco finished the first
round with a one-stroke advantage over Ernie Els, Vijay Singh, Steve
Allan of Australia and Greg Kraft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twelve-year-old Michelle Wie struggled to a two-over 72 in her
LPGA Tour debut, while defending champion Lorie Kane shot a 63 to
take the first-round lead in the season-opening Takefuji Classic in
Waikoloa, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Wie, the 5-foot-10 seventh grader from Honolulu, had three birdies
and five bogeys in surprisingly calm conditions on the oceanside

<HD>Nguyen Stakes Claim in Arcadia</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Former Vietnamese refugee has a Santa Anita
Handicap longshot in Freedom Crest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fishing boat was less than 100 feet long, crammed with 140
Vietnamese refugees and piloted by a so-called captain  clueless
about their destination. There were rations that might last three
days, and toward the end of the third day, after a journey of more
than 500 miles across the South China Sea, this desperate party found
the coastline of Malaysia.</LD>
<LD>   Calvin Nguyen, then  9 years old, was on that boat, with his aunt
and uncle and a 12-year-old brother. Left behind in Vietnam were two
other Nguyen boys and their parents. Their father, a South Vietnamese
Navy man, was in his seventh year of what would be a 10-year
incarceration in a POW camp.</LD>
<LD>   "We got on that boat because we were looking for a better future,"
Nguyen says now of the 1983 journey. "We were in Malaysia for about a
month before we were sent to a camp in Indonesia. Six months after
that, through the intervention of the Catholic church, we wound up in
Florida. There we were, absolute strangers. It was incredible. We
didn't speak a word of English, those around us didn't know
Vietnamese, but what we had going for us was that we all shared a
common faith."</LD>
<TE>   Nguyen's first visit to a racetrack was also large dollops of
serendipity--more about that later--and his claiming of an
undistinguished gelding, his first horse, 10 years later has resulted
in a longshot chance at winning Saturday's $1-million Santa Anita
Handicap. Freedom Crest is 15-1 on the morning line, and probably
will go off at an even higher mutuel, but double-digit payoffs in the
Big 'Cap are not uncommon, and this year, with the expected favorite,
Mizzen Mast, on the sidelines, nicely priced challengers abound.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a mixed blessing when Mizzen Mast came out," said the
28-year-old Nguyen, who has moved from his brother's vitamin export
business to a career as a stockbroker. "Had he run, there probably
would have been only nine or 10 starters, and now there are 14.
Traffic could be a factor. The horse with the best trip will probably
win."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Freedom Crest had run twice for trainer Tony Diaz when he
ran him, for $32,000, in a six-furlong claiming race at Hollywood
Park. Nguyen (pronounced Win) went to the track with his eye on a
better-bred horse, Play Taps, in the same race. But Nguyen's trainer,
Richard Baltas, was attracted to Freedom Crest.</TE>
<TE>   "He fell in love with the horse," Nguyen said. "He said that he
looked like a runner. So we claimed him on that instinct."</TE>
<TE>   Running second the day he was claimed, Freedom Crest ran four more
times without winning.</TE>
<TE>   "We were having second thoughts," Nguyen said. "Play Taps went on
to win a maiden race by something like seven lengths, and then moved
into allowance company and also did well."</TE>
<TE>   In his eighth career start, in December  1999, Freedom Crest
finally landed in the winner's circle. He could have been claimed for
$40,000 by other trainers that day, and Baltas never ran him for a
claiming tag again.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, shrewdly spotted by Baltas, the horse had four wins,
three seconds and one third in eight starts, earning $147,360.  In
January 2001, Baltas tossed Freedom Crest into stakes company and he
won the Grade II San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   The season then had a bittersweet ending as Freedom Crest won
another Grade II, the Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita, before
running last in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, in his first start since then, Freedom Crest
will be asked Saturday to run 11/4 miles for only the second time.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the 13 [outside] post in New York, and maybe I ran him
back a little too soon," Baltas said. "I know it's a lot to ask of
him, but he's fit enough and he's beaten better horses before. We're
just happy to have a shot in the race."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, who moved with his aunt and uncle to California after
spending nine months in Florida, was reunited with his mother but
didn't really meet his father until 1990, when he was 17. His parents
live with two of their sons in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Nguyen and some friends, unable to get tickets for an
Angel game because Nolan Ryan, nearing a strikeout milestone, was
pitching for the visiting Texas Rangers, went to the quarter horses
at Los Alamitos instead. Nguyen netted $12 with the first bet he
made, went home with a profit of $32 and said to himself that he'd
like to own a horse some day.</TE>
<TE>   He now has six at Hollywood Park with Baltas, who met Nguyen
through a mutual friend at Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been around," said Baltas, 40, who between stints at the
track once worked as a bartender in Huntington Beach. "The last job I
had had at the track was as an assistant to [Richard Mandella]. At
the time I met Calvin, I was starving."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen chuckled as he recalled his entry into racing. "Here I am,"
he said, "thinking about buying a horse, and I'm with a trainer who
doesn't have any horses."</TE>
<TE>   The downside to running in the Santa Anita Handicap is that
Freedom Crest could finish last again, as he did in New York. But the
5-year-old gelding has already earned more than $600,000, and along
with it the reputation as one of racing's biggest bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew, who has suffered from neurological problems for two
years, will undergo back surgery soon in Lexington, Ky. A team from
the San Luis Rey Equine Hospital in Bonsall, Calif., will handle the
operation. Seattle Slew, 28, is the only living Triple Crown
champion.... Make it 93 in a row for the winless Zippy Chippy. The
11-year-old gelding finished eighth in a field of nine at Penn
National.  ... Scratch this year's Pimlico Special, the victim of a
purse shortfall at the Baltimore track.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You practically need an Ivy League education to figure out the race
this season in the only remaining Division I conference without a
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Let Edwin Draughan, a Yale freshman from Lakewood Mayfair High,
try to explain.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, Princeton is in first place at 9-2, we're in second at
9-3 and Penn is in third place at 8-3," said Draughan, Yale's leading
scorer at just shy of 12 points a game. "There's a real possibility
of a three-way tie, and if there is a three-way tie, we go to a
playoff where we play Princeton, then the winner goes on to play Penn
for the championship.</LD>
<TE>   "But for that to happen, Penn has to beat Princeton, and we have
to win our last two games."</TE>
<TE>   Put in terms everyone with a public university education can
understand:</TE>
<TE>   "It's real crazy," Draughan said.</TE>
<TE>   Yale could have clinched its first trip to the NCAA tournament
since 1962 with wins over Princeton and Pennsylvania last weekend but
lost both. Now the Bulldogs have to hope all the cards fall to clinch
the first three-way tie for the Ivy League title in history--creating
what would amount to a mini-conference tournament in the only league
that resists holding one.</TE>
<TE>   Penn, which won at Princeton, 62-38, in the first meeting and is
an impressive 21-6 overall, would get a first-round bye because it
would have the best head-to-head record among the three teams.</TE>
<TE>   Sites and dates for the potential mini-tournament have yet to be
determined, but need to be set quickly because the NCAA field is
announced March 10.</TE>
<TE>   The crucial Princeton-Penn game is Tuesday, with all three teams
also playing tonight and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It has all been quite a whirlwind for Draughan, who picked Yale
over Rutgers, Providence and Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   When he and Mayfair teammate Josh Childress--Stanford's
fourth-leading scorer as a freshman--parted ways, their prospects of
ending up in the NCAA tournament together seemed far-fetched. Now
there's at least a chance, but when the two talk on the phone, it
usually isn't about basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of compare school, how I think my classes at Yale are
extremely more difficult than his classes at Stanford--and he thinks
otherwise," Draughan said.</TE>
<TE>   Draughan chose Yale partly for the education, of course, but
partly because Coach James Jones persuaded him Yale could contend for
the Ivy League title, won by either Princeton or Penn in 31 of the
last 33 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I wasn't too interested. I didn't think it was too much
of a basketball powerhouse," Draughan said. "Coach Jones, he really
tried to tell me we were going to have a chance to go to the NCAA
tournament. I knew if not this year, sooner or later we could be in
the NCAAs."</TE>
<TE>   Although Yale (17-9) managed to win at Penn State and at Clemson
this season, Penn has been the real star of the Ivy League. Penn has
beaten Georgia Tech, Iowa State, Villanova, Temple and St. Joseph's
and had a Ratings Percentage Index of 41 through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Princeton (14-9) or Yale were to win the automatic bid, Penn
would have a case for an at-large bid, based on its 20-plus victories
and respectable RPI. If Penn wins the Ivy bid, the others stay home.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ivy League is making strides. As a conference, the Ivy RPI
is No. 13 this season as computed by collegerpi.com--a leap from 28th
last season that equals the largest by any conference since 1994,
when the statistic was first tracked.</TE>
<TE>   Going Ivy proved a good decision for Draughan. "Yale is not like
what most people think, all nerds. It's a pretty fun school," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yale, a party school?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a non-party school, I'll tell you that," said Draughan,
whose social life centers around the team and Saybrook residential
college, where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   "During football games, in the third quarter, there's something
called the Saybrook Strip," Draughan said. "I've never done that, and
I won't."</TE>

<HD>No Question, O'Neal Is Not Tapped Out</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How was Laker center Shaquille O'Neal preparing at the team's
HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo for tonight's game against
the Indiana Pacers?</LD>
<LD>   If you watched any of the local sportscasts Thursday night,
perhaps you noticed O'Neal had someone's head under his massive left
arm while he answered reporters' questions. That someone was
assistant public relations director Michael Uhlenkamp. Saying he was
tired of dumb questions, O'Neal put Uhlenkamp in a headlock and
announced he would tap Uhlenkamp's head every time a reporter asked
what O'Neal deemed a stupid question.</LD>
<LD>   Uhlenkamp got plenty of taps, although a tap from a 7-foot-1,
335-pound giant can be frightful.</LD>
<TE>   But if O'Neal starts tapping Brad Miller tonight, they won't be
love taps.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they faced each other, it was back in January when
Miller was a Chicago Bull. Incensed by what he thought were cheap
shots, O'Neal took a wild swing at Miller that was anything but
playful. Fortunately for Miller, O'Neal missed, but he was still
suspended for three games and fined $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was obtained by Indiana from the Bulls in a Feb. 19 trade.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was asked about Miller Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Tap, tap, tap.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't live in the past," O'Neal said. "I don't like dirty play.
[But] it doesn't really matter to me. I just want to get back on
track."</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson took the same stance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not putting any energy into it," he said of the
O'Neal-Miller faceoff. "Just let it be. Whatever it is, it is."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is sure to be asked about it again tonight. And when he is,
Uhlenkamp is sure to be as far away as possible.</TE>

<HD>Injury Sidelines Lemieux</HD>
<DH>Hockey: His future is in doubt because of painful hip that
will keep him out probably for the rest of the season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Lemieux, like Michael Jordan, is finding that trying to
recapture youth can be painful.</LD>
<LD>   Lemieux probably will miss the remainder of the season because of
a hip injury that has limited him to 24 games this season. It leaves
in question the future of the Pittsburgh Penguin player/owner, who
picked up an Olympic gold medal Sunday to go with his two Stanley Cup
championships.</LD>
<LD>   Lemieux, who said he still wanted to return next season, needed
several painkiller injections to keep him in Canada's lineup during
the Olympics. Now, with gold medal in hand, it remains to be seen if
he will be back on the ice or return to the owner's box.</LD>
<TE>   Lemieux, a six-time scoring champion in the NHL, follows another
legend to the sidelines. Jordan, who won six NBA championships with
the Chicago Bulls, had knee surgery Wednesday, possibly ending his
comeback season with the Washington Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, 36, has been bothered since training camp by the hip
injury, which nearly forced him to miss the Olympics. He had
arthroscopic surgery to remove loose cartilage on Oct. 29 and
returned two weeks later. But after playing in three games, he was
sidelined for two months while doctors tried to determine the cause
of his pain.</TE>
<TE>   As late as Tuesday, Lemieux said he was not considering sitting
out the rest of the season. But results of recent tests on his hip
revealed chronic tendinitis and inflammation. Doctors told Lemieux
that he risked further damage if he continued to play this season.</TE>
<TE>   "While I am disappointed I can't be in the lineup, I am satisfied
that I have identified the problem with my hip," Lemieux said. "The
doctors have told me that this period of rest and rehabilitation is
necessary so that I can make a full recovery and get back in the
lineup next season."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, like Jordan, has found duplicating success difficult. The
Wizards were 10th, half a game out of a playoff spot, on Thursday. A
big jump for the Wizards, but hardly a Jordan-type leap.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Penguins have struggled and could miss the playoffs
for the first time since the 1989-90 season. They were 12th in the
Eastern Conference after losing to the Kings, 5-4, Wednesday. Lemieux
had two assists in that game to become the seventh player in NHL
history to reach 1,600 points.</TE>
<TE>   He had six goals and 25 assists this season.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, who overcame back problems and Hodgkin's disease during
his first 13 seasons with the Penguins, retired after the 1996-97
season. He returned from a 44-month retirement in December 2000, and
his presence helped the Penguins reach the conference final last
spring.</TE>
<TE>   There was speculation that Lemieux returned only to prepare for
the Salt Lake City Olympics. He said this season that the Winter
Games were his priority, which angered Penguin fans.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lemieux said during the Olympics that he missed some
Penguin games because the Olympics took priority, he was shocked at
the reaction of the team's fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed by some of the comments made," Lemieux
said this week. "But I think if you look at my history with this
organization, I've always put the franchise first and that's not
going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Canada had not won an Olympic gold medal in 50 years and Lemieux
was instrumental in ending that drought. He sat out one game but
returned to score two goals against the Czech Republic in a key 3-3
tie.</TE>
<TE>   "Being around guys like Mario, guys who have won Stanley Cups, you
learn a lot," the Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya said. "The bigger the
games are, the less he changed. He played the same the first game in
the preliminary round as he did in the gold-medal game."</TE>

<KH>LOS ANGELES MARATHON Sunday, 8:30 a.m., Channel 9</KH>
<HD>Running Start</HD>
<DH>De La Cerda Was a Late Arrival to Marathon but Is Making Up
for Lost Time</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running a marathon was always in the back of Peter De La Cerda's
mind, and that's where it stayed for several years.</LD>
<LD>   He wanted no part of the grueling training, muscle cramps and
painful blisters that come with pounding the pavement for 26.2 miles.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole thing about running a marathon intimidated me," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   So how come De La Cerda can't wait to toe the starting line for
the Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday? He said he had a change of heart
a few years ago when he realized he would probably never fulfill his
dream of making the U.S. Olympic team as a 10,000-meter runner.</TE>
<TE>   Since his first marathon in 1999, De La Cerda, 30, has established
himself as one of America's best hopes for the 2004 Summer Games in
Athens, after narrowly failing to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Games.</TE>
<TE>   "If he stays healthy and he stays motivated, he should make [the
Olympic team]," said Joe Vigil, De La Cerda's coach at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista. "His chances are as good as
anyone's."</TE>
<TE>   De La Cerda's entry in the L.A. Marathon is a belated homecoming.
Despite the encouragement of family and friends, the Sylmar native
was unable to fit the race into his schedule until this year.</TE>
<TE>   He is the top-ranked American in the men's field and seeded No. 9
overall, indicative of the United States' lack of prowess in the
marathon, which has been dominated at the international level by
African runners in recent years. Kenyans have won the last three L.A.
Marathons and are five of the top seven entries in this year's men's
race.</TE>
<TE>   Unfazed, De La Cerda says he is shooting for a top-five finish.</TE>
<TE>   "My expectation is to run a [personal record]," he said.
"Considering it's a much faster course than past years, I think
that's a realistic goal."</TE>
<TE>   For the 17th running of the L.A. Marathon, the course has been
significantly changed to make it flatter. The first nine miles are
mostly downhill, with the rest of the course featuring mild upgrades
and downhills that are smaller than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   That should make for faster times, and De La Cerda hopes to shave
a minute or two off his personal best of 2 hours 15 minutes 10
seconds, established at the Chicago Marathon in October.</TE>
<TE>   Helping him along the course will be his own cheering section.</TE>
<TE>   "All of my family lives in the San Fernando Valley and they're
going to come out and watch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be something special for me."</TE>
<TE>   De La Cerda, who lives in Alamosa, Colo., with his wife, Ronda,
and two young sons, Isaiah and Elijah, was a good but not great
distance runner in high school.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Granada Hills High in 1989 after also attending
Mission Hills Alemany and Newhall Hart, the result of trying to find
the right academic fit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without a college scholarship offer, De La Cerda said he sat down
with his father, Philip, who advised him to take a couple of years
off from school and train on his own to allow himself to get
stronger. Two years later, at 19, De La Cerda enrolled at Adams State
in Alamosa, then an NCAA Division II power in cross-country and
track.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tutelage of Vigil (pronounced VEE-hill), then the Adams
State coach, De La Cerda won Division II titles in the outdoor 10,000
meters and indoor 5,000 as a sophomore in 1993. But his reign as
champion ended there after some top African runners enrolled at
Division II schools.</TE>
<TE>   "That pushed me out the next two years," he said. "I wasn't able
to repeat again."</TE>
<TE>   Concentrating on the 10,000 after college, De La Cerda said he
began to seriously think about switching to the marathon after he ran
several disappointing 10k times and failed to qualify for the Olympic
trials in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "When that year went by, I told myself I would get to the Olympic
trials in 2000 in some event, so I can give myself a chance to
qualify," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been training with a lot of marathoners in Alamosa, and
they were always encouraging me and asking me when I was going to run
one. It was just a matter of time."</TE>
<TE>   That day finally came in the fall of 1999, when De La Cerda ran
the Chicago Marathon and posted a qualifying mark of 2:18 for the
Olympic trials. He nearly qualified for the 2000 Games, but fell
short of the Olympic "A" qualifying standard after placing second at
the trials in Pittsburgh. The standard was 2:14. He ran 2:16:18 in
only his second marathon.</TE>
<TE>   During the race, De La Cerda endured the type of physical pain
that had initially scared him away from the marathon. His legs became
heavy at the 20-mile mark and a blister on his right foot bled
through his shoe. Still, he kept going.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what," he said afterward, "I wasn't going to run a
gutless race."</TE>
<TE>   Rod DeHaven passed De La Cerda for the lead during the 23rd mile
and won in a time of 2:15:30, automatically qualifying for the
Olympics by placing first.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to watch the Olympics that year knowing how close I
was to being there," De La Cerda said.</TE>
<TE>   But any frustration was offset by the fact that he had established
himself among America's top marathon runners. De La Cerda's stature
has grown in recent months while training in Chula Vista. He has
taken a leave of absence from his job as a high school history
teacher to train full time.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter has a lot more in him than he's displayed," said Vigil, 71,
who coached 19 national team champions in track and cross-country in
29 years at Adams State. "Hopefully he can put things together in
L.A. I think he's capable of [a] 2:12."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Collins, De La Cerda's training partner, agrees. Collins was
the top American finisher in last year's L.A. Marathon, clocking
2:17:47 to finish sixth overall, but is skipping the race this year
in favor of the Valley of the Sun Marathon in Phoenix on March 10.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said he and De La Cerda have been running an average of 17
miles a day and have benefited from the presence of one of the
world's top marathon runners, Khalid Khannouchi, who is also training
in Chula Vista. Khannouchi ran a world-best time of 2:05:42 in the
1999 Chicago Marathon while competing for Morocco. He became an
American citizen in 2000 and intends to compete for the U.S. in the
2004 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see what it's like at the top of the food chain,"
Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   De La Cerda wants to experience the same thing in the L.A.
Marathon, where his competition includes the winners of the last two
men's races--Kenyans Benson Mbithi (who ran 2:11:55 in 2000) and
Stephen Ndungu (2:13:13 in 2001).</TE>
<TE>   "If you say the Africans are unreachable, you're never going to
try and push yourself to that level," De La Cerda said. "Slowly, I
think American runners are making gains on African runners and the
rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be intimidated. You have to run your own race."</TE>

<HD>Team Penske Is Ready to Cart Away IRL Titles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first chapter of the Penske era in the Indy Racing League will be
written Saturday when the IRL opens its seventh season with the Grand
Prix of Miami at Homestead-Miami Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in south
Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Penske made a temporary foray into the IRL last year when
his two Brazilian drivers, Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran,
finished one-two in the Indianapolis 500 while still with CART, but
this time Marlboro Team Penske is a full-time IRL team.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm glad to see them competing in the IRL," said owner-driver
Eddie Cheever, the 1998 Indy 500 winner. "The Red Bull team is
looking forward to competing with Penske. The mistake everybody is
making is to say, 'Oh, oh, the best team from CART is coming over.'
What they should say is, 'The IRL just got stronger.'"</LD>
<TE>   In two years with Penske--the winningest team in Indy car
history--De Ferran won two CART championships, Castroneves won the
Indy 500 and the two drivers won 10 races between them.</TE>
<TE>   "Team Penske is the yardstick of success in any form of motor
sports," said Brian Barnhart, IRL vice president. "Their addition is
a tremendous asset."</TE>
<TE>   Facing the Penske invasion will be a strong force of IRL regulars,
from young Sam Hornish Jr., the defending series champion, to veteran
Al Unser Jr., returning with a new team, Kelley Racing, after Rick
Galles, his longtime car owner, dropped out for lack of a sponsor.
Unser, who lost 30 pounds in a reconditioning program before signing
with Kelley, will be 40 on April 19, but likes to point out that his
father, Al, won his fourth Indy 500 in 1987 when he was 47 and his
uncle Bobby also was 47 when he won Indy in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I feel like I'm in the best shape of my life, and I've
got the most experience of my entire life," he said after signing to
become Scott Sharp's teammate with Kelley Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish won last year's Homestead race en route to the IRL title
in his second season in the series and his first with Pennzoil
Panther Racing.</TE>
<TE>   There will be as many missing favorites as there will be
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kelley first dropped popular Mark Dismore to make room for
1999 champion Greg Ray, then dropped Ray for Unser Jr. Ray is still
looking.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Fisher, voted most popular driver in the IRL last year, is
without a ride because team owner Derrick Walker has been unable to
find a sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "We were close to signing a sponsor, but when it fell through, we
were short of money and time," said Walker, who fields a
Toyota-backed CART team with Tora Takagi. "Sarah is under contract to
Walker Racing and we hope to have her in a car as soon as possible.
The car is ready, the team is ready, Sarah is ready, but there's no
money."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's only 2002 ride at the moment is for the Toyota
Pro-Celebrity race during the Long Beach Grand Prix on April 13. In
last year's Homestead race, she finished a close second to Hornish,
but after an early-race crash with Scott Goodyear at Indianapolis,
she wasn't a factor the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Buzz Calkins, winner of the inaugural IRL race in 1996, has
retired and is looking for a sponsor to run his own team.</TE>
<TE>   Among the newcomers are rookies Tomas Scheckter--son of South
African Formula One champion Jody Scheckter--who was selected by
Cheever to drive a second Red Bull car, and George Mack of Los
Angeles, a former karter who hopes to follow Willy T. Ribbs and
become the second African American in Indy car racing.</TE>
<TE>   Formula One</TE>
<TE>   One more championship and Germany's Michael Schumacher will pull
even with the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio for the most Grand Prix
titles. The Ferrari driver's bid will begin this weekend with the
Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher already has the most individual wins, 53, and is an
overwhelming favorite to win a third consecutive championship in his
red Ferrari. His other two wins came with Benetton in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   For the race in Albert Park, a street circuit, Schumacher and
teammate Rubens Barrichello will be in last year's cars, saving the
appearance of the 2002 model until later in the 17-race season.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the plan to start the new year with the old car, but
the situation looks very positive," Schumacher said.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had enough experience [to run the new car] so this is
the situation we are faced with, and we just have to get the best out
of it."</TE>
<TE>   Former Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya, Schumacher's
chief challenger in a BMW Williams, says the Ferrari decision is a
mistake and he hopes to capitalize on it.</TE>
<TE>   "[It is] positive for us and negative for them if you really think
about it," the Colombian driver told Reuters. "If we came here with
last year's car we'd end up 10th on the grid. They're starting with a
car that last year had a lot of potential, but if they didn't change
the car a lot from last year, it might not be the winning car."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher had nine wins last year, Montoya one.</TE>
<TE>   An added interest in the 2002 opener will be the appearance of
Toyota's first entry in Formula One in cars driven by Alan McNish of
Scotland and Mika Salo of Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Fast Laps</TE>
<TE>   VW Bug-ins, one of the most popular attractions at old Orange
County International Raceway, will be revived Saturday at Irwindale
Speedway, sponsored by hotVWs magazine. Bug-ins were held at OCIR
from 1968 to 1983 when the track closed. Racing will start at 9 a.m.
on the eight-mile strip. Also scheduled is a VW swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   After drawing a sellout crowd for the World of Outlaws winged
sprint cars last week, Perris Auto Speedway will return to its roots
Saturday night when the Sprint Car Racing Assn. holds its first night
race of the season for nonwinged sprinters on the half-mile clay
oval. Bud Kaeding, winner of last year's Oval Nationals, will make
his first SCRA start of the season, along with two-time USAC sprint
car champion Tony Elliott and defending SCRA champion Cory Kruseman.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Parks, founder of the National Hot Rod Assn., received the
first Robert E. Petersen Lifetime Achievement Award in ceremonies
Thursday at the Hot Rod &amp; Performance Trade Show in Indianapolis.
Petersen, a publishing magnate who created Hot Rod Magazine and other
publications, made the presentation. The trophy honoring Parks will
be displayed at the Petersen Automotive Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Long, the Oak Park driver who finished second in the
British Formula Ford series last year, has signed to drive this
season in the British Formula Renault series. Finland's Kimi
Raikkonen, last year's Formula Renault champion, is now driving in
Formula One with McLaren as a replacement for former champion Mika
Hakkinen, who is taking a sabbatical.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Busch, 17, who was signed to drive in the Craftsman Truck
series for Jack Roush this year until NASCAR mandated an 18-year-age
limit, will drive in the ASA series for Roush. The ASA will be at
Irwindale Speedway on April 6-7. Kyle is the younger brother of
Winston Cup driver Kurt Busch.... The Los Angeles Kart Club, after
more than 15 years at Saugus Speedway, is moving to Irwindale
Speedway. Its first race will be March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Round 2 of the six-race Duralast SCORE Desert Series will take
place Saturday when more than 200 vehicles take off in the 16th
annual Tecate SCORE San Felipe 250. Enduro Racing teammates Dan Smith
and David Ashley, both of Riverside, will defend their championship
in the Trophy-Truck class in a Ford F-150. Although they have four
consecutive wins, including this year's season-opening Laughlin
Challenge, Smith and Ashley have never won the San Felipe race.</TE>

<HD>Miller's 37 Loud and Clear for Cavaliers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As usual, Andre Miller's whispers could barely be heard above the
buzz in the Cleveland Cavaliers' locker room.</LD>
<LD>   Moments earlier, Miller had made all kinds of noise out on the
court.</LD>
<LD>   Miller sank a buzzer-beating three-point basket to force overtime,
then scored eight of his career-high 37 points in the extra session
Thursday night to rally the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 114-107 win over
the San Antonio Spurs at Cleveland.</LD>
<TE>   "He came up big down the stretch," Cavalier forward Lamond Murray
said. "He's a marquee guy."</TE>
<TE>   And still a quiet one.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a decent night," said the modest, soft-spoken Miller. "We
needed to win this game."</TE>
<TE>   Miller made sure the Cavaliers did. He made four free throws and
two short jumpers in the final 2:27 of overtime as Cleveland finally
pulled away and won for the seventh time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who played 50 minutes, made his three-pointer from the top
of the key as time expired in regulation, tying it at 101-101 and
capping a frenetic final five minutes when the Cavaliers made up a
nine-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 35 points to lead the Spurs, and Malik Rose added
18 on seven-of-eight shooting. David Robinson added 17 for San
Antonio, which has lost three of four.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, too, was impressed with Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "He was great, absolutely incredible," Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a lot of tough shots. It's one thing when we give up
wide-open jumpers. But it seemed like every time he turned and shot,
we had somebody in his face."</TE>
<TE>   Utah 114, Memphis 70--Donyell Marshall scored 20 points and Bryon
Russell had 13 as the Jazz won at Salt Lake City in only their second
home game during February.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz, who lost twice to the Grizzlies this season, played
their first home game since Feb. 2 after being displaced for nine
games by the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone (1,330 games) passed Moses Malone for fourth place on
the NBA's career games played list.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 107, Indiana 100--Stephon Marbury scored 26 points,
including nine in the final 31.8 seconds of regulation and four in
overtime, as the Suns rallied at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Miller, playing only his third game with Indiana after being
traded by Chicago, scored 25 points--including 13 in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 100, New York 86--With four reserves in the game, the Heat
made nine consecutive shots and scored the first 16 points of the
fourth quarter at Miami to rally past the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Jones had 32 points for the Heat, which has won 16 of 22 but
is still eight games below .500 (24-32).</TE>

<HD>Tyson Wants Michigan License to Be Reinstated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Tyson is applying to have his Michigan boxing license reinstated
in a possible attempt to fight heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in
Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Jerome P. Barney, chairman and chief financial officer of
Detroit-based All World International Network LLC, said Thursday that
Tyson's application was expected to be delivered today to the state
Athletic Board of Control.</LD>
<LD>   Barney said he was confident he could win state approval and
persuade Tyson and Lewis to hold a June fight at Joe Louis Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Barney said Detroit's long history of boxing and the presence of
downtown casinos make it an ideal place to hold what he called "the
fight of the new millennium."</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be world news," he said. "Detroit is going to be
a world stage."</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor, said the chances that Tyson would
choose to fight in Michigan are "very high." He said he was working
on a deal that would bring the fight to the state.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World light-heavyweight boxing champion Roy Jones Jr. plans to
speak today with International Olympic Committee member Sandra
Baldwin regarding the controversial decision that cost Jones a gold
medal at the 1988 Seoul Games.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, the U.S. Olympic Committee president who was made an IOC
member at the Salt Lake City Games, had said she would take up Jones'
case in the aftermath of another controversial decision last month
involving a Canadian pairs figure skating duo, who were awarded a
duplicate gold medal several days after improper judging was
uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   Most ringside observers believed that Jones easily had won the
fight. Later, according to minutes from the IOC's board meeting,
boxing judges at those Games acknowledged receiving $300 a day from
South Korean officials, purportedly for meals and taxi rides.</TE>
<TE>   An employee of former heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman and a
woman were found dead with gunshot wounds to the head in a car
registered to the boxer, Baltimore police said.</TE>
<TE>   The man and woman were identified as Oliver L. McCafferty, 29, and
Lisa R. Brown, 28.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they don't believe Rahman was involved in the
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Kevin Daniels, a police spokesman, said investigators "have
no known suspects or motives."</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt fought off four match points and won the
final five points of a third-set tiebreaker to beat Paradom
Srichaphan, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 7-6 (6) in the Siebel Open at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Martin beat defending champion Greg Rusedski, 6-3, 7-6 (5).
James Blake also advanced to the quarterfinals, beating Belgium's
Xavier Malisse, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Andre Agassi beat Sargis Sargsian, 6-2, 6-4, to
reach the quarterfinals. Third-seeded Andy Roddick beat Davide
Sanguinetti, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (4), 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jennifer Capriati won her first match in the State Farm
Women's Tennis Classic, defeating Alexandra Stevenson, 6-4, 6-4, at
Scottsdale, Ariz. In a night match, Nathalie Dechy of France beat
fourth-seeded Meghann Shaughnessy, 7-5, 6-2.... Anna Kournikova
advanced to the semifinals of the Abierto Mexicano Pegaso tournament
in Acapulco after defeating Slovakia's Janette Husarova, 6-3, 6-4.
Kournikova, seeking her first WTA Tour title, will face Slovakia's
Katarina Srebotnik, a 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4 winner over fourth-seeded
Cristina Torrens Valero.... Defending champion Juan Carlos Ferrero
was forced to retire from his second-round match at the $1-million
Dubai Open in the United Arab Emirates because of a thigh injury.
Younes El Aynaoui was leading, 7-5, 4-6, 2-1, when a left thigh
strain forced Ferrero to quit.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Tennis Assn. selected Charlotte, N.C., to be the site for
a first-round Federation Cup series against Austria next month. The
U.S. team, led by captain Billie Jean King, will face the Austrians
on clay in a best-of-five series April 27-28 at the Olde Providence
Racquet Club.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   The governing body of European soccer called for an investigation
into an accusation that bribes were paid to ensure Sepp Blatter's
election as FIFA president.</TE>
<TE>   Farah Addo, a vice president of the governing body of African
soccer, said he was offered money to support Blatter in his race
against Lennart Johansson, president of the Union of European
Football Associations.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to identify the name or nationality of the person who
offered the payment.</TE>

<HD>Bills Release Inconsistent Johnson, Save $6 Million</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rob Johnson, once considered the Buffalo Bills' long-term
quarterback, was released by the team Thursday, proving too
expensive, inconsistent and injury-prone.</LD>
<LD>   Along with saving more than $6 million in salary-cap money, the
Bills released a player who failed to live up to his strong-armed,
athletic potential during four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, a former USC standout, had one year left on his contract,
and was due a $2.5-million bonus today if he remained on the team's
roster.</LD>
<TE>   The Bills also announced that they released veteran cornerback Ken
Irvin, saving another $1.9 million in salary-cap money.</TE>
<TE>   Bill President and General Manager Tom Donahoe said Johnson's
salary-cap figure proved too expensive, and the two sides were unable
to negotiate a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We wish him the best," Donahoe said. "We stated from the
beginning that we would have liked to have Rob remain with our club,
but we could not afford the salary-cap figure of his current
contract."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Giants cut out the longtime heart and soul of their
defense, releasing five-time all-pro linebacker Jessie Armstead in a
salary-cap move.</TE>
<TE>   Two other starters, safety Sam Garnes and offensive tackle Lomas
Brown, and two backups, quarterback Jason Garrett and cornerback Dave
Thomas, also were released.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Howard Cross, the last player link to New York's Super
Bowl win over Buffalo in 1991, announced his retirement after 13
years with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants also restructured the contracts of cornerback Jason
Sehorn, receiver Amani Toomer, running back Tiki Barber and defensive
tackle Keith Hamilton in cutting $10 million in salary to get under
the NFL's $71.1-million salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee Titans released four-time all-pro safety Blaine
Bishop, linebacker Eddie Robinson, receiver Chris Sanders and
cornerback DeRon Jenkins and restructured three more contracts to get
below the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop was due to count $5.8 million against the salary cap, with
Robinson scheduled for $2.25 million in the final year on each of
their contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans restructured several contracts over the last week to
clear more cap space, including a new deal for offensive lineman
Bruce Matthews, who is expected to retire in June.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Dolphins cut defensive tackle Tim Bowens then re-signed
him an hour later to a five-year, $15-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   As negotiations progressed, the Dolphins had to release Bowens.
But one hour later, Bowens signed a new contract with Miami rather
than test the free-agent market.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought about going into the open market but felt good about
the Dolphins' contract, and Tim did not want to leave," said his
agent, Drew Rosenhaus. "We're happy with the way things are going for
him there and just want to keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers waived running back Dorsey Levens, allowing
him to test his value on the free-agent market but leaving the door
open for his return.</TE>
<TE>   Levens, 31, an eight-year veteran, wants to be a starter again.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to play on grass to save his legs after battling
injuries for much of his career. Levens' departure saves the Packers
more than $2 million in cap room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ray Mickens had his contract extended by the New York Jets, who
lost both starting cornerbacks to Houston in the expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   The team also released starting strong safety Victor Green and
signed punter Daniel Pope.</TE>
<TE>   Mickens, a seven-year veteran, was primarily the nickel back last
season and started three games when Aaron Glenn injured a knee.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn and Marcus Coleman, the other starter, were taken by the
Texans as the Jets attempted to free up money under the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jacksonville Jaguars released cornerback Aaron Beasley and
voided the contracts of linebacker Kevin Hardy and defensive end
Renaldo Wynn.</TE>
<TE>   The moves save the Jaguars about $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Cowboys cut center Mark Stepnoski, safety George Teague
and tight end Jackie Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Stepnoski and Teague were exposed in last week's expansion draft
but weren't chosen by the Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a difficult decision involving three players who played a
big part in helping us get things headed in a positive direction last
year," Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Stepnoski, whose contract was through 2003, would have counted
more than $4 million against the Cowboys' salary cap next season when
his actual salary would have been $2.75 million.</TE>
<TE>   He was due a $250,000 roster bonus today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Engram, the wide receiver who caught 29 passes for 400 yards
for Seattle last season, signed a one-year contract with the
Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-year veteran was scheduled to become an unrestricted
free agent today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A league source said that a tentative schedule for next season
includes an opener on Thursday, Sept. 5, at Giants Stadium between
the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers. It would be televised by
ESPN. The first Sunday of the season is Sept. 8.... Albert Connell
was released by the New Orleans Saints, who suspended the wide
receiver Dec. 19 after he was arrested on charges of stealing more
than $4,000 from teammate Deuce McAllister.... The Baltimore Ravens
cut two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Sam Adams.... ESPN reported
that former UCLA linebacker Donnie Edwards was released by the Kansas
City Chiefs.... Indianapolis Colt quarterback Peyton Manning sued a
Staten Island sports memorabilia dealer for fraud and breach of
contract, saying he is owed $105,000 for autographing 2,500 items,
including footballs, helmets and jerseys.... The Cincinnati Bengals
have hired former Ohio State coach John Cooper as a part-time
consultant to help scout college players and assess them for the NFL
draft.</TE>

<HD>Anglers Seek Support at Show</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Next week at this time, the ocean could come alive with albacore,
yellowtail or other popular game fish, and it would practically go
unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   That's because a different kind of frenzy will be in progress on
shore.</LD>
<LD>   The annual five-day celebration of a new fishing season, known as
the Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and Boat Show, begins Wednesday at the
Long Beach Convention Center. Tens of thousands of anglers will
convene to stock up on the latest in gear and tackle, and learn from
experts when and where to go and what to do once they get there.</LD>
<TE>   This is as big an event as the season's first runs on any of the
so-called "exotics"; in its 55th year, as much a tradition as the
Eastern Sierra trout season opener.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, the show will be about more than just fun and
games. The mood will be tempered by an important issue--the seemingly
imminent closure of many prime fishing grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that will affect all of us," said Tom Raftican,
president of the United Anglers of Southern California. "It's a
saltwater issue right now, but clearly it'll become a freshwater
issue in the future."</TE>
<TE>   United Anglers will use the show as a platform to seek "broader
support" for what already is a hotly contested battle between
fishermen and environmental groups over marine protected areas, or
MPAs.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of MPAs, designed to help the recovery and
conservation of several species of rockfish and other bottom fishes,
was mandated as part of the 1999 Marine Life Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   That plan was to have been finalized this year, but the issue
generated such a furor that the Department of Fish and Game requested
an extension so it could restart the process, set up committees and
obtain more input from those who would be most affected by closures.</TE>
<TE>   An extension was granted by the Legislature and the California
Fish and Game Commission now has until Dec. 1, 2003, to adopt a
version of the DFG's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a separate process dealing with the Channel Islands
National Marine Sanctuary is underway. And because this issue will be
decided much sooner--the adoption hearing is Aug. 1-2 in San Luis
Obispo--it is of more immediate concern to all parties involved.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed regulations include six alternative networks protecting
12% to 34% of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary waters; an
alternative for no change to the existing system; and an alternative
to include the Channel Islands marine reserves process with the
coast-wide process under the Marine Life Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   A science panel within the Marine Reserve Working Group
recommended closing 30% to 50% of sanctuary waters to fishing. The
DFG and sanctuary manager have proposed closing 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups, naturally, support maximum closure.
Sportfishing interests favor the latter alternative because,
"Stakeholders need to have the ability to look at the whole area
around the Channel Islands and the mainland and come up with a
comprehensive decision on a network [of reserves] they can support,"
said Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California.</TE>
<TE>   "Splitting out [Channel Islands] waters and having that as a
separate process cripples the committee members' ability to mix and
match closed areas in a way that will allow for the creation of some
marine reserves while minimizing economic loss to the fishing
communities and the industries that rely on access to productive
fishing grounds."</TE>
<TE>   The matter will be discussed March 7 during the Fish and Game
Commission's 10 a.m. meeting at Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute in
San Diego. Public testimony on the issue is the fifth item on the
agenda, meaning it will probably begin sometime before the 2 p.m.
opening of the Fred Hall show.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time, Mike Nussman, president of the American
Sportfishing Assn., will be conducting a news conference at the show
to announce results of an independent study ASA spokesman Forbes
Darby said "shines new light on the economics used to evaluate
closures in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary."</TE>
<TE>   Darby wouldn't elaborate, but added, "They significantly
underestimated what closing off large percentages of the sanctuary to
sportfishing would do to California's economy."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of MPAs won't have a presence at the show, but they
will be well represented at the Fish and Game Commission meeting,
just as they've been at previous meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Their latest weapon is a poll commissioned by the conservation
group SeaWeb, showing that 71% of Californians favor the creation of
marine reserves.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of the meeting, the National Resources Defense Council
issued a news release warning of an ocean in peril and touting MPAs
as the best means by which sea creatures can be saved.</TE>
<TE>   "In the United States, where our terrestrial park and wilderness
system is a cherished treasure, the idea of comparable sites in the
ocean was long overdue," the NRDC's release said.</TE>
<TE>   The group is armed with results of studies revealing the apparent
success of reserves in other states. One example is a no-take
sanctuary near the Kennedy Space Station in Florida, where more and
larger fish are being found.</TE>
<TE>   Sportfishing industry leaders claim the findings have more to do
with the banning of gill-nets--previously used by commercial
fishermen within the reserve--and not with the removal of
hook-and-line anglers, whose impact, they maintain, was negligible.</TE>
<TE>   Raftican says that the banning of gill-nets 10 years ago off
California is having the same effect in our waters, pointing to
impressive recent runs of white sea bass and halibut.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups are adamant that traditional management
techniques, such as catch and size limits, aren't working and point
to the decline of certain species of rockfish. Sportfishing groups
are just as adamant that nature's cycles have been a factor in the
plight of rockfish, which are highly susceptible to warm-water events
such as El Ninos.</TE>
<TE>   MPAs might be beneficial to some degree, they grudgingly
acknowledge, but they are not a proven management tool, nor the cure
to what ails our fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be talking about integrating the use of marine
reserves with fisheries management, not using reserves as the tool by
placing reserves at the magnitude proposed by the MRWG co-chairs and
the environmentalists," says Fletcher, a former DFG deputy director.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is ultimately up to the appointed commission
members, who by now must be wishing they had stuck to their real
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Not much has changed for this year's show, which will feature more
than 2,000 tackle, boating and travel displays. The popular Bongos
Girls fashion show is back, as is the kids-fish-free fishing pond,
and there will be hourly seminars featuring local and national
experts. Among new attractions: The Paul Bunyan Lumberjacks show; a
kayak demonstration pool; and bass-fishing guru Jimmy Houston, who
will appear Wednesday only at the Shimano booth.</TE>
<TE>   Hours are 2-10 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturday and 10
a.m.-7 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $10 for adults and free for those 15
and younger.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater Fishing</TE>
<TE>   News item: Robert Vandevelde of Whittier catches a 26.08-pound
rainbow trout at Santa Ana River Lakes, setting a potential state
record (the current record is a 23-pounder caught two years ago in
Northern California's Lake Natoma).</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Big deal. Vandevelde's catch came less than a week after
another potential record rainbow was pulled from the small Anaheim
fishery.</TE>
<TE>   Both fish were purchased at record size from a private hatchery
and stocked days earlier, proving only that hatcheries are getting
better at growing fish. When one of them grows a rainbow that can
beat the all-tackle world-record 42.2-pounder caught 32 years ago at
Bell Island, Alaska, now that'll be a big deal. And you can bet SARL
reps will be there to purchase it.</TE>
<TE>   Hunting</TE>
<TE>   The spring turkey-hunting season begins March 30 and a successful
hunter is making the rounds. Wayne Carlton, whose calling techniques
have enabled him to shoot gobblers in 11 states, will give free
seminars Thursday night at 6 at Turner's Outdoorsman in West Covina,
and next Friday night at 6 at the chain's San Marcos store. Details:
(626) 858-8948 and (760) 741-1570, respectively. On March 9, he will
headline Spring Turkey Hunting Day at Raahauge's Shooting Enterprises
in Norco. Details: (909) 735-7981.</TE>
<TE>   Whale Watching</TE>
<TE>   The American Cetacean Society's annual "Around Catalina With John
Olguin" trip is March 9, embarking from the Catalina Express Terminal
in San Pedro at 9:30 a.m. and returning at 4 p.m. Olguin is the
director emeritus of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. The trip is timed
to coincide with the peak northbound migration of California gray
whales. Cost is $40 for adults, $35 for ACS members and seniors, and
$25 for children 12 and under. Details: (310) 548-6279.</TE>

<LD>Curtis Borchardt scored 28 points, one shy of his career-high, to
pick up the slack from an injured Casey Jacobsen and No. 17 Stanford
held off No. 14 Arizona, 76-71, Thursday night in Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-foot junior scored 10 points over the final 1:44, including
going six for six from the free-throw line in the last 15 seconds. He
also got an offensive rebound after teammate Teyo Johnson missed two
free throws with six seconds to go and Stanford, 18-8 overall and
11-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference, leading, 74-71.</LD>
<LD>   Borchardt, who finished 11 for 11 from the line, was fouled by
Salim Stoudamire on the play and made two free throws with 4.2
seconds left to seal the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Jason Gardner scored 33 points for the Wildcats (18-7, 11-6),
whose loss ended any shot at a share of the Pac-10 title. Stanford,
Arizona, USC and UCLA are all tied for third.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, the Pac-10's leading scorer at 23.8 points per game,
left the game with 4:07 to go in the first half with a cut above his
right eye. He received five stitches and returned early in the second
half, but a more extensive medical exam was planned after the game.</TE>
<TE>   The junior, who was an All-American last season, finished with a
season-low six points on two-for-seven shooting.</TE>
<TE>   With Stanford leading, 68-66, Johnson's pass was intercepted by
Gardner, who threw it to Rick Anderson streaking to the basket. But
Johnson blocked Anderson's layup as the crowd booed loudly, believing
a foul should have been called.</TE>
<TE>   California 91, Arizona State 80--Shantay Legans and Amit Tamir
each made a late three-point basket that allowed the No. 21-ranked
Bears to pull away from the Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Legans, who had 20 points, five assists and four steals, made his
fourth three-point shot in as many tries with 2:45 to play, opening a
77-70 lead. Tamir, who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds,
made his 25 seconds later to make it 80-72.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Shipp also had 18 points for the Bears (21-6, 12-5), who are
alone in second place in the conference, one game behind Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Smith had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Arizona State
(14-12, 7-10), while injured center Chad Prewitt had 17 of his 19
points in the second half. Prewitt partially tore a ligament in his
right elbow during practice on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually have the ball in close situations like that," Legans
said of his crucial basket. "The coaches have confidence in me, and I
have confidence in myself, so I just shot it."</TE>
<TE>   Cal, which finished 17-1 at home, rallied to win for the fourth
time in nine road games.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils led, 59-53, after Smith made a layup off an
inbounds pass with 9:36 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But they went nearly six minutes without another field goal, and
Cal caught up and went ahead with a 17-4 run that lasted 4:23.</TE>
<TE>   "We took advantage of some mismatches, and everybody contributed
to this one," Cal Coach Ben Braun said. "We seemed to exploit
whatever opportunities we had in the second half--Joe Shipp was
scoring on the blocks, Ryan [Forehan]-Kelly was getting some open
jumpers, Shantay nailed a few, Amit gave us some big baskets."</TE>
<TE>   Legans made two free throws with 6:16 to play as the Bears
regained the lead, 64-63.</TE>
<TE>   After a putback by Forehan-Kelly, Legans made two free throws
after a technical foul was called on Smith for shoving Forehan-Kelly,
and Cal led, 68-63.</TE>
<TE>   "I got caught pushing the guy," Smith said. "It was retaliation
from a couple of plays before, and I got caught for the technical,
and from that point our team went down."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was pulled after the technical and did not return to the
game.</TE>

<HD>One Last Shot Against Stanford</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: Pacific 10 teams taking aim at Cardinal
(27-1) in inaugural tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>When players from Oregon and Washington State walk onto McArthur
Court tonight, they will shoot Pacific 10 Conference women's
basketball into a new era.</LD>
<LD>   Those teams will get the Pac-10's first women's postseason
tournament underway. Their first-round game will be followed by UCLA
against California.</LD>
<LD>   But the real battles aren't expected until Saturday, when the
quarterfinal games are played. With the exception of Stanford, the
remaining teams are fighting for their NCAA or National Invitation
Tournament lives.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be the most intense conference tournament and one of the
most unpredictable," USC Coach Chris Gobrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no easy way out; you have to play someone who can beat
you. And everyone except Stanford has to do something to get into the
NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford--the regular-season conference champion and second-ranked
team in the country--is an NCAA lock no matter what happens.</TE>
<TE>   But the 27-1 Cardinal, which is riding a 20-game winning streak
and has outscored the other Pac-10 teams by 19.7 points a game,
aren't lacking motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we have to win the tournament to get a No. 1 [NCAA] seed,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (17-10) and Arizona State (21-8), seeded second and
third, are the next good bets to get NCAA bids.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we an NCAA team? I don't know," Arizona State Coach Charli
Turner Thorne said. "We need to come back [from last week's loss to
Arizona]. In my mind, we have to win on Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   USC (15-12), Oregon State (15-13) and Arizona (14-13) probably
need to win the tournament and its automatic bid to make the NCAA
field.</TE>
<TE>   But if they can fight into Monday's championship game, or have a
strong semifinal showing on Sunday, those teams could appear on the
NIT's short list.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (15-12) did not necessarily want to play a first-round
game. But, as the host school, their appearance today could boost
interest and attendance. In turn, the hometown fans could provide an
emotional wave that carries the Ducks through the weekend and to a
postseason bid.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford sophomore guard Nicole Powell was selected as the
conference player of the year. USC's Ebony Hoffman and Aisha Hollans
were named to the all-conference team. The Trojans' Rachel Woodward
was named to the freshman team.</TE>

<HD>End of the Race, but Not the End of the World, for USC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it was a ballet of the incompetent at the Sports Arena
Thursday night. Basketballs were bouncing off heads and backsides,
skittering out of bounds, flying into the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it was the stampede of the desperate, two basketball
teams in a thunderous race to a rebound, to a defensive position, to
a place where the jump shot was wide open and available, to first
place, to a grasping, clasping share of the Pac-10 regular-season
title.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the newly reconstituted Pac-10 tournament, the Pac-10
regular season championship is highly valued. So highly valued that
USC and Oregon alternated between breathtaking brilliance and comedic
clumsiness.</LD>
<TE>   USC alum Tom Selleck came to the game and when we're stargazing at
the Sports Arena, that's a sign the event is a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not make it too big a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks came from 11 points behind with 11 minutes to play and
beat the Trojans, 67-65. For the fourth time this season, the Trojans
were beaten just before the buzzer. Everybody in the Sports Arena
stood for the final 20 seconds, after David Bluthenthal had tied the
score with a three-pointer. The collective groan that came after
Frederick Jones scooted free for the winning basket with one second
left rumbled and shook the old building.</TE>
<TE>   The loss cost USC a shot at any part of that regular-season title
and, yes, that is a very big disappointment. It is an honor and a
point of pride and something Trojan male basketball players have not
been able to brag about for a very long time.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the tournament," Sam Clancy said, "and if we win that,
everybody will forget about these losses." Clancy was speaking of
this game and of last Saturday's bad outing at California.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe he's right.</TE>
<TE>   With so many teams so close to first place, and sixth place, it is
dangerous to make too much of a single game. It is not the time to
take one game at a time, nor is it the occasion to chew over one game
for more than a moment.</TE>
<TE>   In games like Thursday's, between teams almost certain to find
themselves in the NCAA tournament, it is more about finding one's
way. It is the time for teams to work out the kinks, to learn how to
pat down the wild emotions, find out how to make shots even when your
mouth is too dry for spit, to rein in the need to make the dangerous
full-court pass when the solid, sound pass is the safe and right way
to play.</TE>
<TE>   There was no predicting, from moment to moment, which of these
teams was going to have the momentum. There was no predicting, from
moment to moment, whether Clancy, the senior, wouldmake an 18-foot
jump shot or miss a layup, whether Errick Craven, the freshman, would
wow the crowd with a fancy reverse or a goofy pass to nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's shooters were good at finding the safe spots and not
always good at making the shots.</TE>
<TE>   This is the spotlight USC and Oregon aren't accustomed to. UCLA,
Arizona, Stanford, those teams have played in the glare of
expectations, accepted the pressure of being at the top of the
conference, of playing deep into the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Even after their Elite Eight run of a year ago, the Trojans have
not been considered by the "experts" a true basketball powerhouse in
the Pac-10. And Oregon was picked to finish sixth in the league.</TE>
<TE>   When USC was up, 50-39, a blowout seemed imminent.</TE>
<TE>   But Clancy got his fourth foul with 10:13 left and the Trojans
leading, 53-46. Clancy went for a block of a Luke Jackson shot and it
appeared he may have gotten the block cleanly. The officials
disagreed. Coach Henry Bibby said afterward that he considered the
block a clean one and Clancy's aggressiveness the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing basketball," Bibby said, "and that was a basketball
play. And I thought it was a pretty good play."</TE>
<TE>   But as a senior--and on a night when his senior teammates, Brandon
Granville and David Bluthenthal, were going to shoot a collective
three for 17 from the field--Clancy must understand that he might
need to pass up the block attempt and keep himself on the court. When
he came back in the game nearly five minutes later, the Trojans were
one point behind.</TE>
<TE>   "If I play with four fouls," Clancy said, "I'm tentative."</TE>
<TE>   The argument wasn't about whether Clancy should stay in the game
with four fouls, though. It was about trying for that block. Clancy,
who finished with 25 points and nine rebounds, was needed on the
court and not the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "At times," Craven said, "we depend on Sam. When Sam went out, the
offense kind of stagnated. Without Sam, everybody was kind of
standing around."</TE>
<TE>   Granville and Bluthenthal also needed to come up bigger on this
night of grand opportunity. Granville scored four points, Bluthenthal
five and that's not enough. It's not enough for USC to score 65
points and it's not enough to keep losing these great games at the
buzzer and it's definitely not enough for Granville and Bluthenthal
to total nine points in the biggest game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But Clancy is right. This game will mean nothing if the Trojans
win the Pac-10 tournament or have another great NCAA run. This game
will be forgotten if the Trojans beat somebody at the buzzer next
week at Staples Center. And this game could mean everything if the
USC seniors take from it the resolve to play hard but also smart, to
calm the nerves and make the shots and stay in the game.</TE>

<HD>New Red Sox Owners Quickly Fire Duquette</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Duquette, the controversial and aloof Boston Red Sox general
manager who brought Pedro Martinez to Fenway Park but inexplicably
let Roger Clemens leave, was fired Thursday, less than 24 hours after
the team's new owners completed their $660-million purchase of the
franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Duquette, whose eight-year tenure was marked by his contentious
relationship with fans, reporters and players, was replaced on an
interim basis by the club's assistant general manager, Mike Port, the
no-frills executive who served as Angel general manager from 1984 to
'91.</LD>
<LD>   Showing an emotional side he rarely displayed in Boston, Duquette,
a native of Dalton, Mass., and a graduate of Amherst College, choked
back tears as he said farewell to his dream job during a news
conference in Fort Myers, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm most disappointed that I will not have the opportunity to
realize the goal Red Sox fans and I have shared for too long: a World
Series championship," he said. "No one loves the Red Sox more than I
do."</TE>
<TE>   Duquette will be paid until Jan. 26, 2004, as part of the
three-year, $4.5-million contract extension given to him by the
previous owners. Port, 56, has been Boston's assistant general
manager since 1993 and vice president of baseball operations since
1996. It was unclear how long Port would be interim general manager.
"It could take a few weeks or a few months," said Larry Lucchino, the
team's new president under new owners John Henry and Tom Werner.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a key long-term decision that should not be dictated by a
clock or a calendar."</TE>
<TE>   Port was surprised by the move, saying he wasn't sure if he would
be part of a housecleaning or the beneficiary of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an awesome responsibility ... and I am ready and prepared to
accept it," Port said.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Port was the Dan Duquette of the 1980s. Cautious,
guarded and conservative in style and apparel, he was one of the
first general managers to talk more like a lawyer and less like a
baseball man when he replaced Buzzie Bavasi on Sept. 1, 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Port began sentences with phrases such as, "At this point in
time," and "I submit to you," a language one writer dubbed
"Port-ugese" and turned off players and agents. Port was viewed by
some as cold and calculating.</TE>
<TE>   Port made many minor deals but seemed reluctant to pull the
trigger on major deals. One of his best trades came at the end of
1985, when he acquired pitcher John Candelaria, outfielder George
Hendrick and reliever Al Holland for pitchers Pat Clements and Bob
Kipper, and outfielder Mike Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Many criticized the deal because Clements and Brown were
considered top prospects, but Candelaria played a key role in the
Angels' 1986 division-title run, going 10-2 in 16 starts, most of
them in the second half. The Angels came within one pitch of the
World Series that October before a devastating Game playoff loss and
an eventual American League championship series loss to the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Like Port, Duquette's Red Sox teams won only one division title,
in 1995, but they did earn wild-card playoff berths in 1998 and '99.</TE>
<TE>   While Duquette's greatest coup was acquiring Martinez from the
salary-dumping Montreal Expos for pitchers Carl Pavano and Tony Armas
Jr. in 1997, he will also be remembered for driving Clemens, the most
accomplished pitcher in Red Sox history, out of town after the 1996
season.</TE>
<TE>   Duquette miscalculated Clemens' market value, saying the future
Hall of Famer was "in the twilight of his career."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens left and won three more Cy Young awards and two World
Series rings.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, a rift developed when temperamental outfielder Carl
Everett quarreled with then-manager Jimy Williams, but Duquette
failed to back his manager, saying it was "more important how
[Everett] produces on the field." Several Boston players fumed at the
general manager.</TE>
<TE>   And last year, Duquette spent $110 million on player salaries in
an attempt to end the Red Sox's 83-year championship drought, only to
have the season disintegrate amid a series of injuries and turmoil
and Williams' firing as manager.</TE>

<DL>FAYETTEVILLE, Ark.</DL>
<LD>The drama surrounding Arkansas basketball Coach Nolan Richardson
deepened Thursday when he had a 90-minute meeting with Chancellor
John White and Athletic Director Frank Broyles, canceled a news
conference and skipped practice.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting with White and Broyles ended without a resolution of
Richardson's status, but Little Rock station KATV reported that
Richardson rejected an offer to buy out the remaining six years of
his $1.03 million-a-year contract. The university declined to say if
an offer was made.</LD>
<LD>   White's office released a statement saying: "The discussions from
this morning are continuing. The university expects to resolve the
situation soon and we'll have no further statements until that time."</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Richardson, an African American, criticized reporters
and fans, closed practices and questioned why only white reporters
were assigned to cover the team. He has been under fire since making
the remarks.</TE>

<HD>So Far, Crenshaw Goes Gentle Into Seniors</HD>
<DH>Golf: Two-time Masters champion will make tournament at
Valencia his third start with the over-50 set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words rebirth, renewal or reinvention--whichever you want to
use--don't seem to connect with a newly minted 50-year-old, at least
at first glance. Senior PGA Tour golf, of course, is an exception. It
works on both sides, potentially revitalizing the tour with an
infusion of new faces and on the other side, delivering a vital
career boost to the player.</LD>
<LD>   Case in point: Ben Crenshaw.</LD>
<LD>   Crenshaw, who turned 50 on Jan. 11, will be featured in the
$1.45-million SBC Senior Classic, which starts today and continues
through Sunday at the Valencia Country Club in Santa Clarita.</LD>
<TE>   This is Crenshaw's third event on the senior tour. He was supposed
to make his debut at the Royal Caribbean Classic in Key Biscayne,
Fla., but withdrew because of flu symptoms. In February, he tied for
43rd at the ACE Group Classic in Naples, Fla., and tied for 64th at
the Verizon Classic in Lutz, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fascinated by the way the players play," Crenshaw said. "It's
very, very competitive. I feel sort of out of tournament shape, not
swinging with a lot of confidence yet....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxious. It may take me a little while."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw isn't the only new high-profile addition. Fuzzy Zoeller
made his debut this year and said he plans on making a full-time
commitment, playing 20-plus tournaments. According to Crenshaw's
personal Web site, he is expected to play 18 senior events.</TE>
<TE>   Also at Valencia, Wayne Levi, who turned 50 on Feb. 22, will make
his first senior appearance. In quiet fashion, Levi won 12 titles and
earned $4.69 million on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   For Crenshaw, a two-time Masters champion, it hasn't been easy the
last few years on the PGA Tour. In the last three years, he made the
cut twice, including once in 11 starts last year. He is the guy Fred
Couples had in mind when he was talking earlier this week about his
proposed Major Champions Tour, which would feature players between 37
and 55 who have won major championships.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been real cruel for Ben Crenshaw the last three, four, five
years," Couples said. "I don't think it's fair. He can't keep up on
the PGA Tour and he wasn't ready for the senior tour. Those are way
too many years to waste [waiting for a place to play]."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw spoke Thursday about the struggles, saying: "I need to go
back to how I played." But on the positive side, he has taken
advantage of the opportunity to slow down and enjoy life because of
his decreased playing schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, someone asked me the other day: 'What have you
been doing all this time?'" Crenshaw said. "And I said, 'Well, I've
been living.'</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's funny. A golfer, at least in my case, you start
out on the tour and you're totally one-dimensional. You just started
tournament golf and you go as far and hard as you can to try to make
adjustments, experiment, trials, tribulations, lost tournaments,
winning occasionally, because that's what you do in this game. Those
of us who are human, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "And you relish the things that--the times and the opportunities
that you had to win a big tournament, or any tournament, for that
matter. And then between the age of 42 to 50, you just start
wondering what you're going to do with the rest of your life, where
you've been, and you look forward to something else."</TE>
<TE>   And now, something new is also something old.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to see these fellas," Crenshaw said. "It's been a
long time in a lot of cases."</TE>

<LD>Now that the Winter Olympics are behind us, college basketball takes
center stage. There are games galore over the final nine days of the
regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Championship Week begins on ESPN and ESPN2 on Saturday, with the
two networks televising 56 college basketball games through March 10.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN and ESPN2 will be involved in covering 27 of the 30
postseason conference tournaments, including the Big West tournament
championship game at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   One tournament that isn't on ESPN is the Pacific 10 tournament at
Staples Center, which begins with the quarterfinals Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will televise the first two rounds, and CBS will
televise the title game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited about carrying such a major postseason event,"
Fox Sports Net executive producer Bill Borson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net will go on the air at 1 p.m. Thursday and except
for a half-hour news break at 6 will be on the air nonstop from
Staples Center until 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Frazier and Sean Elliott will co-host the studio show
Thursday, and they'll be joined by Bill Walton for the semifinals the
next day. Commentators Marques Johnson and Dan Belluomini also will
be a part of the show when they're not working games.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Physioc and Barry Tompkins will handle the play-by-play,
with Bill Macdonald and the Bay Area's Leila Feinstein serving as
sideline reporters.</TE>
<TE>   KXTA (1150) will offer radio coverage.</TE>
<TE>   A Perfect Fit</TE>
<TE>   Elliott, in his first full season as a television commentator for
the San Antonio Spurs--he works with Joel Meyers for Fox Sports Net
in Texas--is a good choice to work the Pac-10 tournaments. And not
just because he has picked up broadcasting so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott was selected the most outstanding player in the 1989
Pac-10 tournament at the Forum. He led Arizona to a 73-51 victory
over Stanford in the title game.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament was held in 1990, but this will be the first since.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott also will be among 10 former coaches and players who will
be inducted into the Pac-10 Hall of Fame during the tournament.
Others include John Wooden, Bill Sharman, Pete Newell and Byron
Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's assumed that Elliott's playing days are over--he
came back to play for the Spurs on March 14, 2000, after undergoing a
kidney transplant on Aug. 16, 1999--he says he has not officially
retired.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to take this season off and see how broadcasting would
go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It apparently is going pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   Back on Hot Seat</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson, who took some heat this week for
a tirade against members of the media, may take some more with the
airing of "Outside the Lines" by ESPN today at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The topic is the graduation rate among black male basketball
players, and Arkansas is among 36 Division I schools that have a 0%
graduation rate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the responsibility doesn't necessarily rely all on the
coach," Richardson says in an interview taped before the latest
turmoil. "The important thing is, who's in control here? Are the
parents in control? The kids are in control of their life some. Where
do you stop putting the blame on the coach, the institution?"</TE>
<TE>   Marathon Task</TE>
<TE>   After 16 years on Channel 13, the 17th Los Angeles Marathon will
be televised by Channel 9 Sunday, beginning at 8:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Olsman, who produced the the television coverage of the first
races, has returned as the producer.With the switch in stations,
there are some changes. Channel 9 sportscaster Alan Massengale will
anchor the coverage, which will run only three hours rather than 5 or
5 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Tompkins and Larry Rawson will no longer be involved, but Toni
Reavis and Katherine Switzer are back.</TE>
<TE>   Crazy World</TE>
<TE>   You've probably heard about the boxing show Fox is planning for
March 13. In the featured bout, Amy Fisher will square off against
Tonya Harding.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this is for real, and the late-night talk show hosts are
already zeroing in.</TE>
<TE>   "I smell an Emmy here," Jay Leno said Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   From Conan O'Brien: "After Mike Tyson's antics, they're trying to
bring dignity to the sport of boxing."</TE>
<TE>   The bouts will be three two-minute rounds. The producers
apparently haven't quite filled out the card.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's this: "Toughwoman," an offshoot of "Toughman," is
coming to pay-per-view March 9. The asking price is $19.95.</TE>
<TE>   "Toughman" is free on FX.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Oscar De La Hoya will be at ESPN Zone in Anaheim tonight, serving
as the co-host of "Ringside With Johnny Ortiz" on KSPN (1110) from
8-10.</TE>
<TE>   Are you ready for tennis on pay-per-view? The two semifinal
matches at the Siebel Open at San Jose on Saturday will be shown on
pay-per-view channels by In Demand 2 from 7-11 p.m., with a suggested
price of $9.95.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Weir has said he plans to leave Channel 7 to pursue other
interests. Although his contract doesn't expire until September, he
may be leaving fairly soon. Word is Chris Myers is one candidate to
replace him. Another is Leslie Gudel, a Southern California native
who is a sports reporter for ABC and a former anchor at what is now
Fox Sports Net.... ESPN announced this week there will be two
versions of the Bob Knight movie, "A Season on the Brink," March 10.
A unedited version, with all the bad language, will run on ESPN,
while a tamer, edited version will run on ESPN2.... With Michael
Jordan out after knee surgery, NBC has dropped two Washington Wizard
games that were added after he announced he was coming out of
retirement. Instead of Washington-Orlando Sunday, it will be
Indiana-Sacramento. On March 10, Washington-Boston will be replaced
by Toronto-Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have hired Jose Mota as a Spanish-language announcer.
He'll work alongside Ivan Lara on XPRS (1090). Mota, who does games
for Fox in both English and Spanish, also applied for one of the two
Angel openings on the English side.... Dodger flagship station KXTA
and sister station KLAC (570), the Angels' flagship, are both
carrying spring training games in the noon-to-3 p.m. slot, with the
Dodger broadcasts from Florida delayed.... Fox Sports Net 2, which is
getting some incredible ratings for its "Santa Anita Live" program,
will televise Saturday's Santa Anita Handicap as part of a one-hour
special from 4 to 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Shows Leadership</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Bruins can't finish first despite never
losing early lead in 65-57 win over Oregon State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rico Hines watched from the bench with a knowing smile. According to
his five-minute rule, things were going well.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA led by eight points. Four starters had already scored and
point guard Cedric Bozeman had three assists.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, the Bruins defeated Oregon State, 65-57, Thursday
night in front of 8,959 at Pauley Pavilion, never trailing the last
38 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "With our laid-back team, it's hard to tell how we're going to
come out," said Hines, a senior reserve guard. "Nobody says much
before games. But five minutes into the game, I can tell."</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes turned to 10, to halftime and beyond. Never did the
Bruins relinquish the lead they seized two minutes into the game on
Billy Knight's three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the victory, UCLA (19-9, 11-6 in the Pacific 10
Conference) was eliminated in the race for the regular-season title
because Oregon holds a two-game lead over the Bruins. UCLA completes
the regular season with a home game against the Ducks on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the seventh in a row against UCLA for the Beavers
(12-16, 4-13) and ensured that Washington--not Oregon State--will be
the No. 8 seeded team in the Pac-10 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We are playing for second place and want to continue our momentum
going into the conference tournament," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said.
"But we need to play better. This was one of the ugliest games I've
seen in my 11 years at UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Turning in a strong 40-minute effort against a lesser opponent is
always a difficult task for the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Horrendous free-throw shooting, long second-half stretches without
a field goal and porous man-to-man defense by UCLA allowed the slow,
steady Beavers to crawl within two points four times in the last
seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, however, Oregon State took the award for bone-headed
mistakes. Six Beaver players took the court after a timeout with 5:50
to play, resulting in a technical foul and two free throws by Jason
Kapono, stretching a two-point lead to four.</TE>
<TE>   And with less than a minute left and UCLA again up by four, Oregon
State nervously passed the ball around like a hot potato and never
got off a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "We played some good defense late," Hines said. "And we finally
made some foul shots."</TE>
<TE>   After hitting only one of eight in the first 34 minutes, including
a zero-for-six effort by Dan Gadzuric, the Bruins made their last 10
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had a balanced, if uneven, attack. Matt Barnes scored 14
points, Knight had 13, Kapono added 11 and T.J. Cummings scored 10.
Bozeman equaled his season high with eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings was one of five reserves to make a group contribution. He
and Dijon Thompson, Andre Patterson, Ryan Walcott and Hines replaced
the starters 5:34 into the second half with UCLA ahead, 44-37.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, Joe See hit a three-point shot to pull the Beavers
within four, but the quintet of reserves held its own for the next
six minutes, and UCLA led, 50-44, when the starters returned.</TE>
<TE>   "The second group picked us up," Kapono said. "They didn't score
much, but they didn't allow [Oregon State] to score, either."</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers shot only 32.8%. UCLA made 15 of 31 shots in the first
half, but only eight of 22 in the second. Barnes played the best in
the second half, scoring nine points and making several big defensive
plays.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't appear the Bruins would need any late-game heroics when
they led by 10 on Bozeman's layup with 4:25 left in the first half.
Oregon State scored the next six points, but Cummings made two jump
shots and Barnes hit a three-pointer two seconds before the buzzer
for a 37-29 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Employing its relatively new motion offense, UCLA shared the ball.
Eight players scored in the half and Bozeman contributed five
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Beavers made only eight of 28 shots from the field,
staying as close as they did by making nine of 10 free throws while
UCLA made just one of four.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, a less-than-shining performance, but one that kept the
Bruins in the hunt for a share of second place and a reasonably high
seeding in the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great feeling after the first five minutes," Hines said.
"But we lacked intensity in the middle. We picked it up at the end,
but we'll need to play better to win games in the Pac-10 tournament."</TE>

<HD>Loss Is Trojans' Buzzword</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Jones makes shot with one second to
play and Oregon clinches share of regular-season title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Visions of cutting down nets and hanging up banners were dancing
through the players' heads. USC was out-running and out-gunning
Oregon early in the second half of their game for first place
Thursday night, building an 11-point lead with 11 minutes to play.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out the Trojans' visions of a Pacific 10 championship were
delusions of grandeur.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon senior guard Frederick Jones ended the Trojans' title hopes
when he drove the lane and made a one-handed runner with one second
remaining, giving the Ducks a 67-65 victory before 11,505 at the
Sports Arena. That clinched at least a tie for the Pac-10
regular-season championship for the Ducks as well as the top seeding
in next week's conference tournament at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   USC point guard Brandon Granville's three-quarter-court heave as
time expired hit the backboard and the rim but bounded away
harmlessly, dropping the Trojans into a four-way tie for third place.
Had USC (19-8, 11-6) swept this weekend, the Trojans would have
earned at least a share of their first Pac-10 title since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Oregon (21-7, 13-4), meanwhile, clinched at least a share
of its first league title in 57 years after sweeping USC and getting
only its fourth road win of the year.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth game No. 19 USC has lost on a last-second shot
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "How much character do I want?" USC Coach Henry Bibby said. "I
don't want to build character, I want to win the game. Maybe there's
something down the road for us. We've just got to play harder and we
can't let them have runs like they did tonight."</TE>
<TE>   USC's collapse against Oregon was made possible with Sam Clancy
being forced to the bench with his fourth foul at the 10:13 mark and
USC holding a 53-46 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy disputed a number of fouls called on him, referring to them
as "bogus."</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to play aggressive," he said. "I can't play tentative.
This is for the championship of the Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy's fourth foul came when he was called for bumping Luke
Jackson from behind on a breakaway opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "He was playing basketball and it was a basketball play," Bibby
said. "I thought it was a questionable call."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Clancy returned, with 5:32 remaining, Oregon led by
one, 56-55. And with a tentative Clancy trying to avoid fouling out,
the Ducks drove at him and eventually went up by six, 65-59, with
2:17 to play.</TE>
<TE>   How bad was USC's drought? After Errick Craven made a three-point
basket at the 11:04 mark, USC's first three-pointer of the game to
give the Trojans their 11-point lead, USC would be outscored, 23-6,
over the next nine-plus minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A Craven three-pointer from the left wing, though, with 1:27 to
play got the Trojans within three, 65-62, before David Bluthenthal
made a long three-pointer to tie the score with 30.9 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   After two timeouts, Jones got the ball, drove to his right and by
Bluthenthal, who was expecting help, but Clancy was a little late in
the lane.</TE>
<TE>   "They made shots and we missed shots," Bluthenthal said. "It was
bad basketball by us."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy led USC with a game-high 25 points and nine rebounds in 35
minutes while Craven had 20 points and a career high-tying six
steals.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, though, got little from seniors Granville and
Bluthenthal, who combined for nine points on three-of-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, who was weakened by flu-like symptoms, left without
speaking to the media after becoming USC's all-time leader in games
played with 119.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Ridnour's 17 points led Oregon while Jones finished with 15.</TE>
<TE>   "You had, in my opinion, tonight, the two best teams in the
conference," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "It was just a battle. Our
last nine games [against USC] have been decided by fewer than eight
points.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'We've got to win down at USC. Not at UCLA, but at
USC.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Last-Second Woes</TE>

shots. The teams and players that beat the Trojans:</TE>

<LD>Top-seeded Pepperdine survived a surprising scare to defeat
eighth-seeded Gonzaga, 68-64, in the first round of the West Coast
Conference women's basketball tournament Thursday before 979 at Jenny
Craig Pavilion in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves (21-7), seeking their first WCC tournament title and
second NCAA tournament berth, didn't have the game comfortably in
hand until forward Sarah Richen made two free throws with 7.8 seconds
left to account for the final margin.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzaga (11-18) harassed regular-season champion Pepperdine into
27 turnovers and pulled within two points three times in the final
two minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Center Nadja Morgan had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Waves,
who will play fourth-seeded San Francisco (18-10) in the semifinals
at 6 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 65, Loyola Marymount 63--The Lions (15-13), playing
without their leading scorer, finished the season with their third
consecutive loss after center Adrianne Slaughter's shot in the lane
bounced off the front of the rim as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola was missing senior guard Bryn Britton, the WCC's No. 2
scorer with a 15.3 average, who tore a knee ligament Saturday against
San Diego.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Top Rank, Inc., KCAL 9 and the Arrowhead Pond have joined to create a
new boxing series at the arena that will present four cards a year to
be shown live on television.</LD>
<LD>   It's not by accident that Top Rank chose Julio Gonzalez of
Huntington Beach to headline the first card on April 27, or that Top
Rank chose Orange County as its home for the series, what with its
burgeoning Latino community.</LD>
<LD>   "It's worthwhile for us to do these shows in this area," Top Rank
Chairman Bob Arum said. "This is a great untapped market and building
to have it in."</LD>
<TE>   The other cards are scheduled for June 29, Sept. 28 and Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez (28-1, 18 knockouts) took Roy Jones Jr. the distance in
losing a 12-round unanimous decision for the undisputed
light-heavyweight championship last July at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County is full of Latinos that love boxing," Gonzalez
said. "You go to all the smaller cards and they're always sold out.
But now we'll be in a bigger arena in front of bigger audiences."</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled to fight on the April 27 card will be heavyweight
Javier Mora (12-0-1, 11 KOs) of Westminster and Joey Torres, 41, who
will be making his professional debut after spending the last 23
years, eight months in prison on a murder charge.</TE>

<TE>   Junior-bantamweight Jose Navarro, a South-Central Los Angeles
native and 2000 U.S. Olympic boxing team member, remained unbeaten as
a professional with a six-round unanimous decision over Luis De La
Rosa Thursday night in Tallahassee, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Navarro (9-0, three knockouts) won every round and knocked De La
Rosa (3-4-1), of Hidalgo, Mexico, down in the sixth round. All three
judges scored the bout 80-71.</TE>

<HD>Chouinard Is Out, McDonald Questionable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks' breaks after the Olympic break haven't been good
ones.</LD>
<LD>   They lost their first game, to Minnesota, 5-3, Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   They lost center Marc Chouinard, who had his left arm in a sling
because of a shoulder injury suffered in that game. They probably
have lost center Andy McDonald, who was still groggy after suffering
a head injury in the second period against the Wild.</LD>
<TE>   So the Ducks, who are already thin at center, probably will be
without McDonald, their top-line center, and Chouinard, their best
faceoff man, when they play Chicago on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard is definitely a no-go, Coach Bryan Murray said Thursday.
He was injured after colliding with the Wild's Matt Johnson, although
X-rays were negative, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's injury is more uncertain. He sat out the third period
and underwent a CT scan after the game, but Murray was not calling
the injury a concussion. McDonald will be reevaluated before the
Ducks leave for Chicago on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy got whacked from behind, and he wasn't feeling very good
after the game," Murray said. "Right now, we're going to go day to
day."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that there were no plans to call any players up from
minor league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks did get center Steve Rucchin back Wednesday. He had
missed 44 games with a stress fracture in his left ankle. But Rucchin
is far from 100%.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say I can only feel better next game," said Rucchin,
who played 18 minutes in Wednesday's game. "That was the worst I have
played in 400-plus NHL games. Three-and-a-half months are a long time
to be out. The ankle still doesn't feel very good, but it's only
going to get better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya and Jeff Friesen missed practice Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya was given the day off, Murray said, to rest after his
hectic Olympic experience. Friesen sat out to rest a sore left ankle
but said he would play Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rumor-mill alert: Toronto Maple Leaf goalie Curtis Joseph will be
sidelined six to eight weeks, which immediately started speculation
that Duck goalie Steve Shields could start making travel plans.</TE>
<TE>   Shields, whom Duck General Manager Pierre Gauthier has on the
trading block, would be a good fit. He has playoff experience and,
although he is making $2 million his season, will be a free agent
after the season.</TE>
<TE>   But before anyone starts packing bags, there are other goalies on
the trading block.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's Tom Barrasso, Calgary's Mike Vernon, Florida's Trevor
Kidd and Tampa Bay's Kevin Weekes are also being mentioned as
possibilities, should the Maple Leafs make a move.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Maple Leafs will go with goalie Corey Schwab.
Sebastien Centomo was recalled from the minor leagues to back up
Schwab. Maple Leaf officials are expected to wait a couple of weeks
before deciding if they need to find a veteran goalie.</TE>

<LD>   Today at the Pyramid in Long Beach</LD>
<LD>   DIVISION I-AA</LD>
<TE>   Lynwood (28-0) vs. Long Beach Poly (32-0), 8:15 p.m.: There are
three undefeated girls' teams in the section, and two meet in the
marquee game of the weekend. They are similar in that they are two of
the deepest, most athletic teams in the section and are comfortable
applying pressure defense up and down the floor. Still, both trailed
in the fourth quarter of their semifinals and nearly had their
seasons ended; top-seeded Lynwood defeated Long Beach Wilson, 80-76,
and second-seeded Poly hung on against Chino Hills Ayala, 42-40.
Lynwood is led by senior Janice Bright and sophomore Sade
Wiley-Gatewood, and the Knights may have more offensive weapons than
Poly, which is led by Kameca Simmons. This is Lynwood's ninth
title-game appearance, and it has won three championships--in 1986,
1994 and last year--when it beat Anaheim Esperanza, 59-39. Poly is
playing for the title for the third time; the Jackrabbits lost in
1980 and won in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III-A</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery (23-5) vs. Pasadena Muir (24-4), 4:45
p.m.: Each team is going for its third title. Top-seeded Bishop
Montgomery, a 65-62 loser to North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake in the
final last season, is trying to win its second title in three years.
Second-seeded Muir lost in last season's II-A title game to Artesia,
76-47.</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II-A</TE>
<TE>   North Torrance (24-6) vs. Redondo Union (22-7), 6:30 p.m.: This is
the surprise matchup of the weekend after fourth-seeded North upset
top-seeded Brea Olinda in the semifinals, ending the Ladycats' string
of 13 consecutive title-game appearances, including 12 championships.
North was beaten in last season's final, 56-54. Third-seeded Redondo,
which defeated Brea two years ago, is trying to win its second title
in three years. . These teams played twice in the Bay League, and
Redondo won, 41-37 and 51-41.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V-A</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Pilgrim (25-3) vs. Hemet Baptist Christian (23-0), 3
p.m.: These schools meet in the playoffs for the third consecutive
season, with Pilgrim trying to win its fourth consecutive V-A title
and its fifth in the last six seasons under seventh-year Coach Kevin
Blue. Amber Cunningham, a 5-9 senior wing, averages 20 points and 10
rebounds for Pilgrim, the top-seeded team. The Warriors feature
seniors Jamie DeKiewiet, a 5-10 point guard who averages 19 points,
and ReAnne Lappinga, a 6-5 center who averages 22 points and 12
rebounds.</TE>

<LD>Those who love maiden claiming races are in luck today at Santa
Anita.</LD>
<LD>   The day before the track offers its biggest race, the $1-million
Santa Anita Handicap, it is presenting a card in which half the races
are of the maiden claiming variety.</LD>
<LD>   The pick six kicks off with a route (11/16 miles) for 3-year-old
California-bred maiden fillies running for a $40,000 tag, and
continues in the fourth with a seven-furlong race for $25,000 older
maidens. Twelve 3-year-olds running for a $32,000 purse will contest
the sixth, and the day winds up a split of the fourth race with 10
$25,000 maidens again going seven furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   Although a lot of slow horses will be in action this afternoon,
the program does feature a stakes race. A dozen 3-year-old fillies
are scheduled to get together in the $100,000-added La Habra at about
61/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Carinae is the 5-2 morning-line choice and for good reason. A
daughter of Nureyev trained by Bobby Frankel for owner-breeder
Flaxman Holdings Ltd., Carinae should have won her U.S. debut on this
course Feb. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The even-money favorite that afternoon, she was blocked when
crossing over from the turf to the dirt, then back onto the grass,
then had to steady again while searching for room in the final
furlong. Given all those problems, she was still beaten by only 11/2
lengths and should be able to make amends with a clean journey.</TE>
<TE>   Back to face Carinae again is Fun House. A daughter of Prized out
of the productive mare Bistra, she won the Feb. 1 race. It was her
second win in three tries for owner-breeder Verne Winchell and
trainer Ron McAnally.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the La Habra field includes Dancing, the 18-1 upset
winner of the Santa Ynez Stakes in her American debut; Lady Katy Did,
Ayzal, Gold Sugar, Ashbecca, Partytime, Anbella, Yourfinalanswer,
Nunatall and High Society. Ayzal and Partytime will race coupled
because of common ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The second at Santa Anita marks the comeback of
Tates Creek, a Frankel-trained filly who won three turf races in a
row last summer at Hollywood Park and Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Honey Mustard Girl. The Black Tie Affair filly has won
six of eight and will try for another victory in today's seventh at
Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's fourth at Santa Anita. The 10
maidens are a combined 0 for 56 and have managed only six
on-the-board finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  Exacta boxes in the first keying Alessandria
with Sherri Shine, Thatswhatshesaid and Western Dawn.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/135. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $28.20/$807.60. Total money bet: $802.</TE>

<LD>The Kings have never won the President's Trophy, presented annually
to the NHL team with the league's best regular-season record. Nor
will they win it this season, thanks to one of the worst starts in
franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   But since Dec. 8, when a 2-0 loss to the St. Louis Blues left them
two points out of last place in the Western Conference, the Kings are
21-6-4-1, tied with the league-leading Detroit Red Wings and Eastern
Conference-leading Philadelphia Flyers for the league's best record.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 12 weeks, the Kings have been seven points better
than the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche, 14 better
than the division-leading Carolina Hurricanes and seven better than
the division-leading Boston Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   In the Pacific Division, they've erased all but five points of
what had been a 14-point advantage for the division-leading San Jose
Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   They've been 14 points better than the Phoenix Coyotes, 15 better
than the Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Tied with the Mighty Ducks on Dec. 9, they've left them 18 points
behind.</TE>
<TE>   The Calgary Flames, who on Dec. 9 were 14 points ahead of the
Kings in the Western Conference playoff race, now trail them by nine.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing very well," General Manager Dave Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the first of December our goaltenders started to play
better for us. Where we've won a lot of games is, our defensive play
has been very good."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have given up 2.09 goals a game in their last 32 games
and have moved up to fifth in the league in goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With an overall record of 29-20-8-3, the Kings are 10 points
better than they were at this point last season, when they were
25-26-8-1.... The return of Coach Andy Murray, recuperating from
post-concussion syndrome at home in Faribault, Minn., after last
month's auto accident, remains uncertain. "I hope it's sooner rather
than later," Taylor said, "but I don't have a time frame."</TE>

<HD>It Should Be Flat-Out Faster</HD>

<LD>With a flatter and presumably faster course for the Los Angeles
Marathon on Sunday, Kenyan Benson Mbithi is intent on bettering the
time of 2 hours 9 minutes 25 seconds set by countryman  Simon Bor in
the 1999 race.</LD>
<LD>   Bor's time is the only sub-2:10 clocking in the L.A. Marathon
since the race began in 1986, but Mbithi said Thursday at a news
conference that it could be bested this year.</LD>
<LD>   "We all want to break it," said Mbithi, who finished third last
year after winning the 2000 race in 2:11:55. "The fast course will
make my legs go faster."</LD>
<TE>   Kenyan Stephen Ndungu, who won last year's race in 2:13:13 in
breezy conditions, didn't guarantee a better time than Bor's. But he
does expect to run faster than last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we could run a 2:10 or possibly a 2:09," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan Joseph Kariuki is the designated pace-setter for Sunday's
race, but he said Thursday he wasn't sure what kind of pace he would
be setting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm waiting for them to tell me what time I'm supposed to run,"
said Kariuki, who plans to pace the lead pack of runners for the
first 18.6 miles. "The pace will depend on the weather."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps indicative of U.S. marathon fortunes in recent years,
there were no American runners in attendance at Thursday's news
conference for elite runners.</TE>
<TE>   Among nine athletes present were five Kenyan men, one Kenyan
woman, two Romanian women and Mexico's Saul Mendoza, five-time
defending champion in the wheelchair division.</TE>

<HD>Avalanche, Drury Finish Strong, 2-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Drury scored 3:15 into overtime and Joe Sakic had two assists
as the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Phoenix Coyotes, 2-1, Thursday
night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   After solid performances from both goalies, Drury tipped in a
rebound of a shot Sakic fired from the left wing.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, it was Patrick Roy who kept the Avalanche in the game
when the team played sluggishly. He blocked Daniel Briere's shot at
9:25 in the third to neutralize a two-on-one break, then stuffed
Michal Hanzus after Drury coughed up the puck in the Avalanche zone.</LD>
<TE>   Roy finished with 32 saves, and Sean Burke had 25 for Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado played without defenseman Rob Blake, who is out
indefinitely with a bruised knee suffered in a 2-2 tie Tuesday
against Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Vancouver 3--Mike Modano scored a power- play goal with
less than a second left in overtime, lifting the Stars to the victory
at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   With Ed Jovanovski in the penalty box for boarding, Dan Cloutier
stopped Joe Nieuwendyk from close range after a scramble in front of
the Vancouver net. Modano stuffed home the rebound on his backhand
just before time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Edmonton 2--Martin Erat scored with less than two
minutes remaining as the Predators rallied at Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Vitali Yachmenev's long slap shot tied the score for Nashville
only 25 seconds into the third period. The shot was reminiscent of
the long, high shot that beat Salo to give Belarus a 4-3 win over
Sweden at the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, St. Louis 2--Jeff Shantz and Petr Buzek each scored his
first goal in more than a year as the Flames won at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Shantz, Buzek and Derek Morris scored in the second period as
Calgary built a 3-0 lead after 40 minutes, then held off a St. Louis
rally.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 6, Boston 2--Ron Francis scored a goal and had three
assists at Boston as the Hurricanes won for only the third time in
their last 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, New York Rangers 0--Patrick Lalime stopped 34 shots for
his second shutout of the season and Radek Bonk scored twice at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Washington 2--Alex Korolyuk scored the tiebreaking
goal to spark a three-goal second period at Washington as the Sharks
won their seventh in a row. San Jose last loss on Jan. 29 at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Columbus 3--Michal Rozsival won it in overtime after
Alexei Morozov jammed in a loose puck with 31.2 seconds left in
regulation at Columbus, Ohio, as the the Penguins ended an eight-game
winless streak (0-5-1-2).</TE>
<TE>   New York Ranger captain Mark Messier will have arthroscopic
shoulder surgery today and will be sidelined for at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to have surgery was put on hold for about one hour
late Thursday afternoon after Messier, Ranger General Manager Glen
Sather and team surgeon Dr. Andrew Feldman considered a final
ultrasound treatment. But the team announced afterward that surgery
will go on as planned.</TE>

<HD>Transfusion Bags Found in House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>House cleaners found used blood transfusion bags at a home where
Austrian Nordic skiers stayed during the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge opened an
investigation Thursday into the find, ordering that "all scientific
techniques" be used, "including DNA testing."</LD>
<LD>   The bags were found Wednesday along with blood transfusion sets,
including tubes and needles. Wasatch County Sheriff Mike Spano
gathered the evidence and turned it over to doping control officials
for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Spano said the transfusion bags were drained of all but residual
blood, indicating they had been used.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't monkey with it," Spano said. "I had gloves on, we
stuffed it in a large bag, I washed my hands of it and immediately
turned it over to SLOC. They are so up on this doping."</TE>
<TE>   The home in Midway, Utah, near the Olympic Nordic venue at Soldier
Hollow, had been rented to the Austrian team, which kept 10 athletes
there.</TE>
<TE>   Doping officials will analyze blood residue for any sign they
contained banned substances.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Charles Rich, SLOC's chief medical officer and a member of the
IOC medical commission, said he found it difficult to believe the
Austrians had any legitimate medical reasons for using blood
transfusions during the Olympics, "where oxygen-carrying capacity is
so important" to winning.</TE>
<TE>   Rich said if it was doping, technicians could test the DNA of
residual blood to implicate athletes who could be stripped of any
medals they won.</TE>
<TE>   The Austrians took home three Olympic medals in Nordic events at
Soldier Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Hoffmann won a silver and Mikhail Botvinov a bronze in
the 30-kilometer race, while Wolfgang Perner won a bronze in the
10-kilometer biathlon sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Johann Muehlegg was stripped of his gold medal in the
50-kilometer race after testing positive for darbepoetin, which
boosts production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kim Un-yong, a South Korean IOC member plagued by scandals and a
speed skating controversy at the Olympics, offered to resign as head
of the country's sports governing body.</TE>
<TE>   Kim abruptly offered to resign during a meeting of delegates of
the Korea Sports Council, said Park Pil-soon, a council spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also offered to resign as head of South Korea's Olympic
Committee, then left the conference room, Park said.</TE>
<TE>   The delegates met without Kim and "unanimously" decided to ask Kim
to complete his five-year term that ends in February 2005, Park said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim has yet to decide whether to accept, Park said. The spokesman
said earlier that Kim accepted the request.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Kim returned to the meeting and thanked delegates for
the request, which made us believe that he was accepting the request.
But as the situation stands now, his offer to resign still stands,"
Park said. "He will make his final position known in a day or so."</TE>
<TE>   There was no comment from Kim on the episode.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old Kim has been plagued by scandals involving him and
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are investigating a case in which Kim's son, John,
reportedly received bribes from a jailed taekwondo official accused
of fixing taekwondo tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Before the scandal surfaced, Kim resigned as head of the South
Korean Taekwondo Association in November. Kim still heads the World
Taekwondo Federation.</TE>
<TE>   Kim is also under public criticism for failing to take a firmer
stand on the controversial disqualification of South Korean short
track skater Kim Dong-sung at the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Dong-sung crossed the line first in the 1,500 meters, but was
disqualified for impeding the course of American Apolo Anton Ohno,
who was awarded the gold.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Olympic delegation first threatened to boycott the
closing ceremony in protest. Kim Un-yong reversed that decision.</TE>

<HD>His Game Is Straight A-Rod</HD>
<DH>Mater Dei's Santos Is a Player in Mold of His Hero, Alex
Rodriguez</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sergio Santos made an unplanned detour on his way home from a
baseball workout last weekend and rediscovered the simplicity of the
sport he loves best.</LD>
<LD>   Santos, a 6-foot-3, 200-pound senior at Santa Ana Mater Dei High,
is a smooth-fielding, power-hitting shortstop regarded as a potential
first-round selection in June's amateur draft.</LD>
<LD>   Burdened occasionally by the expectations that come with that
status, Santos pulled his car into Manzanita Park near his family's
home in Hacienda Heights and took in the joy displayed by Little
Leaguers.</LD>
<TE>   "Watching those kids, I remembered when I was their age and how
much fun it is to play this game," Santos said. "Seeing them out
there, with no worries, I forgot about the expectations and the
scouts. It sounds silly, but it reminded me about how simple the game
is."</TE>
<TE>   Santos, ranked No. 7 on Baseball America magazine's list of top
100 high school prospects, has a knack for making the difficult look
easy on a baseball diamond. His physique, arm strength and movement
in the field and at the plate put observers in mind of Texas Ranger
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, Santos' favorite player.</TE>
<TE>   "Santos is a man among boys, and has played like that for a few
years," said La Puente Bishop Amat Coach Kenny Kendrena, whose
top-ranked team will play Mater Dei on March 26.</TE>
<TE>   Santos, who has signed a letter of intent with USC, began his high
school career at Hacienda Heights Los Altos. But after hitting over
.500 on the varsity as a freshman and impressing scouts at the annual
Area Code games, he decided to transfer to Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty developed when he got here," Mater Dei Coach Burt
Call said. "There were some things he needed to work on but he was
someone who could swing the bat really well. I haven't messed with
his swing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Santos batted .440 with eight home runs and 29 runs batted in as a
sophomore, raising his profile with scouts and college coaches even
higher. Last year, he hit .448 with three homers, 23 RBIs and 18
stolen bases. Call said Santos' homer total dipped because teams
pitched around him. But Santos said he could have done better.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a humbling sport," he said. "My junior season
prepared me for the summer because it reminded me, 'Don't believe all
the hype. You still have to strap on your cleats and work.'"</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Santos played shortstop and third base for the U.S.
18-and-under junior national team that finished second in the Pan
American qualifying tournament in Cuba. He hit .286 with a homer and
seven RBIs in 11 games. The U.S. lost to Cuba, 3-2, in the title
game, but qualified for this year's World Junior Championships in
Sherbrooke, Quebec.</TE>
<TE>   "The intensity of the fans in Cuba was incredible," Santos said.
"There were 10,000 to 15,000 there and it was a great experience. I
think it prepared me well for what's coming up this season and the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Santos is one of several key players for a Mater Dei team that
also features experienced pitching and solid defense. The Monarchs
open their season today against Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to a great year for our team and for myself,"
Santos said. "I'm just going to go out there and enjoy playing the
game like the Little League kids do."</TE>

<HD>Johnson Draws Strength From Dad's Memory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When William Johnson was in sixth grade, his father died of a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   "It was devastating," Johnson said. "He was my idol."</LD>
<LD>   Steve Johnson, a big man who was a middle school principal, never
got to watch his son wrestle or play football. He never got to see
William bring home a report card from high school that had straight
A's. He never got to experience the moment his son decided to become
an Ivy Leaguer.</LD>
<TE>   Somehow, though, Johnson used his father's death to guide him on a
path to success.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was a standout tight end and defensive end for Tustin
High's football team. He has been the top heavyweight wrestler in
Orange County this winter, qualifying for the state championships
this weekend in Stockton. He has never received a grade lower than A
in high school. He plays the piano and guitar, surfs on a longboard,
helps build houses for the poor and rarely misses church on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He's friends with everyone, from the nerds to the most popular
kids on campus, from the rappers to the classic pianists.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't find someone who doesn't like him," football Coach
Myron Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday at a banquet in Anaheim, Johnson will be honored with 40
other high school football players as a scholar-athlete by the Orange
County chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall
of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   He's a 17-year-old senior with a future full of hope. He's 6 feet
4, 240 pounds and plans to do more than just play football at
Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   His birthday, May 29, is the same as John F. Kennedy's. He likes
shaking hands and kissing babies. He's starting to enjoy government
and politics, something Harvard is known for.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's a reason his fifth-grade teacher once said, "You're
going to be president someday."</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, he has seized opportunities to meet new people and
explore facets of life teenagers don't always want to experience.</TE>
<TE>   He credits his teachers at Tustin for broadening his knowledge and
challenging his beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "My English teacher, Mr. Woods, developed a lot of creative
thought in literature," he said. "He has forced me to take a step
back and transfer things to the real world. My calculus teacher, Mr.
Patton, was a jock in high school but very intelligent. He showed me
you can have an equal balance of academics and athletics. My civics
teacher, Ms. Levine, tried every day to bring out the politician in
me."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's mother, Miriam, is an eighth-grade teacher. His older
brother played football at Tustin. His younger sister is a freshman
volleyball player. They helped navigate him through the dark days
after his father's death.</TE>
<TE>   "We drew closer, formed our own support group and managed to get
through it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But his father has never really left him. Before every wrestling
match and every football game, Johnson speaks to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Always for me, he's been a driving force," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Harvard, when he was 3,000 miles from home and
trying to decide whether to commit or continue taking college trips,
he sought comfort and advice from his father.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds weird," he said. "I asked him, when I woke up on a
Sunday morning, looked out the window, everything was white, I'm at
Harvard, how can I pass this up?"</TE>
<TE>   In his personal essay, Johnson wrote why he plays the piano:</TE>
<TE>   "I play because it soothes my mind and sets free my dammed flow of
thought. I play because it eases my heart and softens my
soul--because the simple structure of music gives me foundation in an
unpredictable world.</TE>
<TE>   "I play because it makes me feel close to my late father knowing
that he loved to hear me play. And I know that he is proud of me, not
because of my brother's athletic prowess, nor because of my sister's
dramatic artistry, but because I pursue a balance of the two, because
I am his middle child, and in his eyes am his Renaissance man."</TE>
<TE>   To become a scholar-athlete in Orange County, you had to maintain
at least a 3.3 grade-point average and make first-team all-league.
The Anaheim banquet will be filled with achievers like Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, the San Fernando Valley chapter will hold its
scholar-athlete dinner in Granada Hills. Fifty high school athletes
will be honored.</TE>
<TE>   There's Dustin Baxley of Oak Park, who has a 3.93 GPA and endeared
himself to classmates and faculty with his leadership skills. There's
Jamey Iaccino of Panorama City St. Genevieve, on the honor roll seven
times. There's Albert Alejo of San Fernando, a black belt in martial
arts of whom his football coach said, "I know Albert will be
successful because he has a never-quit attitude."</TE>
<TE>   There's Keith Howell of Newhall Hart, who started out in the
school band, became a football standout and gained entrance to
Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   These are athletes who have made their parents and communities
proud.</TE>

<HD>Phone Monopolists, Again</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1996, members of Congress virtually wrapped themselves in the
American flag while passing a telecommunications bill that they said
would help the little guy. What a shock that the opposite happened.
Consumers saw their phone, cable and high-speed Internet rates
increase, and existing providers strengthened their monopolies.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the same ruse has returned. On Wednesday, the House of
Representatives passed the proposed Internet Freedom and Broadband
Deployment Act, which would relax the already loose regulations of
the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Telephone companies would no longer
be required to let competitors use their copper phone lines and other
facilities to offer high-speed Internet access.</LD>
<LD>   The bill's principal author, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.),
claims that his legislation would spur the local phone companies to
make the costly investments needed to bring broadband to poor and
rural areas.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the legislation would essentially let the Baby Bells
freeze out competing Internet service providers from digital
subscriber line, or DSL, services. That would lead to fewer choices
and higher prices for broadband subscribers. There would be no
credible price competition. No small and innovative Internet service
providers with creative ideas about, for instance, audio- and
videoconferencing. As Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) bluntly put
it, the bill is a "blasphemy ... a total fraud that will extend the
power of monopolists rather than promote competition."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the legislators who took to the House floor to support or
oppose the bill Wednesday tripped over its highly technical
terms--their orations seemingly motivated less by an eagerness to
help their constituents than by a desire to court the bill's
proponents (mainly the Baby Bells) or its opponents. Among the foes
are small Internet service providers as well as some big ones like
AT&amp;T and Sprint. Both sides together have given $32 million in
campaign contributions to members of Congress since debate on the
bill began three years ago, according to the nonprofit Center for
Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Tauzin nor his opponents could exactly be called friends
of the consumer on this issue. But one thing is sure: Despite
Tauzin's overheated contention that his bill is all "about jobs ...
about [giving] us all a chance to enjoy this amazing technology," the
legislation is a perfect child of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. It
will not help consumers, promote competition or spur innovation.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) should make sure the
bill does not leave the Senate alive. FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell
should also resist lobbying pressure to relax broadband regulation
through backdoor means if the legislation fails.</TE>

<LD>An appeals court ruling this week turning Omar Bradley out of
office--again--was a really tough break for Compton's once,
once-again and not-anymore mayor. After all, last month he'd managed
to convince a judge that he lost his bid for a third term because his
name appeared second on the ballot. As a result, Bradley's long-time
political nemesis, prosecutor Eric Perrodin, the man Bradley once
tried to pound to a pulp on the street outside the City Council's
chambers, squeaked into Bradley's throne, er, seat last June by a
margin of 281 votes. (Don't tell Bill Jones and Dick Riordan, whose
names appear second and seventh on the ballot for next week's
Republican gubernatorial primary, behind Bill Simon in the No. 1
position.)</LD>
<LD>   With the trial court's finding that Bradley was, in effect,
swindled out of his rightful return to power, Bradley thought he had
another four years in the bag. But the appeals court wouldn't buy the
"ballot primacy" argument and threw out the lower court ruling that
had restored Bradley to office. With the California Supreme Court's
decision Thursday denying Bradley's emergency appeal, the gig may
finally be finished for the man who has likened himself to the Roman
emperor, Augustus.</LD>
<TE>   The comparison is a strained one, and not just because Augustus
ruled for some 40 years to Bradley's eight. For one thing, Augustus
didn't have to worry about paying attorneys. But wait, neither does
Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   The tab for his failed legal gambit runs to $840,000. Seem a tad
high? Well, consider that senior litigators can command $450 per
hour, that paralegals fetch $100 per hour and that all the election
law experts hired--the folks who dreamed up the argument that
Bradley's place on the ballot sank his reelection bid--don't come
cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if Bradley has lost, he's not nearly as big a loser as the
93,000 other residents of Compton, who earlier this week learned that
they will be footing the bill.</TE>
<TE>   There's no use daydreaming about what $840,000 could do to upgrade
Compton's five parks, how many new books and computers that money
could buy for the city's one library, the potholes that could be
repaired and the trees that could be planted along streets. That's
because Bradley's City Council cronies blew their former (we think)
leader a giant air kiss Tuesday, voting to pay his legal bills. A
fitting capstone to a memorable career in public service. Recall that
Bradley was the guy who disbanded the Compton Police Department,
tried to impose a gag rule on city employees because someone had
called him a tyrant--never mind that he fancied himself a "gangster
mayor"--and insisted that, since being mayor is only a part-time job,
he could run the Compton schools at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   But as Augustus learned when German troops vanquished his army
near the Rhine River, the party can't go on forever. It's too bad
that, unless the City Council comes to its senses and reverses its
decision, taxpayers will be paying off Bradley's legal bill for
nearly that long.</TE>

<HD>Ending Eastside Transit Jam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of study, debate and delay, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority's board approved a plan Thursday for a light
rail line to the Eastside. Opponents vowed to keep fighting it,
whether in court or by literally throwing themselves onto its tracks.
Welcome to the land of congested freeways and contested mass transit
projects, where no one goes anywhere fast.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would extend the recently renamed Gold Line--13 miles of
light rail already under construction (and still under attack)
between Pasadena and downtown Los Angeles--eastward to Boyle Heights
and unincorporated East Los Angeles. The Eastside extension has
significant support in the neighborhoods it would serve. Almost $500
million in federal transit funds are earmarked for its construction
and at risk of disappearing if ground isn't broken soon.</LD>
<TE>   None of this matters to the rail line's vocal critics, who may
differ on their reasons but are united in naysaying. Some complain
that local businesses would suffer during construction. Some simply
don't trust the MTA. And some want the MTA to spend the money on
buses instead of light rail. Los Angeles City Councilman Nick
Pacheco, who represents Boyle Heights and should be leading the fight
to improve transportation, is grumbling about the MTA plan because a
campaign contributor who owns a shopping center wants a planned rail
station moved closer to his business so his customers won't have to
walk two blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, construction will disrupt some businesses. No, not every
shopping center can have a station next door. Yes, the MTA has messed
up in the past, but its new director, Roger Snoble, comes to the job
after building light rail in Dallas, on time and in budget, and is
eager to do the same for the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   And here is the big picture: About 20% of the working people in
the densely populated, mostly low-income Eastside depend on public
transportation to get to their jobs, compared with 6.5% in Los
Angeles County as a whole. Fully 30% of the residents have no access
to an automobile.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Eastside residents need buses. A light rail line would
supplement, not replace, buses, just as it would in the densely
populated, traffic-congested Westside, where for too long the
naysayers were the loudest voices in the debate over the finally
approved Exposition Line. Public debate is needed and welcome. But at
some point the argument gridlock has to end, or the traffic gridlock
never will.</TE>

<HD>Foes Find Lockyer Is Difficult to Unseat</HD>
<DH>Election: With his war chest dwarfing rivals' by millions,
attorney general is looking past the Democratic primary to a November
matchup with a GOP state senator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In seeking reelection, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer already has filled his
war chest with almost $5 million for a down-ticket race against an
eclectic field of challengers with low public profiles and little
money.</LD>
<LD>   His campaign finances reflect his standing as a long-established
liberal Democrat and California's top cop, and many large
contributions are from his party's traditional benefactors.</LD>
<LD>   But records show that in the last two years Lockyer's campaign
also collected $41,000 from the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens, which
his office regulates. And Oracle Corp., which has millions of dollars
in computer software contracts with the attorney general's office,
donated $50,000 and sponsored a golf tournament fund-raiser for
Lockyer. Oracle is one of the primary competitors of Microsoft, which
the attorney general is suing over alleged monopolistic practices.</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer, a veteran of a quarter of a century in the Legislature,
said that gaming regulation and contracting are handled by the
office's professional staff and that contributions do not influence
his official actions. "I have never connected a decision made with
any contribution made and no one has been able to contradict that
statement," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has collected so much money and staked out so much
political turf that even his opponents allow he will be difficult to
unseat.</TE>
<TE>   His lone rival in Tuesday's Democratic primary is Michael Schmier,
who has waged an esoteric legal crusade born of his personal
bankruptcy years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer acknowledges that he is looking past Schmier to a November
matchup with state Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Fullerton), a pro-business
lawmaker drafted by the GOP after others declined to take up the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   The field will be rounded out by three minor party candidates: a
barrister who has specialized in drunk-driving cases, a former Santa
Barbara County public defender who represents the homeless and an
Orange County attorney who once ran for president.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign experts have speculated that Lockyer is positioning
himself for a future gubernatorial bid. Without ruling that out,
Lockyer says he loves being attorney general. "I have noticed that
officeholders who are fixated on the next rung of the ladder often
don't do a good job on the one they're at," he said. "The best
politics is to do the job well."</TE>
<TE>   The race boils down to a referendum on Lockyer's performance as
the state's chief lawyer overseeing everything from narcotics and
firearms enforcement to gambling regulation and environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   His opponents span the ideological spectrum. Some fault him for
supporting capital punishment. Others criticize him for being
anti-business.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer dismisses his competition. He calls Schmier, whom he
easily defeated in the 1998 Democratic primary, "a person searching
for an office." He calls Ackerman an anti-environment and
anti-consumer legislator who is "defined more by what he is against
than for."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, 60, is the son of an East Bay roofing contractor. He
studied at nearby UC Berkeley and chaired George McGovern's 1972
presidential campaign in California.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer served in the Legislature for 25 years, the last four as
Senate leader. He earned his law degree at night school while
chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee. Although he now runs an
office with 1,000 lawyers, he has never practiced law full time.</TE>
<TE>   Like his dearth of legal experience, his liberal reputation was
one of his hurdles as attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty. Tom Sneddon did not endorse
Lockyer in 1998, but this time he is one of more than 30 district
attorneys who do. Many, like Sneddon, are Republicans and former
skeptics.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a great job in almost every respect," said Sneddon. "He
came in with very little exposure to law enforcement needs. But he's
an incredibly quick read, and he has done something about them."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer wanted to bolster consumer and environmental protection.
But he says he did so without weakening the law enforcement side or
the unit that handles criminal appeals for the counties.</TE>
<TE>   His office helped win a ban on jet skis on Lake Tahoe, and it
stepped up enforcement action against nursing homes. He also made
technological improvements in services provided to local law
enforcement, such as eliminating a backlog at the state's DNA
databank.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice is modernizing the automated criminal
history system--an $18-million project. Records show that Oracle,
which did some work for the department prior to Lockyer's election in
1998, has received at least $11 million in contracts for the criminal
history project since May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's campaign received $25,000 from the company in December
2000, as well as $25,000 in June 1991 for a fund-raiser at the Tehama
Valley Country Club in Carmel. Signup sheets listed Oracle as the
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle spokesman Jim Finn said there was no connection between the
contract--one of many between the company and the state--and the
contributions. "We have a ... wall between our political giving and
our business divisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Glueck, the Oracle vice president who reviews contributions,
said the company refrains from making donations while it has a
procurement pending, although it is comfortable making them
afterward. "We try to apply an appearance test," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company gave to the attorney general, Glueck said, because he
is one of the most important state officials and the California-based
company has an interest in state issues ranging from energy to
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said he is not involved in contracting decisions and was
not aware of the Oracle contract until recently.</TE>
<TE>   He said his policy as attorney general prohibits soliciting money
from individuals or companies with business before his office, such
as investigations or other problems.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the $41,000 in contributions from the Bicycle
Club, he said that the casino is not under investigation and that the
department's professional law enforcement officers "review the
licensing and make sure the games are honest."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his reputation as a liberal, Lockyer says he has supported
the three-strikes sentencing law and capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   His position on the death penalty may have comforted local police
and prosecutors. But it offends Lockyer's primary opponent, Schmier,
who called on Lockyer to make an 11th-hour attempt to block the
execution in January of Stephen Wayne Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer says that stopping executions is the governor's
responsibility, not his.</TE>
<TE>   To Schmier, seeking justice for a condemned man is part of his
larger crusade for a "dependable and affordable" legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Schmier, 57, is a University of Michigan-educated lawyer who has
specialized in labor and employment law. He was appointed to the
Emeryville school board and served part of last year.</TE>
<TE>   But his passion is fighting to make sure that all state appellate
court decisions are published and become legal precedent. The issue
hit home more than a decade ago, he said in an interview, when he was
facing a $300,000 malpractice suit.</TE>
<TE>   The judge sent the case to a private referee. Schmier said he
refused to participate, believing that legal precedents required both
parties to agree to such a dispute resolution. He said the judge
found him in default.</TE>
<TE>   Schmier said court costs and the judgment entered against him
exceeded $1 million, forcing him into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   He lost an appeal--but the decision was not ordered published. "So
no one else was warned that you could be forced to accept a referral
to a private referee," said Schmier. "It's a secret law."</TE>
<TE>   Schmier enjoyed some success--legal journals have written about
the issue and the Supreme Court agreed to post appellate decisions on
a Web site for 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   To get out his message, Schmier visits shopping centers, local
Democratic clubs and newspapers. He says he has taken out some
newspaper ads but has not raised enough money for statewide
television buys. "People are not anxious to give unless they think
you're going to win.... That's sad."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman, the Republican state senator, attended UC Berkeley. He
graduated from UC's Hastings Law School and has practiced business
law for 34 years. His political career includes 12 years on the
Fullerton City Council and three terms in the state Assembly. He was
elected to the Senate in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said he was considering running for attorney general in
2006 but got drafted for this election. The thinking was that Gov.
Gray Davis is susceptible to a Republican challenge--and a GOP
victory would make the incumbent attorney general more beatable.</TE>
<TE>   "If Davis wins, I will probably lose," Ackerman said. "Lots of
those races are driven by the top of the ticket."</TE>
<TE>   His late start, Ackerman said, means that he has lots of
fund-raising to do. "You should have the same amount at least as the
incumbent to be competitive," he said. As of Feb. 19, he reported
about $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   But Ackerman said he already has identified issues where he feels
Lockyer is vulnerable. The attorney general, he said, does not have
nearly as much legal experience as he does, and has harmed the
state's business climate by going after companies such as Microsoft
and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than joining in a federal settlement with Microsoft,
Lockyer is leading a contentious legal fight with the
Washington-based software company.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Lockyer's opponents have all but waved a white flag.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Beall Templin of Escondido, the American Independent Party
candidate, has run for various offices, including attorney general in
1998. She says she wants less government and more campaign finance
reform.</TE>
<TE>   Does she expect to win this time? "I'll plead the 5th," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian Party candidate, Ed Kuwatch, lives on a
mountaintop near Willits. He runs a business called Fast Eddie
Publishing and wrote a self-published book on drunk-driving laws in
the state.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to end laws that restrict the right to bear arms and
wants three-strikes cases to apply only to violent offenders. But he
has not raised money or campaigned around the state. He figures he'll
put together some bumper stickers with his catchy campaign slogan:
"Don't let them micromanage your life."</TE>
<TE>   The Green Party's candidate is Glenn Freeman Mowrer, Santa Barbara
County's retired public defender. "I represent mainly the homeless
who get tickets for camping or sleeping out of doors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mowrer wants a death penalty moratorium and an end to disparities
in how it is enforced around the state.</TE>
<TE>   His chances of winning? "Zero," he said.</TE>

<HD>Couple Face Murder Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jennifer and Matthew Fletcher are being held in the
1998 shooting death of her then-husband, Joel Shanbrom.</DH>

<LD>A woman who told police her husband was killed by robbers four years
ago was charged with his murder Thursday along with her current
husband.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Fletcher, 32, and Matthew Fletcher, 43, each face six
counts in the 1998 shooting death of Joel Andrew Shanbrom, including
murder, insurance fraud and conspiracy. There are also special
allegations of lying in wait and murder for financial gain, which
carry with them the possibility of the death penalty, according to a
criminal complaint by the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office. The couple are being held without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Fletcher told police that her husband at the time was
killed during a home invasion robbery at their Northridge residence
on March 18, 1998.</LD>
<TE>   LAPD detectives said they were immediately skeptical and began to
review the Shanbroms' financial records.</TE>
<TE>   They said they found that Jennifer Fletcher was the beneficiary of
more than $1 million in insurance on Joel Shanbrom's life. That
included a $300,000 policy issued in April 1996 by Primerica Life
Insurance Co.--for whom Matthew Fletcher worked--and a $500,000
policy issued by Midland Life Insurance. According to the information
filed by prosecutors, she has collected $315,000 in death benefits
from Shanbrom's employer, the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   As the investigation unfolded, police drew parallels to the 1996
killing of Robert Adair, who was beaten to death with a baseball bat,
allegedly by home invasion robbers.</TE>
<TE>   After an investigation, police arrested his wife, Jean, who was
also the recipient of a large insurance payout and made inconsistent
statements about the crime, investigators said. She was acquitted,
however.</TE>
<TE>   According to investigators, Jennifer Fletcher made inconsistent
statements about Shanbrom's shooting death. Nothing appeared to be
missing from the rented home in the 17900 block of Raymer Street that
Shanbrom shared with his wife and their 3-year-old son, Jacob, police
said. The crime was not reported for two hours, when Jennifer
Fletcher's mother, Diane Bates, returned home to discover Shanbrom's
body, police said. No weapon has been found.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Candidates Exchange Accusations on Campaign Tactics</HD>
<DH>Election: Bamieh says Totten running mean-spirited race.
Totten charges rival is misleading voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While rallying support in the Latino community, district attorney
candidate Ron Bamieh denounced his opponent Thursday for running a
mean-spirited campaign and vowed to stay positive in the final days
of the race.</LD>
<LD>   "Just to be clear, our campaign is not changing," Bamieh told
supporters gathered at a downtown Oxnard cafe. "We are going to stay
positive. We are going to run hard these last five days."</LD>
<LD>   Opponent Greg Totten's campaign fired back, repeating assertions
that Bamieh has misstated his qualifications and misled voters.</LD>
<TE>   The two prosecutors are locked in a bitter fight to replace
retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Although they agree on many law-and-order issues, they are
opposites in personality and have clashed repeatedly during an
increasingly hostile campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And Latino neighborhoods have been a frequent battleground.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, Totten held a news conference in Oxnard's
Heritage Square to announce support from minority leaders, including
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and Hank Lacayo, president of El Concilio
Del Condado de Ventura, the county's largest Latino advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bamieh held his own news conference just a few blocks
away to announce support from other community members, including
businessman Tomas Garcia and Oxnard Planning Commissioner Morey
Navarro.</TE>
<TE>   During the event, Bamieh supporters described him as the
"clean-cut candidate" while accusing Totten of running a dirty
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Totten and his law enforcement supporters condemned
Bamieh for running a Spanish-language television ad that featured a
72-year-old Santa Paula man who, unbeknownst to Bamieh, had been
convicted in 1989 of selling cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Totten told reporters that he found it "reprehensible" that a
candidate for district attorney would associate with a convicted drug
dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh defended the man, Raul Cervantes, for turning his life
around, and suggested Thursday that his opponent's "sad" attack has
angered people in the Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh backer Francine Delgado, a Santa Paula homemaker, told
reporters that she was outraged by Totten's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Manuel Martinez said voters should take note of the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Bamieh is a clean-cut candidate," he said. "The other side is
using dirty tactics against him and it's going to backfire."</TE>
<TE>   But Debra Creadick, Totten's campaign strategist, said the issue
is Bamieh's use of judgment--not Cervantes.</TE>
<TE>   And she suggested that Bamieh's claims of running a positive
campaign are false.</TE>
<TE>   Creadick said Bamieh misled voters early in the race about his
level of experience and is now trying to paint Totten as the bad guy
by having his supporters dish out criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "He is running an underground whisper campaign," Creadick said.
"He's not man enough to stand up and say what he really thinks, so he
has others do it for him."</TE>

<HD>One Year, 11,000 Diapers Later</HD>
<DH>Parenting: A weary but happy Lynn and Joe Bova of Ventura
celebrate the first birthday of their quintuplets today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Lynn and Joe Bova of Ventura celebrate the first birthday of their
quintuplets today, they could measure the last year of their lives in
many ways--perhaps the 11,000 diaper changes or the 10,000 times the
babies have been nursed or bottle-fed.</LD>
<LD>   But the staggering numbers aren't what they think of first. The
Bovas instead reflect on the five smiles that greet them every
morning when they walk into the babies' room and the touching way
their 2 1/2-year-old son, Ryan, hugs his siblings and runs for a
tissue to wipe their noses.</LD>
<LD>   "Having five babies at one time does have its own inherent
challenges--lack of sleep and nonstop days," Lynn said. "You're
cleaning five highchairs, five times the handprints on the walls and
food thrown on the floor. There's five times everything, but I prefer
to think about five times the hugs, six times the love [with Ryan],
six times the smiles."</LD>
<TE>   Abigail, Emiline, Katie, Nathan and Samuel--Ventura County's first
quintuplets and one of 13 sets born in the United States in 2001,
according to the "Facts About Multiples" Web site--will have a huge
birthday bash March 16. Community Memorial Hospital, their
birthplace, has invited about 200 relatives, hospital workers,
friends and volunteers who helped the Bovas through the year.</TE>
<TE>   Smooth Sailing in the First Year</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, will pass with less fanfare. The quints will get a
checkup, complete with vaccinations. Lynn will make a cake, the Bovas
will sing "Happy Birthday" and 50 little fingers will likely mash
frosting into five little mouths.</TE>
<TE>   It's definitely been a year for family members to celebrate,
devoid of the health problems and chaos that could have faced them.
Since Katie--the last one to master sucking, swallowing and breathing
on her own--came home 11 months ago, the only ailments the children
have had were their first colds and misshapen heads caused by their
being squished together during Lynn's pregnancy. Abigail, Emiline and
Samuel still wear padded helmets most of the time to reshape their
heads.</TE>
<TE>   "They were in good condition as babies and they have good
parenting," said their pediatrician, Paul Feldheim of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived with the help of fertility drugs and intrauterine
insemination, in which Joe's sperm was injected directly into Lynn's
uterus, the quintuplets were born seven weeks early. Their weights
ranged from 3 pounds, 15 ounces to 4 pounds, 10 ounces for a
relatively hefty total of nearly 22 pounds. Compared with all
1-year-olds, the children are now about average for weight--with
Nathan, the smallest at birth, the heaviest at nearly 22 pounds.
Emiline is the lightest at 18 1/2 pounds. Their heights are all way
above average, Lynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Developmentally, the babies are all average or beyond compared
with 10-month-olds, the age they would be if they had been born at
full term, Lynn said. Four are crawling. All can stand while holding
on to something, and Nathaniel and Abigail are the closest to
walking.</TE>
<TE>   The Bovas also seem to have defied the odds when it comes to
maintaining order. Space is tight in the Bovas' three-bedroom home,
with bins of clothes stacked on each other in what used to be their
living room. But it isn't the hectic, crazy place one might expect.
In fact, volunteers report, it's usually quite calm.</TE>
<TE>   Joe, the 36-year-old principal of Foothill Technology High School,
and Lynn, 31, a former kindergarten teacher, were determined not to
endure the chaos they had seen and heard about in other multiple
families.</TE>
<TE>   To do this, the Bovas adhere to rigid schedules and continue to
accept help. The family received many monetary donations and gifts,
including diapers, formula and money to help buy a van. But they feel
particularly indebted to the legion of volunteers. In the beginning,
90 people from Ventura Missionary Church and the Ventura Unified
School District provided round-the-clock help, Lynn said. Friends and
family, including both sets of grandparents, also helped.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to measure that," Lynn said. "We couldn't have
done it without them."</TE>
<TE>   The Bovas now go at it alone when the quintuplets sleep, but about
60 volunteers still cover 50 shifts a week. Having so many people in
their house was tough at first, Lynn said, but those who were
strangers have become close and the lack of time spent alone as a
family is worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think you have to be willing to sacrifice something," Lynn
said. "We'd rather sacrifice some privacy now at this point in our
lives in order to have quality time with our kids and [have] healthy
lives."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the quintuplets are an easygoing bunch. They play
and babble happily in their cribs until it's time for all of them to
get up at 8 a.m. While someone may shout to get the first bottle,
most of them patiently wait their turns in a plastic corral filled
with toys while their siblings are fed and changed. Even big brother
Ryan, whom the couple adopted in 1999, has adjusted well.</TE>
<TE>   "We really feel that God has blessed us with six children who
could handle being in a family like ours," Lynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Personalities Begin Coming Into Focus</TE>
<TE>   The quintuplets are not carbon copies of each other. Abigail is
the most social and affectionate and has earned the nickname
"Grabigail" because she is always grabbing and touching. Katie is the
most adventurous and curious. Emiline is the little rascal,
independent and stubborn with a talent for making funny faces. Bald,
toothless Samuel is the sensitive one and the first to wave and say
"Dada." Blue-eyed Nathan, the only blond, likes yelling loudly,
banging on things and being where the action is.</TE>
<TE>   And action isn't hard to find. Joe said the biggest blessing of
having quintuplets is that there is never a dull moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody is always going to do something to make you laugh or
entertain you in some way," he said. "It's constant joy."</TE>

<LD>A 22-year-old man was hospitalized for a mental evaluation after
police on Thursday found a dozen possible pipe bombs and volatile
chemicals in his bedroom, authorities said. The discovery led to the
evacuation of an entire block.</LD>
<LD>   About 8 a.m., Alhambra police responded to a home in the 400 block
of North Hidalgo Avenue near Huntington Drive after the mother of the
unidentified man showed up at the police station to report her son
was acting strangely, said Capt. David Skorheim. The man, who is
apparently mentally ill, had not been taking his medication, she told
police.</LD>
<LD>   Residents were allowed back in their homes about 4:30 p.m., he
said.</LD>

<HD>24 Are Arrested in Countywide Gang Sweep</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A multi-agency task force arrested 24 in a countywide gang sweep
Thursday morning, a sheriff's spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 200 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and officers
from the county Department of Probation, the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the California Youth Authority and the
Department of Corrections made arrests starting in Compton and
spanning to 70 locations across the county.</LD>
<LD>   The busts, among occasional operations by the county's Safe
Streets Gang Enforcement Unit, turned up a number of handguns, an
assault rifle and an illegal chop shop, Sheriff's Deputy Richard Pena
said.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca expanded the anti-gang unit to the north end of
the county in 1999. The unit has been compared to the Los Angeles
Police Department's troubled CRASH units.</TE>
<TE>   Pena said the team does not often conduct sweeps such as the one
Thursday, and that the unit "has a lot of accountability"</TE>

<HD>Baca's Budget Woes Raise Policy Issues</HD>
<DH>Sheriff: Some question cuts while new programs are started.
He touts 'new direction' for agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his four years as Los Angeles County sheriff, Lee Baca has closed
a jail and bought an airplane. He has delayed the promotions of some
high-ranking officers, while at the same time trying to increase his
command staff. He has opened a jail for drug and domestic violence
offenders but has not allocated the money to finish it.</LD>
<LD>   Baca has launched and protected programs close to his heart, but
also has overspent his budget so severely that the county now
requires him to submit monthly expenditure reports.</LD>
<LD>   The sheriff, who exceeded his $1.4-billion budget last year by $25
million, is the only county department head on such a watch, and his
spending habits have become fodder for his campaign opponents, Sgts.
Patrick Gomez and John Stites, both of whom work for the department.
March 5 is election day.</LD>
<TE>   Baca said his decisions are deliberate and reflect his
determination to move the department in new directions. He said that
he takes the budget situation seriously and that he has a much
clearer understanding of the department's finances today than he did
when he was first elected.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real learning experience for all of us in the county,"
Baca said. "I'm very flexible when it comes to balancing a budget
based on need. I understand that I can't just barrel on oblivious to
the fact that these [are] precious dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Still, his choices have led some county officials and others to
question whether he has a clear budget strategy. Instead, those
officials say, Baca appears to be making some bold moves while
maintaining a host of other, less traditional law enforcement
programs. Gomez and Stites have repeatedly said that the first thing
they would do upon election is order an audit of department spending.</TE>
<TE>   Operating in an Unusual Financial Environment</TE>
<TE>   The county sheriff operates in an unusual budget environment. He
is an elected official, and the county supervisors have no direct
authority over him. As a result, he can spend money largely as he
pleases, but the board can limit the overall amount provided to the
department, giving the supervisors substantial power over the
sheriff. In Baca's case, they are using that power to try to change
his spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   "We really haven't had a department in the recent past come up
this short," said Sharon Bunn, chief deputy in the county's Chief
Administrative Office, who formerly worked in the Sheriff's
Department budget division. "Everyone is taking this very
seriously.... He's got to realize his resources."</TE>
<TE>   Department veterans say that the sheriff's budget difficulties are
no worse than those of his predecessor, Sherman Block, and that Baca
inherited some debt carried over from his former boss' tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Baca was hit with a large lawsuit settlement--$27 million
for detaining people in jail past their release dates--that adds to
his budget difficulties. The department is paying that amount over
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Baca and his budget officers attribute last year's shortfall to a
number of things: debt carried over from previous years,
higher-than-expected workers' compensation claims, increased training
costs because the department hired more deputies than it had set
aside money for; and increased costs during the Democratic National
Convention, held in 2000 at Staples Center downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Promise to Repay County Over 2 Years</TE>
<TE>   Baca and other department officials say they were caught off guard
by the budget shortfall. As a result, the sheriff has promised to
repay the county coffers for the deficit over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   But some confusion remains as to the money he will use--and how
much latitude he will be permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Baca, for instance, has proposed diverting federal money that the
county receives in return for jailing illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   But the county chief administrative office says that money may not
be spent on debt reduction, and is holding the money in a trust fund
until it can resolve that dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials complain about what they say is the county's
improper withholding of state sales tax revenue from the department.
That, too, is a source of friction between the agency and its county
parent, with county officials arguing that they have other priorities
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the disputes about how much money the sheriff receives are
related debates about how he spends what he gets. He recently
purchased a $2.4-million airplane, whose funding he said mostly came
from narcotics forfeitures that could not be used for other, general
fund purposes.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Baca's budget czar, Chief Marvin Dixon, said the
costs were initially going to be shared with the Orange County
Sheriff's Department but that agency backed out after the issue
became public.</TE>
<TE>   Baca says the airplane is primarily for use by investigators to
get to and from homicide scenes and interviews, for example, but he
and other top brass use it as well.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the department quietly closed the south jail in the
Pitchess Honor Ranch complex in the north county, saving $11.2
million a year. Groups of inmates have been transferred to other
facilities over several months; 79 deputies, along with 52 civilian
workers, have been reassigned. Only a year ago, Baca was seeking to
add to that jail by creating special classes and counseling for
female inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The department also recently closed a floor at the Century
Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood to save nearly $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, Baca opened a dorm there for veterans to
receive special programs while they are incarcerated. The sheriff
plans to hold an official opening of the 96-bed dorm on election day.
That's just one of the ways that Baca has tried to expand programs
for inmates even as he has reduced jail beds. Although some have been
shelved, Baca has pushed for drug- and alcohol-recovery courses and
anger-management classes.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly ambitious--and still unrealized--effort is the
so-called Miracle Program. Baca has proposed construction of a
women's jail in the north county where inmates could live with their
infants and take parenting, anger-management and other classes while
serving time. The cost of that facility is estimated at $4.1 million,
but so far Baca has been unable to come up with the money.</TE>
<TE>   And he touts the Biscailuz Recovery Center, which offers drug and
domestic violence offenders the chance to live in low-security dorms
taking classes in a group therapy-type atmosphere. But half the dorms
sit empty, painted and furnished without the funding to staff--or
open--them. Last year, the sheriff requested $2 million to open 120
additional beds. The supervisors declined to appropriate the money.</TE>
<TE>   Grappling with his budget shortfall, Baca has, on his own, elected
to delay remodeling and reopening of the Sybil Brand Institute
women's jail, a move that saved him $10 million this year. Female
inmates are now housed at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, a
maximum-security setting that Baca has said is inappropriate for most
of the women there.</TE>
<TE>   Although jail construction and operation eat up a large share of
the sheriff's budget, Baca is using his spending decisions to adjust
staffing as well.</TE>
<TE>   To save more than $1 million, the sheriff is delaying the
promotions of some commanders and captains, but he is also trying to
win voter approval to increase the size of his top command staff at a
cost of about $600,000. Baca succeeded in placing Measure C on next
week's ballot requesting approval for an assistant sheriff and four
division chiefs; voter approval is needed under the County Charter.</TE>
<TE>   Those positions are necessary, the sheriff said, because the
command structure was created more than 30 years ago when the
department--and the communities it serves--was smaller. In 1967, 23
cities contracted for department services, compared with 41 today;
the department had about 6,000 employees, compared with nearly 15,000
today; and the jail population has just about doubled, from 10,000 to
nearly 20,000 on average.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the tight budget, Baca is pulling back on some of
his favorite initiatives, including a project that put new deputies
through leadership classes. Training Division Capt. Dennis Conte said
the academy has cut its program by a week, sprinkling the sheriff's
leadership classes throughout the now 18-week curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the department, Baca may be best known for his decision to
start the Office of Independent Review, a group of outside attorneys
hired by the county at the end of last year to oversee internal
Sheriff's Department investigations. Baca persuaded the Board of
Supervisors to absorb the costs of that office in the county budget,
rather than in his own. But although he said the rationale for the
office was to add integrity to internal reviews of deputies, he is
now proposing to transfer four sergeants from Internal Affairs to
save money.</TE>
<TE>   That has caused some to question Baca's budget strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Bill McSweeney, for example, oversees Internal Affairs and
other investigations. He argued that those four sergeants, who are
building profiles of problem deputies, are an important part of the
tracking program in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "Would the quality suffer without them?" he asked. "Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   While cutting officers assigned to identifying problem deputies,
Baca has found the money to reinstate his "off the streeters"
program, in which the department conducts background and medical
checks on prospective deputies and then assigns them to the jails
before sending them to the academy for their formal training.</TE>
<TE>   That program, which officials predict will help decrease the high
costs of overtime, has raised concerns among some in the county Hall
of Administration who worry that the new hires are too inexperienced
for the jails.</TE>
<TE>   Some County Officials Puzzled and Annoyed</TE>
<TE>   Some of the moves--buying the airplane while closing jail beds,
for instance--have puzzled and annoyed other county officials. One
department observer called them "penny-wise and pound-foolish."
Others have suggested that Baca thinks more about political
ramifications than law enforcement needs.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Gloria Molina credits Baca with improving his
approach, but said the sheriff still sometimes surprises the board.</TE>
<TE>   "It's when we see him coming in and asking for money and proposing
new programs," Molina said. "That always creates a bit of a problem.
It makes it hard for us to understand his priorities. Sometimes he
throws a curveball to us."</TE>

<HD>Valley Busway Plan Advances</HD>
<DH>MTA: Some strongly oppose the east-west project, which
critics say won't pass legal muster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU and KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning aside protests from residents who live along the 14-mile
route, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday approved
a key environmental report for a proposed east-west busway in the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA board also allocated $1 million to study the feasibility
of a north-south Valley busway. In addition, the panel voted to
vastly expand Los Angeles County's rapid-bus network, from two lines
to 25.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's approval of an environmental impact report allows the
MTA to solicit construction bids for the $329.5-million, east-west
busway, which is separate from the rapid system.</LD>
<TE>   The busway would run along Chandler Boulevard and Topham Street,
from Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the Red Line subway in North
Hollywood. It is scheduled to open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The route would be used by buses only, and would include stops at
Pierce College, the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, the Van Nuys
government complex and Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   State officials and the Valley's business community have pushed
for the busway for years. But some residents and rail transit
advocates have vehemently opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have 10 rapid bus routes" for less than the cost of the
busway, said Diana Lipari, chairwoman of Citizens Organized for Smart
Transit, which was formed to fight the project.</TE>
<TE>   She noted a 2001 study showing that a rapid bus serving a similar
14-mile route would cover the distance in 43 minutes. MTA's latest
estimates show that an end-to-end busway ride would be 35 to 40
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are we spending all this money?" Lipari asked.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Grossman, a representative of the Yad Avraham Congregation
in Valley Village, told the board the busway would endanger members
of his synagogue, senior citizens and children who walk in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The busway may not withstand legal scrutiny, warned Kymberleigh
Richards, a spokeswoman for Southern California Transit Advocates.
She said a state law calls for a rail line in that corridor, and
$44.8 million of the busway funding came from a bond issue that
requires the route to be converted to rail within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But MTA board President John Fasana said the busway is on "solid
footing" legally and financially.</TE>
<TE>   Also backing the busway were representatives of the California
Department of Transportation, Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., and
United Chambers of Commerce of San Fernando Valley, as well as
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica).</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, the MTA board voted to add 23 lines to the Metro
Rapid network. The rapid buses now serve two lines--along Wilshire
and Whittier boulevards from Santa Monica to Montebello, and along
Ventura Boulevard in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The first six of the new lines will be added within three years,
at a cost of $24 million, according to the MTA. They will include a
second Valley line, along Van Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid buses share streets with autos. They cut travel time by
making fewer stops and are equipped with transponders that keep
traffic lights green longer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the MTA board approved a study that clears the way
for construction of a six-mile light rail line from downtown to the
Eastside.</TE>

<HD>Another Day, Another Mayor</HD>
<DH>Compton: Eric Perrodin is sworn in for second time after
his rival's appeal is rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE and SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Perrodin, the elected Compton mayor until a court ruling last
month triggered civic chaos, was officially returned to office
Thursday after the state Supreme Court declined to hear his
opponent's appeal to stop it.</LD>
<LD>   Smiling broadly as about 50 supporters hovered outside the Compton
city clerk's office, Perrodin was sworn in for the second time since
the contested June election.</LD>
<LD>   "Deja vu, huh?" said a Perrodin friend, hugging him.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm feeling pretty good right now," said Perrodin, a deputy
district attorney who narrowly defeated two-time incumbent Omar
Bradley in a stunning upset eight months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I would ask the supporters of Mr. Bradley to put aside their
differences," Perrodin added, as about 20 Bradley boosters stood
outside the office with signs in Spanish: "We don't want Perrodin for
mayor," and "Latinos support Omar Bradley."</TE>
<TE>   Decorum was maintained through the brief ceremony, but only
barely.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin attorney Fred Woocher said he got word about 2:30 p.m.
that the Supreme Court, in a one-sentence notice, chose not to hear
Bradley's emergency request for a review.</TE>
<TE>   "They might have heard it and ruled on it one way or the other,"
Woocher said. "But in this case, they declined even to hear it. So
the result is that the appellate order [went into] effect as
scheduled at 4 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley could not be reached, and his attorney, Bradley W. Hertz,
did not return telephone messages.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz had expressed hope that the high court would recognize "what
is at stake" and agree to review a Tuesday appellate court ruling
that evicted Bradley from office.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the past month's volley of legal rulings seesawed
Bradley and Perrodin in and out of office, this city of 93,000 had a
history of political turbulence.</TE>
<TE>   After the June election that was narrowly won by Perrodin, Bradley
filed suit, charging that his defeat was the result of election fraud
by the city of Compton, Perrodin and City Clerk Charles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 8, the trial judge ruled that Davis broke the law by
placing Perrodin's name first on the ballot and that it afforded him
enough of a statistical advantage to decide the race. The judge
ordered Bradley and Melanie Andrews, who lost the election for an
open City Council seat to Leslie Irving, sworn into office Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   They had just convened for their second City Council meeting
Tuesday afternoon when word arrived that the appellate court had just
granted Perrodin's request to return him to office while his appeal
of the lower court ruling was considered.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Perrodin and Bradley agree that the appeals process
will last a minimum of four to six months but probably longer.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Perrodin is back in the seat of power.</TE>
<TE>   And so at 4:02 p.m., he resumed the mayoralty surrounded by
friends and fans. Before a bank of news cameras, the cheers of
Perrodin fans prompted the Bradley camp to begin chanting, "Bradley!
Bradley!"</TE>
<TE>   Davis--who had sworn Bradley back into office a few weeks
before--asked the celebrants and protesters to go outside. The two
camps repaired to the City Hall steps and taunted each other for
almost an hour.</TE>
<TE>   When Perrodin finally exited City Hall, he was met with shouts of
"Eric! Eric!"</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin said one of his first goals in office is to address the
City Council's controversial 3-1 vote Tuesday night to pay Bradley
$43,000 in back wages and his attorney's claim for $840,000.</TE>
<TE>   City Treasurer Douglas Sanders, who attended the swearing-in along
with several city employees, said the city staff is looking forward
to focusing on their work again without the storm cloud of politics.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty tense for the last 18 days," said Sanders, who was
elected in June. "But, you know, as the treasurer, I'm concerned
about us paying two city managers and two assistant city managers,
and this thing they approved the other night.</TE>
<TE>   "That check was not going to be signed," he explained. "If you
looked at the judge's order, it looked like Mr. Bradley never was in
office, so why would you pay someone back pay if they were never in
office?</TE>
<TE>   "And No. 2, the attorney fees, $840,000, would be a gift of public
funds, and that is illegal. So I don't think that was very prudent
for the council to vote for.... I don't think it was right."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had received 75 calls from residents indignant about
the vote to pay Bradley's legal fees.</TE>

<HD>Glendale Teen's Design Picked to Aid Families of 9/11
Victims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale boy was one of two Southland students who topped nearly
150 others statewide in a license plate design contest intended to
help families of Sept. 11 victims.</LD>
<LD>   The winners, Dashielle Samoy, a 17-year-old senior at Allan F.
Daily High School in Glendale, and David Amond, a 17-year-old senior
at Mary Star of the Sea High School in San Pedro, were announced by
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City).</LD>
<LD>   Dashielle won for his American flag motif design, and David won
for his slogan, "We Will Never Forget."</LD>
<TE>   Dashielle, who spent two weeks crafting his design on his
computer, said, "I put the flag because it stands for patriotism--for
all the people showing the flag today. The clouds represented the
people who died."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 license plate provision is included in a bill
sponsored by Wesson and pending in the state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the plates will be available to all registered
California drivers for a $50 one-time cost and a $40 annual fee.</TE>
<TE>   The proceeds from sales of the special plates would provide $5,000
scholarships to the surviving spouses and children of the estimated
200 Californians who died in the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Money would also help fund anti-terrorism programs in the state
Office of Criminal Justice Planning.</TE>
<TE>   "We are affording Californians an opportunity to do something
substantive. We're not soldiers or police officers, but everyone
wants to do our part," Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   The winning designs were chosen by representatives from
government, law enforcement, arts and school organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Brenda Lamothe of the First AME Church of Los Angeles
came up with the idea for the contest and represented Wesson on the
selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   "When people look at it they will remember our brotherhood and the
reasons we are the United States. The fact that we had a tragedy
pulled us together, and we are united under the flag and God,"
Lamothe said.</TE>

<HD>Radio Host to Be Charged in Rape Case</HD>
<DH>Burbank: Firmo Rossetti, who uses the name Hector
Rocksetti, appears in court today on allegations involving a
14-year-old girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish-language radio personality Hector Rocksetti is scheduled to
appear in a Burbank courtroom this morning to answer charges that he
raped a 14-year-old girl after promising her a broadcasting job and
to boost her singing career.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old radio host, whose real name is Firmo Rossetti, was
booked at the Burbank jail Thursday on 10 felony counts and a
misdemeanor, including child molestation, rape and oral copulation.</LD>
<LD>   He is being held in lieu of $1.5-million bail.</LD>
<TE>   Rossetti, who works the morning show for Century City-based Viva
107.1 (KLYY-FM), surrendered to authorities Wednesday afternoon at
the Burbank police station. He had gone there voluntarily to be
questioned in connection with the rape investigation, Lt. Tim Stehr
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti is accused of twice assaulting the girl, on Aug. 25 and
on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   In the first alleged incident, Rossetti picked the teen up from
her Long Beach home, saying he would take her to a recording session.
Instead, he had sex with her in his car and again at his apartment in
the 1500 block of Catalina Street in Burbank, police said. Five
months later, he again forced himself on the girl while the two were
in his apartment, Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to offering to help the girl, Rossetti reportedly told
her he would help her father get a job or start a business, Stehr
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to find out if there are other victims, and, if there
are, for them to come forward," Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stephen, 48, a neighbor of Rossetti, said Wednesday night
he saw police remove bedding, boxes, a camera case and metal
suitcases from the radio host's apartment. Police also towed a pickup
truck thought to belong to Rossetti, Stephen said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Viva 107.1, owned by New York-based Big City Radio,
would not comment Thursday on the allegations against the radio host.</TE>
<TE>   Viva program director Fernando Perez said Rossetti previously
worked at KRTO-FM (98.3).</TE>
<TE>   As Viva's host during the morning weekday commute--the most
critical ratings shift in radio--he immediately began spinning
Spanish contemporary music, pop, rock and tropical tunes, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Viva listeners, who were told Thursday morning about the
allegations against Rossetti, responded by calling in with questions
as well as support for both Rossetti and the station, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacqueline Madrigal, editor in chief of Radio y Musica Magazine,
said Rossetti is known for getting young listeners hooked on
contemporary pop music rather than more traditional sounds.</TE>

<HD>E-Mail on Bond Measure Backfires</HD>
<DH>Schools: Fullerton district superintendent McCune says he
regrets soliciting employees for money. State officials say his
action does not appear to be illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The superintendent of the Fullerton School District said Thursday
that he regrets sending an e-mail urging his employees to contribute
money to the district's campaign for a bond issue on Tuesday's
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Some opponents of the $49.7-million bond issue, which would be the
district's first, expressed outrage at Supt. Cameron McCune's
missive, sent Feb. 7 to principals, in which he wrote, "It is now
time to also dig into your pocket for $$$$."</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is totally inappropriate that he is leveraging or
pressuring staff to donate money," said Chris Thompson, a parent and
president of the Beechwood Elementary School's site council who is
opposed to the bond.</LD>
<TE>   "No manager should ever pressure any government employee to donate
money to any political cause."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the State Department of Education said the e-mail
does not appear to be illegal because McCune sent it from home and
did not actually urge employees to vote a certain way.</TE>
<TE>   The education code prohibits the use of school supplies and funds
to urge the support or defeat of a ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   In the e-mail, provided by bond-issue opponents, McCune wrote: "As
I have shared with you before, the Bond election committee is in
serious need of money.... Unfortunately, it was reported today at the
Bond committee meeting that to date only a small number of
Administrators have contributed.... If you need an envelope, call
me."</TE>
<TE>   McCune said Thursday he wished he could rescind the electronic
missive.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not meant in any way to be coercion," he said. "The
awkward part is, in a bond election, we are all expected to
participate, but legally we are not supposed to use district time or
district funds."</TE>
<TE>   He did not do so, McCune said. He sent the e-mail from his home
computer in response to administrators' questions about what they
were expected to do to support the bond issue, which he said is badly
needed to repair aging campuses and construct an elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Hilda Sugarman, co-chair of the district's
bond campaign, said McCune sent a follow-up e-mail to all district
employees Thursday saying it was not his intention to make anyone
feel coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Some principals who received the e-mail on their office computers
said they did not feel any pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "The e-mail is a request. It's not tied to our employment in any
way," said Carolyn Milliken, principal of Ladera Vista Junior High
School.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate the superintendent's leadership in trying to get the
bond passed."</TE>

<HD>Dale Eunson, 97; Prolific Writer of Stories, Scripts
Focused on Frontier</HD>

<LD>Dale Eunson, who for seven decades successfully wrote nearly anything
that fit on paper--short stories, novels, plays, motion picture
scripts and teleplays--has died. He was 97.</LD>
<LD>   Eunson died Feb. 20 at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital
in Woodland Hills of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   A child of the frontier, Eunson mined his rich background for many
of his best-loved works. They included the true story of his father,
Robbie, who as a 12-year-old newly orphaned son of Scottish
immigrants trudged through the Wisconsin snows on Christmas Eve of
1868 to find good homes for his five younger siblings. The tale
became a Christmas magazine story, a children's novel, a motion
picture, a television movie and a radio narrative.</LD>
<TE>   That charming novel, "The Day They Gave Babies Away," was not
Eunson's first but certainly became one of his most popular efforts.
Published in 1946, it was reprinted in 1970 and was still popular in
1991, when one reviewer suggested a paperback version as a
last-minute Christmas stocking stuffer, calling it "no-frills prose
perfect for reading aloud."</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Eunson co-scripted the movie made from the book, "All
Mine to Give," starring Cameron Mitchell and Glynis Johns.</TE>
<TE>   Eunson told of his Montana sheep ranch childhood in two other
books, the novel "Homestead" in 1934, and a children's book of
reminiscences, "Up On the Rim" in 1970. A Times reviewer commented on
the latter: "It is a tribute to Eunson's skill and loving memory of
those bygone years that his work achieves such a pleasing,
entertaining quality. To read this book is to return, however
briefly, to a vanished America of emotion and events recollected in
tranquillity and to values and certainties that made those pioneer
years so critical in our history."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Eunson turned a longtime friendship into another popular
novel about two boyhood pals from Montana and their intertwined
lives, "Philip's Chair," with one boy clearly his alter ego. A Times
reviewer wrote, "Eunson writes fluently, highly literately, with
delightful and often sly humor, and with painstaking insight....
Trust me, 'Philip's Chair' will enthrall you."</TE>
<TE>   Moving to Los Angeles with his father and stepmother in the early
1920s, Eunson attended USC for one year but dropped out for lack of
money. He worked as a publicist for movie studios and then became
secretary to novelist and George Washington biographer Rupert Hughes.
Some might question who worked for whom, because Hughes became a
nurturing mentor, encouraging Eunson to rewrite his short stories and
helping him sell them to New York magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes also recommended the young man in 1930 as secretary to Ray
Long, editor of the Cosmopolitan magazine. Eunson rose quickly,
becoming associate editor in 1933 and then fiction editor as well as
freelance contributor.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I never was a really good secretary," Eunson said to The
Times in 1933. "So my bosses were always encouraging me, helping me
to do something else."</TE>
<TE>   In 1931, Eunson married writer Katherine Albert and, until her
death in 1970, collaborated with her on Broadway plays, including
"Loco," and 1950s movie scripts, including "On the Loose," starring
their daughter, Joan Evans. Other films were "Sabre Jet," starring
Robert Stack, and "The Star," featuring Bette Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The couple also penned several dozen television scripts for such
shows as "Leave It to Beaver" and "Little House on the Prairie."</TE>
<TE>   With Hagar Wilde, Eunson also co-wrote the Broadway play "Guest in
the House" in 1942, which was made into the movie of the same title
two years later starring Ralph Bellamy and Anne Baxter; and the play
"Public Relations" starring Broadway actress Elaine Stritch.</TE>
<TE>   Eunson's solo writing included not only his books but some 50
short stories published in various magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed again in 1993 by the death of his second wife, artist
Berenice Tolins Dratler, Eunson is survived by his daughter; two
stepchildren, Lynne Finney and Jay Dratler Jr.; two grandchildren;
and one great-grandson.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Man Killed in Blast That Damages 12 Homes</HD>
<DH>Explosion: The victim, 65, was reportedly using a welding
torch in his Costa Mesa garage at 3:30 a.m.</DH>

<LD>A 65-year-old man who may have been working with a welding torch was
killed Thursday in an early-morning explosion that damaged homes,
melted car tires and rained debris throughout a Costa Mesa
neighborhood</LD>
<LD>   Residents in the Monticello Townhomes complex said the 3:30 a.m.
blast rocked the neighborhood--blowing out windows, ripping doors
from hinges and crumpling metal garage doors.</LD>
<LD>   "It blew up like a bomb went off," said Mark Galoustian, who has
lived in the neighborhood for two years. "Our bedroom shook. We
looked out the window, and the whole place was a fireball."</LD>
<TE>   Fire officials said the explosion, which was followed by a series
of smaller blasts, was heard by firefighters at a station four miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   The man killed in the explosion has not been identified but was
described as a quiet retiree who kept to himself. Neighbors said he
had lived in the complex for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor John Leighton said the man rushed from his garage after
the blast, his clothing on fire. Leighton said he sprayed him with a
fire extinguisher, but the man then turned and ran back inside his
burning garage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why he did that," said Leighton, a 15-year resident
of the tract. "He didn't say anything." The man's body was later
found just inside his garage, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty residents were evacuated to a Red Cross shelter set up at
nearby Vanguard University of Southern California. Gas service was
interrupted for several hours in the morning while crews searched for
leaks, and some residents were without water for much of the day,
said Barbara Marcosa, a spokeswoman for the Costa Mesa Fire
Department.</TE>
<TE>   In all, a dozen other townhomes--each worth about $250,000--were
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials have not determined a cause for the explosion but
said it came from the man's home. His garage, they said, was stocked
with welding materials, tanks and chemicals. A bomb squad was brought
in later in the day to inspect to canisters and tanks in the
burned-out garage.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the fire forced firefighters to battle it from
the street. It took 40 minutes to extinguish the blaze. By then,
little more than a skeleton of the townhouse remained.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the complex's property management company,
Chrissy Gruninger, said the man rented the townhouse from a Newport
Beach couple. The management company said there are no rules barring
the use or storage of welding torches in the complex.</TE>

<LD>A 65-year-old man who may have been working with a welding torch was

burned-out garage.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the fire forced firefighters to battle it from
the street. It took 40 minutes to extinguish the blaze. By then,
little more than a skeleton of the townhouse remained. Fire crews
later brought in wooden beams to prop up the walls. The blast set off
a frantic effort in the neighborhood to alert residents to the fire
ignited by the explosion. Residents ran from house to house in the
darkness, banging on doors and yelling for their neighbors to
evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   "When the first blast occurred, we thought it was an earthquake,"
said Nancy Fay, who lives down the street and ran outside with a
phone, dialing 911 as she screamed for neighbors to get out of their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the second popping noise hit, and we thought it was a bomb.
And when the third one struck, we thought we were going to war," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Minear said he and his wife, Carol, grabbed garden hoses,
hoping to keep the fire from spreading. But they were pushed back as
the man's house was swallowed by flames.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't too much you could do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dawson said that the blast woke him and that when he looked
out his broken bedroom window, he saw a man in flames stumbling from
a garage. Dawson said he grabbed a blanket to help smother the flames
and ran outside.</TE>
<TE>   But when he got there, the man was gone. Dawson said that he ran
toward the burning house but that the heat drove him back.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the man killed in the blast was quiet and reserved
yet friendly.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor, who knew him only as "Sonny," said he helped her
with a plumbing problem. Others said he would offer wood and other
supplies to kids building skateboard ramps.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, he woke early and worked on bicycles in his
garage, often using welding equipment, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was real quiet, and he didn't get into a lot of
conversations," said Julia Cross, who serves on the homeowners
association board. "He just kind of stayed to himself and liked to
putter around in his garage."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Manfrey, who has lived in the complex about four years, said
he'd wave to the man or say hello, but he never learned his name.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the complex's property management company,
Chrissy Gruninger, said the man rented the townhouse from a Newport
Beach couple.</TE>
<TE>   The management company said there are no rules barring the use or
storage of welding torches in the complex.</TE>

<HD>Reported Flu Cases Drop 90% in County</HD>
<DH>Health: Only 18 have been officially noted since November,
though the actual number is much higher. Vaccines, reduction in
travel are credited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year, Isela Sanchez thought she had beaten the flu bug. By
February, the fever, body aches and chills that historically had
haunted her during the early winter months hadn't arrived.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Super Bowl Sunday. Her family noticed that she wasn't
cheering or screaming as she usually does during football games. Her
throat was sore, and she knew exactly what that meant. Her doctor
diagnosed her with influenza.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it just started later this year. I got my family sick and
I got the people upstairs sick," she said, referring to her
co-workers at Eisner Pediatric and Family Medical Center south of
downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   She is in the unlucky minority this year.Despite delays in the
delivery of the influenza vaccines in 2000 and 2001, Southern
California has had a steady drop in the number of influenza cases
compared to past years.</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute the change to factors ranging from better access
to the flu shots to a decrease in travel and an improvement in the
way vaccines are created.</TE>
<TE>   There were 170 influenza cases reported in Los Angeles County
during the winter months of 2000-2001, said Dr. David Dassey, deputy
chief of the acute communicable disease control unit at the county
health department. Only 18 have been reported since the 2001-2002 flu
season began in November, a little more than 10% of the previous
season's number.</TE>
<TE>   "In a good flu season, we would have three to four hundred
[reported] cases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rate has been low nationwide too, although 13 states reported
widespread influenza outbreaks this month, according to U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics are only an indicator, not a precise measure, of
what is actually happening. It is too costly for each state to test
each patient who comes to the hospital with flu-like symptoms, and
some who become ill do not to seek medical attention at all.
Statistics are based on the reports from selected laboratories,
mortality cases and doctors who volunteer to send cultures from
patients who come in with respiratory problems and a fever of at
least 100 degrees, said Carl Stevens, an emergency medicine physician
at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens directs the hospital's fast-track flu program, which was
designed to expedite the treatment of influenza patients. It emerged
from the 1999-2000 epidemic when emergency rooms across the state
struggled to treat an overload of patients with respiratory problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We have used the same surveillance systems for the past five
years, and all of the indicators have been lower than we would expect
to see in the average season," said Robert Murray, epidemiologist
with the California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Influenza changes constantly, which makes the virus very difficult
to predict, experts said. When it replicates it is likely to mutate,
producing different strains. Whether new strains emerge can make the
difference between a low season and a severe epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on whether there is a novel virus present--and if it
is novel, if it has the qualities that would allow it to spread
quickly and cause serious illnesses or death," Dassey said.</TE>
<TE>   Dassey said most of the strains circulating now are the same as
the one present during recent seasons. Many people's immune systems
might already have defenses against those particular forms of the
virus.</TE>
<TE>   Those same strains were included in the vaccines delivered during
the fall, optimizing the level of immunization. The fact that fewer
people are traveling this year might have helped prevent the spread
of flu.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not mingling in the way they used to," Dassey said.
"Fewer people are getting on airplanes and transmitting their germs
to other people," he said, alluding to changes in travel linked to
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Irma Gonzalez, a pediatrician with Eisner Pediatric and Family
Medical Center, said the vaccine protects people from the flu virus
but cannot keep people from getting colds or other respiratory
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "The vaccine is against influenza, not colds," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we give them the vaccines, they still are going to
get colds. Unless you put them in a bubble," she said, adding that
the center immunizes only children with chronic respiratory problems.
In truth, health officials said, the flu remains highly
unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "If the season is going to blow up in a week, there is no way to
know," Dassey said. "Predicting influenza can be hazardous to an
epidemiologist's health," Murray said.</TE>

<HD>Remains Identified as Missing Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: Dental X-rays confirm that body is Danielle van Dam,
but the cause of death can't be determined. Parents thank volunteers
who aided search.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Solving part of a mystery that left much of San Diego emotionally
spent, authorities confirmed Thursday that the body found in a lonely
oak grove by volunteer searchers is that of Danielle van Dam, missing
since Feb.2.</LD>
<LD>   A forensic examiner matched X-rays of the jaw to the 7-year-old
girl's dental records, said San Diego Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst.</LD>
<LD>   Though an initial autopsy was completed Thursday, medical
examiners were unable to determine a cause of death, largely because
of decomposition, officials said. San Diego Police Chief David
Bejarano, who broke the news to Danielle's parent minutes before
Pfingst made the identification public, acknowledged that
investigators may never learn exactly how Danielle died.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a possibility ... because of the condition of the body,"
Bejarano said as he left the Van Dams' home in Sabre Springs, a
well-kept community of welcome mats, ski racks, bright stands of
bougainvillea and Spanish-tile roofs.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we would like to know the cause of death. But if we
don't have that, I believe we will still have a successful
prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst would not address whether the body was clothed or whether
there is evidence that Danielle was sexually assaulted. "This is a
sad day for a lot of people and I don't want to make it sadder," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   No weapon has been found.</TE>
<TE>   Police have arrested one of the Van Dams' neighbors, 50-year-old
David Alan Westerfield, and charged him with kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, who has pleaded not guilty, is also charged with
possession of child pornography and could face the death penalty if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said it will take at least two months for his office to
determine whether it would seek to have Westerfield executed.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they will begin the painstaking process of piecing
together a criminal case that could lurch toward trial for a year or
more and will be watched closely throughout.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday was also an ending of sorts, a temporary calm in what
has been an emotional storm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tragic, to say the least," Bejarano said. "But there is
a little bit of relief. Danielle is in good hands now."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's parents, Brenda and Damon van Dam, went to a borrowed
real estate building in Poway, near their home, to thank, one last
time, the volunteers who had searched for their daughter. Authorities
say the search for Danielle was the most extensive ever mounted in
San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "Brenda said that love conquers evil," said Father Joseph Acton of
St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, who has been attending to the family
since the body was discovered next to a winding, two-lane road
Wednesday afternoon. "This community has shown that."</TE>
<TE>   In local schools, children were told to take home letters
encouraging families to spend time together this week.</TE>
<TE>   On a Web site devoted to Danielle's disappearance, a flurry of
messages organizing everything from search parties to fund-raisers at
local restaurants came to an abrupt halt.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site was given a lavender hue, Danielle's favorite color.
Replacing information about how to contact police investigators and
rescue organizers was a photo of the girl, holding a flower, and
words from the Sarah McLachlan song "Angel": "You're in the arms of
the angel; may you find some comfort there."</TE>
<TE>   So many flowers were pouring in to the family that supporters
asked residents to stop sending them until they finish planning a
public memorial.</TE>
<TE>   They were having trouble finding a hall big enough for the crowd
expected at the service.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long three weeks for San Diego and it's been a long
three weeks for law enforcement," Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents, many of whom had never met the Van Dams, descended on
the family's five-bedroom, two-story home Thursday when word came
that Danielle was officially dead.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Plant, an Oceanside woman, brought her daughter Parris to
the house to draw pictures on a large sheet of paper placed outside
for children to leave messages.</TE>
<TE>   Like many parents, Plant was grappling with the right way to tell
her children about the events of the last four days--Monday's
conclusion by authorities that Danielle must be dead, Tuesday's
charge of murder and Wednesday's discovery of the body.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine this happening to me," Plant said. "It's hard to
explain to her about what happened, especially since she's only 4.
She has a lot of questions. She doesn't understand why Danielle is
gone. She doesn't understand how something bad could happen to a
little girl."</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam has said he put Danielle to bed Feb. 1 while Brenda
van Dam spent time with friends at a Poway bar.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield also was at the bar that evening; he has said he
danced with Brenda van Dam there. Brenda van Dam has said she merely
chatted with Westerfield, and only briefly.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Feb. 2, when her parents went to wake her,
Danielle was not in her bed.</TE>
<TE>   Police immediately focused on Westerfield, who lives alone, two
doors away from the Van Dams. Westerfield, authorities say, was the
only one of the Van Dams' neighbors who was not home the morning
Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   They believe he drove his motor home to a beach strand and then
into the desert over the next few days, and subsequently had the RV
steam-cleaned before they could inspect it.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators later found blood on one of Westerfield's jackets
and in the motor home.</TE>
<TE>   DNA tests, police say, confirmed that it was Danielle's blood, and
Pfingst said Thursday that Westerfield is the only suspect in the
case.</TE>

<HD>February Among Driest, Warmest</HD>
<DH>Weather: Only .29 of an inch of rain fell in L.A. last
month. Average temperature hovered around 60 degrees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>February normally is the wettest month of the year in Southern
California, but the February that just ended was one of the driest on
record. It also was one of the warmest.</LD>
<LD>   In downtown Los Angeles, it rained only one day last month--Feb.
17--and only .29 of an inch fell.</LD>
<LD>   That compares to a normal total for the month of 3.55 inches.</LD>
<TE>   In the record-setting February of 1998, 13.68 inches of rain fell
on the Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   The average temperature in Los Angeles last month was about 60
degrees, roughly 8 degrees warmer than normal, said Bill Hoffer, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   The average temperature for the month is computed by adding each
day's high and low readings, dividing by two and averaging the total.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 22, high temperatures set records for the date at 20
weather service stations in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee that the weather in the coming months will be
any closer to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McClung, another weather service meteorologist, said the
summer-like conditions in the dead of winter have been due largely to
persistent masses of cold polar air that have been parking over the
Great Basin area of Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "When that happens, we have a lot of Santa Ana events, offshore
winds that warm up by compression as they blow down mountain passes
and out to sea," McClung said. "Los Angeles stays warm."</TE>
<TE>   He said a ridge of high pressure extending west from the Great
Basin forms a shield that also keeps Los Angeles dry.</TE>
<TE>   "Storms ride along the northern edge of that ridge instead of
swinging down into Southern California," he said. "They got plenty of
snow in Utah for the Olympics, but nothing fell down here."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why this is happening, McClung said, "There's nothing you
can really hang your hat on.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an El Nino coming, but that shouldn't affect things until
next year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, we have short-term dry patterns and short-term wet
patterns here, and right now we have dry patterns and we can't seem
to shake them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month was not the driest February in Los Angeles--there have
been six Februaries since 1877 when no measurable rain fell. But the
precipitation total for the rainy "season"--which runs from July 1
through June 30--is 3.95 inches, considerably less than half the
normal total for the date of 10.65 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee that we'll make up for this with a lot of
rain this spring," McClung said. "March can be wet, but looking ahead
through March 8, we don't see anything coming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still possible to get back up to normal, but we're running
out of time."</TE>

<HD>Evicted Tenants in N. California Gain Time</HD>
<DH>Housing: Japanese real estate tycoon agrees to give 570
renters two months beyond state law's 30 days to relocate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER and ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japanese real estate tycoon Genshiro Kawamoto has agreed to give 570
renters he's booting from whole neighborhoods in Northern California
more time to relocate, but will still sell their houses to make
investments in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The tenants in Sacramento and Santa Rosa will get 90 days--triple
what's prescribed by law--before they're uprooted under an agreement
reached with Kawamoto, who last month created an international stir
with the evictions and has since been buffeted by legal and political
pressure.</LD>
<LD>   In a 30-minute interview Thursday, Kawamoto denied that he is
heartless and greedy or that he needs the cash to prop up failed
investments elsewhere, although at least one Japanese real estate
expert suggests his company "brand" may well be lagging.</LD>
<TE>   The real estate investor blamed California lawmakers for crafting
an eviction statute that gives tenants only 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I just followed the law," he said. "This one-month notification
period obviously doesn't make sense for people's lives. It's a
ridiculous law. The legislators are the ones at fault."</TE>
<TE>   That said, he stopped short of fully explaining why he was in such
a rush to sell.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the international multimillionaire has repeatedly
said that the sale of the houses, including another 80 in Hawaii, was
necessary to finance a potentially lucrative investment that comes
along only once in a generation.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said that investment opportunity is in New York, though
he didn't offer any details about how he planned to spend the
money--be it in real estate or the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, renters and tenant rights groups declared victory
after Kawamoto agreed to let them stay put into June. The agreement
came after a Superior Court judge this week set a March 20 hearing on
an injunction blocking the evictions.</TE>
<TE>   Housing officials say about a third of the residents in the half a
dozen neighborhoods owned by Kawamoto are interested in attempting to
purchase their homes, and the 90-day reprieve will help give them
time to raise money. It will also allow those who wish to move more
time to find property in the region's tight housing market, where the
vacancy rate hovers around 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very grateful," said Margret Hefley, 75, one of the tenants
who joined in the legal fight against Kawamoto.</TE>
<TE>   Private sector and nonprofit groups have rushed to help.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Sacramento-based Nehemiah Corp. of California
announced its intent to acquire as many as 40 houses from Kawamoto
and lease them back to the neediest tenants. The nonprofit
organization then will work with the tenants to purchase the homes or
to find another to rent or buy.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only about one in 10 residents have moved, in part because
rentals are so hard to come by, local housing officials say. When the
420 tenants in Sacramento were hit by the eviction notices Feb. 9,
only seven available rental houses were listed in the local
newspaper, said William C. Kennedy, managing attorney for Legal
Services of Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy and others said that while pressure has been eased on
Kawamoto's tenants, problems remain in a state dealing with both a
crowded rental market and ever-higher prices for new homes.</TE>
<TE>   Freshly emboldened activists plan to push anew for legislation
requiring that landlords state a valid reason for an eviction. State
Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) is pushing legislation that would
give tenants more time in mass evictions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Mr. Kawamoto has given the tenants' rights movement the
biggest boost we've seen in a decade," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Such critiques have stung Kawamoto, whose business has in the past
largely maintained a low profile in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't the greedy, arrogant person some have made him out to be,
Kawamoto said, but rather is patient, makes long-term investment
decisions, and has amassed a fortune from almost nothing by following
his instincts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there are some evil investors who would have kicked them
out already," he said. "If I filed a lawsuit, they'd have to leave
within two weeks. But I don't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he was somewhat surprised by the uproar his move
engendered.</TE>
<TE>   After his agents began handing out eviction notices in early
February, the media latched onto the story, and California
politicians jumped on board. Lawmakers ranging from Gov. Gray Davis
to U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer wrote letters to the
Japanese ambassador asking that pressure be put on Kawamoto to
relent.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians and journalists, he said, only confused the situation,
and he didn't understand why they had to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he was shocked because the United States is a nation
of laws, and he was simply following the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I would understand if this sort of response happened in a
developing country, but this is the U.S.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he has sent four teams to interview the residents
and explore whether they need the eviction deadline extended and
whether they are interested in buying the property.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto also disputed rumors that he needs to sell the property
quickly to prop up his real estate empire back in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Though real estate experts in Northern California have pegged
Kawamoto's property as worth perhaps $75 million, the Japanese
businessman estimated that his Sacramento-area holdings could fetch
about $215 million given the region's strong residential market.</TE>
<TE>   Details on the size of his privately held fortune or the extent of
his losses over Japan's past troubled decade of deflation and sinking
asset values aren't available.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not telling," he said, when asked what his net worth was. "If
I disclose it, people get jealous and think I'm arrogant."</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine, in a 2001 ranking of rich individuals, pegged his
assets at $770 million.</TE>
<TE>   Other real estate officials in Japan said his Marugen Co. has
taken a much lower profile in recent years compared with a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard much of them for awhile," said Tomonori Fujikawa,
president of Aplex Co., a commercial and residential agent. "I don't
think the brand is as strong as it was before."</TE>
<TE>   Takanobu Kojima, an author and real estate tycoon who has lost
most of his empire under a mountain of debt, said Kawamoto is an
outsider in Japan's tightly knit real estate world.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto built his empire by focusing on a few areas of Tokyo he
knew well, Kojima said, a break with others who expanded from
neighborhood to neighborhood as their fortunes ballooned during the
late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   While Kawamoto may plan to invest some of the Sacramento proceeds
in New York, Kojima said he expects some of it is needed in Japan,
where developers face an increasingly difficult environment.</TE>
<TE>   Land prices have fallen for 10 straight years, on average, and
there's no end in sight, Kojima said.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto was born in Kitakyushu City in 1932, the son of a kimono
shop owner.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, he audited classes for a year at prestigious
Keio University. He planned to register as a regular student for a
second year when his father called him back to Kyushu to run the
family business, which he built into a network of Western apparel
shops before selling it off in the late 1950s. Kawamoto then turned
his attention to real estate, first in his local area and then in
Tokyo after moving there in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   From a base in Tokyo's prestigious Ginza district, he expanded his
holdings into the nightclub area of Roppongi, the more upscale
Akasaka neighborhood and the Kabuki-cho entertainment district,
emerging in a 1989 Nikkei Venture magazine ranking as Japan's fifth
richest individual. By 1991 he was ranked third with $2.3 billion in
assets.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he owns 800 properties in Hawaii and California, has
submitted plans to build another 1,050 houses on Maui, and owns 3,500
properties in Tokyo and the Kyushu area where he grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto waxed eloquent when asked what made him successful. He
looked where others didn't see value, he said. "I'm the only Japanese
to make money in U.S. residential property," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he has no plans to stop wheeling and dealing,
despite being 70, unmarried, without an heir and in possession of
more money than he could reasonably spend. "I keep doing this to
maintain my health," he said. "It's fun. I like to buy and sell."</TE>

Ueno in the Tokyo bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Jorge Gonzaga and Sean Ramsey are running marathons to get ready to
run a marathon.</LD>
<LD>   By 4:30 a.m. one recent morning, 16-year-old Jorge was already
dressed. He washed down a handful of cookies with a glass of milk and
was standing in the driveway of his Highland Park home when Ramsey,
his Dorsey High School teacher, pulled up to drive him to practice.</LD>
<LD>   They greeted the dawn inside a 24-hour gym, where they pumped iron
and did push-ups and leg-strengthening exercises, more preparation
for Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the boy nor the teacher is likely to win the 26.2-mile
race. Like many others, they will try make their statement merely by
finishing. For Jorge, a novice runner who dropped more than 60 pounds
training, it would be another sign of maturity. For Ramsey, who is
completing his medical degree at UCLA in addition to teaching biology
at Dorsey, it would be vindication for a work schedule that on some
days has begun at 1 a.m. and ended at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "In my life, so many people have pushed me," said Jorge, a
10th-grader at Dorsey's Police Academy magnet school. "When I'm
running, I have to push myself. Nobody can do it for me."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Ramsey announced plans to take a team of Dorsey
students to run in the marathon. Fifty youngsters expressed interest.
A dozen will make it to the starting line.</TE>
<TE>   "So many students are afraid to run a 26-mile race," said the
Bahamian-born Ramsey, who has finished the marathon six times. "They
think it's impossible. Well, anything is possible with good
preparation and hard work."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey's dozen will be among 2,000 Los Angeles students competing
in the marathon through Students Run L.A., a program that encourages
young people to train for the marathon.</TE>
<TE>   "Student runners have changed eating habits, missed fewer days of
school and [graduate] at a higher rate," said Marsha Charney, the
group's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The program was started in the 1980s by a Boyle Heights
continuation high school teacher who believed the discipline of
running would help his students mature. Today's program encompasses
all middle schools and high schools, with corporate sponsors picking
up the tab for students' racing fees, uniforms and running shoes. But
the message is the same.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn how to keep going and keep going until you accomplish
what you started," said Sandy Morales, a Dorsey ninth-grader who at
first found it difficult to run a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jones, 16, said the challenge has strengthened his
determination and made it easier for him to communicate with his two
younger brothers. "They listen to me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey spotted Jorge's determination when he learned that the
student was taking two buses to Dorsey in southwest Los Angeles to
attend predawn marathon practice. Jorge's mother, Yolanda Gonzaga, a
single parent who had quadruple bypass surgery in 1999, would
accompany her only child on the 11/2-hour ride and walk to the track
and would stay until practice was over. Ramsey drove the students
home when practices ran late.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's dark and the streets are lonely, there are a lot of
crazy people out there," said Yolanda Gonzaga. She accompanied her
son to practices until December, when he turned 16 and asked her if
he could ride alone. She agreed, but that's about the time Ramsey
started picking him up in the mornings.</TE>
<TE>   The practice runs, which grew to 15-18 miles, were a refuge, Jorge
said. "It keeps you away from all the negative things out there," he
said. His weight dropped from 240 to 178. But the workouts also put a
strain on his day, which was already stretched because of tutoring
sessions. His grades suffered. He was sleepy in class and once dozed
off while reading Shakespeare. "I wanted to quit," he said. "But my
mother said I should always try to finish what I start. So I stayed."</TE>
<TE>   He soon adjusted to the long hours. His grades improved and so did
his behavior in the academy, where he was asked to help train the
younger cadets. He began to appreciate his decision to leave his
Highland Park neighborhood to attend a magnet that would prepare him
for a career as a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a big change," said Los Angeles Police Officer Kacey
Coleman, who coordinates the academy. "He was a goof-off last year,
and now he's a leader."</TE>
<TE>   Jorge, who never really knew his father, began to bond with his
teacher. "He's a good kid," Ramsey said. "I see him wanting to
constantly improve. He looks at what I do as an example and tries to
better it. If I push 50 pounds with the weights, then he wants to
push 50 pounds too."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey identifies with his young student and his closeness to his
mother. The teacher was forced to postpone his graduation from UCLA
Medical School for two years after the death of his mother. While
teaching at Dorsey, he managed to complete his required
schoolwork--including early morning rounds with physicians, before he
picked up Jorge for practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days ... I fall asleep between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. with the
news on television," he said. "I made the commitment that I would
give the students all my energy until June."</TE>
<TE>   The day after the marathon, Ramsey will learn which hospital
assignment he will draw to complete his residency.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of Sunday's race will complete the course in a little
over 2 hours. Jorge is shooting for 3 hours, 9 minutes. That would
match his coach's personal best.</TE>

<HD>Investigators Hone Their Skills at Homicide School</HD>
<DH>The 80-hour program teaches detectives about the latest in
crime scene technology--and how to correct mistakes made during the
handling and collection of evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scattered pile of chewed sunflower seeds did not look like much,
but in this case the mess meant a passing grade for a group of crime
scene investigators.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like trash," said Sgt. Rich Longshore of the sheriff's
homicide unit. "Most people would never believe it, but that small,
discarded shell can tell us a lot. It can find a murderer."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Longshore left the seeds on the floor himself, hoping
detectives would find the valuable DNA evidence during a murder
reenactment in La Mirada.</LD>
<TE>   "All evidence is important," Longshore said. "It can be a simple
strand of hair to a drop of blood to a shoe print. In this case, it
was a pile of chewed seeds."</TE>
<TE>   Shadowed by veteran homicide investigators, two dozen law
enforcement officers from California and Arizona recently
participated in the two-week Homicide and Death Investigation School
operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Los
Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The school, in its fifth year, hones the skills of young homicide
detectives by teaching the latest in crime scene technology and
investigative techniques. Its main purpose is to correct mistakes
made during the handling and collection of evidence, Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way you learn," he said. "You learn from the mistakes
of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence gathering is one of the most important parts of a
criminal investigation, and if not done properly can lead to a
defense victory during trial, Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD and sheriff's homicide investigators are required to take the
class, but other departments are welcome to participate, Longshore
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience level here is just incredible," said Sgt. Richard
Garcia of the sheriff's homicide unit. "You get to see how other
agencies work a homicide scene and you can share tips and get
feedback."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 80-hour program is in a classroom setting at a hotel
where investigators learn about forensic science, changes in the law
and the difference between good and bad evidence, Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   The last class met at the Residence Inn in La Mirada, where
prosecutors made guest appearances to tell detectives what might be
needed to convict a murder suspect, and a forensic specialist taught
the proper way to unearth skeletal remains so they can be examined
for clues.</TE>
<TE>   Although crime lab experts generally do most of the work with DNA
evidence, detectives are taught how to safely discover DNA samples in
blood, sweat or saliva, such as from the chewed sunflower seeds.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the lecture portion of the homicide school is just a
refresher from college and police academy training--but with an
emphasis on murder.</TE>
<TE>   Most look forward to the homicide reenactment, where students deal
with bloody mannequins, phony witnesses and pesky news reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Mock Crime Scenes Are Staged at Hotel</TE>
<TE>   During this session, five teams of investigators were sent to mock
crime scenes in and around the La Mirada hotel, where they gathered
evidence, interviewed witnesses, briefed the media and solved the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   All of the crime scenes were based on real-life cases, Longshore
said. The students were being closely monitored by veteran LAPD and
sheriff's homicide detectives, who pointed out every mistake or
missed piece of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Anything that looks suspicious at the crime scene is possible
evidence, Det. Todd Henderson of the sheriff's major crimes bureau
told his team as they investigated the mock death of a woman in her
hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think it's going to help your case, take it," a monitor
overseeing the scene advised him. "You can always put it back."</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I want," Henderson replied as he examined a phone
book for possible fingerprints, and two investigators checked the
kitchen, where it appeared there may have been a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Many students in the class are in their first year as homicide
investigators or are in the process of becoming homicide detectives,
Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   Two Arizona detectives enrolled to see how homicides are handled
in a larger city. Dets. Gary Fuller and Ivan Kaminsky, who work the
robbery-homicide detail for the Chandler Police Department, handle
about 10 to 12 homicides a year. By comparison, more than 1,000
homicides a year are investigated by Los Angeles County's two major
law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of similarities in technique, they just have higher
repetitions," Kaminsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Arizona investigators did quite well, classmates said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very bright," said Sgt. Mike Thatcher of the sheriff's
Century Station. "Their department is smaller than ours, but they
really know what they are doing out there."</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the class is provided by the state Commission on Peace
Officer Standards and Training, which was established in 1959 to set
minimum selection and training standards for California law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Janis Cavanaugh, a professor of administration of justice and
forensic science at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, said the program's
hands-on approach is helpful.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought that this was the best way to teach crime scene
investigations," said Cavanaugh, who has worked as a police officer
in El Monte and Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   Rio Hondo's certificate program requires 536 hours of training in
crime scene investigation, fingerprints, police photography,
investigative report writing, interrogations and courtroom testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Being successful in the field of crime scene investigations is
something that cannot be learned overnight, many investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know how to read people," Garcia said. "You cannot
rush to judgment and you have to really pay attention to the most
minute details."</TE>
<TE>   Homicide school is held four times a year. The next class is
scheduled in April.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a better environment to make a mistake than out in the
field at a real murder investigation," Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to make it tough, but if they look and listen, they
can solve these crimes."</TE>

<HD>Security Breach Closes Half of LAX</HD>
<DH>Airport: Thousands temporarily evacuated when unplugged
metal detector is discovered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM and JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The entire south side of Los Angeles International Airport was shut
down for several hours Thursday morning and at least 10,000
passengers were evacuated after security employees discovered that a
metal detector in Terminal No. 4 had been unplugged.</LD>
<LD>   The machine, known as a magnetometer, wasn't working for at least
an hour during the morning rush at the world's third-busiest airport,
allowing dozens of passengers to pass through it without being
screened, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The shutdown delayed about 400 arriving and departing flights from
6:30 to 10 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   The security breach--among the first to occur at a U.S. airport
since the federal government last month assumed screening contracts
traditionally held by the airlines--raised the question of whether
the airlines and the federal Transportation Security Administration
have devised protocols for employees who work at screening
checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately apparent who had unplugged the
magnetometer. Nor was it clear why screeners did not notice that the
machine, which routinely beeps when it senses a metal object, was not
functioning. Brian Jenkins, a senior advisor to the president of the
Rand Corp. and a former member of the White House Commission on
Aviation Security, said employees should have noticed.</TE>
<TE>   The shutdown decision, made by transportation security officials,
marked the first time in LAX's 40-year history that officials were
forced to close half the airport. Past incidents had usually been
limited to a portion of a single terminal.</TE>
<TE>   After an employee discovered the problem in the American Airlines
terminal around 6:10 a.m., airport police evacuated travelers from
five terminals on the airport's south side.</TE>
<TE>   These buildings are occupied by the facility's largest carriers,
including American, United, Delta and Continental.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers who were forced to disembark from planes parked at the
gates streamed outside to join other travelers on the crowded
horseshoe-shaped roadway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials emptied all terminals on the airport's south side
because they are connected by tunnels located past the security
checkpoints that allow connecting passengers to travel back and forth
between buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers were allowed to reenter terminals and required to pass
through security checkpoints again starting at 8:20 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The breach prompted officials to announce that they plan to shut
down the tunnels connecting Terminals No. 4 and 5 and Terminals No. 5
and 6 on the lower level--yet another post-Sept. 11 trade-off between
passenger convenience and security.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, should there be another breach of security in any one
terminal, we don't want the whole south complex affected," said Lydia
Kennard, executive director of the city agency that operates LAX.
"This was an unfortunate situation. We absolutely agree that the TSA
made the right call to evacuate all the terminals. We have to close
the gap now."</TE>
<TE>   The tunnels, constructed to help passengers catch connecting
flights, were built before the advent of passenger screening,
magnetometers or X-ray machines.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Transportation Security Administration assumed control,
American Airlines maintenance employees would have checked security
equipment, including magnetometers and X-ray machines, each morning
to make sure they were working properly, one source familiar with
operations said.</TE>
<TE>   But now it is unclear whose job that is, according to interviews
with several aviation-security sources.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an area where partnership is a prerequisite to security,"
Jenkins of the Rand Corp. said. "The screeners may be federal
employees, but the screening process is not exclusively a federal
responsibility but one shared by the industry, the local airport and
the federal government."</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines corporate headquarters declined comment on the
incident, transferring a reporter to a recording asking the media to
call the Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration officials said they've
asked Huntleigh USA Corp., the firm hired by American Airlines to
handle security in Terminal 4, to report back to federal security
officials on the incident. The federal agency said it wouldn't take
disciplinary action against the Huntleigh employees, who still
operate under a contract drawn up between the contractor and the
airline.</TE>
<TE>   The metal detector is prone to beep when it senses keys, coins and
cell phones every few minutes. Employees should have known it wasn't
working, Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "First, these things have green and red lights on them, and
second, they make noise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most passengers responded to the evacuation--one of numerous such
incidents at the nation's airports since the terrorist
attacks--calmly, if not altogether good-naturedly.</TE>
<TE>   "People seemed to kind of take it in stride, though I don't think
anybody was happy about it," passenger Ed Thomas said. Thomas had
been at the gate by 6 a.m. to board a flight to Washington, D.C., en
route to his home in Virginia when the evacuation announcement came
over the public address system.</TE>
<TE>   A Delta passenger was less accepting, and he insisted the airline
made matters worse by being "so disorganized."</TE>
<TE>   "They should be better prepared to handle this type of thing by
now," said Charles Tindle, who had just arrived on a Delta flight
from Las Vegas and was awaiting another to take him home to Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I'd rather be safe than sorry, but I can't believe they
couldn't handle this better," said Tindle, wearing a purple and black
aloha shirt and smoking a cigarette while other passengers sat on the
curb or snaked their way past one another's baggage in search of a
snack or restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Tindle said passengers on his Las Vegas flight were taken off the
plane when it arrived at LAX and made to walk through long tunnels
under the airport, only to be greeted at another terminal by a
security guard yelling, "Get them out of here! This is a secure
area--they'll contaminate it!"</TE>
<TE>   "How would you like to be treated like that?" he fumed.</TE>

<HD>It's Tough to Throw Compton's Bums Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's how bad it's gotten in Compton: I'm out in the middle of the
Civic Center plaza and a dirt-caked beggar who lives on the street is
griping about the bums in City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of crooks in there, stealing from their own
people," says Jesse Lopez, 36. "I see a lot. I read the paper. I'm
not stupid. They've got their hands in people's pockets left and
right. It's a shame, because this used to be a beautiful town."</LD>
<LD>   I suppose people say the same thing about Kabul. These days it's a
tossup as to which town--Compton or Kabul--has the more stable
leadership.</LD>
<TE>   It's been nearly 10 months since Compton's disputed mayoral
election last June, yet without a single chad to consider, we still
don't know who won.</TE>
<TE>   While flip-flopping judges snorkel through the cesspool, it's a
game of musical chairs in the mayor's office. One day the throne is
occupied by Omar Bradley, a machine-style boss who once called
himself the Gangster Mayor. The next day it's Eric Perrodin, who
packed a concealed handgun on election day, pocketed a campaign
contribution from Death Row Records, and is seen as a reformer.</TE>
<TE>   That is not as peculiar as it sounds, this being a town of
political operatives in bulletproof vests, ex-cons winning political
appointments, and squads of investigators swooping down on City Hall
with search warrants. I almost forgot to mention that everyone is a
PhD, the honorary degrees bestowed by a local school of acupuncture.</TE>
<TE>   So now you understand why a common beggar stands in the plaza with
his indignation and an air of moral superiority. Soon as Jesse Lopez
moves on to scrabble for quarters, I see a stream of Compton High
students headed for the plaza, and instantly my heart aches for this
kicked-around town and its kids.</TE>
<TE>   You've got the gangs in Compton. You've got the drugs and the
crime. But is there a more dangerous or corrupting influence on young
minds than to have to walk past nearby City Hall when school lets
out?</TE>
<TE>   "Compton's not all bad, we just get stereotyped," says sophomore
Chanel Williams, 15. Public officials don't help the cause, she adds,
carrying on this way. "A lot of those people are twisted."</TE>
<TE>   "They think if they do it fairly, they're never gonna get
anywhere," says Jaquata Lewis, who turned 15 on Thursday and now must
carry the burden of this cynicism into manhood.</TE>
<TE>   I wander through a bleak City Hall, where employees move like
zombies through another torturous day of uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   TV vans are camped outside, awaiting the next humiliation. Bradley
and his posse rode into town last month, and no one expects them to
leave quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin won the election by a slim margin, but got tossed out of
office three weeks ago by a harebrained Superior Court judge who
ruled that the placement of Perrodin's name on the ballot, above
Bradley's, was an unfair advantage for Perrodin.</TE>
<TE>   I was just as confused by that ruling as I was by the movie "A
Beautiful Mind." The film was about a schizophrenic Princeton
professor who won a Nobel prize for a mathematics/economic theory.
But I couldn't make heads or tails of the guy's "theory," and I felt
the same way about the judge's ruling. Maybe she saw the same movie
and lost her mind.</TE>
<TE>   Out front of City Hall, on the steps near the TV vans, I find a
woman who looks as though she wants to throw herself in front of

<TE>   She's been a city employee for decades, she says, and although
Bradley had ordered staff to keep their mouths shut, she can't help
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got greedy people in charge. Ignorant people," she says.
"The place is run like Haiti, or an African country."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if Perrodin is the solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know yet," the employee says, but she's looking forward
to Bradley's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's greed and ego with him, and he started getting out of the
realm of reality. You can't run a city for your own personal uses.
I've worked here a long time and this is the worst it's ever been.
You don't know what to expect when you go to work each day. You go to
a convention and you're embarrassed to put your name tag on because
it says Compton."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the state Supreme Court refused to hear Bradley's
latest challenge, so he cleared out of City Hall and Perrodin moved
back in as police kept watch. There was a commotion and a lot of
shouting, but no bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   If you know anything about Compton, though, you know this is not
the end of it. Schoolchildren and beggars in the street could tell
you that.</TE>

<HD>A. Lyman, 70; Vibraphonist Specialized in 'Exotic Music'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Lyman, a vibraphonist best known for his contributions to
so-called "exotic music" from Hawaii in the late 1950s and early
1960s, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Lyman died Sunday at a hospital in Honolulu after a long battle
with throat cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born on the island of Kauai, Lyman moved to Honolulu as a child.
He became interested in jazz from the mainland, particularly the
music of vibraphonist Lionel Hampton. As a teenager, he joined a
local jazz group and was soon a widely sought-after musician.</LD>
<TE>   By his early 20s, he was playing with mood music king Martin Denny
on Denny's well-received albums "Exotica," which contained the hit
single "Quiet Village," and "Exotica 2."</TE>
<TE>   "He played a very essential part in the formation of the exotic
sounds," Denny told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin this week.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman used the guitar, percussion and vibraphone to produce music
with a soft, ethereal quality. Lyman left Denny to form his own
quartet. He signed a contract with the Hi-Fi label in 1957 and within
a year released his debut album, "Taboo." The album ultimately made
it to No. 6 on the U.S. record charts. Because of its exotic quality,
the album was popular with consumers then exploring the new sounds of
stereo equipment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Lyman's single "Yellow Bird" reached No. 4 in the United
States. An album of the same name reached the top 10. Lyman's last
album on the charts was "I Wish You Love" in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman's band also appeared on the Warner Bros. television program
"Hawaiian Eye" in the early 1960s, and his music was frequently in
the soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   His music regained some popularity in the mid-1990s in mood-music
compilations.</TE>

<HD>Gordon Matthews, 65; Was 'the Father of Voice Mail'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He held some three dozen patents.</LD>
<LD>   But it was No. 04,371,752, issued on Feb. 1, 1983, that built his
reputation, made his fortune and inadvertently caused roughly half
the developed world to love him and the other half to hate
him--passionately.</LD>
<LD>   He called his invention "voice message exchange." We have come to
know it as everyday, super-convenient but often irritating "voice
mail."</LD>
<TE>   Gordon Matthews, who also invented systems to make computers talk
to each other, telephones find the cheapest long-distance lines and
alarms go off when duffers dawdle too long on the golf course, will
always be known as "the father of voice mail." Matthews died Saturday
in Dallas of complications of a stroke. He was 65.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews, who maintained a busy consulting and speaking schedule,
usually opening with an affable "half of you love me ...," had the
stroke in a Dallas hotel Feb. 20. He had lived in Austin since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot, 3-inch Oklahoman with a University of Tulsa degree in
physics and engineering liked fine wine, classical music,
motorcycles, the Dallas Cowboys and order.</TE>
<TE>   A former Marine fighter pilot, he bred prize-winning Doberman
pinschers, preferring the breed not only because of its status as
Marine mascot but because "they are a very efficient dog."</TE>
<TE>   But most important, Matthews had a lifelong penchant for devising
solutions to problems.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see something that irritates me, I invent something to fix
it," he told Forbes magazine in 1982. "Sometimes I think the universe
could be flawless if only I could design it."</TE>
<TE>   Once out of uniform, Matthews worked for IBM and then Texas
Instruments and loved the corporate world, telling the Fort Worth
Star Telegram last year, "I found the esprit de corps and the
discipline to be very similar to the Marines."</TE>
<TE>   But then he started a couple of his own companies--learning the
hard way that he was far better at research and development than
management.</TE>
<TE>   The first company he lost to a partner and the second had to be
sold in a flood of red ink, prompting a venture capitalist to say 20
years ago: "As an inventor, Gordon's reputation is unblemished. As a
businessman, it's the pits."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Matthews' most lucrative invention--voice mail--came
out of his labors for those ill-fated companies in 1974. While
calling on client Johns-Manville (now Manville Corp.) in Colorado, he
was having trouble reaching his Dallas home office.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he happened to notice great volumes of the
client's trash--all bundles of pink "while you were out" slips with
cryptic call so-and-so messages hand-written by secretaries.</TE>
<TE>   He started pondering, and when he got back to Dallas he told his
wife, Monika, "I've got this crazy idea."</TE>
<TE>   The idea soon materialized into his Voice Messaging System,
described by Forbes 20 years ago as "a computerized telephone message
storage and retrieval system with greater capacity than a tape
recorder and a novel ability to reroute and replicate messages."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike simple home answering machines containing miniature tape
recorders, which date to the 1920s, Matthews' system for companies
enabled users to exchange, send, receive, store, forward and erase
voice messages from any telephone.</TE>
<TE>   By 1979, he had created a small company, ECS Telecommunications
(later VMX Inc.) and filed the 49-page patent application. A year
later his first major customer, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Co., or 3M, bought the system and other corporations lined up.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there were problems and prejudices to overcome. Many
companies--and their customers--balked at dismissing pleasant-voiced
receptionists in favor of machines, and mass terminations of
no-longer-needed secretaries were controversial. The cost and size of
the hardware were other drawbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We were stretching the technology," Matthews recalled last year,
explaining that his first voice mail system for 3M required 64
telephone lines, 114 Intel 8086 microprocessors and four
refrigerator-sized 200-megabyte hard drives. It cost 3M $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   But within the first decade, from the early 1980s to early 1990s,
the size of the hardware had shrunk to that of a three-drawer filing
cabinet, the price had dropped commensurately and the systems'
dependability had risen.</TE>
<TE>   Until his death, Matthews himself believed that customers should
be able to speak to actual employees during a business day and that
his system was only an adjunct, facilitating communication among
mobile staff members and from customers after hours.</TE>
<TE>   He made it clear that he did not invent today's "automated
attendant," which presents the caller with a series of push-button
options for recorded information with no actual person at the end of
the line.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other consumers, Matthews loathed getting mired in the
popularly termed "voice-mail jail" of labyrinthine options leading
only to more and more tape recordings.</TE>
<TE>   "If I call someone and have to go through four or five steps to
reach a person, only to reach his message machine," he said last
year, "I won't do business with him. People hide behind it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet his invention certainly paved the way for the proliferation of
messaging systems. About 80% of large American companies use voice
mail, according to the TeleMessaging Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   After selling his voice mail company--for once at a tidy
profit--Matthews tried briefly to retire, devoting himself to golf
and dogs. But he was soon back on the consulting and speaking
circuit. And he kept right on inventing, filing his final patent
application for a still-secret idea only last week.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews is survived by his wife, and a daughter, Christina, both
of Austin.</TE>

<HD>Dog Attack Preventable, Defense Suggests</HD>
<DH>Trial: Lawyer cites failure of victim's partner to report
previous incident involving the animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY  and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defense lawyer stunned a Los Angeles courtroom audience Thursday by
suggesting that dog-mauling victim Diane Whipple's partner could have
prevented the fatal attack.</LD>
<LD>   Whipple, who died after being attacked by two large Presa Canario
dogs in January 2001, had previously been bitten by one of the dogs,
but neither she nor her partner reported the incident, according to
court testimony.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you ever consider that had you made a complaint, Diane
Whipple might be alive today?" defense lawyer Nedra Ruiz asked Sharon
Smith, who was Whipple's partner for seven years.</LD>
<TE>   Smith glowered at Ruiz and shook her head in silence. Several
members of the courtroom audience gasped.</TE>
<TE>   After a momentary pause, Judge James Warren quietly asked, "Do I
hear an objection?"</TE>
<TE>   One of the prosecutors immediately objected. It was sustained, and
Smith did not have to answer the question.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Smith said the question was painful.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked by her question and, frankly, deeply offended by
it," Smith said. "I had been questioned by her before, but I don't
think you can fully be prepared for something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said she gets her strength from her memory of Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about her every day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith played a role in last year's passage of legislation
expanding the rights for gay and lesbian domestic partnerships when
she testified before state legislators. The legislation gives
same-sex couples the benefits and protections of traditional
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, 33, a college lacrosse coach, was mauled by the two dogs,
each weighing more than 100 pounds, as she tried to enter her
sixth-floor San Francisco apartment on Jan. 26, 2001. One of the
dogs, Bane, tore into her neck, and the other, Hera, ripped at her
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz is defending one of the dog owners, Marjorie Knoller, 46, who
was present during the attack. She and her husband, Robert Noel, 60,
are charged with involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous
dog. Noel was not in the apartment building at the time of the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller also faces a second-degree murder charge and could receive
a prison sentence of 15 years to life. Noel faces a possible sentence
of four years.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the couple knew their dogs were dangerous,
and that Knoller didn't do anything to prevent Whipple's death.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers describe the attack as an unexpected, tragic
accident and say Knoller was herself bitten and bruised as she tried
desperately to save Whipple's life.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being tried in Los Angeles County Superior Court
because of publicity in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   During her testimony, Smith spoke softly, mostly in short, single
sentences. She was on the verge of tears when asked to tell about the
day Whipple died.</TE>
<TE>   Smith testified that she and Whipple planned to have dinner and go
to a movie that night.</TE>
<TE>   Smith spoke strongly about the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed Diane. It was their dogs and it was their careless
disregard for Diane's life that caused her death."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that she was not at home when the attack occurred, but
added that she was with Whipple at a hospital when she died. That
testimony prompted tears from several of her friends in the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Attys. James Hammer and Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom
called Smith to the stand primarily to explain Whipple's and Smith's
fear of the dogs, and to recount an incident in early December 2000
when Whipple encountered Noel and one of the animals as she was
leaving the building.</TE>
<TE>   "The dog lunged at her, and bit her in the hand," Smith said,
recalling Whipple's account of the incident. "She said, 'I told him,
you need to control your dog.' "</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 36, a regional vice president at Charles Schwab stock
brokerage, said the incident frightened Whipple so much that whenever
they encountered the dogs in the hallway, Whipple cowered in terror
against the wall or even pushed Smith between her and the animals.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Ruiz vigorously questioned Smith on why
she and Whipple did not complain to the building owners.</TE>
<TE>   "You took no action to remedy a situation where your life partner
lived in fear?" Ruiz asked.</TE>
<TE>   After Smith said they both decided to keep their distance from the
dog, Ruiz continued with the line of questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "You both decided not to make any complaint whatsoever about the
fact Diane Whipple had been bitten?" Ruiz asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not make a complaint," Smith said. "I now wish I had."</TE>
<TE>   It was at that point when Ruiz asked whether Smith realized that
Whipple might be alive had a complaint been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz also questioned Smith on whether she would profit from a
wrongful-death civil suit that Smith has filed against Knoller and
Noel. Smith said any money from the suit would go into a foundation
in Whipple's name.</TE>
<TE>   The question also cleared the way for Hammer to ask Smith why she
filed the suit, prompting Smith to comment:</TE>
<TE>   "They are responsible for taking Diane's life, and I want to make
sure they are held responsible."</TE>
<TE>   After the court proceedings Thursday, Hammer said Ruiz's
questioning seemed to imply that Smith was responsible for Whipple's
death.</TE>
<TE>   One of Smith's civil attorneys, Kate Kendell, called it "obscenely
disrespectful."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cardoza, another civil attorney for Smith, said, "It
crossed over the line....And it deeply scarred my client. But I think
it shows exactly what the defense in this case is about--don't take
responsibility yourself. Blame everybody but yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz could not be reached for comment outside court.</TE>
<TE>   Jury consultant Philip K. Anthony said Ruiz may have asked the
question to divert jurors' attention from Smith's testimony. That
strategy, however, probably has a 50% chance of succeeding without
offending the jury, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The testimony is so dramatic and so compelling that [the defense
attorneys] might as well try something shocking because they know
they can't do any worse than they are already doing," said Anthony,
chief executive officer of DecisionQuest, a national trial-consulting
firm.</TE>

<HD>Molestation Victim Faces MTA Driver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 23 years he had waited to confront his molester, and on Thursday
he did, tearily telling Anthony Zaragoza how the molestation had
nearly moved him to take his own life.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want you to know, Mr. Zaragoza, you took away something I
could never regain," the 34-year-old man said during a sentencing
hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court. "God forgive you for the
sickness you have. It caused me pain, filthiness, shame. I don't wish
this on anybody."</LD>
<LD>   There was no doubt about Zaragoza's sentence. In a plea agreement
with prosecutors, the MTA bus driver, 49, was sentenced Thursday to
nearly 30 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   The remarks by the man identified as John Doe 2 were not delivered
to sway the judge. They were for Zaragoza, a Quartz Hill resident who
hid his face behind his hands as the young man spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you, everyone involved in this case, for having closure in
my life," the man began.</TE>
<TE>   As an 11-year-old boy in April 1979, the man and his
then-13-year-old brother met Zaragoza as he drove a Montebello bus.
Several years of sexual assaults on the younger brother followed.
Zaragoza became friends with the brothers' family. He also molested
the older brother, who is now a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Then last year, Los Angeles police arrested Zaragoza for molesting
a 15-year-old North Carolina boy on a Metropolitan Transportation
Authority bus. The boy, a tourist, used his video camera to capture
audio of Zaragoza propositioning him.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza faced one of his accusers Thursday and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to say, I pray to my creator that he forgive me for
all I've done, I am truly sorry for all the hurt I have done," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig E. Veals sentenced Zaragoza
to 29 years. He will serve a minimum of 19.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty Monday to three charges involving the
15-year-old boy he met on the MTA bus last June, along with nine
counts involving the two brothers.</TE>

<HD>Goodbye Motel, Hello House</HD>
<DH>Poverty: Program moves 'skid row' families to permanent
dwellings by helping solve transit, child-care and credit problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marcos and Yvonne Morales were living with their five children--ages
4 months to 8 years--in a single motel room where a hot plate and an
ice chest were the sum total of their kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to a program run by Orange County Rescue Mission, the
couple have taken occupancy of a three-bedroom house in Buena Park.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday they will be among the first 50 families to graduate
from the program. The event will commemorate their move to permanent
housing from what one social service agency calls Orange County's
skid row.</LD>
<TE>   The rescue mission "asked us to work on ourselves," said Yvonne,
28. "And we did. If we knew then what we know now, we probably
wouldn't have" had to live in motels.</TE>
<TE>   The program, possibly unique in the country, brings social
services to motels where the working poor often end up because they
cannot come up with first and last months' rent and security deposits
for apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where our skid row is in Orange County," said Jim Palmer,
executive director of the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Stymied when it comes to building new shelters--communities balk
at having them--Orange County social service agencies are looking for
other ways to house the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   A county report counted 19,740 homeless people in 2001 but only
2,100 shelter beds. The program, Strong Beginnings, was developed
with $1.1 million in Proposition 10 funds and hopes to get private
money to continue after the current funding ends this year.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 10, passed by state voters in 1998, levied a
50-cents-per-pack tax on cigarettes to fund child development
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stoops, director of community organizing at the National
Coalition for the Homeless in Washington, D.C., said he is unaware of
any other program in the United States that brings social services to
motels.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not enough shelters in this country. Agencies have no
place to put people, and they end up in motels. But in motels, they
do not get better.... This is a model program that other communities
should emulate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Rescue Mission counselors meet with motel families
to help them find transportation and child care and establish credit.
Those issues often are barriers to permanent housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Moraleses say the program helped them make choices that
benefit the family, instead of picking what's best for the moment.
They are trying to budget, Yvonne is interviewing for jobs and they
might leave Orange County for a more affordable area.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, raised in Orange County, lived in four motels and even
their van for more than a year. Marcos Morales had lost his job; they
lived with Yvonne's mother but left because the quarters were so
cramped. In the motels, their children's grades suffered, and they
were cranky about constant moves.</TE>
<TE>   Social workers pushed the couple to get rental subsidies from the
Orange County Housing Authority and apply to county welfare for
additional aid. The mission paid part of the deposit and even got
cleaners to fix up the house that the couple rents.</TE>
<TE>   The program also helped Robin Peter, 40, get custody of her
daughter from foster care and establish credit.</TE>
<TE>   Peter, a recovering alcoholic, lived in motels for six months
after leaving a recovery house. She had no credit and no money.</TE>
<TE>   Peter now lives with her two children, 18 and 15, in an Anaheim
apartment. She works at an agency that helps parents regain custody
of their children.</TE>
<TE>   Although the participants are grateful, they say the rules of the
program are tough. The legwork to find apartments and car repair
estimates is challenging for someone who has never done it.</TE>
<TE>   Of the first 57 families participating, seven failed to "graduate"
because they could not meet expectations, such as attending mandatory
credit counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who make it could be back to the motels, said Karen
Roper, county homeless coordinator. Recidivism is high among working
families whose $8-an-hour wages fall far short of paying the county's
high rents.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, those who made it through Strong Beginnings feel as
though it put them on a new life course.</TE>
<TE>   Marcos Morales, 33, is thinking about how to improve his new
rental's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first house. I'm jazzed about it," Morales said. "I
don't want to lose it. I will do everything I can to keep it."</TE>

<HD>Eastside Rail Line Gets Green Light From MTA Board</HD>
<DH>Transit: A key environmental study is approved and will be
sent to the U.S. About 350 supporters and foes of the plan attend the
emotional session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a packed and sometimes confrontational meeting, the board of the
county's transit agency cleared the way Thursday for construction of
a light rail line that extends from downtown to the Eastside of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority blessed the
final environmental study for the long-delayed commuter line on an
11-0 vote.</LD>
<LD>   The plan will be sent to the Federal Transit Administration in
Washington, which will be asked to affirm its earlier promise to pay
for most of the $760-million project.</LD>
<TE>   State money is slated for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA board approved the rail plan on the same day it gave a
double endorsement to faster bus service throughout much of the
county.</TE>
<TE>   The agency approved a final environmental review for a
much-debated, 14-mile busway across the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   It also set in motion plans to roll out 23 new rapid bus lines,
adding to two extremely popular existing lines.</TE>
<TE>   But the most contentious issue of the day was the approval of the
environmental study for the Eastside rail line.</TE>
<TE>   The study provides a blueprint for the about 6-mile route, which
would run from Union Station through Little Tokyo and then east into
Boyle Heights, before terminating in unincorporated East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Boyle Heights, the line would travel underground for just over
a mile, keeping the light rail line off crowded, narrow streets.
Construction could begin in the summer of 2003 and be completed in
five years.</TE>
<TE>   By passing the plan, the board backed a line regarded as a pet
project of Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA board member Gloria
Molina, one of the Eastside's most powerful politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Molina spearheaded the light rail project after the MTA in 1998
scaled back an old promise to build a subway to the densely packed,
transit-dependent Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is going to be very satisfied with the project we
are putting in place," Molina said Thursday of the line, which will
connect with a 13-mile rail segment that is now being built from
downtown to Pasadena. "We originally wanted the subway, of course.
But after waiting so long, we finally" will have a rail line.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she expected the Eastside line to be the busiest in
the region and a boon to the area's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Loudly disagreeing with her at Thursday's meeting was a large,
vocal contingent. During the half-hour allotted by the MTA board for
public comment, many in the audience of about 350 people blasted
Molina and the rail line.</TE>
<TE>   They verbally sparred with the scores of others who support the
project and vowed to keep fighting, threatening to appeal to Congress
or file lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics said the commitment to spend hundreds of millions of
dollars on the rail line will make it impossible to fulfill a federal
court order to buy more buses to relieve overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   Others argued that construction would pollute the air and that the
underground portion would disturb grave sites at a landmark cemetery.
Yet others said they want the entire line to be underground.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the complaints focused on the placement of one of the
line's nine stations.</TE>
<TE>   The stop had long been proposed for a spot 20 yards from El
Mercado, a three-story shopping mall and an Eastside landmark.</TE>
<TE>   But planners moved the stop to ensure that firetrucks and other
vehicles would have better access. Some saw the move away from the
market as a slight.</TE>
<TE>   The plan inflicts "maximum damage to El Mercado," said Arturo
Chayra, a neighborhood activist who organized a petition drive
against the rail line. Some El Mercado supporters believe that the
rail route would make it harder for automobiles to reach the market's
parking lot, thereby harming the business. To them, the proposal is
just the latest by government that would take land from poor Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The revised plan moves the former El Mercado stop about two blocks
east. But that solution raises another set of problems by placing the
line on the campus of Ramona High School, a small facility that
serves 150 girls. Many of them are teenage mothers, who bring their
babies to campus each day.</TE>
<TE>   School Principal Sherry Breskin told board members Thursday that
she supports the light rail line.</TE>
<TE>   But she asked the MTA to move the school to a small parcel of land
in Boyle Heights that is now the site of an abandoned grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials remained noncommittal about their plans for the
school, other than to say that they will fund remodeling to make the
school habitable on its current lot or move it nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Countering the critics at the meeting was a seemingly equal number
of proponents.</TE>
<TE>   They sometimes shouted at the critics, some of them neighbors and
longtime friends.</TE>
<TE>   The proponents lavished praise on the plan, noting that there is
growing impatience in the community for a rail line--first discussed
on the Eastside two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Their viewpoint was summed up by Connie Gomez, a grandmother who
sat in the audience with a group of about 30 grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, for our grandchildren, for our businesses, for our
connection to the rest of Los Angeles, we want this line," Gomez
said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, we need this line, and we've waited long enough."</TE>

<HD>Planning Panel Votes Against Oakmont</HD>
<DH>Glendale: Commission urges council to oppose the hillside
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Glendale Planning Commission has recommended that the City
Council reject a long-debated plan to build 572 luxury homes in the
Verdugo Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The commission voted 5 to 0 against the development after a
marathon public hearing that stretched into the early morning hours
Thursday. The council will vote on the Oakmont View V project on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 600 homeowners and environmentalists packed the Glendale
Civic Auditorium on Wednesday night to urge the commission to vote
against the development. The city's Planning Division presented a
24-page report that found that the 238-acre project is "inconsistent
with the city's General Plan" and "poses a significant public safety
hazard."</LD>
<TE>   The meeting, interrupted at times by cheers or jeers, lasted
nearly eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't an easy decision to make," commissioner Bob Lemke said.
"But when we were all leaving at 2 a.m., we all said that we did the
right thing. I did what was in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   A similarly large crowd is expected for the council hearing. That
session will be held at City Hall, but with a television link to the
Civic Auditorium, where people can testify.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont developers blamed the commission's decision on political
pressure brought by homeowners and environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not surprised," said Lee Gregg, vice president of Gregg's
Artistic Homes, "but I am always hopeful that our elected officials
will carefully make an informed decision."</TE>
<TE>   Gregg said the commission lacked enough time to fully consider a
four-volume, 2,000-page environmental impact report on the
development.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Division cautioned that building homes on the steep,
rocky slopes could trigger landslides or rockslides. It also found
that the Oakmont proposal would pose "substantial environmental
danger" to the area's oak and sycamore trees, wetlands and wildlife,
including endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed federal legislation calls for a study of expanding the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the
Verdugos. It would allow the Oakmont land to be set aside for
recreation.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved $8 million toward the purchase of
the Oakmont tract. The developers, however, say the land was
appraised at $46 million more than a decade ago.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Chief Ronald Lowenberg, the city's top cop for nearly 13
years, will retire Oct. 18, officials said this week.</LD>
<LD>   Under Lowenberg's tenure, the Police Department set up several
substations and increased community-policing efforts in high-crime
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Lowenberg, 55, headed the Cypress Police Department before
becoming Huntington Beach's chief in 1989. He began his career in
Cypress in 1967. From 1977 to 1981, he served as a police lieutenant
and captain in Baldwin Park and Tustin, respectively. He returned to
Cypress as its chief in 1981.</LD>

<LD>The police log of the Rancho Santa Margarita News reported a
complaint from a resident who charged that "her neighbor on Esperanza
left a loud alarm clock on just to annoy her."</LD>
<LD>   How unthoughtful (though I'd love to find out the brand of that
alarm clock to see if it could wake up my 9-year-old on school days).</LD>
<LD>   A note from home: You may have noticed that this space was vacant
on Wednesday. I just wanted you to know that I was undergoing
computer training--not, as one friend guessed, serving as mayor of
Compton that day.</LD>
<TE>   Guide to Adventurous Dining: Today's specials (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A recipe for a tamale pie that Ken Tuxford of Redondo Beach
figures is unusually explosive (unless it was supposed to say black
"pepper").</TE>
<TE>   * A dish that Woody Langley of Sherman Oaks points out would give
new meaning to the phrase "club sandwich." Langley fondly recalled
the episode of the TV show "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" in which a
murderous wife conked her mate over the head "with a frozen leg of
lamb that she then cooked in the oven while police investigated the

<TE>   Prizes to die for: You can almost hear Monty Hall asking, "Do you

Casket No. 4?"</TE>
<TE>   That's the question that raffle-prize winners will be considering
Sunday at a charitable fund-raiser thrown by a mortuary to celebrate
the new season of the HBO series "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be about $800 worth of prizes in three of the caskets,

McKenzie Mortuary.</TE>
<TE>   The price of admission will be $20 at the Little Brown Chapel in
Long Beach. The raffle will be at 8 p.m., and the HBO show, a black
comedy about the mortuary biz, will air at 9.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie might have to display a fifth casket if he can persuade
one local disc jockey to lie inside. The person choosing that casket
would then win a date with the deejay.</TE>

Pitches</HD>

<LD>I'm in the zone.</LD>
<LD>   And I'm not coming out until I vote on Tuesday. You can knock on
my door and bombard my mailbox with fliers and brochures, but you
won't get through to me. The zone can't be penetrated.</LD>
<LD>   So if you're a political candidate or campaign manager who wants
to tell me that your opponent is a wife-beating, tax-cheating satanic
worshipper, save your breath or your postage.</LD>
<TE>   Had you informed me of that last month or a couple weeks ago or
even as late as yesterday, I would have been greatly interested.
There's a good chance I would have factored such things into my
decision.</TE>
<TE>   But now that I'm in the zone, forget it. All last-minute political
mailers, which historically have had all the integrity of an Enron
annual earnings report, will go directly to the trashcan.</TE>
<TE>   I enter the zone knowing full well that some of the stuff in the
final-weekend political barrage might be true. The problem is,
there's no way to find out for sure ... so into the trash it goes.</TE>
<TE>   Being in the zone works the other way too. It prevents me from
seeing or believing flattering things about a candidate. If you were
that appealing, you should have told me long ago, so I'd have had a
chance to check your references. You think I want to hire you for
public office without a background check?</TE>
<TE>   Here's what it means to be in the zone:</TE>
<TE>   Don't send me grainy, doctored photos of your opponent, making it
look as if he's just come off a 12-day bender or has the genetic code
of a werewolf. If you're sending a photo of yourself, try to make it
one that was shot within the past 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Don't call my house this weekend telling me that your opponent is
six months behind on child support or that your candidate has the
endorsement of every local police department, PTA and civic club--not
to mention the entire U.S. Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Don't send me a mailer with a resume that reads as if you ought to
be nominated for Time's Person of the Year, instead of running for a
city council seat. Even if you tell me how you single-handedly made
Operation Desert Storm a success or turned a failed company around in
six months, I won't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   Don't tell me that an incumbent Orange County judge, uncontested
on the ballot, has been accused of downloading kiddie porn ... uh,
scratch that. It happens to be true, but note that the story has been
reported at length in the weeks leading up to the election.</TE>
<TE>   Although I'll be safe in the zone, others will not. And Orange
County history tells us that some campaigns will pull out all the
stops in the final stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago in Santa Ana, opponents of a Latino mayoral candidate
sent out mailers depicting Latino children holding rifles. The
suggestion was that the children inevitably would grow up to be gang
members.</TE>
<TE>   On a lighter note, a local candidate some years back said she'd
been warned that the opposing campaign might dredge up some dirt by
talking to her high school sweetheart. Have at it, she said, noting
that she'd married her high school sweetheart.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign managers are hoping you don't go into the zone.
They'll argue that, with limited funds, they have to save their ad
blitz for the final days. It's just a coincidence, they'll say, that
voters will have no chance of assessing the truth of the
late-arriving campaign pitches.</TE>
<TE>   I admit that being in the zone means you'll run the risk of
missing some potentially juicy stuff. You might have to disregard
that a candidate for city council was a Taliban recruiter or that a
certain county initiative is secretly supported by a witch's coven,
but so be it.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this your civic duty.</TE>
<TE>   Be a good citizen. As of this morning, join me in the zone.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter W. Geiger, 74, a veteran financial advisor to the entertainment
industry who had a four-decade career with Bank of America, died
Sunday in Los Angeles of complications after heart surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Geiger was hired by Bank of America in 1951, when its
entertainment lending division was in trouble. Television had begun
to keep moviegoers at home, and the bank had foreclosed on 30 films.
He helped salvage several loans with the idea of selling the films to
television, packaged as "The Million Dollar Movie of the Week."</LD>
<LD>   He went on to serve as senior account officer to every major
Hollywood studio over the years, including Warner Bros., Disney,
Paramount, Columbia, MGM, and 20th Century Fox.</LD>
<TE>   After retiring from Bank of America, he launched his own
consulting firm, the Geiger Group, in 1990. It provided financing and
marketing advice to theater chains and entertainment companies.</TE>

<HD>Thomas McEvilly, 67; Seismologist Scrutinized Microquakes
on Fault</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas V. McEvilly, a seismologist known for long-term monitoring of
the San Andreas fault, died Feb. 22 of cancer in St. Louis. He was
67.</LD>
<LD>   The UC Berkeley emeritus professor of earth and planetary science
conducted a 15-year project with the U.S. Geological Survey to
monitor the movement of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   As a principal investigator, McEvilly hoped to detect changes in
the fault that could be used to predict large quakes. He helped
install state-of-the-art borehole sensors and recording devices that
allowed sensitive detection of microquakes, which seem to occur every
one to two years at Parkfield.</LD>
<TE>   Along with a Berkeley colleague, he reported in 1999 that the
pattern of microquakes could be used to predict the rate at which the
fault is slipping deep underground and posing less risk of producing
a major earthquake.</TE>

<DH>Environment: Group that includes growers and educators
unveils guidelines intended to protect schoolchildren from
pesticides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In March 2000, spectators at a Rio Mesa High School track meet in
Oxnard were appalled to see toxic fungicides being sprayed over
neighboring strawberry fields as young runners struggled for their
personal best.</LD>
<LD>   Eight months later, parents dropping off their children at Mound
Elementary School in Ventura were horrified by a fog of pesticide
drifting over from an adjacent lemon grove. The incident sickened
dozens of students and triggered prosecution of the grove's owner.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, an unusual coalition of growers, environmental
activists and educators unveiled a set of guidelines aimed at
averting such incidents. The risk is constant, the Ag Futures
Alliance said. Twenty-nine county schools, the alliance said, are
within 300 feet of farms, and restrictive new laws make it tough for
farmers to sell their land to developers.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference attended by two county supervisors and
representatives of several school districts, members of the alliance
praised their two-year search for consensus among competing factions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a reason for Ventura County agriculture not only to have
unqualified support from the community but to deserve it," said Doug
Adrianson, an alliance member and a former Times editor.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Haffner,  an anti-pesticide activist whose children attended
Mound, was less effusive.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to see people so willing to come to the table and talk,
but I don't want anyone to think everything is hunky-dory," she said.
"Now we have guidelines with respect to when pesticide applications
can take place, but I don't think the committee will recommend
reducing pesticide use. It's heavily packed in favor of the
industry."</TE>
<TE>   The group, which includes an organic farmer and a representative
of the Environmental Defense Center, has called for such common-sense
measures as principals updating growers on students' schedules and
growers spraying only when schools are not in session. On Thursday,
the group distributed recommendations that are being distributed to
growers and schools.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations urge school officials to meet with nearby
farmers, learn which pesticides are planned for use in the coming
year and establish emergency plans for accidental exposure.
Meanwhile, growers are urged to consider using less toxic substances
in the areas nearest schools and give school officials written notice
of pesticide use at least two days in advance.</TE>
<TE>   County Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail said such procedures
have been the norm for a number of growers, but that the alliance's
work has formalized them.</TE>
<TE>   McPhail said agreement from diverse interests on such significant
recommendations is unprecedented in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In a report, the alliance also recommended that the county provide
more money for response to pesticide emergencies and look into buying
"pesticide use rights" from farmers in sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance did not address construction of new schools on or
near farmland--an issue so contentious that it sparked a three-year
battle in Oxnard, where the elementary school district ultimately
withdrew its plans.</TE>

<HD>Some Forced to Mail In Their Votes</HD>
<DH>Election: Redistricting has eliminated hundreds of polling
places, and affected voters must use absentee ballots. Other hurdles
abound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good thing Bernice Kaufman didn't mistake the election literature she
received the other day for campaign junk mail to be tossed out.</LD>
<LD>   The mailer was one of the 11,626 mandatory absentee ballots sent
to unsuspecting Los Angeles County voters who will have no polling
place to visit next week, thanks to statewide legislative
redistricting.</LD>
<LD>   Direct voting has been eliminated at Kaufman's Wilshire District
precinct and in hundreds of other neighborhoods across Los Angeles.
Those left without a polling place must use an absentee ballot.</LD>
<TE>   The new political boundaries are not the only hurdle that election
officials are facing as Tuesday's voting draws close:</TE>
<TE>   * A new system that allowed voters to register up to 15 days
before the election instead of the previous 29-day deadline has sent
election employees scurrying to update registration lists and
complete distribution of election supplies to the county's 4,845
voting locations.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of producing sample ballots has soared as officials
juggled printing press runs to accommodate not only the new political
districts but extra candidate statements now allowed under new state
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   * The scheduling of a gubernatorial election in March rather than
June has caused some schools to refuse use of auditoriums as polling
places. That has forced election planners to scramble to find
alternate voting sites.</TE>
<TE>   About 20% of the county's 4.1 million voters will use voting
booths in an unfamiliar place next week, said Conny B. McCormack, the
county's registrar-recorder/county clerk. "It's a big problem. People
who have been going to the same place to vote for years have to go
somewhere else. People are kind of upset."</TE>
<TE>   The redistricting is responsible for an explosion of sample ballot
configurations, McCormack said. The pamphlet jumped from about 180
versions at the last election to 398 this time.</TE>
<TE>   Enactment of Proposition 34, which voters approved in November
2000, also helped expand the size of the sample ballot by allowing
candidates for state legislative seats to include statements if they
agree to specified voluntary campaign expenditure limits. In the
past, only statements for candidates for nonpartisan offices were
included.</TE>
<TE>   The county spent about $3 million printing this election's sample
ballot. The most ever spent before was $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Orange and Ventura counties say redistricting has had
less of an impact on voters there. "The 15-day deadline was a
horrendous problem, but we're in good shape," said Rosalyn Lever,
Orange County's registrar of voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Every problem we have is magnified 10 times in L.A. County," said
Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of voters for Ventura County. But
in Los Angeles, "the new lines go everywhere," dividing
neighborhoods, often down the middle of a residential street,
McCormack said. Because voting precinct boundary lines cannot cross
legislative and special district boundaries, dozens of "pockets" of
voters are isolated from neighboring precincts.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows local election officials to designate precincts
with 250 or fewer voters for absentee voting. That's how Kaufman's
two-square-block neighborhood in the Carthay Circle area became a
mail-in precinct.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack urged voters to carefully examine mail sent by her
office for new polling place addresses--or for mandatory absentee
ballots. Absentee ballots must be in election workers' hands by 8
p.m. Tuesday to be counted. If not mailed, they can be delivered to
any polling place on election day.</TE>
<TE>   As for Kaufman, she had finished poking the chads off her ballot
and had mailed it in Thursday. She said she was not looking forward
to staying home on election day. "I was a fifth-grade teacher for 18
years over at Carthay Center Elementary School, where we vote. I
looked forward to seeing old friends and parents there on election
day. I'm going to miss that."</TE>

<HD>Protest in Favor of LAPD Chief to Target Key Official</HD>
<DH>Policy: The Police Commission president denounces a plan to
demonstrate at his mall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Los Angeles Police Commission continues to weigh the fate of
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, commission President Rick Caruso on
Thursday angrily denounced efforts by Parks supporters to hold a
protest at the site of a new shopping mall he is building.</LD>
<LD>   "What ... are they trying to accomplish other than extortion?"
Caruso asked. He said the protest planned by African American
supporters of the chief at the site of the Grove--a complex of more
than half a million square feet about to open next to Farmers Market
in the Fairfax district--is a threat to his financial interests and a
misguided effort to influence his vote.</LD>
<LD>   One Parks advocate involved in planning the protest defended the
efforts and said he suspects that Caruso has already made up his mind
to back Mayor James K. Hahn, who opposes a second term for Parks.
Caruso, who was appointed by Hahn, has said he has not yet decided
whether Parks should be reappointed.</LD>
<TE>   "When you get in the midst of battle, you've got to go all the
way," said the Rev. Frederick Murph of Brookins Community AME Church,
who is organizing the March 9 rally with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles). Waters did not return phone calls Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   At a contentious commission meeting Tuesday, Murph and others
passed out fliers announcing the planned rally and, as the news
spread, several observers, including Parks, took Caruso's side.
"Caruso is doing a service to the community, and he does not deserve
that," said Lt. Horace Frank, spokesman for the chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I am kind of amazed," Commissioner David Cunningham said. "I
think it is unfair.... Rick has been more than available to talk to
people.... At the end of the day, he is a very fair person."</TE>
<TE>   The Grove, now under construction, is the biggest project of
Caruso's development career and the latest of his malls in the Los
Angeles area. A developer, Caruso, like the other members of the
commission, serves in the post part time as a volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   He spends much of his time outside the commission at the
construction site. The mall is scheduled to open March 15.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will not resign from the commission because of the
planned protest. But, "you know, I don't think this works to motivate
anyone to get involved in public service," he added. "That's why a
lot of people don't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and the four other members of the civilian commission have
been feeling intense political heat in recent weeks, since Hahn
announced that he does not favor a second term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is the city's second African American chief and a local to
boot. He is popular among many of the same African American voters
who supported Hahn for mayor, but strongly disliked by many leaders
of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing
officers, for reforms he has made in LAPD discipline.</TE>
<TE>   On a different front, Parks also faces criticism from some
civilian reform advocates who have clashed with him over the years on
particular reform proposals, controversial decisions on use of force,
or access to information.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Los Angeles City Charter, the commission holds the power
to reappoint the chief to a second five-year term, subject to a City
Council override. In declaring his opposition, Hahn has said he is
only expressing his opinion and that the commission is empowered to
act independently.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is in the midst of an eight-step process to
evaluate the chief's performance on such criteria as management and
community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners have said repeatedly that they will not be swayed by
political considerations. Instead, they say they will vote based on
their evaluation of Parks' merits as chief.</TE>
<TE>   Parks supporters said they are divided on the wisdom of the
planned protest. Early Thursday afternoon, Danny Bakewell, president
of the Brotherhood Crusade, said some supporters had been discussing
the plan and that they had not reach a consensus on whether to go
forward. Bakewell called back a short while later to report that
Parks had called him and asked him not to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked me pointedly not to be involved and to encourage others
not to be involved," Bakewell said.</TE>
<TE>   He quoted the chief as saying, "Look, I want to be evaluated on
the merits of my performance, nothing more and nothing less."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Inspector General Jeffrey C. Eglash, who works for
the Police Commission, said he had heard rumors that police resources
had been misused to help protesters who support the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the rumors, Parks strongly denied that any police
resources had been used, saying, "The LAPD has no role in the
community's activities." Frank, his spokesman, said Parks' staff has
strict instructions not to become involved in the political activity
swirling around the department, and called the allegations
"ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Eglash, however, said he planned to discuss the rumors with the
commission during its session Tuesday and ask commissioners whether a
formal investigation is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Bakewell, meanwhile, said the protest idea remains "on the table"
despite Parks' efforts to dissuade him. But he added, "if I didn't
say this before, I am not desirous of confronting Mr. Caruso in his
personal life." A protest would be warranted only if evidence
surfaced that Caruso had attempted to mislead community activists, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Murph said he continues to plan the protest, which he expects
to draw 750 people. The idea is to bring continued attention to "the
issue at hand, which is fairness."</TE>
<TE>   Murph also said he had received a phone call from Parks. He said
the chief conveyed Caruso's dismay about the planned protest. But he
said he remains skeptical of Caruso's professed neutrality. Murph
said activists are also considering holding a protest during the
grand opening of the Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso is being targeted, Murph added, because he "has been
extremely smug and arrogant."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said Thursday that he has made a point of contacting
concerned African American leaders and listening to their views. Told
of the comments of Bakewell and Murph, Caruso said he would call them
too.</TE>
<TE>   He said the protest could harm him financially by tainting the
Grove and discouraging people from shopping there. "If they are doing
this to impact my business, I think it is a crime," he said. "They
are going to the very core of this decision. It is about making
judgments on the merits, not influence."</TE>

<LD>City Council members have moved closer to adopting a so-called
"living wage" ordinance.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the council directed the city staff at a meeting
Tuesday night to draw up a proposal guaranteeing $9 per hour plus
health benefits, or $11.25 without, to city employees and employees
of city contractors.</LD>
<LD>   No deadline has been set to vote on such a plan, but at least two
council members reportedly want to vote on it before July.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A metal recycler must halt all discharges of a soupy waste that has
over 30 years created a 40-foot slag heap on its beachfront property.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board on Thursday
gave Halaco Engineering Inc. nine months to convert to a system that
would remove water from the slurry generated by its smelting plant.</LD>
<LD>   The switch would produce cleaner waste water along with solid
material that could be sold rather than piled onto the slag heap,
which has been blamed for 20 years of contamination of nearby
wetlands, ground water and the ocean.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county district attorney's office has appealed the dismissal of a
grand jury indictment against murder suspect Michael Shultz, saying
the decision was beyond the scope of the judge.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa ruled this
month that women were underrepresented on the Ventura County Grand
Jury and dismissed the indictment of Schultz. The grand jury had
indicted Schultz, 32, in 2000 on charges of raping and murdering a
Port Hueneme woman in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   In the motion to the 2nd District Court of Appeal, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Michael Schwartz said the number of women on the grand jury was
"fair and reasonable."</LD>
<TE>   He said Ochoa's decision means that other indictments from the
grand jury could be appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on March 26.</TE>

<LD>Water from 2,000 feet underground is now being filtered to remove its
iced-tea color, then sent to customers of Irvine Ranch Water
District, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The water from the deepest part of the vast aquifer beneath Orange
County was tinted by redwood trees and other vegetation that grew in
the area millions of years ago. The water is of high purity, but the
color had made it unpalatable, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A project to filter the water cost $16 million and took two years
to dig two wells and build a treatment facility in Santa Ana.</LD>

<HD>School Violence on the Increase Across the State</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Physical assaults on public school campuses--mainly schoolyard
brawls--rose 16% last year throughout California in a double-digit
pattern that was generally followed in Los Angeles, Orange and
Ventura counties, according to a report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The California Safe Schools Assessment, conducted by the state
Department of Education, also found that drug and alcohol offenses
increased statewide by 7%, with drug sales increasing by 32% during
the 2000-2001 school year from the previous year. Also, property
crimes rose by 1%, with a 10% increase in graffiti and an 8% increase
in vandalism.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest increases were in crimes against people, including
battery, assault and sexual offenses. Battery, described as physical
altercations without weapons, was by far the most commonly reported
incident in that category, increasing by 18%.</LD>
<TE>   "The crimes against persons category continues to rise," said
state Schools Supt. Delaine Eastin in a prepared statement. "The
highest rate by far occurs during the middle school years when peer
pressure, bullying and other social conflicts can result in the
disengagement of our students."</TE>
<TE>   The crime rates were based on reports from 1,043 school districts
and county offices serving more than 6 million students from
kindergarten through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   Across Los Angeles County, battery crimes increased for the fourth
consecutive year, with a 15.5% jump in 2000-2001. The 720,000-student
Los Angeles Unified School District, which has the largest enrollment
in the state, experienced an 11.6% increase in battery.</TE>
<TE>   "We find a lot of youngsters who, when they are not successful in
school, are releasing that anger in other ways," said Willie
Crittendon, director of safety for Los Angeles Unified. He added
that, similar to statewide trends, most battery crimes in Los Angeles
Unified occurred in middle school and high school.</TE>
<TE>   However, he noted that Los Angeles Unified has reduced its rate of
drug and alcohol offenses by 25% and property crimes by 2.2%, a
record that is counter to statewide increases. "I think we can do
better," he said. "But it shows we are making progress."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Hardenburg, a consultant in the safe schools and violence
prevention office for the California Department of Education, said
the statewide rise in many crime statistics may be partly due to more
careful crime reporting by schools and districts because more
resources have been put into crime detection and prevention.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, battery increased by 17.1%, from 268 in
1999-2000 to 314 last year. That includes the Oxnard Elementary
District, where battery arrests went up from 25 in 1999-2000 to 36
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately it's indicative of what's going on in society in
general," Oxnard Supt. Richard Duarte said. "Children are exposed at
a much earlier age to incidents of violence and settling problems
physically. That shows in these numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Drug- and alcohol-related crimes also jumped significantly in
Ventura, by 13.5%, and in Orange County by 8.6%, exceeding the
statewide increase of 7%. In Los Angeles County, drug and alcohol
offenses rose by 0.07%.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, crimes against people rose by 37% mostly due to
an increase in cases of battery, with 985 reported in 2000-2001
compared with 719 the previous year.</TE>

<HD>Timeout in Chino's Water Suit</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials in Chino are blaming that sinking feeling on their
neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past decade, the ground in some areas of the city has
dropped by as much as 21/2 feet, damaging several buildings and
forcing the relocation of at least one family.</LD>
<LD>   Chino has said that Chino Hills is responsible for the subsidence
because the neighboring city has refused to stop pumping water from
several deep wells that it operates in Chino.</LD>
<TE>   Officials in Chino Hills counter that recent studies by water
experts have cast doubt on whether pumping from the deep wells has
caused the subsidence.</TE>
<TE>   The issue became so contentious that Chino took it to court in
January. Since then, other public agencies, including the Chino Basin
watermaster, have weighed in.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the watermaster, the agency responsible for
preserving and managing area ground water, asked Judge J. Michael
Gunn to postpone any decision and give the feuding parties time to
work out a solution.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the judge agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not prepared to decide at this point," he told a gallery
crowded with public officials. "You guys are going to have to,
through consensus building, work this out," Gunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Watermaster chief executive John Rossi said his agency has been
aware of subsidence for years and is developing a plan to measure the
phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get this equipment in the ground so we have an idea of
what's going on," he said. "We don't know enough yet. We just don't
have enough data."</TE>

<HD>Elections Overseer Is Called Unsuited</HD>
<DH>South Gate: Secretary of state orders switch to clerk or
county. Jones is politicking, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying South Gate's elections process reeks of cronyism and
manipulation, Secretary of State Bill Jones ordered the city to hand
over electoral duties to either the county or the city's elected
clerk.</LD>
<LD>   The "grave" situation facing South Gate voters ranks as the worst
in the state, Jones told a boisterous throng Thursday in front of
City Hall. Officials, he said, have defied his orders to restore
integrity to the process.</LD>
<LD>   Jones was especially critical of a decision earlier this year that
stripped the city clerk of her electoral duties in favor of a
consultant who Jones said was beholden to the council majority.</LD>
<TE>   "This isn't independence," Jones said to wild applause at the
afternoon news conference. "It appears to be cronyism, plain and
simple."</TE>
<TE>   When the consultant, Julia Sylva, took the microphone, angry
residents shouted her down, calling her a "liar" and urging her to
"quit today." Her speech was cut off in mid-sentence when someone
pulled the plug on the public address system.</TE>
<TE>   Sylva later denied she was a biased elections officer, saying
Jones was misinformed. "I definitely am impartial," she said. "I'm
there to hopefully set a tone of stability and neutrality."</TE>
<TE>   The city is awash in recall efforts against nearly every elected
official. Furthest along is a drive that targets Treasurer Albert
Robles and his council majority allies: Mayor Raul Moriel, Vice Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba and Councilwoman Maria Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   The fear among recall organizers, who have gathered more than
8,000 signatures, is that Sylva will block the recall process if
state officials do not intercede.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Jones ordered state monitoring after receiving reports
from City Clerk Carmen Avalos, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley and state legislators about alleged voter intimidation, fraud
and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said his "patience is at an end," because city officials
have tried to manipulate the election process further under the
pretense of making reforms.</TE>
<TE>   He singled out Sylva for criticism, saying her links with two
Robles allies, Angel Gonzalez and Katrina Jackson, give the
appearance of bias.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who is Robles' printer of campaign materials, and
Jackson, a former council candidate, have been charged by the
district attorney's office with distributing illegal hit-piece
mailers during last year's election, a felony.</TE>
<TE>   Sylva, in a transcript of an interview with prosecutors,
identified herself as an attorney for Gonzalez. She also was present
at an interview with Jackson, whom prosecutors say she also
represented.</TE>
<TE>   Sylva has denied she represented Gonzalez or Jackson, saying she
was present at the interviews but only as a friend.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones said he considers her ties "corrosive" to the people's
confidence in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "The election official hired by, linked to, beholden to the
current City Council majority and the city treasurer appears to have
an undeniable, unmistakable and impermissible conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba, the vice mayor, dismissed Jones' visit as a cynical
attempt to get publicity in his run for governor. But she said she
would vote to have the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office
handle the electoral process.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba says the city clerk, Avalos, is biased and has used her
computer for political purposes. Avalos denies the charges, saying
Ruvalcaba resents her because she defeated her sister in last year's
election.</TE>
<TE>   After Avalos became the target of a recall, the council majority
stripped her of her electoral duties, saying she was biased. But
Jones said the city had no valid reason to take away Avalos' election
duties.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of stripping this elected official of her election
responsibilities is plain," he said. "The City Council majority wants
a stacked deck in their favor."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Lauds Soundproofing Effort</HD>
<DH>Policy: City is installing noise-reduction insulation in
homes near Van Nuys Airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in the home of a happy and well-rested North Hills resident,
Mayor James K. Hahn announced Thursday the completion of the first
phase of the Van Nuys Airport residential soundproofing program.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which began in August, provides insulation,
dual-paned windows and heavy wood doors to homes beneath the jet
flight path of the airport, which is the busiest general aviation
facility in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Up to 1,050 homes and apartments qualify for the soundproofing
improvements.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased with this effort to help release the burden
homeowners shoulder when they reside in such close proximity to an
aviation facility," Hahn said. "We must continue to work hard to
mitigate negative impact on our families."</TE>
<TE>   Nine homes and 24 apartments have been soundproofed, including the
North Hills home of Joyce Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   "This has immensely cut down the noise, I'd say, by half in our
house," said Hartman, who has lived under the flight path for 38
years. "It's wonderful. I'm sleeping much better now."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to cutting down on the noise, Hartman said, the
improvements have also cut her heating bill in half.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone who qualifies for the soundproofing is aware of the
plan, said Hilda Delgado of the mayor's office. Those qualifying must
live along flight paths near the airport and have at least a
65-decibel sound level in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not registering for this program," Delgado said as a
jet roared overhead. "The money is there, and there is no cost to the
residents."</TE>
<TE>   For more information, residents can call the Van Nuys residential
soundproofing office at (818) 909-3573.</TE>

<HD>Candidates See Education Post as Pulpit for Reform</HD>
<DH>Politics: State schools superintendent oversees programs
but lacks key powers. Union ties, vouchers are issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The job has an impressive title--state superintendent of public
instruction--but little real power to shape California's educational
landscape.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to setting policy and doling out money, the state
schools chief takes a back seat to the Legislature, the governor, the
Cabinet-level education secretary and the State Board of Education.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, four candidates are vying for the nonpartisan post that
they believe offers the perfect bully pulpit from which to weigh in
on school reforms.</LD>
<TE>   The contest feature two legislators forced out of their jobs by
term limits, an Anaheim school board president and a Los Angeles
political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), is viewed by many
as the candidate to beat. The senator, whose legislation led to the
popular class size reduction program in the primary grades, enjoys
huge financial backing from the state's major teachers unions.</TE>
<TE>   A Field poll released Thursday showed O'Connell leading the other
candidates, with 18%, although nearly two-thirds of voters were still
undecided. Katherine Smith, president of the Anaheim Union High
School District's board, ran second in the poll with 12%, and
Assemblywoman Lynne Leach (R-Walnut Creek,) was third with 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Taylor, a Los Angeles political consultant, is the fourth
candidate and was not listed in the poll.</TE>
<TE>   If none wins a majority Tuesday, the two top vote-getters will
face each other in a November runoff.</TE>
<TE>   The eventual winner will replace Supt. Delaine Eastin, who must
leave because of her own two-term limit.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the California Department of Education, the
superintendent oversees dozens of programs worth billions of dollars,
such as student testing and the school accountability system.</TE>
<TE>   The authority to establish those programs, however, lies outside
the department.</TE>
<TE>   So the candidates acknowledge that they must forge close
relationships with the governor and legislators, who together control
spending, and members of the state education board, who set policies.</TE>
<TE>   "The only power the job has is to sway ideas," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Leach, who is vice chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee,
sees the superintendent as a "watchdog" and a "loving critic" working
behind the scenes to move reforms along.</TE>
<TE>   The race has been largely overshadowed statewide by other
contests, including the campaigns for governor.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, who has raised about $3.5 million, is the only
candidate for the superintendency advertising on television. His
commercials stress his role in reducing the size of classes in
kindergarten through third grade and say the popular initiative
should be expanded to every grade.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, 50, said he also wrote legislation that created the
state's new high school exit exam and another bill that increased
salaries of beginning teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The former high school teacher said his nearly two decades in the
Legislature make him the strongest candidate to work within the
state's elaborate education bureaucracy. "I firmly believe in team
building," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Connell has drawn criticism for his close ties to the
state's teachers unions, which have contributed about $250,000 to his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He has also received $250,000 from the president of the State
Board of Education, Reed Hastings, raising questions from opponents
about O'Connell's independence from Hastings, who was appointed by
Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Leach said O'Connell "is totally dependent on the unions and the
other educational bureaucracies. They are not going to give Jack
O'Connell any breathing room."</TE>
<TE>   He defended the contributions, calling Leach's comments "totally
misguided and inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   Leach casts herself as an agent of change in a state that she says
has received little in return for its increased spending on
education. She wants teachers and schools to have a greater say in
reforms handed down by Sacramento, and would like to review the
state's testing and accountability systems to make sure they are not
overwhelming local schools.</TE>
<TE>   Like O'Connell, Leach, 62, advocates better pay for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many more kids we can throw away unless we have
some major changes," said Leach, who has raised about $350,000 for
her campaign.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell has criticized Leach for her connection to voucher
advocates. Leach's biggest campaign contributor, industrialist
William Hume, who has given her $100,000, has backed candidates who
favor publicly funded vouchers to pay tuition at private schools.
Leach said she opposes such vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   Smith depicts herself as a Sacramento outsider who can restore
civility to schools. She touts her successful effort to introduce a
moment of silence each morning in Anaheim's secondary schools so
students can collect their thoughts. Smith, 61, also has sought to
instill more respect in the schools by seeking to have students stand
when adults enter their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   She has raised only $14,000, lending herself $5,000 of the funds.
Still, she said she brings fresh ideas to a job that needs new blood.
O'Connell and Leach "are termed-out legislators circling around for
another job," she said. "I am a citizen committed to change."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, 54, has raised less than $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is running a grass-roots campaign and hopes as
superintendent to make kindergarten mandatory and offer financial
incentives for teachers to work in low-performing schools.</TE>

<HD>Don't Run Into Trouble</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Participants and others must negotiate the race's
new path.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many people figure they have the Los Angeles Marathon wired. If
they're one of the 23,000 runners expected for Sunday's race, they
probably already know where to lace up for the start. Thousands of
others have learned to take a different route on race day, picking
their way around the crowds and street closures.</LD>
<LD>   But a new course, the most significant change of route in the
race's 17-year history, means a significant readjustment for
competitors, spectators and those who just want to avoid the hoopla.</LD>
<LD>   The race once only went as far west as Highland Avenue in Hancock
Park. The course now stretches all the way to the border of Beverly
Hills.</LD>
<TE>   That shift and others mean that more than 20 miles of the
26.2-mile course are brand new to the race. Several
streets--including stretches of Venice, Pico, Wilshire and Olympic
boulevards--will be closed for the event for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Although the marathon begins at 8:45 a.m. on Grand Avenue
alongside Disney Hall, street closures for the first miles of the
course will begin more than two hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Streets will reopen on a staggered schedule throughout the day.
The last stretch of the course, on Olympic Boulevard downtown, won't
reopen until 4:30 p.m. The finish line will be on Hope Street near
9th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Steering clear of the course might mean a change of plans for
some.</TE>
<TE>   ''Well, it's 26.2 miles between downtown and West L.A.,'' said
Byron Ruano, an engineering associate with the city Department of
Transportation. The best way to avoid it? ''Just wait until the
afternoon to go there,'' Ruano said.</TE>
<TE>   The city agency will have signs marking detours, Ruano said. About
70 traffic engineers will be deployed to place signs and barriers to
block traffic and guide drivers to alternate routes. More than 450
traffic officers will divert vehicles around the marathon area.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-nine Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines in the
downtown, Mid-City and mid-Wilshire areas, among others, will be
rerouted between 4:40 a.m. and 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   However, all Metro Rail lines will run as scheduled. In fact, the
MTA is touting the Metro trains as the best way for spectators to
reach the course.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the expected million spectators could take the Metro to
Union Station, then the Red Line to Pershing Square, MTA officials
say. Pershing Square is three blocks from the starting line.</TE>
<TE>   Other Metro stops within walking distance of viewing points are
the Wilshire/Western, Pico and Grand stations. The 7th/Metro Center
station will land spectators near the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Planning to drive to the race? Several downtown parking lots will
be open for reduced fees, averaging $5 per car, according to marathon
officials, although they also advise that the best way to get there
is to use the rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers say the race is the largest single-day sporting event
west of the Mississippi. And one of the biggest parties. Festivities
will include 10 entertainment centers, featuring performances by
community groups representing the city's diversity. Entertainment
will range from Jewish folk music to Ecuadorean dancing and poetry.
More than 85 musical groups will perform along the course.</TE>
<TE>   The ''Spirit of Los Angeles'' cheerleading competition, featuring
seven high school squads, will offer runners an extra dose of
encouragement. The squads will be stationed between miles 15 and 25,
and judges traversing the course will rate each group to name a
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the marathon and entertainment stages, Sunday events will
include a bike tour that begins at 6 a.m., a wheelchair race that
begins at 8:20 a.m., and a 5K race that begins at 9:45 a.m.</TE>

<HD>2 Republicans Vie to Challenge State Treasurer</HD>
<DH>Candidates: Both attack incumbent Angelides, a Democrat,
for his role in energy crisis. He'll be favored to win in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican P. Gregory Conlon has what might be the perfect resume to
run for state treasurer--if only he could roll back the clock about
two years.</LD>
<LD>   A former president of the California Public Utilities Commission,
Conlon was one of the architects of the state's energy deregulation
scheme, hailed at the time but widely viewed now as a costly train
wreck. Before that, he spent 30 years with Arthur Andersen--that's
right, the accounting firm at the center of the Enron financial
scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Conlon's chief opponent, former state Deputy Treasurer Mary Toman,
contends that Conlon's resume is so politically radioactive that
worried Republican Party activists recruited her on the final day to
file for office, when they realized he would face no opposition in
Tuesday's primary.</LD>
<TE>   Conlon calls that hogwash, and says that although his background
might now be regarded as a political liability, it also gives him the
experience needed to take on incumbent Democrat Phil Angelides, who
is sitting on a heap of campaign cash, more than $4.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have the chutzpah to take him on," Conlon, 68, said. "I
think I can raise the money to do it. A lot of people now are sitting
on the sidelines, but after next month, they are going to help me
take him on."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who wins the primary, Angelides is considered a
heavy favorite in November, even though his role in the energy
crisis--particularly a $4.3-billion loan that he executed to pay for
power but that went sour--has opened him up to criticism. Both GOP
candidates are already trying to seize on the opening, accusing
Angelides of mismanaging the state's finances during the power
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil Angelides is a land speculator. He does not have the
background needed to serve as treasurer, which is all about being a
conservative steward of the state's money," said Toman, 47, who was a
deputy in the U.S. Commerce Department under former President Bush
and is now head of the Republican Party's Los Angeles County chapter.
Toman is also trying to paint Angelides as a habitual fund-raiser in
the Gov. Gray Davis mold.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Calfo, a treasurer's aide who is on a leave to run
Angelides' reelection campaign, says the former California Democratic
Party chairman and Sacramento real estate developer is prepared for
any challenge. Angelides is running unopposed in the primary, along
with Libertarian Marian Smithson, Green candidate Jeanne-Marie
Rosenmeier, American Independent Nathan E. Johnson and Natural Law
candidate Sylvia Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been nationally recognized for his leadership on fiscal
issues and has worked hard to get good rates on investments," Calfo
said of Angelides. "He really believes that as treasurer his
responsibility is to be a fiscal watchdog, and that is what he has
done."</TE>
<TE>   Like most statewide offices, the treasurer's position attracts
little notice outside Sacramento. But treasurers wield considerable
clout.</TE>
<TE>   The treasurer acts as the state's chief banker, frequently
orchestrating billion-dollar loans and bond deals to finance state
projects. The treasurer also oversees a variety of powerful but
little-noticed financial committees and sits on the board of the
state's gargantuan pension funds for state employees and teachers,
CalPERS and CalSTRS. The job pays $140,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the GOP candidates has raised much money--both have run
low-key campaigns financed largely by their own bank accounts--and
they've both secured their share of endorsements, with Assembly
Republican Leader Dave Cox backing Conlon and former Treasurer Matt
Fong backing Toman.</TE>
<TE>   Toman has a master's degree in business from Harvard, served as a
deputy under Fong and spent time as his representative on the pension
boards. She says she is the only candidate with the financial
background needed to earn respect on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Toman says the treasurer's office is in serious need of structural
change, and that many on staff there need enhanced training if they
are to have a fighting chance of securing good investment rates from
New York banks. Conlon, she says, simply has too much political
baggage to make a serious run at Angelides. And she believes his
stubborn adherence to deregulation illustrates a refusal to admit a
mistake that makes him unfit to serve as treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the best skills and background to be treasurer. I have
already been a deputy in that office," Toman said. "The state is in a
fiscal mess, and I have detailed plans for how to work on PERS and
STRS and deal with the cash management area of the office."</TE>
<TE>   Conlon, a former military pilot who also served on the California
Transportation Commission in addition to his time on the PUC,
recently obtained a law degree from the University of San Francisco
at an age when many are retired.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was moved to run for treasurer last year when he saw
Angelides push the PUC to suspend direct-access energy contracts, the
ability of large businesses to shop around for power deals instead of
getting their electricity from the local utility. Angelides and
others considered the suspension essential to selling bonds to
finance the state's entry into the power business as a result of the
energy crisis. But Conlon said it was another nail in the coffin of
deregulation, which he contends was never given a chance. It could be
viewed in a negative light, he said of his continued support for
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   "But as I have said, I don't think the problem was the
restructuring, I think it was the way it was implemented."</TE>

<HD>Tunnel Across Border No Shock to Drug Agents</HD>
<DH>Border: Discovery of the route from Mexico to the U.S.
confirms long-held suspicions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>For years, American drug agents heard whispers about the existence of
one or more tunnels for ferrying drugs beneath the U.S.-Mexico border
in the remote, boulder-strewn reaches of eastern San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   This week, aided by leads from an earlier drug seizure, they found
such a passage: a tunnel the length of four football fields, complete
with electricity, ventilation pipes and rails for hauling carts of
contraband under the border fence in a rural stretch of eastern San
Diego County. The agents also reported finding 500 pounds of
marijuana at the mouth of the tunnel on the U.S. side of the border.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Thursday that they think smugglers used the
1,200-foot-long subterranean route for three years or more, shuttling
perhaps tons of marijuana and cocaine to a house on a former pig
ranch in the community of Tierra del Sol, about 55 miles east of
downtown San Diego. Officials said there was no indication it was
used to smuggle illegal immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery of the 4-by-4-foot tunnel on Wednesday added a
strange chapter to border lore and, officials said, could stand out
as a major law-enforcement coup. Though the passage is not the first
to be unearthed along the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said it was
noteworthy for its sophistication and for how long it had been in
use.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's one of the most significant finds ever on the
Southwest border," said Errol J. Chavez, special agent in charge of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's office in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Agents displayed aerial photographs of the U.S. property, a shaded
barn-style house where the tunnel ended beneath a lift-up staircase,
1,000 feet north of the border. The photographs also showed a
single-story tile-roofed home in Tecate, Mexico, that held the
tunnel's opposite opening, about 200 feet south of the fence.</TE>
<TE>   The builders took great pains to disguise their project, hiding
the U.S. entrance beneath the false floor of a hidden safe and the
Mexican opening in a fireplace piled with ashes. The tunnel was lined
most of the way with wood paneling and lighted by electricity.
Plastic pipe carried fresh air to the deepest part of the tunnel, 35
feet below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Smugglers apparently used rail carts to move their cargo and may
have done so recently. Chavez said the 500-pound marijuana stash
appeared fresh.</TE>
<TE>   "[The tunnel] was very sophisticated," Chavez said during a news
conference at the DEA office in San Diego. "It was very secure and
obviously used for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said that no arrests were made on the U.S. side, but that
some could come soon. He said agents, who continued to search the
property, were seeking to determine the identity of a man who leased
the house from the owners, who were believed to be unaware of the
smuggling enterprise. Three people initially detained on the Mexican
side were also thought to be innocent of smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said the smugglers probably built the tunnel after a
10-foot border fence went up in 1995 as part of the U.S. government's
border crackdown known as Operation Gatekeeper. The remote area was
long known as a smuggling haven. Officials suspect that the operators
paid a toll to the Arellano Felix drug cartel, based in Tijuana, for
permission to move drugs through the gang's turf.</TE>
<TE>   The drug organization has been the target of U.S. and Mexican
authorities for years. Ramon Arellano Felix is on the FBI's list of
most-wanted fugitives, and his brother Benjamin also is sought on
U.S. charges. U.S. and Mexican officials are investigating whether
Ramon, considered the gang's top enforcer, was killed in a shootout
in Mazatlan last month.</TE>
<TE>   Tunnels have been a staple of border smugglers over the years. A
tunnel estimated to have cost $1 million to build was used to smuggle
cocaine from Agua Prieta, Mexico, to Douglas, Ariz. Discovered in
1990, the tunnel was elaborately camouflaged on the Mexican side to
look like a game room with a hydraulic lift that hoisted a pool table
and concrete slab that concealed the southern entrance. The
electrically lighted tunnel was 273 feet long, lined in concrete and
had sump pumps to prevent flooding.</TE>
<TE>   An unfinished quarter-mile tunnel built by drug kingpin Joaquin
"Chapo" Guzman was discovered near the Otay Mesa port of entry in San
Diego in 1993. That tunnel made headlines again in 1998 when Border
Patrol officials suspected it had been reopened to smuggle
undocumented immigrants onto U.S. soil. The mystery of its reopening
was never solved conclusively, but the tunnel was sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, customs agents found a tunnel beneath the border
leading to an unoccupied house in Nogales, Ariz. Tunnels had been
discovered there previously, making use of a system of drainage
ditches that crossed the border there.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said the discovery of the Tierra del Sol tunnel came during
an unrelated investigation stemming from a big drug seizure in San
Diego six months ago. He said it confirmed persistent reports of
tunnels and may hint at others yet undetected.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been numerous rumors about tunnels throughout Southern
California," Chavez said. "We still hear rumors that there are more
tunnels out there. We make every attempt to locate the tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   "But because of how difficult it is to find tunnels underground,
the technology that is required, the expense to locate them, it has
been extremely difficult."</TE>

<HD>16 Are Seeking 4 Coveted Posts on Tax Board</HD>
<DH>Finances: Term-limited legislators lead those seeking a
spot on only elected tax panel in U.S. Some want to make it more
accessible; others want to do away with it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Collecting the money that runs California government sometimes comes
down to questions like these:</LD>
<LD>   Are oak barrels used to make wine exempt from property tax because
they impart flavor? Can satellites made in El Segundo be taxed each
year as they orbit above the equator? Do airport restaurants deserve
a tax break because they lost business after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks?</LD>
<LD>   The California Board of Equalization decides such matters. It
reaches 1 million businesses, from hot dog stands to giant
telecommunications companies. Last year, the board collected $39.5
billion in taxes and fees that state and local governments use to pay
for schools, parks, roads, health care, police, housing and more.</LD>
<TE>   The Board of Equalization is the nation's only elected tax
commission. Its four $131,250-a-year positions--a fifth seat is held
by the state controller--are coveted by legislators ousted by term
limits. At the same time, the board is a jumping-off spot for
politicians seeking statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   In the March 5 primary, 16 candidates compete for four seats. They
include two veteran lawmakers. Two of the seats opened when current
board members, Democrat Johan Klehs and Republican Dean Andal, chose
to run for state controller.</TE>
<TE>   In the board's 1st District, Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco) runs unopposed in the Democratic primary. Having served
the maximum six years in the Assembly, she would become California's
first openly gay constitutional officer if she wins the heavily
Democratic Northern California coastal district in November. Two
Republicans and a Libertarian candidate are on the primary ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to represent the Board of Equalization's 2nd District
after 24 years in the Legislature is Republican Assemblyman Bill
Leonard. In the once-a-decade redrawing of political districts that
occurred last year, Leonard's colleagues in the Legislature stretched
a finger of the 2nd District to reach Leonard's San Bernardino house.</TE>
<TE>   In the Republican-leaning 3rd District, incumbent Republican
Claude Parrish faces two primary challengers, including Steve
Petruzzo, a veteran auditor for the board who proposes making the
trade-in of used cars tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively small 4th District encompasses the southern half of
Los Angeles County. Incumbent John Chiang, a Democrat who organizes
public workshops to help taxpayers, faces no competition in the
primary. The sole Republican candidate, businessman Glen R. Forsch,
said he would push to make a day or more of each month a "sales tax
holiday" if he were elected. The Libertarian candidate, attorney
Kenneth A. Weissman, said he wants to see state government--including
taxation--"scaled back tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   A constitutional amendment created the board 123 years ago to make
certain that county assessors levied property taxes uniformly. It was
also given the duty of taxing politically powerful railroads and
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Board of Equalization's 4,000 employees handle the
state's sales tax and collect fuel, alcohol and tobacco taxes. The
board itself acts as judge in property tax and personal income tax
appeals. Its interpretation of tax law can mean the difference
between tens of millions of dollars paid in taxes or retained by big
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Though each Board of Equalization district is vast, encompassing
roughly 8.4 million people, the post is too obscure to justify
expensive television advertising. Most candidates, if they campaign
at all, use signs and mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Most candidates for the March 5 primary have raised little or no
money, with several notable exceptions. By January, Migden had
gathered more than $500,000. Parrish had raised more than $250,000.
Leonard and Chiang had each amassed nearly $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the donations came from companies whose property is
assessed by the board. Southern California Edison executives donated
$5,000 to Leonard, for example. Pacific Bell/Pacific Telesis
employees gave $5,000 to Parrish.</TE>
<TE>   But many companies limit their donations to $249.</TE>
<TE>   That's because Board of Equalization members must follow tougher
conflict-of-interest laws than lawmakers. A 1990 law requires board
members to either recuse themselves or return donations before voting
on matters that involve companies that have given them $250 or more
in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   There's a loophole. Many big corporations with business before the
board--including Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway, Duke
Energy and Sprint--give money to the Taxpayers Political Action
Committee, which then funnels donations to board members without
being hindered by the $250 limit.</TE>
<TE>   In January, TaxPAC donated $15,000 each to Leonard, Parrish and
Chiang, then gave Leonard another $10,000 last week.</TE>
<TE>   State Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) tried last fall
to close that loophole and make political action committee donations
subject to the same restrictions as direct donations. But Migden, the
Board of Equalization candidate who chairs the Assembly
Appropriations Committee, stripped the provision from Burton's bill.
Migden said she recalls Burton's bill being amended to comply with
rules affecting other constitutional offices.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what they hope to accomplish on the Board of Equalization,
candidates offered ideas that ranged from opening more district
offices to obliterating the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, the Republican Assemblyman running in the 2nd District,
proposes a constitutional amendment that would consolidate
California's tax agencies into a single California Tax Commission. He
would combine the Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board,
which collects income tax, and the payroll-tax division of the
Employment Development Department.</TE>
<TE>   Such a consolidation would spare business owners from filling out
triple sets of paperwork and limit the circulation of confidential
tax data, Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   His Republican opponent in the primary, anti-tax crusader Edward
J. "Ted" Costa, said "political maneuvering" at the board must be
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Costa, director of People's Advocate, a Sacramento-based group
that lobbies for lower taxes, also criticized the Legislature for
redrawing districts to suit Leonard and Migden. "What's the use to
elect people to the Board of Equalization," Costa said. "Let's just
say the Board of Equalization seats are a plum we're going to give to
retired legislators."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, who has been in the Legislature since 1978, said he did
not draw the new lines, but "I did sit down with the Democrats and
said I want a district to run in."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats competing for the 2nd District are Norman R. Angelo,
a recently retired board auditor from Bakersfield, and Tom Y. Santos,
a Sacramento tax consultant. Angelo said he would like to reopen some
of the 17 district offices closed by Andal to save money. "The board
should be more accessible to the businessman," Angelo said.</TE>
<TE>   Santos, also a former board auditor, agreed that small offices
should be reopened to give business owners personal help. And
taxpayers deserve more equitable treatment when they bring tax
disputes to the board, he said. "I would be a good voice for tax
simplification and tax fairness," Santos said.</TE>
<TE>   In the 3rd District, which covers parts of San Bernardino,
Riverside, Orange, San Diego and Imperial counties, two Republicans
hope to unseat incumbent Parrish.</TE>
<TE>   A former real estate director with ABC, Parrish consistently sides
with taxpayers, not staff, in his votes. He said he may run for state
treasurer someday, and he prides himself on directly helping
taxpayers. "I call everybody back personally," he said. "I am
accessible."</TE>
<TE>   Petruzzo, a board auditor for 17 years, said he wouldn't be
running if Parrish were "a productive board member." He said the
board must do more to help businesses navigate tax law, perhaps by
offering voluntary annual audits so that businesses do not
unwittingly violate the law for years at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Parrish' other challenger in the primary, Emad Bakeer of El Cajon,
did not respond to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The only 3rd District Democratic candidate is Mary
Christian-Heising. Once employed in public relations, the La Jolla
woman called a seat on the Board of Equalization "a wonderful
opportunity to encourage women to start their own businesses."</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian candidate, J.R. "Nobody" Graham of San Diego, said
he "would always vote for the victim, never for the tax man."</TE>

<LD>In a sign of the growing ethnic diversity of Orange County, the
number of white students in public schools decreased in the past
year, even as the total student population increased by 10,000.</LD>
<LD>   Latinos became the largest ethnic group of Orange County students
last year, outnumbering whites for the first time, according to
county demographic data.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the proportion of Latino students continued to grow, to
43.1% from 42.3%, while the proportion of white students fell
slightly to 39.7% from 40.8% last year, according to the annual
enrollment survey taken last fall and released this week.</LD>
<TE>   "That's just the demographics of the state," said John Fogarty,
coordinator of fiscal services for the Orange County Department of
Education. "The Hispanic population is growing, and the white
population is decreasing."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the number of Latino students grew by 8,000, to 217,506.
The population of Asian American students increased by 2,000, to
61,783, while the number of Native American students rose to 3,050
from 2,457.</TE>
<TE>   The population of African American students declined slightly to
9,588 from 9,660. The biggest decrease was in the number of white
students, which fell to 200,554 from 202,211.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Orange County had public school enrollment last fall of
505,079.</TE>

<HD>Reports of Crime in Schoolyards Rise</HD>
<DH>Education: Some see better procedures, more officers as
reason. O.C. sees a drop in property offenses but 33% increase in
crimes against people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Physical assaults on public school campuses--mainly schoolyard
brawls--rose 16% last year throughout California, a double-digit
pattern that was generally followed in Los Angeles, Orange and
Ventura counties, according to a report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The California Safe Schools Assessment, conducted by the state
Department of Education, also found drug and alcohol offenses
increased statewide by 7%, including reported drug sales increasing
by 32% during the 2000-01 school year from the previous one. Also,
property crimes rose by 1%, including a 10% increase in graffiti and
an 8% increase in vandalism.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest increases were in crimes against people, including
battery, assault and sexual offenses.</LD>
<TE>   Battery, described as physical altercations without weapons, was
by far the most commonly reported incident in that category,
increasing by 18%.</TE>
<TE>   "The highest rate by far occurs during the middle-school years,"
said state Supt. Delaine Eastin in a prepared statement, "when peer
pressure, bullying and other social conflicts can result in the
disengagement of our students."</TE>
<TE>   Officials Say Vigilance Causes Higher Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Some education officials, however, cautioned that part of the
increase in offenses may be the result of better reporting by schools
and districts rather than an actual increase in incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress Elementary School District in Orange County, for example,
reported 17 incidents of battery last year after reporting none the
year before.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been with the district nine years," said William Eller,
superintendent of the 4,900-student district. "And I didn't notice
anything significantly different last year" in terms of crime.</TE>
<TE>   What Eller did notice, however, was that school officials were
defining incidents such as bullying and schoolyard brawls as cases of
battery and reporting them to the state. In the past they only dealt
with those incidents as internal disciplinary issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not discouraged by the fact that we are reporting more,"
Eller said. "Society is a different place today than it was 10, 15,
20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County as a whole, the rate of reported property crimes
dipped by more than 9%, but crimes against persons rose by 32.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County campuses remain some of the safest in California,
ranking below state levels on all types of reportable crimes.
Nonetheless, there were 985 cases of battery and 83 incidents of
assault with a deadly weapon reported last year compared with 719 and
66, respectively, for the year before. There were no murders.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitized by highly publicized cases of school violence in recent
years, school administrators said they are becoming increasingly more
vigilant about children's conduct, even about perennial behavior that
might have been viewed more innocently in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The 22,275-student Anaheim City School District, for example, saw
all its crime statistics drop last year with one curious exception.
The district reported 10 sex offenses in its elementary schools after
reporting very few such cases for five years.</TE>
<TE>   All of last year's offenses involved inappropriate touching of
girls by boys, district spokeswoman Suzi Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the cases were later determined to not qualify as sexual
offenses because the boys were too young to have had sexual intent.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said part of the difficulty for teachers is defining the
right category of offense even when they know the behavior is
unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we looked at our battery numbers, and we found
administrators were very inconsistent" in how they reported similar
incidents, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had them go through more training, with videotapes about
bullying and harassment at each grade level so we could be more
consistent from school to school," she said.</TE>
<TE>   More Officers to Catch More Offenses</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified School District has achieved some of that
consistency by entrusting its in-house Police Department with the job
of reporting crimes to state education officials.</TE>
<TE>   But that, district officials say, artificially inflates Santa
Ana's crime numbers compared with other districts.</TE>
<TE>   The largest district in Orange County reported some of the highest
rates of offenses and posted some of the biggest increases in the
county last year, but that can be deceiving, said Santa Ana school
Police Chief Jim Miyashiro.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, the only school system in the county with its own
law enforcement agency, a police report automatically generates a
school safety report, including cases involving students on their way
to and from school, Miyashiro said.</TE>
<TE>   In districts patrolled by city or county law enforcement, that is
not usually the case.</TE>
<TE>   The 60,600-student district has also increased its police force
from four sworn officers five years ago to 25, which means the
department can catch and report more offenses. Santa Ana reported 188
cases of battery and 21 cases of assault with a deadly weapon last
year compared with 97 and six the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The rates still remain below statewide figures.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I don't see an increase in crime at all," Miyashiro
said. "It is a matter of reporting the data. Overall, our campuses
are very safe."</TE>
<TE>   The statewide crime rates were based on reports from 1,043 school
districts and county offices serving more than 6 million students
from kindergarten through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, battery crimes increased for the fourth
year in a row, with a 15.5% jump in 2000-01. The 720,000-student Los
Angeles Unified School District, which has the largest enrollment in
the state, experienced an 11.6% jump in battery crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, battery crimes increased by 14.8%, from 268 in
1999-2000 to 314 last year. That includes the Oxnard Elementary
district, where battery arrests went from 25 in 1999-2000 to 36 last
year.</TE>

<HD>Drug and Alcohol Crimes Up 16% at County Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: The trend tops statewide averages for the third
straight year, alarming local officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crimes involving drugs and alcohol on Ventura County campuses jumped
15.9% last school year, topping the statewide average for the third
straight year, a report released Thursday shows.</LD>
<LD>   Education leaders say the trend is a disturbing one to which all
administrators, teachers and parents should pay attention.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just totally unacceptable that we have numbers above state
averages, and now the numbers are even growing from previous years,"
said Charles Weis, Ventura County superintendent of schools. "I would
call for a communitywide effort to look at this issue and come up
with new solutions, because obviously the old programs are not
getting the desired results."</LD>
<TE>   According to the annual California Safe Schools Assessment, for
every 1,000 students in Ventura County last year, 4.96 were arrested
for drug or alcohol offenses, compared with 4.30 per 1,000 students
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   That means local students were more likely to be caught drinking
alcohol and using or selling illegal drugs last year than their
counterparts across California, which saw a 7% rate increase in drug
and alcohol offenses last year.</TE>
<TE>   Battery Arrests Increase 17%</TE>
<TE>   The number of student arrests for battery also increased
countywide, by about 17%, from 268 in 1999-2000 to 314 last year.
That trend also was mirrored statewide. The rate of crimes against
people, including battery, assault and sexual offenses, jumped 16%
from the previous year across California. Battery was the most
commonly reported incident in that category, rising by 18% to 4.58
per 1,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   ''The highest rate by far occurs during the middle school years
when peer pressure, bullying and other social conflicts can result in
the disengagement of our students,'' Delaine Eastin, state
superintendent of public instruction, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   One district that saw a sharp increase was Oxnard Elementary,
where battery arrests went up from 25 in 1999-2000 to 36 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Richard Duarte said violence on the district's elementary
and middle school campuses is something teachers and principals are
working on daily.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately it's indicative of what's going on in society in
general," Duarte said. "Children are exposed at a much earlier age to
incidents of violence and settling problems physically. That shows in
these numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Offenses in other categories--including assault, sex offenses and
property crimes--were well below state averages, and in many Ventura
County districts the numbers went down from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   But Weis said the drug and alcohol figures are nonetheless
disheartening in a county where students regularly perform better
academically than their peers throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching kids math and science, and how to be outstanding
speakers and writers, is great, but if they ruin their lives by using
alcohol and drugs, it's all for naught," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During the school year that ended last June, 694 students out of
139,808 countywide were arrested for possession, sale or use of
alcohol or illegal drugs, up from 599 the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The increase is more than double the hike that local schools saw
between 1999-2000 and 1998-1999, when arrests went up about 6.5%.
Since the state began collecting campus crime data in 1995, the rate
of drug and alcohol crimes has gone down in the county, from 5.01
offenses per 1,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   However, since 1997, arrests have climbed because the overall
number of students has grown.The data, compiled by the state
Department of Education, show the highest rates of drug and alcohol
crimes in Ventura County occurred on Oxnard and Santa Paula high
school campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Many other districts also showed increases in drug and alcohol
offenses from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   In the Simi Valley Unified School District, drug and alcohol
arrests rose from 72 in 1999-2000 to 92 this year, up nearly 28%.</TE>
<TE>   Some Districts Turn to Prevention Programs</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rizzardi, director of secondary education, said he hopes two
new research-based prevention programs--one for middle schools and
one for high schools--will help combat the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there are drugs and alcohol on our campuses, and our goal
is to eradicate it ultimately," he said. "Even if we were moving in
the right direction it is not good enough. Until the numbers are zero
we will continue to make an effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about kids' lives here."</TE>
<TE>   State crime rates are based on reports from 1,043 school districts
and county offices serving more than 6 million students from
kindergarten through 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   Many local education officials attributed the increases to better
reporting rather than an actual rise in crime on their campuses.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Forces Storm Into 2 Palestinian Refugee Camps</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Fierce combat in West Bank kills at least 14. First such
incursion of the conflict seeks to break militant strongholds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALATA REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Backed by tanks and helicopters, Israeli forces waged a major,
risky assault on two Palestinian refugee camps Thursday, conducting
house-to-house searches and battling gunmen who vowed to fight to the
death.</LD>
<LD>   The mission to break Palestinian militant strongholds marked the first
time in years that Israel had invaded a refugee camp, and it triggered
some of the fiercest combat yet in 17 months of conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Israel said the densely populated Balata camp, in the West Bank city
of Nablus, and the nearby Jenin camp are "hotbeds of terrorism" where
Palestinian militants train, make weapons, take shelter and plot attacks
on Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   For Israel, entering Balata, a teeming warren of cramped cinder-block
homes and narrow streets where at least 20,000 Palestinians live, was
always a red line, a threshold that few would have predicted the
government would cross. The layout of the decades-old camp is more
conducive to the guerrilla warfare that Palestinian militants wage than
the conventional operations of Israel's mechanized army. The risk of
heavy losses has always been considered high.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive began late Wednesday, and fighting continued to rage
early today in Balata, where Israeli forces had seized control of many
buildings, and in Jenin, 25 miles to the north, where troops met stiff
resistance as they moved deeper into the camp. Palestinian fighters vowed
revenge and carried out shooting attacks on Jewish communities throughout
the West Bank and near Jerusalem. That led to Israeli retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   At least 13 Palestinians were killed in Balata and Jenin and more than
100 wounded. One Israeli soldier, a member of an elite paratroop
reconnaissance squad, was also killed in Balata. Scores of Palestinian
civilians fled the camps or hunkered down, stockpiling food and bracing
for worse.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher urged that
"the utmost restraint be exercised to avoid harm to the civilian
population. These are heavily populated areas."</TE>
<TE>   The surge in violence sidelined a fledgling Saudi peace initiative
that had been gaining momentum. Palestinians accused Israel of attacking
the camps to undermine the land-for-peace proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Balata on Thursday was ringed by tanks and engulfed in clouds of black
smoke from the burning tires that camp residents placed in the roads
alongside concrete chunks and hulks of cars as barricades. The main
Market Road was pitted with grapefruit-sized holes, apparently from
Israeli helicopter fire. Palestinian gunmen crouched around corners.
Every storefront was shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   "The camp is effectively under [Israeli military] control," Col. Avi
Kochavi, head of the paratroop brigade carrying out the operation, told
reporters in a briefing at a command post west of Nablus. "It's
completely surrounded, and we are in commanding positions."</TE>
<TE>   The Balata camp, the largest in the West Bank, has long been a bastion
of Palestinian militancy--so tough and independent that even Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat has had trouble asserting control over
camp leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But Kochavi said less conventional tactics than the army commonly uses
had given his men mobility, allowing them to seize key intersections and
buildings with minimal casualties and carry out an extensive search for
weapons and suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces began taking up positions near Balata last week, when
they cut off the main road into Nablus. Late Wednesday, tanks were
bearing down on the camp, and around midnight, helicopter gunships fired
two missiles into an electrical transformer, plunging the area into
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   The invasion began. In a blaze of gunfire, elite special forces
dressed in black swept into several apartment buildings and a United
Nations-run boys school. Palestinian gunmen answered helicopter fire with
bursts from automatic weapons and explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals were overwhelmed with scores of casualties. "Anyone who left
his home could get shot," said Ghassan Awad, a 36-year-old ambulance
driver who had hauled out six of the wounded by 8:30 a.m. One later died.
The injured included women and children as well as gunmen, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers set up an observation post at the U.N. school, perched on
high ground with a vantage point over the entire camp. Palestinians tried
to lay siege to the school, and they and the Israelis traded fire for
hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not surrender," proclaimed Maged al Masri, a leader of the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah movement
that essentially runs Balata. "We will fight until death. We will send
the soldiers to [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon in coffins."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, troops conducted house-to-house searches. To avoid
exposure to enemy fire, they blew holes in the walls of adjacent homes so
they could move from one to the next without going outside.</TE>
<TE>   At noon, the army announced that it would give civilians three hours
to leave the camp if they desired. "We strongly suggested they leave, for
their safety," an army spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hour before the grace period ended, dozens of people, mostly
women tugging children, hurried from the camp and onto the debris-strewn
streets of Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is leaving," said Shifa Smajil, her two daughters and her
husband's other wife in tow. "There's been shooting all night, and we
really don't know what's happening. I'm very afraid."</TE>
<TE>   But Mohammed and Jamila Ibrahim and their 11 children were having none
of it. "Where would we go?" Jamila asked, dressed in a velour housecoat
and tucked in an alley. "We left in '48, we left in '67," she said,
referring to Israel's War of Independence and the Middle East War, when
huge numbers of Palestinians fled their homes. "We will die in our home.
We will not leave again."</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke, another barrage of gunfire sounded. A shout went up. A
young man fell wounded. Others grabbed him from the street, blood gushing
from a leg wound, and rushed him to a battery of waiting ambulances,
their red lights flashing and sirens wailing.</TE>
<TE>   After nightfall, shooting from helicopters resumed, allowing Israeli
forces to advance deeper into the camp. Early today, at least three more
Palestinians were wounded as troops and armored vehicles moved deeper
into Jenin, with helicopters hovering overhead, according to residents
reached by telephone. Fierce gun battles raged before dawn and calls for
the residents to defend their homes were sounded from loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Since the worst Israeli-Palestinian fighting in decades erupted in
September 2000, Israel has shelled targets in refugee camps, mostly in
the Gaza Strip, and has repeatedly invaded cities and towns. But never
have troops come so close to hand-to-hand combat in the alleyways of an
angry, hostile refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "The operation shows . . . no place is off-limits for the Israeli
army," Kochavi told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Hostilities between Israel and Balata militants date back to the early
days of the current conflict, when Israeli troops were forced to retreat
from Joseph's Tomb, a shrine in Nablus, under almost constant attack by
the militants. An Israeli soldier bled to death when his comrades
couldn't rescue him.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Thursday that Balata
militants were launching suicide bombers "every day" and had to be
stopped. "The Palestinians must not think that the camps are safe
havens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military clearly had Thursday's operation on the drawing
board for some time. The tactics are classic Sharon, reminiscent of the
steps he took as a military commander to "cleanse" the Gaza Strip of
Palestinians he judged to be terrorists in the late 1960s and early
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "This is complete madness," said opposition leader Yossi Sarid of the
leftist Meretz Party. "Someone burnt badly in the past in Sabra and
Chatila must be very careful in the present in Balata and Jenin. Nothing
good can come from yet another escalation. . . . This is bad, very bad."</TE>
<TE>   Sabra and Chatila were Palestinian refugee camps near Beirut where
Christian Phalangists killed hundreds of people during Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon. Sharon, who was defense minister at the time,
controlled the area, and an official Israeli investigation held him
indirectly responsible for failing to stop the massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants vowed revenge to the Balata and Jenin operations
and later opened fire on Gilo, a Jewish neighborhood on land Israel
captured in the 1967 war and considers part of Jerusalem. Four people
were injured and 20 buildings damaged, Israeli authorities said. Israel
fired missiles at the nearby Palestinian town of Beit Jala in response.</TE>

<HD>Special Interest Money Talks</HD>
<DH>Election: State limits on political donations don't apply to groups
such as doctors or unions, which are spending millions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>A 2-year-old state law limiting the money that donors can give to
most California politicians has not stopped special interest groups,
which are spending millions of dollars on behalf of their favored
candidates in this year's state legislative races.</LD>
<LD>   The result is that some voters are receiving expensive, last-minute
mailers from groups without an obvious interest in the race at hand.
Dentists, doctors, unions, trial lawyers, tobacco companies, mobile home
owners and many others have entered the fray by forming so-called
independent expenditure committees.</LD>
<LD>   The groups are spending more than candidates in some races.</LD>
<TE>   "It is completely dysfunctional," Democratic consultant Richie Ross
said. "The candidate's voice is being drowned out by well-intentioned
groups. Voters get mail and don't know who's behind it."</TE>
<TE>   In the first state election governed by the contribution limits of
Proposition 34, interest groups are legally evading the caps approved by
California voters and mimicking a much-criticized practice in federal
campaigns--one that Congress is trying to overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Calderon's battle for the Democratic nomination in an Assembly
district east of Los Angeles, for example, is not merely with Chuck
Fuentes. A group calling itself California Alliance, financed by trial
lawyers, a nurses union and an environmentalist group, has spent nearly
$100,000 on Fuentes' campaign.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday's election, the newly created committee will have spent
about $600,000 on five races.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, north of Los Angeles, two unions led by state prison guards
have spent $220,000 on behalf of Sharon Runner, wife of a retiring
assemblyman, in harsh attacks against her Republican-primary opponent,
Assemblyman Phil Wyman of Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sacramento-area Assembly race, optometrists have spent $70,000
against ophthalmologist Alan Nakanishi.</TE>
<TE>   And north of Sacramento, in a race between two Assembly Republicans
competing for a state Senate seat, dentists are using independent
expenditures to help Sam Aanestad while state employees are spending on
behalf of Dick Dickerson. Combined, the committees have spent a reported
$704,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gale Kaufman, a campaign consultant now coordinating the independent
expenditures of teachers, state employees and others, says her clients
are spending heavily "because of the stakes in some of the races, the
ideological issues."</TE>
<TE>   David Allgood of the California League of Conservation Voters, which
has used independent expenditures, also defended the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't feel as if we could sit outside the fray," he said. "We
felt we had to be players."</TE>
<TE>   Under California's old anything-goes system, donors could give an
unlimited amount to candidates. Checks of $100,000 made out to Assembly
and Senate candidates were not unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34 caps individuals' donations to legislative candidates
at $3,000, though some groups, such as labor unions, can give $6,000. In
2006, candidates for statewide offices will fall under Proposition 34's
contribution limits, raising the likelihood that independent committees
will help shape the race for governor.</TE>
<TE>1st Amendment Right Was Upheld</TE>
<TE>   A few groups have run independent campaigns in state races, and Indian
tribes used them in last year's race for mayor on behalf of James K. Hahn
and against Antonio Villaraigosa. But the 2002 primary is the first
election in which such efforts are being used extensively in Assembly and
Senate races.</TE>
<TE>   Independent expenditures have their defenders. Some say they insulate
candidates from being influenced by having to solicit campaign donations
directly.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that although caps can
be placed on donations to candidates, individuals and groups have a 1st
Amendment right to spend as much as they want on independent political
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is anything you can do with independent
expenditures," said Lance Olson, a political law expert who helped draft
Proposition 34 and advises about a dozen such groups set up for this
year's election.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say independent spending allows groups to circumvent
contribution limits. James Knox, executive director of California Common
Cause, which opposed Proposition 34, said the groups can level harsh,
sometimes inaccurate, allegations, leaving the targeted candidate with
little recourse.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that independent expenditure committees are less
accountable," Knox said. "Frankly, sometimes candidates like it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   As money shifts away from candidates, state parties are becoming
richer recipients of campaign cash. The California Democratic Party
reported having $11.3 million in ready cash as of Feb. 16--six times the
$1.6 million it had in February 2000, before Proposition 34's passage.
The California Republican Party had $2 million as of Feb. 16, twice what
it had two years before.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, parties don't get involved in primaries.
Independent expenditure committees, however, have no such compunctions.</TE>
<TE>   With most legislative districts heavily favoring either Democrats or
Republicans, the collective view of the next Legislature probably will be
determined by this year's primary battles, and interest groups are trying
to seize an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   On the Republican side, some groups are trying to elect moderates to
revive a party that has been losing ground in California, largely because
voters view it as too conservative on social issues. Business groups also
are playing in Democratic primaries, on the side of fiscal moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys and organized labor, increasingly angry at
moderate Assembly Democrats for casting pro-business votes on major
legislation, are trying to elect lawmakers who share their more liberal,
pro-consumer bent.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a cancer that has developed in the Legislature," said
attorney Ray Boucher, who oversees spending by Consumer Attorneys of
California, the trial lawyer organization. "They call themselves the
moderate Democratic caucus. They are really the corporate business
caucus, and they have hijacked the Democratic party and the Assembly
process."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, a partner in the Beverly Hills firm of Kiesel, Boucher &amp;
Larson, estimates that plaintiffs' lawyers will have spent $2.5 million
on legislative races by Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the final weekend before the election, voters will be
inundated with mailers and other ads attacking candidates, financed by
groups with benign-sounding names such as Californians for Common Sense,
funded by alcohol, oil, construction and energy interests, and
Californians United, which gets money from labor, energy, tobacco and E&amp;J
Gallo Winery.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some more surprises this weekend," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Calderon-Fuentes race, California Alliance is sending mailers
lashing out at Calderon for taking money from tobacco and oil companies.
One mailer raises questions about his commitment to public education,
though he has been endorsed by teachers unions.</TE>
<TE>   A committee funded by California Chamber of Commerce members,
including energy, oil and insurance companies, is spending on Calderon's
behalf.</TE>
<TE>Prison Guards Unions Are Spending a Lot</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers and environmentalists are not the only ones aiming to
settle old scores. The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. is
spending in the high six figures, hoping to influence the outcome of a
half-dozen races.</TE>
<TE>   North of Los Angeles, two unions led by the state prison guards union
have spent $220,000 on behalf of Sharon Runner, wife of outgoing
Assemblyman George Runner Jr. (R-Lancaster), in her campaign against Phil
Wyman. A loser in last year's redistricting, Wyman moved into the
neighboring district in an effort to extend his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The unions have sent mailers attacking Wyman as "a career politician
who spent nearly 20 years in the Legislature and is now desperate to
return." The mailers seek to make an issue of Wyman's taking tax-free per
diem payments of $121 for each day the Legislature is in session. Of
course, virtually all state lawmakers accept the payments. Guards also
tried to link Wyman with Willie Brown, even though the San Francisco
mayor has been out of the Legislature for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman believes the prison guards targeted him because he opposed
legislation restricting the state from contracting with private prison
companies. A private prison firm is helping to finance mailers on Wyman's
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The guards union opposes private prisons, some of which are in the
Antelope Valley. Wyman has raised about $300,000 for his campaign. But
though he intends to spend it all to win the seat, Wyman said the heavy
spending by state employee unions makes his chances "dicey."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dangerous precedent for campaigns to have caps, then to have
independent expenditure committees bust those caps by hundreds of
thousands of dollars," Wyman said.</TE>
<TE>   The guards union is using Wyman to send a message that legislators
shouldn't "mess" with them, Wyman said. "If they're able to take me out,
that doesn't bode well for the independence of the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   "Our troops don't like him, and I support our troops," said Don Novey,
president of the prison officers union. Of independent expenditures,
Novey said: "It's something that isn't going to go away. . . . It is
constitutionally in cement."</TE>
<TE>   The rise in independent expenditure committees is spawning a niche
industry for campaign consultants. Gale Kaufman, a longtime Democratic
campaign consultant, said she normally would have an operative working at
the candidate's headquarters and would be in constant contact. Not this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she is overseeing a committee formed by teachers and state
employee unions that will spend as much as $400,000 on behalf of
Democrats in primary fights. She also is representing a business group
that is spending heavily on behalf of a Democrat in the Silicon Valley,
and Democrat Andre Cherney in the San Fernando Valley. The use of
independent expenditure committees could result in more money being spent
on state campaigns because of duplication of polling and other efforts,
Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still very involved in legislative races, but I'm working without
candidates," he said. "I'm doing it on behalf of interests."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34 has strict disclosure requirements. Groups must report
donations to the secretary of state within 24 hours. To look up a donor
on the Internet, go to: http://www.ss.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>'Monday Night Football' Hauls In Madden</HD>
<DH>TV: ABC boots Miller, Fouts and Dickerson to make a high-profile
duo with Al Michaels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the biggest names in the sport--"Monday Night Football" and
John Madden--were paired in a blockbuster deal announced Thursday that
reshapes the football broadcasting landscape and ends ABC's failed
two-season experiment with comedian Dennis Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Luring Madden from Fox to work alongside play-by-play announcer Al
Michaels was followed by a wholesale shake-up at "Monday Night Football":
Miller is out, along with commentator Dan Fouts and sideline reporter
Eric Dickerson. The moves mark the network's latest attempt to restore
the show to its former stature.</LD>
<LD>   For ABC, Madden may be the key to turning around its ratings. While it
remained the network's top-ranked program, ratings for "Monday Night
Football" have steadily declined to their lowest in the show's 32-year
history. The show averaged 16.8 million viewers a week for the most
recent season, down from 18.5 million the year before and 19.4 million in
1999, before Miller arrived.</LD>
<TE>   "There is only one John Madden and he's now part of ABC Sports," said
Howard Katz, president of ABC Sports. "I expect the ratings are going to
be affected positively."</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of Madden comes as all the major networks face significant
financial difficulties with the fees they are struggling to pay for
costly sports rights. Several networks have written off massive financial
losses on their investments--in ABC's case, a commitment to the NFL of
$4.4 billion over eight years--made even more severe by a downturn in the
advertising market and poor ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the hiring of Madden, the former Oakland Raider coach
widely considered the top football analyst for more than two decades,
harks back to the show's heyday, when a larger-than-life personality
named Howard Cosell ruled the booth.</TE>
<TE>   "Madden certainly brings the cachet that is consistent with 'Monday
Night Football's' image," said Jack MacKenzie, a senior vice president
for the television research and consulting firm of Frank N. Magid
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   And though Madden may be 65, he already holds added appeal with
younger audiences: The "Madden" line of video football games, wildly
popular with boys and young men, is the second-largest source of
licensing income for the National Football League, after apparel.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the Raiders, Madden became even more famous as a
broadcaster. His boom-boom, flamboyant broadcasting style and his Miller
Lite and Ace Hardware commercials set him apart. He popularized the use
of the telestrater, which lets a commentator mark up a screen to make a
point.</TE>
<TE>   His fear of flying and his preferred mode of transportation, a bus
called the Maddencruiser that is equipped with a satellite dish and all
the amenities of home, also make Madden unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "Age is not the key factor in attracting young viewers. It's more
about style, and Madden has a unique and energetic style that is
attractive to younger viewers," MacKenzie said.</TE>
<TE>   For Madden, the four-year, $20-million deal is a dream come true.</TE>
<TE>   "This happened so quickly that I'm numb, but even in my numbness I
realize just how lucky I am," Madden said. "Every broadcaster dreams of
being a part of 'Monday Night Football,' and now I have that
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   ABC was hoping to reverse sagging interest two years ago when it
brought back former "Monday Night Football" producer Don Ohlmeyer, who,
in turn, tried to appeal to a younger, hipper audience with the hiring of
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Although ratings for the show declined in each of Miller's two years,
the maneuver seemed justified by the massive amount of publicity and
press coverage generated by his hiring. Web sites sprouted up to
translate the comic's more obscure references, and critics weighed in,
some with front-page reviews.</TE>
<TE>   But more often than not, critics said, his presence in the booth
served as a distraction and ultimately failed to improve ratings. Miller
did not return phone calls seeking comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Whether an announcer alone can remedy the troubles of "Monday Night
Football" or the decline of sports in general on TV, is doubtful, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives say a glut of sports on cable and broadcast
television has reduced ratings across the board--and the prices
advertisers have been willing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Prime time has changed dramatically since "Monday Night Football" was
launched. Football in prime time was then a novelty. Today there are
sporting events available nearly around the clock, with prime-time
coverage of college football and basketball on multiple
networks--including vintage games on ESPN Classic--as well as ESPN's
night NFL games on Thursdays and Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   The major networks have had difficulty making money on the eight-year,
$18-billion contract with the NFL, particularly during the current
advertising downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, News Corp., the owner of the Fox broadcasting
network and Fox Sports Net cable channels, took the largest single
write-off ever on a sports contract when it charged $909 million against
quarterly earnings. About $387 million of the total was related to future
expected losses on its $550-million-a-year NFL contract.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that the Walt Disney Co. is losing millions of
dollars a year on its $1.175-billion annual contract with the NFL. Disney
is paying about $575 million a year for "Monday Night Football" and $600
million a year for the Sunday night package on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC can control its broadcasting lineup, there are various
factors over which ABC has no control. The NFL still sets football
schedules well in advance of the TV season, and while "Monday Night
Football" is frequently given marquee teams, a poor year by an
anticipated title contender or too many one-sided games can significantly
reduce ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Madden had one year remaining on his contract with Fox, which would
have paid him nearly $8 million next season. Fox, according to sources,
offered Madden a three-year extension at $5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC deal came together quickly. Fox granted permission to Madden's
representatives Wednesday to negotiate with ABC, which Madden learned
from his agent as he started driving from his second home in the
Carmel-Pebble Beach area to his primary home in Pleasanton--about a
three-hour drive.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he arrived, the contract was there, ready to be signed and
faxed back to ABC.</TE>
<TE>   It was so quick, in fact, he forgot to tell his mother. "She heard it
on the radio. . . . I had to tell her I was sorry I didn't call her."</TE>
<TE>   Since ABC and ESPN are both owned by Disney, Madden's contract calls
for him to appear on such ESPN news and information shows as "Sunday NFL
Countdown."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said that sideline reporter Melissa Stark will return and that
Fouts will be reassigned within the network. He indicated Dickerson will
not be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Madden said he is thrilled to have the opportunity to work with
Michaels, whom he called the best play-by-play announcer in the business.</TE>
<TE>   And Michaels, 56, offered similar praise for Madden.</TE>
<TE>   "John sets the gold standard," Michaels said. "He created the template
by which all other football commentators are judged."</TE>
<TE>   ABC televises the next Super Bowl, so Michaels and Madden will be
announcing it. But their first assignment together will be the Hall of
Fame game Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   With Michaels, Madden will have his first new play-by-play partner in
21 years. That's how long he worked with Pat Summerall at CBS and Fox.
Summerall stepped down as Fox's No. 1 play-by-play announcer after the
Super Bowl in February.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the transition for John will be seamless," Michaels said,
"but I don't think it would have been as seamless if he were to work in a
three-man booth. John needs space to roam."</TE>
<TE>   Michaels said the hard part was saying goodbye to Fouts and Miller,
whom he calls close friends.</TE>
<TE>   "In Dennis' case, what he tried to do was the hardest thing ever
attempted in broadcasting. No other non-football person or someone of
that ilk could have pulled it off as well as he did."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Michaels said that maybe Miller would have been better
suited for a studio show.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to let the viewers see his face, see his mannerism," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Detainees in Cuba Refuse to Eat After Cell Incident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>A hunger strike broke out this week among most of the 300 detainees
from the Afghanistan war being held at a makeshift prison here, triggered
when a guard stripped a praying prisoner of his makeshift turban,
authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of the hunger strikers had resumed eating by nightfall,
however, after the prison's top official announced that detainees would
be permitted to use their sheets as turbans.</LD>
<LD>   The incident brought to the surface tensions that have built since the
prisoners began arriving seven weeks ago, and led to noisy demands by the
detainees to learn when and how their cases will be resolved.</LD>
<TE>   The refusal to eat marks the first organized protest by the prisoners,
who are locked up under heavy guard in temporary, outdoor wire cages.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to turning down their meals, detainees erupted into
organized, rhythmic chants that spread across cell blocks Thursday. "God
is great!" they cried in Arabic. "There is no god but God!"</TE>
<TE>   About half of them angrily pushed items out of their cells, including
sheets, blankets and mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no violence, no injuries," said camp spokesman Maj. Steve
Cox. "There was no confrontation between guards and detainees during the
chanting or when they threw out their comfort items."</TE>
<TE>   But Cox said the military activated a special unit of soldiers in case
the situation gets worse.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 194 detainees, nearly two-thirds of the prison population,
refused lunch Thursday. But the protest appeared to lose steam after
Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert, who runs the prison, agreed to allow the
inmates to create makeshift turbans.</TE>
<TE>   Many quickly did just that. But Lehnert also warned, in his first
address to the prison population, that the turbans will be subject to
random inspections.</TE>
<TE>   He also told them through an interpreter on a loudspeaker system that
they soon will be allowed books in their cells, in addition to copies of
the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   By dinner time, the number of hunger strikers had fallen to 88.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert also spoke separately to his guards, saying that while
security remains their top objective, they will undergo additional
"cultural training" about the practices of Muslims and their religion.</TE>
<TE>   The frustrations hit a boiling point Tuesday when an Army guard
"interrupted" a detainee kneeling in prayer in his cell because he was
violating prison rules by using a bedsheet to fashion a turban over his
head, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   That was against prison policy, which was designed to prevent weapons
or other items from being hidden under headgear.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities of the Joint Task Force that is running the prison
acknowledged that the episode was an "unfortunate incident" and a
"miscommunication" between the guard and the detainee.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials here vowed that if the strike persists over the
next several days and malnutrition sets in, authorities will force feed
the protesters through IVs or other means.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is going to starve at Camp X-Ray," said Navy Capt. Albert J.
Shimkus, commanding officer of the prison hospital. "We are not going to
let anyone die."</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when the guard noted that a prisoner in his cell
was wearing a turban, officials said. According to Cox, the guard
repeatedly asked the detainee to take the sheet off, but the inmate did
not respond. Finally, Cox said, the guard entered the cell, handcuffed
the detainee and removed the wrap himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an unfortunate incident because at that time the detainee was
in the midst of his prayers," Cox said. "That's why there was this
miscommunication. The guard apparently interrupted the service."</TE>
<TE>   Cox declined to identify the guard but said he was not disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to characterize it," the major said, "I would say it was
an honest mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also refused to identify the inmate, as they have declined
to name any of the 300 prisoners, or divulge his nationality.</TE>
<TE>   As news of the incident swept the camp, 159 prisoners launched a
protest, refusing lunch Wednesday. The protest continued at subsequent
meals and reached a high of 194 detainees by lunchtime Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The protest comes after a series of minor, isolated incidents between
detainees and guards that has strained the already tight disciplinary
conditions here. One prisoner tossed a shampoo bottle at a guard, for
instance, and another bit a guard.</TE>
<TE>   The military is treading new ground in confining such a large number
of prisoners on a U.S. military base and has yet to receive any word from
Washington on whether tribunals will be held here or elsewhere for the
prisoners, or whether the inmates will simply be sent home.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said the detainees are growing increasingly restless about their
fate. Just this week, top officials at the Pentagon said that, while
there may be a decision soon on when to begin conducting tribunals, it
remains unclear if there will be many trials.</TE>
<TE>   "Underlying all this is their uncertainty about their future," Cox
said. "They want to know what is going to happen to them, and when it is
going to happen. The honest answer is that we tell them we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Amnesty International said the protest "highlights the
dangers of the legal limbo into which the prisoners have been thrown."</TE>
<TE>   Detainees are daily given three meals that officials say adhere to
their wishes, both culturally and religiously. For the Muslims, the meals
are considered halal, or religiously appropriate for that faith.</TE>
<TE>   The meals are usually heavy in vegetables and breads.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast is typically oatmeal, fresh bread and an orange. Lunch can
be a pasta and vegetable stew, a box of raisins, two granola bars and a
bag of chips. Dinner is often white rice, red beans, a banana and bread.</TE>
<TE>   None of the detainees has refused water, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not say whether the hunger protest is being
organized by leaders who have emerged among the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Shimkus, of the prison hospital, said there are provisions for IVs and
other procedures to feed the protesters in the Camp X-Ray infirmary.</TE>
<TE>   "If necessary," he said, "we will apply those procedures."</TE>
<TE>   Shimkus estimated that the detainees could go for two or three days
before showing the first symptoms of malnutrition, such as tightened skin
and lethargy. He added that the lethargy would break down their
resistance to being force-fed.</TE>
<TE>   Shimkus said that prolonged forced IVs might not keep a detainee
alive, and he acknowledged that things could become difficult if "someone
wants to die."</TE>
<TE>   However, Cox, the camp spokesman, said the task force will not let
that happen. "Rest assured, there will not be a detainee who starves
himself to death on Guantanamo Bay."</TE>

<HD>Daschle Questions Future Success of U.S. War Effort</HD>
<DH>Politics: Top Democrat's remarks signal party's growing willingness
to challenge Bush's goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After months of studied solidarity behind the war on terrorism,
congressional Democrats are posing increasingly skeptical questions about
the campaign's goals and direction, as well as President Bush's proposed
military buildup.</LD>
<LD>   Questions came from the top of the Democratic Party on Thursday when
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told reporters that
the future success of the mission in Afghanistan was "in doubt" and that
the military cannot yet claim victory because terrorist leaders remain at
large.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, we've got to find [Mullah] Mohammed Omar [the head of the
former Taliban regime], we've got to find Osama bin Laden and we've got
to find other key leaders of the Al Qaeda network, or we will have
failed," Daschle said. "We're not safe until we have broken the back of
Al Qaeda, and we haven't done that yet."</LD>
<TE>   Republicans immediately slammed Daschle for casting doubt on the war
effort while troops are in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare Sen. Daschle criticize President Bush while we are fighting
our war on terrorism," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Daschle later issued a statement saying the senator
did not intend his comments to be construed as critical of Bush and his
campaign against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle's remarks underscored a growing willingness on the part of
Democrats to challenge Bush on security matters as the administration
opens new, more uncertain fronts in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   One point of contention has emerged over Bush's request for a hefty
hike in the defense budget, which includes money for missile defense
systems and other weapons that skeptics say are not needed for the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The increasingly confrontational tone also reflects the political
pressures on Democrats as they struggle to balance their general support
for Bush's foreign and defense policies against the need to draw
distinctions between the two parties in the 2002 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself has signaled that the season for political combat has
arrived, as he has begun campaigning for Republican candidates around the
country--most recently his fund-raising appearance in North Carolina on
Wednesday for Senate contender Elizabeth Hanford Dole.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a frustration that as the election is clicking on, the base
of our party is getting ready to engage," said Michael Meehan, a top
Democratic political strategist. "We're ready to have a battle of
political ideas, and a lot of Democrats now are taking heart that we can
engage."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders have been walking a political tightrope for months,
as Bush's political standing has soared in the aftermath of his response
to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The administration's campaign in
Afghanistan to rout the Al Qaeda network--which is blamed for the
attacks--has enjoyed broad public support.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrating the national unity behind the U.S. military campaign,
Democrats initially refrained from any criticism of Bush. By year's end,
they ventured to criticize him on tax policy and other domestic issues,
while remaining forcefully with him on foreign matters.</TE>
<TE>   That has changed as the administration's war effort began to reach
beyond Afghanistan. In his State of the Union address, Bush identified
Iraq, North Korea and Iran as an "axis of evil." Daschle, among others,
criticized Bush for linking the three countries indiscriminately.</TE>
<TE>   In a television interview in early February, Daschle said: "It's
important for us to look at each of these countries . . . as problems
that we've got to address clearly, but I think we've got to be very
careful with the rhetoric of that kind."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, other Democrats have stepped up questions on other
defense matters. While Democrats in September abruptly dropped their
fight with Bush on his plans to pull out of the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty and build a missile defense system, many are now prepared to
resume these fights.</TE>
<TE>   And while many Democrats last fall seemed ready to approve any defense
budget increase proposed by Bush, they are more dubious now.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't provide a blank check," Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) said at a hearing Thursday on Bush's defense budget.
"Serious questions deserve to be asked."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the aim of the anti-terrorist mission intensified as
word came this week that the administration was expanding the U.S.
military presence in Georgia, in the former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to know what direction the war is going in and how do we
judge whether we have been successful or not," Rep. Charles B. Rangel
(D-N.Y.) said in a television interview Wednesday. "We as a nation do not
know what is going on and it is frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), in
an especially pointed comment at a hearing Wednesday, accused Pentagon
officials of "looking for opportunities to stay longer" in the region
rather than for ways to complete their mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we seem to be good at developing entrance strategies,
and not so good at developing exit strategies," Byrd said. "Where are we?
What's it going to cost? What's the endgame here?"</TE>
<TE>   No skeptic has gotten a harsher response than Daschle, who as the
Senate's leader has thwarted the administration on several domestic
initiatives and is seen as a potential challenger to Bush in 2004. His
comments Thursday were not as extensive as Byrd's, but Daschle endorsed
his line of skeptical questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he thought the success of the war had been overstated,
Daschle said no, but added, "The continued success I think is still
somewhat in doubt. . . . The jury's still out," given that Bin Laden and
several of his key allies have not yet been found.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have said eliminating
the Al Qaeda terrorist network is a central objective in the war on
terrorism, but they have taken pains not to make finding Bin Laden and
Omar among the goals that define success in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding Omar and Osama bin Laden would be nice," Rumsfeld said last
week while at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. But, he added, "There are
any number of people who could pick up for him and go on the next day and
manage that network and continue to commit terrorist acts. So it's a
mistake to personalize it and think of it in terms of just a single
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Several other congressional Republicans joined Lott in rebuking
Daschle for his comments.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas issued a one-word reaction:
"Disgusting." Rep. Thomas M. Davis of Virginia, chairman of the GOP House
campaign committee, accused Daschle of "giving aid and comfort to our
enemies." Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, chairman of another campaign
committee, termed Daschle's comments "thoughtless and ill-timed."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said members of
Congress had a right to criticize the administration's war effort. But,
he added, "when it comes to the defense of the nation, the president
surely hopes that nobody will vote to underfund our nation's defense
need."</TE>
<TE>   Nor could Fleischer resist an indirect swipe at Daschle: "Obviously,
there's going to be politics involved. Some people may want to run for
president one day."</TE>

<HD>White House Begins Reaching Out to Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Administration, which had supported Riordan, now neutral
in GOP race, Bush aide says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of quietly working to boost Richard Riordan's
campaign, the White House is now hedging its position by reaching out
through intermediaries to Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The effort comes as Riordan has slipped from a commanding lead in the
Republican contest to a dead-heat with Simon. The third major GOP
hopeful, Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running a distant third.</LD>
<LD>   The contacts between representatives of the White House and the
Republican National Committee and the Simon campaign are apparently an
effort by the Bush administration to compensate for months of ignoring
the suddenly surging candidate, according to sources familiar with the
efforts.</LD>
<TE>   "Having egg on their face, they're now frantically struggling to
regroup," said one Republican consultant with ties to both California and
the White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Since he lost the state in a landslide in 2000, Bush and his political
operatives have worked to assert greater control over California's
struggling Republican Party--while struggling to figure out the state's
political idiosyncrasies.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced Riordan's centrism and past success among Latinos was the
perfect antidote for a party burdened with an image of intolerance, the
president helped coax Riordan to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, White House operatives and their California allies have
worked behind the scenes in various ways to boost the former Los Angeles
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, the administration leaked advance word of a major
policy decision to Riordan, to give him an opportunity to claim credit.
Earlier this month, the White House and its proxies worked to quash a
straw poll at the state GOP convention, fearing that Riordan would be
embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   The effort backfired when word of the intervention became public;
Simon won handily after Riordan announced that he was pulling out of the
popularity contest.</TE>
<TE>   But as recent opinion polls showed Riordan slipping, the Bush
administration seemed to shift its posture.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a Washington lobbyist with political ties to the
White House approached Simon strategists to discuss a joint appearance
with the president after the primary, in either California or
Washington--assuming, of course, that Simon emerges as the nominee.</TE>
<TE>   The talks also involved post-primary financing and appearances in
California by national GOP luminaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House is already looking beyond Tuesday," said the GOP
consultant, who has discussed the campaign with senior White House
officials and members of the Riordan and Simon camps.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday night, Gerald Parsky--the president's chief
California emissary--denied any such discussions had taken place. He said
that the White House will be "very supportive" of the Republican nominee.
Until then, he said, the Bush administration is officially neutral.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign would not discuss any contacts it may have had with
the White House or its representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans are committed to beating Gray Davis and I think we're all
going to come together on Tuesday," said Sal Russo, chief strategist for
the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The behind-the-scenes maneuvering came as the three major Republican
gubernatorial candidates continued to fight it out in campaign
appearances across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Simon called for tax cuts as Riordan--in a sign of the fight he
suddenly faces--tried unsuccessfully to arrange a last-minute debate
todayin Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, meantime, took on Simon's marquee backer, former New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani, at a stop in Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   "With all due respect to Mayor Giuliani, in this post-Sept. 11 world,
voters want an experienced leader who can get straight to work solving
problems without having to conquer a steep learning curve," Jones said.
"Bill just doesn't have that experience."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a political neophyte making his first try for public office,
was also in the Central Valley. In Sacramento, he joined the president of
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. to file paperwork for a 2004 ballot
initiative that would at least triple the homeowner tax exemption.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, the proposed March 2004 measure would cost the state budget
$1.5 billion at a time when the state's legislative analyst predicts
billion-dollar deficits for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Simon did not say how he would pay for the cut, instead wrapping
himself in the mantle of the Jarvis group, a powerful anti-tax
organization that has already sent voters more than 4 million pieces of
mail pushing Simon in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate noted that he has been talking about keeping taxes low
throughout his campaign. "This is just definitive proof of how serious I
think this is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But under questioning by reporters, Simon acknowledged that he and his
wife gave $10,000 to the March 2000 campaign to pass Proposition 26. The
initiative, which lowered the proportion of votes needed to pass school
bond measures, was opposed by the Jarvis group.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he made the contrition at the urging of Riordan, a friend
at the time, after seeing the poor conditions at his son's school. 'It's
a difficult issue, it's a balancing act," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan had only one public event on his campaign schedule Thursday, a
lunchtime visit to an outdoor shopping mall in San Luis Obispo. Shortly
after reporters asked why the schedule was so light, the campaign
announced that it would open up a private evening fund-raiser outside San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Over a tri-tip steak sandwich and fries at the Firestone Grill,
Riordan reprised his criticisms of Simon for failing to vote in past
party primaries and registering as a political independent during the
1980s when he lived in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also continued emphasizing his conservative credentials,
citing his support for the death penalty, opposition to bilingual
education and 1986 efforts to oust Chief Justice Rose Bird from the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sudden tightness of the race, Riordan was in a joshing
mood. At Mondeo Pronto, an outdoor cafe, Riordan greeted Justin Woodward,
an 18-year-old Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student who told the candidate
that he hadn't registered to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, you could be executed for not voting," Riordan joked.</TE>
<TE>   More seriously, Riordan operatives scrambled unsuccessfully to set up
a candidate debate today on a West Los Angeles public affairs program. It
was a turnabout from earlier in the campaign, when Riordan was leading
and his campaign strategists insisted on a three-week buffer between
election day and the final debate on Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, however, it was Simon who balked. So Riordan, Simon and
Jones will make separate, back-to-back appearances on Adelphia Cable's
"Week in Review."</TE>

<HD>State Justices Uphold Juvenile Crime Law</HD>
<DH>Courts: Initiative that allows strict penalties and prosecutor
discretion to try minors as adults wins sweeping ruling.</DH>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the
constitutionality of a ballot measure that allows for stringent penalties
against teenagers who commit crimes and gives prosecutors unilateral
authority to decide whether certain teens should be tried as adults.</LD>
<LD>   In its sweeping ruling, the state high court rejected multi-pronged
attacks on Proposition 21, the juvenile justice measure overwhelming
passed by voters in March 2000. The 6-1 decision, which removes a legal
cloud over the measure, is expected to result in more juveniles accused
of felonies being tried as adults in California.</LD>
<LD>   An appellate court in San Diego last year had struck down a key
section of the law that gives prosecutors, instead of judges, sole
discretion to try certain juveniles as adults.</LD>
<TE>   Before Proposition 21's passage, judicial hearings were held to decide
whether some teens would be tried in the adult system. The emphasis in
the juvenile system is on rehabilitation and offenders must be released
by the time they turn 25. The appellate ruling prompted many prosecutors,
including the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, to let
judges again make the call.</TE>
<TE>   Although many prosecutors are now expected to exercise their newfound
charging power, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said his
office will continue to seek court hearings on offenders' fitness for
adult court except in "the worst of the worst" juvenile crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the California Supreme Court has upheld Proposition 21, we
will proceed cautiously as we use this law," said Cooley, who opposed the
ballot measure and whose office handles more juvenile cases than any
county in the state.</TE>
<TE>Justices Reject Claims of Unconstitutionality</TE>
<TE>   Groups including children's advocacy organizations, civil liberties
activists and even the California Teachers Assn. supported the challenge
of the law in the case before the state high court.</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, the court
rejected the San Diego appellate court ruling and other attacks on the
measure that could have wiped it off the books.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the proposition does not violate the state
Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by transferring judicial
authority to prosecutors because prosecutors traditionally have enjoyed
wide latitude in charging decisions for adults and juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor does not usurp any fundamental judicial power in
exercising such discretion," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The court also held that juveniles have no fundamental right to be
brought before a Juvenile Court and rejected a challenge that the measure
violated equal protection guarantees because charging decisions may vary
according to the inclinations of different prosecutors in different
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the court found that Proposition 21 complied with a state
constitutional requirement that initiatives cover only one subject.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 21 had provisions on gang activity and the sentencing of
repeat offenders in addition to the overhaul of the juvenile justice
system.</TE>
<TE>   The court, citing a federal finding that about 40% of all gang members
are under the age of 18, said juvenile crime and gang violence are
closely related.</TE>
<TE>   "The provisions of Proposition 21 that change laws regarding
gang-related crime and the juvenile justice system are reasonably germane
to each other and to the initiative's common purpose of addressing
violent crime committed by juveniles and gangs," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>Two in the Majority Sign Separate Opinions</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure added several crimes to a list of violent and
serious felonies that qualify as strikes under the "three strikes"
sentencing law, which increases punishment for repeat offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Among the crimes added as strikes was continuing sexual abuse of a
child, an offense more likely to be committed by adults than by
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "Although some of these crimes, at first blush, might not bear an
obvious relationship to juvenile or gang offenders, upon closer scrutiny
we can not properly conclude that they are not reasonably related to the
goal of the initiative," George wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling cited a report by the U.S. Department of Justice that found
sexual abuse by juveniles to be a serious and underreported problem.</TE>
<TE>   The multiplicity of the measure's provisions did not confuse voters
because ballot materials and a report by the Legislative Analyst clearly
spelled out what the law would do, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Justices Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos R. Moreno did not sign the
majority opinion. They agreed with the result but wrote separately to
distance themselves from the majority's analysis of the single-subject
rule for ballot initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Joyce Kennard dissented, arguing that judges, not prosecutors,
should determine whether minors are tried as adults.</TE>
<TE>   "The practical consequences are immense," Kennard wrote. "An adult
court may sentence a defendant to life imprisonment; a Juvenile Court
cannot impose confinement beyond the age of 25."</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley law professor Franklin E. Zimring, who challenged the
measure along with several other law professors, said the ruling appears
aimed at "making sure enemies of Proposition 21 don't show up again in
the California Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   "They are saying, 'Folks, the last thing we want to see is another
Proposition 21 challenge,' " said Zimring, who specializes in criminal
law and juvenile justice. "This was designed as a door-closing exercise
and will doubtless succeed as one."</TE>
<TE>   But other lawyers in the case said the complex law is certain to
generate more litigation.</TE>
<TE>'Furtherance of Justice' Note Gives Defense Hope</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys took heart in a footnote to the ruling that
suggested the court has yet to decide whether a Superior Court judge can
dismiss charges against a juvenile "in furtherance of justice" or impose
a juvenile term even if the teenager is tried as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   William La Fond, who represented one of the defendants in the case
before the court, said that possibility means there may be a "safety
valve" remaining for young offenders. The court did not decide the issue
because it was not raised in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in the prosecution of eight minors from an affluent
San Diego neighborhood who allegedly chased and beat five Mexican
migrants in 2000. The youths, aged 14 to 17 at the time, used ethnic
slurs against the victims, four of whom were in their sixties,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Dist. Atty. Paul F. Pfingst said the defendants will be
arraigned and charged as adults as a result of Thursday's ruling in
Manduley v. Superior Court, S095992.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said he believes that judges will continue to have the right
to dismiss charges against juvenile offenders but will be required to
impose adult sentences when minors are convicted as adults.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the ruling will not be large in terms of numbers "but
most of the cases that are impacted are very important," Pfingst said.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of 15 states that vest prosecutors with the power to
decide whether a minor will be tried in juvenile or adult court,
according to the Pittsburgh-based National Center for Juvenile Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike California, most states, including New York and Pennsylvania,
still permit judges to return a case to Juvenile Court based on a review
of the evidence and the minor's criminal history, experts said.</TE>
<TE>Some States Revisit Laws as Juvenile Crime Plunges</TE>
<TE>   A dramatic decline in juvenile crime that began in the mid-1990s has
persuaded lawmakers in several states to revisit laws toughening
penalties against minors, the experts said. The drop in crime includes a
murder rate that is as low as it was in the 1960s, according to the
national center.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Schwartz, director of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia,
said the recent juvenile justice laws have "ruined the life chances of
thousands of teens."</TE>
<TE>   "The studies are showing that kids who come out of the adult system
are not only brutalized but come out and commit offenses that occur
sooner, are more serious and are more frequent than those coming out of
the juvenile justice system," said Schwartz, whose group filed a legal
brief against the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hobson, a lawyer for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
group that supports Proposition 21, said the ruling "recognizes that
prosecutors always have the right to make the charging and venue
decisions in criminal cases."</TE>
<TE>   "When they adopted Proposition 21, California voters made a choice to
give our elected district attorneys the right to separate the violent,
hard-core criminals from the young, entry-level offenders the juvenile
justice system was created to deal with," Hobson said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys in the San Diego case said they have not yet decided
whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very disappointed with the Manduley decision and are exploring
every option to overturn this ruling," said Deputy Public Defender Jo
Pastore and two colleagues in a written statement. "Proposition 21 is not
in the best interest of the people of the state of California and it does
not promote the purpose of our juvenile justice system."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Public Defender Michael Judge said Thursday's ruling
"eliminates an important check and balance on the power of prosecutors."</TE>
<TE>   "Institutionally we all know that when there is unbridled discretion,
there are going to be cases of clear-cut abuse," Judge said.</TE>

<HD>Party Is Over for Insiders</HD>
<DH>In Silicon Valley, stock tips were handed out like party favors,
but a new crackdown has tech workers trying to recall what they did.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>After Nvidia Corp. won a lucrative contract from Microsoft Corp.,
the electronic game developer's future seemed assured.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as 11 Nvidia employees heard the secret news, securities
regulators say, they called their brokers and tried to sweeten their
prospects.</LD>
<LD>   The employees, along with four friends and relatives they allegedly
tipped off, are accused of making a total of $1.7 million in illegal
profit over the course of a week in March 2000. Four of the accused have
settled with the government.</LD>
<TE>   "It's unusual; it looks kind of funny," said Michael Hara, Nvidia's
director of investor relations. "Hard to argue with that."</TE>
<TE>   The really funny thing is that insider trading appears to be pretty
routine in Silicon Valley. The late-'90s technology boom sparked stock
speculation across the nation, but nowhere was the fever more intense
than on this peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The official propaganda was that no one was here for the money, but in
reality "just about everyone was cashing in, and you didn't want to be
stupid by missing the opportunity," said Randy Komisar, author of "The
Monk and the Riddle," a critical look at entrepreneurial culture.</TE>
<TE>   Inside tips were passed around like party favors. One prominent
fund-raiser recalls being in a meeting with a prospective donor and
hearing the executive say his company would be the subject of a friendly
takeover bid the next week. It was an open invitation to make a few bucks
on the side, said the fund-raiser, who asked to be anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   The avarice was fueled by the fact that Silicon Valley was
geographically and spiritually a long way from the regulators in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Silicon Valley thinks that the Securities and Exchange Commission's
jurisdiction ends at the Sierra Nevada," said Scott Rafer, a tech
consultant who is a former New York investment bank analyst. "A lot of
valley execs simply don't understand that trading on inside information
is illegal."</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, regulators didn't do much to change that
understanding. Before Robert Mueller was named U.S. attorney here in late
1999, "the office was an embarrassment," one local lawyer said. "It was
viewed as a place where assistant U.S. attorneys were happily put out to
pasture."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller created a seven-member securities fraud team before becoming
FBI director last fall. The local SEC office, meanwhile, staffed up from
19 to 26 accountants and lawyers. The effect can be measured: Of the 11
high-tech insider trading cases brought nationwide in 2001, five were
prosecuted here.</TE>
<TE>   Recent settlements include cases brought against a law firm partner,
the husband of a prominent public relations executive, a vice president
for sales at an e-mail software company and an investor who was casually
dating a second-year associate at a prominent law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who had good jobs," said Helane Morrison, district
administrator for the SEC. "It's not need, it's greed."</TE>
<TE>   A case in point would be Malcolm Wittenberg, until recently a partner
at law firm Crosby, Heafey, Roach &amp; May. On Aug. 16, 1999, Wittenberg was
asked to work on a deal in which Sun Microsystems Inc. would buy Forte
Software, a Crosby Heafey client.</TE>
<TE>   While the deal was being secretly negotiated, Wittenberg bought 2,000
shares of Forte stock. When the deal became public Aug. 23, the price of
Forte shares spiked. Wittenberg's profit: $14,000. It's a sizable chunk
of change for most people, but not for a lawyer making half a million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not thinking clearly," Wittenberg told the SEC. He must have
thought either that he wouldn't get caught or that at most he'd get a
quiet slap on the wrist. That's how first-time insider trading offenders
traditionally were treated, especially if the amounts involved were small
and the defendant was an upstanding member of the community.</TE>
<TE>   It therefore sent a tremor through legal circles when not only did the
SEC file civil charges against Wittenberg, but also the U.S. attorney's
new securities team filed criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Wittenberg pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading. He settled
with the SEC by forfeiting his $14,000 profit and paying another $14,000
in fines. The State Bar of California placed him on interim suspension.</TE>
<TE>   In December, a San Francisco judge sentenced Wittenberg to one month
in a halfway house, three months of home detention and a $10,000 fine. He
won't have any problem paying, because he has a new job with intellectual
property firm Dergosits &amp; Noah for a reported $240,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors, who sought a four-month jail sentence, weren't
completely successful in making an example of Wittenberg, they at least
succeeded in raising the fear level.</TE>
<TE>Fuzzy Memories</TE>
<TE>   Like revelers after a wild party, the inhabitants of Silicon Valley
are struggling to remember just what they did, and whether there's any
evidence. The statute of limitations for insider trading is five years,
which encompasses the height of the boom. And insider trading is just as
illegal when executives use their privileged information to cut their
losses by selling shares.</TE>
<TE>   Crosby Heafey, based in Oakland, does not have a major Silicon Valley
presence. That, according to managing partner Kurt Peterson, has only
increased the unease.</TE>
<TE>   "I have definitely heard the sentiment that, if they came after this
guy at Crosby, a lot of people at the big Silicon Valley high-tech firms
are really thinking back to what they've been up to," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Insider trading often can be murky. The most clear-cut cases are those
such as Wittenberg's, in which a lawyer or other corporate executive who
has material nonpublic information uses it to buy or sell stock. This
violates his duty to the company and its shareholders by placing his
interest above theirs.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the scope of insider trading was widened under the
so-called misappropriation theory, which holds that even those who are
not employees of the company in question can be guilty if they breached a
trust or confidence. In one misappropriation case, the SEC pursued
charges against a psychiatrist who had learned confidential information
from a patient who was the wife of the president of American Express. The
psychiatrist was found guilty, and his conviction was upheld by an
appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Such an expansive definition means insider trading is almost certainly
the most common form of securities fraud. Yet it's impossible to get a
handle on how widespread it is. For one thing, there are no individual
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost certain that 99% of cases go undetected and certainly
unprosecuted," UCLA law professor Stephen Bainbridge said.</TE>
<TE>   But those few that become public tend to be very revealing, said
Bainbridge, author of a textbook on insider trading. "A lot of cases
would make interesting novels. The way that greed causes people to do
things that they know are wrong and are very often stupid never fails to
surprise me."</TE>
<TE>   One case that seems to fall into that category began Friday, Oct. 15,
1999, when Maureen Blanc phoned her husband, George Brandt, and said she
would be working late.</TE>
<TE>   Blanc, a co-founder of public relations powerhouse Blanc &amp; Otus, told
Brandt that one of her clients, software firm Clarify Inc., was being
acquired by Nortel Networks Corp. in a deal that would be announced after
the close of trading Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my husband about what goes on in my life," Blanc said in an
interview. "I tell him about a lot of things." She warned Brandt that
this news was confidential. According to SEC documents, he expressly
agreed not to purchase Clarify stock. Nevertheless, on Monday he bought
600 shares, making a quick profit of $12,750.</TE>
<TE>   Blanc, using a defense that Wittenberg also tried, said the amount of
money earned was so small as to be "insignificant." She noted that her
husband, a writer of mystery novels, was well-off.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly he didn't do it for the money," Blanc said. "He was naive.
This was not premeditated." Through his lawyer, Brandt declined to be
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Sued for insider trading by the SEC, Brandt settled the case by paying
the government his profit and another $12,750 in penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Such settlements, in which the individual pays restitution and a fine
but does not admit wrongdoing, are the typical resolution in insider
trading cases. Occasionally, though, cases go to court, and sometimes the
government loses.</TE>
<TE>   That happened with Keith J. Kim, an Oakland venture capitalist who was
a member of the Young Presidents' Organization, a group of businessmen
younger than 50. Kim was a passenger on a private plane taking YPO
members to a retreat. Over the intercom, it was announced that one member
would not be attending because his company, Meridian Data, was being
bought by Quantum Corp.</TE>
<TE>   When Kim got off the plane, he bought 187,300 shares of Meridian
stock, earning a profit of $832,877 when the deal was announced.</TE>
<TE>   But is merely being a member of a fraternal organization enough to
qualify for insider trading status? In this case, U.S. District Judge
Charles Breyer decided late last year that the misappropriation theory
had its limits.</TE>
<TE>   "While members of a club may feel a special bond, there is nothing so
special about their relationship . . . that it gives rise to a legal duty
not to trade on confidential information," Breyer concluded, saying Kim
would not have to face two counts of securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>A Slip of the E-Mail</TE>
<TE>   The government was more successful in an earlier case against a Nvidia
engineer named Manu Shrivastava. He pleaded guilty in federal court and
was sentenced to one year of home detention. He forfeited his $446,000
profit and was ordered in December to pay a fine of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   That case, like the more recent cases of the 11 Nvidia employees and
four friends and relatives, developed from an e-mail that the Santa
Clara, Calif., company's chief executive sent the firm's 350 employees
late on a Sunday night, March 5, 2000. The e-mail said Nvidia had won a
contract potentially worth $2 billion to make a graphics processor for
Microsoft's video game console, the Xbox. A follow-up e-mail the next
morning from the company's vice president of marketing, titled "xbox
shhhhhh . . . " reminded everyone "to keep the news quiet. Not a word to
anyone outside our walls."</TE>
<TE>   That Monday, Nvidia stock closed at $58.50. On Friday, before the
market opened, Microsoft announced it had awarded the contract to Nvidia.
The stock rose as high as $145 before closing at $118.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not as black and white as the SEC's press releases would have
you think," said investor relations director Hara.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he said, it was possible the employees had planned to
buy stock that Monday before they heard about the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison, the SEC administrator, dismissed that argument. "We believe
that the people we sued used the hot inside information they learned from
the chief executive's e-mail, which makes their trading illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the defendants also were indicted on criminal charges; two of
those pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. The trial of a third
defendant began this week. The nine Nvidia employees who maintain their
innocence have been placed on six-month leaves of absence, with pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard for them to focus on their work if they're worrying
about how to defend themselves," Hara said. "We wish these people the
best of luck."</TE>

<HD>NATO Raid Fails to Net Bosnian Serb</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Peacekeepers storm two villages in search of Radovan
Karadzic, indicted in 1995 by U.N. tribunal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>NATO-led peacekeepers staged a dramatic helicopter raid on two
remote mountain villages Thursday but failed to capture Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted on war crimes charges by a U.N.
tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   The raid began when four helicopters landed near the southern Bosnian
village of Celebici. Black-masked soldiers stormed out to search houses
and other buildings, breaking through locks or doors when necessary,
local residents told reporters who later visited the scene.</LD>
<LD>   As they demanded entry to homes, the soldiers distributed leaflets
that carried a message in Serbian: "Don't be afraid. It's a routine
check." Soldiers also broke into shops, locked apartments and a church,
sometimes using explosives or firing bullets into locks.</LD>
<TE>   At least 40 troops from several countries participated. A soldier was
reported slightly injured by one of the explosive blasts. Three weapons
caches were found during the raid, but there was no resistance and no
other injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The raid was the first publicly known effort to arrest Karadzic, who
was indicted in 1995 on charges of genocide and other war crimes during
the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He has been in hiding since 1996 and now tops
the tribunal's list of most-wanted suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "Karadzic was not found at this location," NATO said in a statement
issued at its headquarters in Brussels. "However, this operation
demonstrates SFOR's capabilities and resolve to act in apprehending, by
force if necessary, persons indicted for war crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Fear of casualties is widely seen as a key reason the peacekeeping
force in Bosnia, known as SFOR, has not acted more aggressively to locate
and arrest Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   There has also been speculation that his arrest could trigger
anti-Western violence in Serb-dominated areas of Bosnia, where far more
people consider him a hero than a criminal. In Celebici, a poster could
be seen Thursday with a photograph of Karadzic and the words "Don't Touch
Him."</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia has a complicated system of elected leadership, but ultimate
power rests with an international administration and an about
16,000-member international peacekeeping force set up by the 1995 Dayton
accords that ended the war.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Karadzic responded to the raid's failure by virtually
taunting SFOR.</TE>
<TE>   One of Karadzic's brothers, Raco, said Thursday that Karadzic is at "a
safe place" and is "healthy and well," Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news
agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Jovan Zametica, a former key advisor to Karadzic, told Belgrade's
independent Fonet news agency that "SFOR certainly doesn't know where
Radovan Karadzic's hide-out is, and there is no danger at all for him."</TE>
<TE>   The aim of Thursday's raid "was probably to test reaction of the
population" to an arrest effort, rather than being a serious attempt to
capture Karadzic, Zametica said.</TE>
<TE>   Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, were indicted by
the tribunal for the siege of Sarajevo and a 1995 massacre of thousands
of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica. They were allies of former Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who is now on trial at the tribunal in The
Hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity in Bosnia,
Croatia and Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main
republic.</TE>
<TE>   Karadzic is believed to be hiding in the general area of Thursday's
raid, protected by armed guards. Mladic is thought to be in Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent reaction to the arrest attempt, four shots were fired
at a building of the United Nations' International Police Task Force in
Bijeljina, in northeastern Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated part of
Bosnia, according to a report by Belgrade's independent B-92 Radio. There
were no other immediate reports of violent reactions.</TE>
<TE>   SFOR reported finding anti-tank rockets, mortar shells, grenades,
machine guns and antipersonnel mines in the raid, which also involved
searches in the nearby village of Jecmenovo. The raid was conducted based
on an anonymous tip, SFOR said.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnian Serb television reported the sounds of gunfire and explosions
during the raid. Roads toward Celebici were blocked Thursday morning, and
NATO helicopters were seen leaving Mostar airport, about 50 miles from
Celebici.</TE>
<TE>   Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor for the Hague tribunal, has bitterly
criticized the failure of authorities to find and arrest Karadzic and
Mladic. In a visit to the region last month, she said it was certain that
Karadzic was in the Serbian part of Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnian Serb leaders have sought to project a more moderate image in
recent months. The party founded by Karadzic, the Serbian Democratic
Party, expelled him and all other war crimes suspects in December. But
the sincerity of the efforts has been widely questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the raid by Bosnian Serb leaders was sharply negative,
with several arguing that they should have been informed in advance of
the SFOR action, despite the risk that someone might tip off Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impermissible that such an operation take place without the
knowledge of any institution of Republika Srpska," said Mladen Ivanic,
the Serb entity's prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   "One cannot expect that institutions of Republika Srpska will
cooperate with the Hague tribunal while at the same time there is no
cooperation of international institutions with Republika Srpska," Ivanic
said. "That means there is distrust toward us, and then we do not have a
single reason to trust the other side."</TE>

<HD>World Is Quickly Going Gray, U.N. Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Aging: 10% of people are now over 60, but by 2050, 20% will be. The
trend reflects medical advances but also spells challenges for many
governments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Feeling old? You're not alone. The whole world is getting older--a
lot older, at a pace that has taken demographers by surprise and
presented governments with economic and social challenges, the U.N.
reported in a global aging study released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   About 10% of the world's population is now over 60, and by mid-century
that will double--marking the first time that group will outnumber
children. "This is unprecedented in human history," said Joseph Chamie,
director of the U.N. Population Division, who supervised the study.</LD>
<LD>   The trend is most acute in advanced industrial nations, where the
working-age population is shrinking as the number of older citizens
steadily increases--a development with "profound implications," Chamie
noted, in a world where fewer and fewer workers will be supporting more
and more older dependents.</LD>
<TE>   Yet ultimately, U.N. experts stress, these statistics depict a medical
and socioeconomic triumph. In much of the world, increasing longevity has
been matched by radically declining fertility and infant mortality rates.
Women choose the timing and frequency of childbirth in the confident
expectation that their infants will thrive.</TE>
<TE>   The Malthusian specter of exponential population growth has evaporated
as developed nations confront the reverse demographics of population
implosion. An aging population is a byproduct of literacy and prosperity,
statistics clearly show.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great news: We are getting greater control over birth and
death," Chamie told reporters Thursday as he detailed the study's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan and Italy--now the two "oldest" countries, with a median age
above 40 and climbing--nearly a quarter of the population is already over
60, and that will pass 40% by 2050, the U.N. projects.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. experts say these countries aren't the demographic anomalies
they were once thought to be: They are simply ahead of the population
curve. Nations where the 60-plus population is also expected to swell to
about 40% in half a century include Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Greece,
Sweden, Bulgaria, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Armenia.</TE>
<TE>   Most other developed countries aren't far behind. The exceptions are
nations with many young immigrants--led by the United States, where the
16% of the population now over 60 is expected to rise to 27% by 2050.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, the number of people age 60 and up will more than triple to
1.96 billion in the next 50 years, according to U.N. forecasts,
representing fully a fifth of the world's predicted population.</TE>
<TE>   Even in places where the median age is extraordinarily young--in most
of Africa and the Middle East, just 5% of the population is over 60--U.N.
demographers predict similarly stunning shifts in a generation or two.</TE>
<TE>   Most striking of all, perhaps, is the expected rapid growth in the
population of those 80 and up, nearly two-thirds of whom are women.
Centenarians, once revered anomalies, now number about 210,000. By 2050,
there will be 3.2 million people 100 or older, the U.N. estimates.</TE>
<TE>   This boom in retirees will produce economic strains as the group is
supported either directly by families or indirectly through taxes. Today
there are nine people of working age--defined by the U.N. as 15 through
65--for every older person. That ratio will shrink to 4 to 1 in 50 years,
the U.N. says. And in industrial nations, where the ratio has already
dropped to 5 to 1, there will be just two working-age people for every
senior citizen by 2050.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, as has already been seen in precincts from Florida to
Florence to the foothills of Mt. Fuji, this sets the stage for conflicts
over funding for social security and health care on the one hand, and
schooling and unemployment benefits on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be changes in electoral patterns generally," Chamie said.
"A person who is 25 has a very different outlook on life than someone who
is 65."</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, there will be increasing pressure to raise the retirement
age, now 65 in most industrial nations, but just 60 in France and much of
Eastern Europe. (In Asia and Africa, mandatory retirement at 50 is not
uncommon. Yet the law means little when social safety nets are handmade:
74% of elderly men and 42% of elderly women in the poorest nations are
still active members of the work force, in contrast to 21% and 10%,
respectively, in the industrialized world.)</TE>
<TE>   The aging phenomenon has been accelerated by radically changing social
mores. Mediterranean Europe, where Catholicism has long dominated, is now
the slowest-growing region on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   In Scandinavia, as many as 40% of the women of childbearing age are
childless and are expected to remain so, Chamie said. Birthrates are
plunging equally dramatically in places as different as Quebec and Hong
Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about a transformation in the population age
structure," Chamie said. "The pace is much faster than we anticipated in
the past. And the implications of the consequences are becoming much more
evident."</TE>

<HD>Scrap War Crime Tribunals by '08, White House Says</HD>
<DH>Justice: Official calls U.N. courts inefficient. Administration
fears that future trials could threaten U.S. sovereignty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Even as a U.N. war crimes tribunal pressed ahead with the trial of
former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the Bush administration
Thursday denounced such courts as wasteful and mismanaged, and urged
their abolition by 2008.</LD>
<LD>   In congressional testimony, State Department official Pierre-Richard
Prosper cited problems "that challenge the integrity of the process" and
raise questions about "the professionalism of the personnel."</LD>
<LD>   He said the tribunals should "aggressively focus on the endgame and
conclude their work by 2007-2008."</LD>
<TE>   Washington's opposition to the tribunals, which are prosecuting cases
from the Balkans and Rwanda, and to a permanent international criminal
court that comes into being in August has become another source of
complaints from U.S. allies about the administration's rejection of
international institutions.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. governments have supported such court proceedings since the
Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. The trials of the ousted Yugoslav
strongman and the former Rwandan leaders, who stand accused in their
country's 1994 genocide, were organized with U.S. leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the U.N. tribunals criticized the administration for
taking on the courts at the moment they have achieved what is arguably
their greatest success: the first war crimes trial of a head of state.
The U.S. challenge, they said, could strengthen Milosevic's claims that
the U.N. trials are a highly politicized victor's justice.</TE>
<TE>   William Pace, who heads a group that supports the permanent
International Criminal Court, said the timing of the administration's
attack suggests that officials are laying the groundwork for a campaign
to discredit the new international forum.</TE>
<TE>   Citing America's sponsorship of a string of past war crimes trials, he
said U.S. officials "know better than anyone that in failed states and
rogue states, the only alternative to no justice is international
justice. . . . After 45 or 50 years of supporting tribunals, this is a
policy in favor of impunity" for the world's Hitlers and Pol Pots.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush administration officials fear that such courts can infringe
on U.S. sovereignty. In particular, they worry that U.S. military
officials might one day be put in the dock for alleged crimes committed
during overseas deployments. The administration argues that such
tribunals create a dangerous dependency on international institutions and
that defendants should be treated instead by national legal systems.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the U.N. war crimes tribunals have been wastefully
expensive, poorly supervised and abused by some of the lawyers and
defendants for their own enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   The tribunals set up in the Netherlands and Tanzania have each cost
about $100 million a year. In both, there have been allegations that some
defense lawyers inflated their bills and divided the proceeds with their
clients.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also have suggested that Carla del Ponte, the chief
prosecutor at The Hague, shouldn't press ahead with her plans to indict
dozens more Balkans war figures, because doing so would cause the trials
to drag on too long. They believe lower-level defendants should be tried
in national courts.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's Prosper, who prosecuted crimes from the Rwanda
war, said that the process "at times has been too costly, has lacked
efficiency, has been too slow and has been too removed from the everyday
experience of the people and the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Even as the administration was criticizing the U.N. tribunals, it
raised the possibility that the United States might support formation of
some ad hoc tribunal to handle a man it considers one of the world's
leading war criminals, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Prosper said aides are compiling evidence of war crimes by Hussein and
considering what kind of forum might be best for handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely will be looking for some sort of mechanism," he said.
"We do believe that Saddam Hussein and his top lieutenants need to be
held answerable for their actions."</TE>

<HD>Colombia Drug War Gains Disputed</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Officials report a drop in coca crop acreage, while
the CIA says the figure rose again last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The amount of cocaine being produced in Colombia dropped
significantly last year, anti-narcotics officials announced Thursday,
making a controversial claim to success in the joint U.S.-Colombia drug
war.</LD>
<LD>   An aggressive U.S.-backed fumigation program resulted in the
elimination of about 46,000 acres of coca plants, the source of cocaine,
according to a detailed satellite analysis performed under U.N. and
Colombian auspices. That would be an 11% decline.</LD>
<LD>   Stepped-up attacks against drug-processing labs and programs with
local farmers to uproot coca crops cut by a third the country's annual
production of nearly 640 tons of cocaine, the officials estimated.</LD>
<TE>   "The reduction in the areas under cultivation is a clear demonstration
of the success of the eradication program," Justice Minister Romulo
Gonzalez said in a meeting with reporters here Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian police numbers are backed up by a State Department
analysis that found that coca cultivation peaked in Colombia around 1997,
at nearly 500,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers have been declining since then but dropped sharply last
year as the spraying program wiped out about 191,000 acres of the plants,
mostly in Putumayo and Caqueta, in southern Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Coca growers replanted many of those crops, leading to a net reduction
of about 74,000 acres. A third analysis, by the U.S. Army, found the
spraying highly effective, destroying most of the coca crops in fumigated
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We have confidence in Colombia National Police figures that indicate
that there has been a net reduction in coca acreage in Colombia," said a
U.S. government official involved in the eradication program.</TE>
<TE>   But a CIA analysis, expected to be released today, will show the
opposite of the Colombian figures, sources said: a massive increase in
the amount of coca cultivated between 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA numbers are expected to show that Colombia's coca growth
jumped for the seventh straight time, from 336,000 acres in 2000 to
417,000 acres in 2001--enough to produce 800 tons of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian drug officials dismissed the reports of the increase and
said they were prepared to defend their estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "Our figures correspond to the truth," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   The new numbers are likely to continue a controversy over the White
House's drug policy in Colombia, which produces 90% of the cocaine
consumed in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   They also offer a possible bright spot after Colombia's internal
conflict widened this month as peace talks collapsed. The government
declared a large southern swath of the country a war zone where the army
had near total control to combat leftist rebels.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, the U.S. has pursued its eradication program
through Plan Colombia, providing nearly $2 billion to the country and
surrounding regions in an effort to halve cocaine production by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that money was used to hire a private contractor,
Virginia-based DynCorp, to fly crop dusters over Colombia's vast coca
fields. Colombia now has more such planes flying more missions than at
any time in its history.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that by drastically reducing the supply of drugs, the
price of cocaine on U.S. streets will soar and availability will drop,
making the drug much less attractive.</TE>
<TE>   After a year of spraying, the central question is the effectiveness of
the fumigation program: How many acres of coca have been wiped out and
how has the price of cocaine changed in the U.S.?</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, what matters is price and availability," said a second
U.S. official with knowledge of the fumigation program.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of coca fumigated in Colombia has become the subject of
intense debate.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA numbers, compiled by the Crime and Narcotics Center, have long
been the standard for measuring coca growing in the Andes. But some
involved in the fumigation program worry that the numbers are skewing the
debate, saying the agency has long underestimated the amount of Colombian
coca.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the perceived increases in cultivation are instead coca crops
that have long been there but are only now being discovered, critics say.
The CIA analyzes only a small portion of the country, using images from
high-resolution satellites, then projects data for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   That's in contrast to the Colombian system, which analyzes satellite
photos of the entire country, though of a lower resolution. The State
Department, in turn, bases its analysis on high-resolution images taken
from a plane, then backs it up with ground visits.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very hard to believe that there has been a major increase
in coca cultivation after a full year of spraying on an unprecedented
scale," said the first U.S. government official.</TE>
<TE>   The picture is further obscured by the regional outlook. Though most
of the analyses indicate a drop in coca production in Colombia, CIA
figures from last year showed that the total amount of coca in the Andes
stayed constant.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there are already signs of an upturn in coca cultivation in
Peru as Colombia has cracked down.</TE>
<TE>   "Fumigation can move coca growth. But it can't remove it from a whole
continent," said Adam Isacson of the Center for International Policy, a
Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   To muddy things further, there is also conflict over the end result:
prices on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Drug Enforcement Administration statistics from December show little
or no change in the street price of cocaine in major cities such as Los
Angeles and Chicago, comparing June 2000 to December 2001. In some
places, the price dropped.</TE>
<TE>   But a recent study by the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy found that nationwide, the cost for a street user to obtain a gram
of pure cocaine had risen sharply over the year, from about $175 a gram
to more than $225 a gram by mid-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Even given the price increase, there are still no signs of a
significant drop in the number of people who use cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "If people need to spend more to get the same amount, they will," said
Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a group
that favors the legalization of marijuana.</TE>

<LD>Japan plans to double its whale catch in the northwest Pacific and
begin hunting a type of whale it has left alone for years, a government
official said, rebuffing international criticism.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty sei whales will be caught during the June-October season as part
of Japan's whale research program, said Takanori Ohashi of the nation's
Fisheries Agency. Critics say Japan's program is commercial whaling,
which was banned in 1987.</LD>
<LD>   Japan will hunt 150 minke, 50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales as well as
the sei whales, Ohashi said.</LD>

<HD>Muslim Area Attacked by Hindu Mobs; 158 Killed</HD>
<DH>India: Rioters set fire to homes in response to a deadly attack on
a train. The government sends in the army.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AHMADABAD, India
</DL>
<LD>Angry Hindus set fire to homes in a shantytown in western India's
Gujarat state today, killing at least 27 Muslims as they slept, police
said. The blaze brought the death toll from a series of attacks to at
least 158.</LD>
<LD>   At least 76 people died in attacks Thursday when Hindu rioters stormed
a Muslim neighborhood. Homes were set ablaze, and rioters kept
firefighters away for hours. The attacks were launched in revenge for a
Muslim assault on a train Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In today's attack in Narora, on the outskirts of Ahmadabad, about 300
Hindus set fire to a Muslim-dominated shantytown in an industrial area
about 2 a.m., Deputy Police Commissioner P.B. Gondya said.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, police had appeared outnumbered or unwilling to act to
quell what appeared to be the worst rioting to hit the country in nearly
a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The officers stood in bunches, watching as groups of Hindus wielding
iron rods and cans of gasoline or kerosene roamed Ahmadabad attacking
Muslims in their homes, shops and vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, the federal government sent nearly 1,000 soldiers to
Ahmadabad, the main city in the area.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's worst attack, 38 people, including 12 children, died
when about 2,000 Hindus set fire to six homes in an affluent Muslim
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped residents made frantic phone calls to police and firefighters.
But police said they arrived two hours later, and firefighters were
delayed more than six hours because of blockades by rioters.</TE>
<TE>   A former lawmaker, Ehsan Jefri, fired at the rioters when they tried
to enter his house, but he was dragged out and burned alive.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Ahmadabad, rioters pulled a Muslim truck driver out of
his vehicle and killed him at a roadblock, police said. Other Hindus made
bonfires with goods looted from shops, and 20 men tore down a small
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   In a few instances, police opened fire on rioters, killing two and
wounding six in Ahmadabad and two other towns, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The violence came in retaliation for an attack Wednesday in Godhra, a
town south of Ahmadabad, where Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindu
nationalists, killing at least 58 people.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions have been growing between Muslims and Hindu nationalists who
have been using the train to travel to and from Ayodhya, in northern
India, where the World Hindu Council plans to start building a temple
next month on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The 1992 destruction of the mosque by Hindus sparked nationwide riots
that killed 2,000 people. The government has called for calm, fearing
bloodshed could spread quickly in this nation of more than 1 billion,
where Hindu-Muslim fighting killed nearly a million people after
independence in 1947. India is majority Hindu, but about 12% of its
people are Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   This week's violence is believed to be the worst Hindu-Muslim fighting
since 1993 riots in Bombay, also related to the destruction of the
Ayodhya mosque, killed at least 800 people.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Recovery Fires Up Demand for Brick-Making</HD>
<DH>Asia: With Kabul's government-owned yard destroyed by war, smaller
operations are thriving. 'We never stop working,' one man says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Kabul is built of dirt. Squat little homes of mud and clay have
been carved from the bare brown hills that ring the city, and vast adobe
slums have risen from the earth itself.</LD>
<LD>   The building blocks of the capital are pale tan bricks of dirt and
clay. They are cut from the ground and fired in hundreds of earthen kilns
that look like huge, prehistoric anthills belching pungent black smoke.</LD>
<LD>   War and reconstruction have been good to the men who earn their living
in the brutish work of brick-making. With Kabul's government-owned
brickyard destroyed by war, hundreds of smaller operations are thriving
as Afghanistan's rebuilding effort stokes an insatiable demand for
bricks.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, we never stop working, day and night, always. We sleep here,"
said Ghulam Farouk, bringing an ax crashing down on a tree stump he was
cutting up to feed the roaring blaze inside his kiln on the capital's
southern shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Since Taliban forces were routed here more than three months ago,
Kabul's brick makers have struggled to keep up with efforts to rebuild
businesses, government offices, private homes and public works. The
demand has more than doubled from a year ago, said Mohammed Musa, a
wholesaler.</TE>
<TE>   The government brickyard produced 24,000 bricks a day before it was
destroyed, Musa said. Now the demand in Kabul alone is for 500,000 to
600,000 bricks a day. More than 400 small, family-owned yards are rushing
to fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   The Dash-e-Zikria brickyard was running on full throttle the other
day. Farouk and his brother, kiln owner Ghulam Zikria, were frantically
chopping wood to keep the fire hot enough to produce quality bricks. A
mountain of logs twice an adult's height was shrinking as fireman Abdul
Ali stuffed one log after another into the belly of the kiln, where the
wood disintegrated in a spray of red and orange flame.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the brothers said, their kiln was often idle. They sold
perhaps 1,000 bricks every two or three weeks and shut down during the
winter. Now, they said, they are selling 3,000 bricks a day, with fresh
orders arriving daily. They intend to work year-round.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, it wasn't safe to rebuild because of the fighting. It wasn't
even safe to be out here making bricks," Zikria said.</TE>
<TE>   The kiln was built from fire-honed bricks by the brothers' grandfather
50 years ago. It is wide at the base, tapering into a tall cone at the
top, where the kiln juts from a muddy embankment. Cracks are plastered
over with a mixture of mud, clay and straw. Smoke is channeled through a
chimney at the crown of the kiln.</TE>
<TE>   The Dai Khudaida district of southern Kabul is a moonscape, a treeless
expanse of hard-packed clay dotted with tall kilns and pocked with pits
from which the brick men shovel out the clay and mud that form the walls
of the city's buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Making bricks is punishing, filthy, backbreaking work. There are no
machines, only sweat and muscle. The clay and mud is packed into wooden
frames of six bricks, each the size of a standard brick used in U.S.
construction. The frames are stacked in the kilns, whose capacities range
from 110,000 to 150,000 bricks per firing.</TE>
<TE>   It is a long, tedious process: 24 days pass from the time the wet clay
and soil is cut to the moment the first hard-fired bricks are fished out
of the kiln.</TE>
<TE>   The molds are placed in the kiln on a bed of marmar, a hard gray rock
delivered from nearby mountains. When fired, the rock produces a chalk
that is used in paints and plaster. It takes six days to load a kiln with
marmar and thousands of wet bricks.</TE>
<TE>   The kiln is fired for six days, allowed to cool for six days, then
fired for another six days. It takes almost a week to unload the bricks
and stack them in 1,000-brick loads that sell for the equivalent of about
$11.75 for low-quality "red" bricks and $17.65 for "white" bricks fired
at higher temperatures at the bottom of the kiln.</TE>
<TE>   Though business is good, the brothers are not happy men. They are sore
and tired from chopping wood and hauling bricks. They can't remember
their last day off.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses were soaring, they complained. The cost of the hot-burning
wood called archa, which is trucked from distant mountains, has climbed
to $19 for each 1,200-pound load of firewood. They will burn 46,000
pounds of the wood to produce the 120,000 bricks now being fired in their
kiln.</TE>
<TE>   And they do not always receive full price from customers quick to find
flaws in the bricks and demand discounts. "People are very particular
about their bricks," Farouk said, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the brothers pay their laborers just under $1.50 a
day. It's a typical salary for manual labor in Kabul, and the men on the
site said they were glad to have steady work after long stretches of
unemployment during 23 years of war.</TE>
<TE>   Zikria, the owner, said he was pleased with his new income, but he had
the look of a defeated man. His eyes were sunken, his face thin and
drawn. He had been at the site for days. Black grime had been baked into
the creases of his neck and into the crow's-feet at the corners of his
dark eyes. His fingers were stained black.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate brick work. It's hard and dirty," Zikria said, leaning on his
ax, his turban stained with sweat on a damp, subfreezing morning shrouded
in fog. "This was my father's work, and my grandfather's work, but it is
not my fault this was the only work they could find. Me, I would rather
own a shop and sit all day."</TE>
<TE>   Ali, the fireman, finished another round of feeding the flames and
collapsed onto a stump to slurp at a cup of green tea. His face was
flushed, and his breath came in sharp little coughs. He didn't know his
age, but he looked to be at least 60, a shriveled little man smeared with
soot.</TE>
<TE>   He looked up from his tea at a visitor and asked in a faint, plaintive
voice: "Do you have a nice watchman's job for me? I am so very, very
tired."</TE>

<HD>Alleged Russian Arms Dealer Gives Interview</HD>
<DH>Trafficking: Victor Bout, wanted on a Belgian warrant, chats at a
Moscow radio station. Officials say they had no grounds to arrest him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Victor Bout, the Russian businessman accused of illegally trading
arms with the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists, dropped into a central
Moscow radio station Thursday for a live 37-minute interview, but Russian
law enforcement officials made no move to arrest him.</LD>
<LD>   Bout offered the rare interview to the Echo of Moscow station, the
city's only liberal radio outlet. After denying all involvement in
illegal arms trafficking, he walked out of the station and disappeared
onto the streets of Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   "What should I be afraid of?" Bout said on air. "I haven't done
anything in my life to worry about so that I would need to hide and run
away. I came to your studio without any precautions."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and Belgian officials had suspected that Bout was in Russia, but
just hours before the interview, Interpol's Moscow bureau said the
chances he was in the Russian capital were minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   Bout is wanted by Belgian authorities on a money-laundering charge;
U.N. reports accuse him of illegal arms trading in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Bout said he is willing to cooperate with Russian Interior Ministry
police. But a ministry spokesman said late Thursday that police weren't
seeking to arrest Bout, because they have no evidence of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still checking Victor Bout out," ministry spokesman Andrei
Polyakov said. "So far we haven't discovered anything to arrest him for."</TE>
<TE>   The unofficial Russian view is that the alleged link between Bout and
Al Qaeda is not proven and that the U.N. reports provide no basis for
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Interpol's Russia bureau sent international
evidence against Bout to the Russian prosecutor general's office, which
will make a decision on whether to open a criminal case and arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to say what will eventually happen to Bout in
Russia--whether he will be detained or not. At this stage, the Bout story
is still full of gaps and question marks," Interpol bureau spokesman Igor
Tsirulnikov said.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance of Russian authorities to detain Bout for questioning
Thursday underscores the difficulty international authorities may face in
pinning him down.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be the first time foreign law enforcement agencies have
been frustrated by Russia's tangled crime-fighting bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss authorities have been trying to prosecute Pavel P. Borodin, a
onetime Kremlin insider accused of money laundering. But those efforts
have been stymied by a lack of cooperation from Russian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Venediktov, Echo of Moscow's editor in chief, a highly
respected Russian broadcaster, said Bout, of medium height and wearing a
mustache, appeared cheery and upbeat Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Victor Bout was in a very cheerful mood, smiling and joking,"
Venediktov said.</TE>
<TE>   Only a couple of photographs of Bout are available. But media reports
that he has never given an interview are inaccurate: He spoke to Russia's
NTV television about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview Thursday, Bout reflected that it was funny that
Interpol was looking for him when "here I am in your studio. They haven't
been able to find me for a long time now--four or five years."</TE>
<TE>   Bout has been accused of funneling guns to fighters throughout Africa,
sometimes supplying both sides in a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Bout told Echo of Moscow he had been in the transportation business
since 1992 and that it was his primary business.</TE>
<TE>   "I deal exclusively with air transportation. And I have never been
involved in arms trade. I have never taken part in it," he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   He said the claims that he supplied Osama bin Laden with weapons,
including nuclear weapons components, were like something out of a
Hollywood thriller.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he had Al Qaeda links, Bout said the claims were
"monstrous" and unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say only one thing: I have never supplied anything, and I
haven't done anything and haven't entered any contacts with either
Taliban representatives or with Al Qaeda representatives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bout admitted that his planes regularly flew cargo to Afghanistan, but
he insisted that it was only to airfields controlled by the anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance. Russia was one of the major arms suppliers to the
Northern Alliance, and Bout's role in supplying anti-Taliban moujahedeen
was already known.</TE>
<TE>   Bout said that when a client ordered a plane and paid by the hour, the
cargo was determined not by the cargo carrier but by his client.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why you need to clarify the question about carrying weapons
to Afghanistan," he said. "We flew quite a lot in Afghanistan and worked
there until the Taliban captured all the airfields, which in their time
were controlled by what is now called the Northern Alliance."</TE>
<TE>   He said part of his problem is unfavorable Western stereotypes of
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "If a Russian businessman works somewhere abroad, he is very easily
labeled as 'Russian,' next comes the word 'Mafia,' then 'weapons,' then
something else," he complained. "It is very difficult to fight it off."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House has approved a mission to send hundreds of U.S.
troops to Yemen to train and advise Yemeni forces hunting remnants of the
Al Qaeda network, a published report said today.</LD>
<LD>   The Wall Street Journal cited a senior military official as saying the
mission would be similar to an effort in the Philippines, where more than
600 U.S. soldiers are involved in anti-terror exercises with local
forces.</LD>
<LD>   The paper quoted unnamed officials as saying the mission was approved
after a monthlong debate within the Bush administration about the size of
the Al Qaeda presence in Yemen and how the U.S. should respond.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. soldiers will also share intelligence but, as in the
Philippines, will not be involved in combat, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House and Pentagon had no immediate comment. Army Gen. Tommy
Franks, head of the U.S. Central Command, had said Wednesday that aid to
Yemen was being considered.</TE>

<HD>Blair Agrees Iraq Is 'a Real Threat'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: British prime minister suggests he may back U.S. action
against the Baghdad regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday endorsed President
Bush's decision to take on states that accumulate weapons of mass
destruction and suggested that he would back U.S. action against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Blair stopped short of adopting Bush's characterization of Iran, Iraq
and North Korea as an "axis of evil"--a view that has been widely
condemned in Europe--but said he shares the sentiment behind it.</LD>
<LD>   "Those who are engaged in spreading weapons of mass destruction are
engaged in an evil trade, and it is important that we make sure that we
take action in respect of it," Blair said in an interview with the
Australian Broadcasting Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq poses a
threat, not just to the region, but to the wider world, and I think
George Bush was absolutely right to raise it," Blair said. "Now, what
action we take in respect of that is an open matter for discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Britain was ready to use force against Iraq, he responded:
"When we're ready to take action, then we'll announce it. It is a real
issue. It is a real threat."</TE>
<TE>   Blair's statements were his strongest to date on Iraq and appeared to
be the opening salvo in an international campaign to rally support for
military action against Saddam Hussein if the Iraqi president refuses to
allow international weapons inspectors back into the Persian Gulf nation.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister played a similar role in the U.S. war to topple the
Taliban government of Afghanistan and hunt down the Al Qaeda network
accused in the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Blair is expected to hold talks with Bush in Washington next month to
discuss a plan of action against Iraq as part of a second phase in the
U.S.-directed "war on terrorism." He has repeatedly stated that there is
no evidence of direct Iraqi involvement in the attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon, but he also has said that the spread of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons is a problem that must be tackled.</TE>
<TE>   Britain is the only ally still helping the U.S. patrol the "no-fly"
zones over the Kurdish north and Shiite Muslim south of Iraq. France
pulled out several years ago. The zones were established after the
Persian Gulf War in an effort to protect minority groups that had come
under threat from Iraq's government.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's "axis of evil" formulation--first put forward in his State of
the Union speech in January--has come under heavy fire from Europeans.
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has warned the United States not to
give in to "the strong temptation of unilateralism." Chris Patten, the
European Union's commissioner for external affairs, accused the Bush
administration of a dangerously "absolutist and simplistic" stance toward
global issues.</TE>
<TE>   Many European governments are skeptical about Bush's pursuit of "a
regime change" in Iraq, while Russia and China have stated their
opposition to a U.S. military campaign to topple Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to sound out Arab governments
during an upcoming tour of the Middle East. Many Arab leaders fear a
leadership vacuum if Hussein is driven from power, creating chaos in Iraq
and spreading violence to neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to meet Iraq's foreign minister,
Naji Sabri, in New York on Thursday to discuss the possible return of
weapons inspectors to Iraq. The U.N. inspectors were pulled out in 1998
after their movements were so restricted that they were unable to do
their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Annan said that "any attack on Iraq at this stage would
be unwise."</TE>
<TE>   The British government reportedly is planning to publish detailed
evidence of Iraq's nuclear capabilities. The Observer newspaper reported
Sunday that the document will reveal that Hussein is attempting to amass
rudimentary nuclear capabilities and is seeking ways to launch "dirty
bombs"--unsophisticated but deadly nuclear devices.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Blair said Thursday that Hussein is continuing to
produce weapons of mass destruction and that the growing attention on
Iraq is part of the "logical process" unfolding since Sept. 11. He
described this as "follow-through" on the anti-terror agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Not all members of Blair's Labor Party agree. A poll of 100 party
members in Parliament conducted by BBC television revealed widespread
opposition to a military attack on Iraq, with 86 saying they would not
support it.</TE>
<TE>   In his television interview, Blair foresaw no hasty action against the
Iraqi leader but said the weapons issue must be confronted.</TE>
<TE>   "Heavens above, he used chemical weapons against his own people,"
Blair said of an incident during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, "so it is an
issue, and we have got to look at it. But we will look at it in a
rational and calm way, as we have for the other issues."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Blair say they believe the prime minister will
support a military campaign in Iraq if the United States first exhausts
diplomatic efforts, reengages in Middle East peace efforts and gets U.N.
Security Council approval for its action.</TE>

<HD>Fireworks Industry Propels Economy in Rural China</HD>
<DH>Pyrotechnics: The hazardous and poorly regulated business has cost
many lives. But it is irresistibly profitable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUANGMAO, China
</DL>
<LD>Zhou Xiaorong was helping to build a new fireworks factory when he
heard a boom from his nearby village. It was the sound of yet another
tragedy for the industry. The epicenter was literally in the 28-year-old
peasant's backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Zhou lived next door to another fireworks factory, the biggest in the
area. The explosion at the business in late December leveled homes and
uprooted trees. Even miles away, ceilings crumbled and windows shattered.
People screamed. Livestock ran amok.</LD>
<LD>   Zhou's new two-story home collapsed, killing his 10-year-old son,
Peng.</LD>
<TE>   "He was watching TV," said the young father as he stood in the
wreckage of his home long after the blast, despair evident in his eyes.
"When I pulled him out, he was still holding the remote control."</TE>
<TE>   The deadly nature of the fireworks industry in China made headlines
last March when dozens of children were killed in a schoolhouse blast.
The students had been forced to assemble firecrackers to supplement the
institution's meager income. The incident prompted Premier Zhu Rongji to
issue an apology to the nation, promising to guard against such
tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   December's explosion at the Panda Export Fireworks Co. here in Wanzai
County, part of Jiangxi province, was particularly embarrassing because
it occurred only a half-hour drive from the site of the school tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   In response, provincial authorities announced that they will eliminate
fireworks production in Jiangxi within the next two years. Neighboring
Hunan province, also famous for its fireworks, came close to doing the
same, temporarily closing 170 producers after a Jan. 10 blast killed six
people.</TE>
<TE>   Like the rash of mining accidents that have rocked China in recent
months, the fireworks blasts have been embarrassing to Beijing. They have
brought attention to a dangerous and poorly regulated industry at a time
when the national government is preparing for a major leadership change
this fall, including the selection of a new president.</TE>
<TE>   A severe cutback in production here in the heart of China's fireworks
country, however, would have lasting impact on the destitute peasants who
are economically dependent on jobs making recreational explosives. It
also would touch millions of Americans who are among the biggest buyers
of China's ancient noisemakers.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the Panda factory exploded and burned to the ground, one
could see signs here of the booming trade: Purple Rain, Cracker Bomb,
Whistling Cuckoo, Fire Stick Torch and TNT Killer Bee. All the labels
were in English.</TE>
<TE>   Global demand has made pyrotechnics an irresistibly profitable
business in China. This nation, which invented fireworks more than a
millennium ago, has become the world's leading producer and exporter in
part because other countries cannot compete with its low labor costs and
find manufacturing too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   But people in other nations sure love to buy the fireworks. China
exported about $250 million worth last year to dozens of countries. About
95% of the consumer fireworks sold in the United States are manufactured
in China. Fireworks usage in America jumped from 29 million pounds in
1976 to more than 152 million pounds in 2000, according to the American
Pyrotechnics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The retail fireworks industry in the U.S. earned an estimated $650
million last year, up from $425 million in 1998, according to the
association. With China offering unbeatable prices, retailers can mark up
their products 200% to 600% and still sell at an attractive price.</TE>
<TE>   Most developed countries have pulled out of the manufacturing end
because of safety concerns. Instead, they concentrate on marketing and
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's impossible to get products out of China it would severely
impact the U.S. market," said John Rogers, head of the American Fireworks
Standards Laboratory, which helps certify imported fireworks. "China has
virtually been our sole source of product for at least the last 20 years.
There is no other country that could produce this quantity at this
point."</TE>
<TE>   Part of Chinese fireworks' rising popularity in the States, industry
experts say, reflects the improved safety of the final products. But they
admit that much less attention is paid to safety standards at the
manufacturing end.</TE>
<TE>   In China's vast countryside, labor is abundant. Plenty of people need
jobs, and fireworks make a welcome cash cow. They are low-tech and cheap
to produce by hand. The process calls for little more sophistication than
it did centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   An illegal cottage industry flourishes alongside accredited factories.
People work at homes and schools, stringing strands of firecrackers or
stuffing gunpowder into shells. They do this with little safety
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   More than a third of all fires reported last year in China were linked
to fireworks production. Officials shut down more than 237,000 illegal
factories and shops in 2001, according to state media. But the industry
thrives.</TE>
<TE>   It's better to die in an explosion than from hunger, goes one saying
in this region. So much is riding on the industry that few here can
imagine life without it.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we don't hate our boss," said a woman who was off-duty
during the Dec. 30 explosion at the Panda factory. "He's making money so
we can make money," she said, giving only her last name, Liu, as she and
some neighbors sifted through the rubble of their former work stations,
looking for scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese peasants, on average, make less than $300 a year. But here in
impoverished Jiangxi province, they helped produce about $179 million
worth of pyrotechnics as part of an industry that contributes about $42
million to the provincial coffers through taxes, according to state
media.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder locals say there are three paths to wealth: selling drugs,
arms or fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   In Wanzai County alone, there are over 300 sanctioned factories making
more than 3,000 varieties of fireworks. Taxes on their businesses make up
as much as 40% of the local government's budget.</TE>
<TE>   New factories spring up all the time. They stand out, usually as
clusters of small brick sheds with pointed black shingle roofs and no
windows. Many of them operate next to homes and schools. The only
apparent precautions often consist of signs on the walls: "Sparks
Prohibited" and "Safety First."</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said the Panda factory erected a stone Buddha to protect
workers. The blast blew off its head.</TE>
<TE>   At least 1 in 4 Wanzai residents works in the trade, according to
locals and media accounts. Most are women. They earn between $37 and $61
a month, depending on overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot afford to abandon this business," said a factory owner here
named Zhou, who would not give his first name and was not related to the
boy killed in the blast. "If you don't let them make it legally, they
will do it illegally. That will be even more dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Annual revenue at the Panda factory was about $700,000, according to
Zhou. Its tax payments made up as much as half of Huangmao township's
budget.</TE>
<TE>   That, some villagers say, may be why officials insisted that only 14
people were killed in the blast and 61 injured.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible only 14 people died," said Pan Baocheng, 24, a
resident of Yongan, one of four villages near the Panda factory. "At
least 10 people died in my village alone, and hundreds more are wounded.
That's not including people killed at the factory."</TE>
<TE>   Some villagers also questioned the official account that Pan Xiaohua,
an employee not related to the Yongan resident, blew up the factory by
packing the explosives "too forcefully."</TE>
<TE>   According to relatives, the 35-year-old mother of two was not packing
smaller backyard fireworks. Instead, she was assembling the more powerful
pyrotechnics used in public displays. Critics of the industry suspect
that lax management and improper use of chemicals contributed to the
blast.</TE>
<TE>   The dead woman's dilapidated hut sits about a five-minute walk from
the blast site. The explosion sent tiles flying from its roof and rocks
falling from the sky. Her father was hit on the face and back. The family
dog, which was nursing five puppies, was struck on the mouth and leg.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers in the area argue that the factory should not have been
built in such a densely populated place. But protests against the
business before it opened in the early 1990s were broken up by local
authorities, several villagers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we're scared to live here, but we have no choice, we were
here first," said Zhu Wansheng, 72, who lives next door to the house in
Huangmao that collapsed on the boy. Only the door frame at the entry to
Zhu's home still stands. The family sleeps under a plastic tarp.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, Zhou Xiaorong has buried his son and erected a tent in the
family's dried wheat field to shelter the family.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a very sad new year," said Zhou Huihong, 20, the boy's
uncle. "I've never seen anything like it."</TE>

<HD>21 Cubans Hole Up in Embassy</HD>
<DH>Caribbean: Castro blames U.S.-backed radio station after Mexico's
post invaded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA
</DL>
<LD>Twenty-one Cubans were holed up in the Mexican Embassy on Thursday
after plowing through the gates with a stolen bus. Cuba's government
blamed an exile-run U.S. government radio station for repeatedly quoting
a Mexican official as saying the embassy's doors "are open."</LD>
<LD>   Mexican Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda said Thursday that his words
had been taken out of context by "radicals" in Miami who "no doubt wanted
to use, to distort, my declarations."</LD>
<LD>   He said Mexican officials were trying to persuade the Cubans to leave
and that the men had not sought asylum. Castaneda also indicated that it
was unlikely they would get Mexican visas.</LD>
<TE>   There were 21 Cuban men inside the mission Thursday, other Mexican
officials said. They described the situation as "calm" and said the
Cubans had received food and medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban government statement said the occupation occurred about 9:30
p.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   President Fidel Castro's government called the reports from Radio
Marti a "gross provocation" that led listeners to believe that Mexico
would grant refuge to any Cuban who showed up. Operated largely by Cuban
exiles in Miami, Radio Marti beams anti-Castro news, talk shows and other
programs to the island.</TE>
<TE>   "Castro blames us any time anything happens. He has to blame
somebody," said Salvador Lew, director of the Miami-based station.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to Miami this week, Castaneda was quoted by news media
there as saying that "the doors of the embassy of Mexico on the island
are open to all Cuban citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban government said Radio Marti rebroadcast that statement at
least eight times. It accused the station of provoking the embassy
invasion with the repeated broadcasts, which it said were interpreted as
"an open invitation to occupy the Mexican Embassy in Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda told Radio Red that reports in Miami had confused two
separate statements he made there while opening a Mexican Cultural
Center.</TE>
<TE>   He said he declared the center's "doors are open to the entire Latino
community in Miami" while also saying that Mexico itself is open to Cuban
dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   In Miami, Radio Marti officials denied the allegations Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Fleischer Retracts Dig at Clinton's Efforts in Mideast</HD>
<DH>Politics: The White House press secretary apologizes for saying the
former president's failed attempts to bring peace sparked current
violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The chief White House spokesman suggested Thursday that the Clinton
administration's unsuccessful efforts to bring peace to the Middle East
actually triggered the latest violence in the region, but he later backed
down and apologized.</LD>
<LD>   "I mistakenly suggested that increasing violence in the Middle East
was attributable to the peace efforts that were underway in 2000," Ari
Fleischer, President Bush's press secretary, said in a statement issued
late Thursday. "That is not the position of the administration."</LD>
<LD>   Fleischer got himself into hot water during his morning "gaggle," a
usually informal session with reporters that precedes his formal, usually
televised, news briefing.</LD>
<TE>   Asked about President Clinton's dogged peace efforts, which continued
late into his second term, Fleischer suggested that they actually made
matters worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I think if you go back to when the violence began, you can
make the case that in an attempt to shoot the moon and get nothing, more
violence resulted; that as a result of an attempt to push the parties
beyond where they were willing to go, that it led to expectations that
were raised to such a high level that it turned into violence."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer's remarks prompted a barrage of skeptical questions from
reporters during his subsequent briefing, but he held his ground.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a statement issued by Clinton's office in New York calling
Fleischer's comments "unfortunate." The statement also noted that the
U.S. at the time was "deeply engaged" in the peace process--a barely
veiled reference to the perception that the Bush administration is not
similarly engaged.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Fleischer said: "No United States president,
including President Clinton, is to blame for violence in the Middle East.
The only people to blame for violence are the terrorists who engage in
it. I regret any implication to the contrary."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONROVIA, Liberia
</DL>
<LD>West African officials expressed disgust Thursday at a U.N. report
that has uncovered allegations of widespread sexual abuse of children by
relief agency workers.</LD>
<LD>   Liberia's deputy health minister, Arthur Saye, said he was
disappointed to learn the country's relief workers were among those
implicated in the probe. "I did not know that the people we thought were
helping the needy were the ones endangering their future," he said.</LD>
<LD>   In neighboring Sierra Leone, Information Minister Cecil Blake said it
was a "shocking revelation" and promised that anyone found guilty of
sexually exploiting refugees would "face the full force of the law."</LD>
<TE>   But in the camps that accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people
displaced in more than a decade of fighting in Liberia and Sierra Leone,
refugees are all too familiar with such abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in this camp, it happens plenty, plenty times," said a mother of
seven at a camp in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. "They take advantage
of our condition."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were contained in an interim report by the Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the British aid group Save
the Children, which uncovered evidence of abuse at camps in Liberia,
Guinea and Sierra Leone. The allegations cover 67 workers and 40
humanitarian aid groups.</TE>

<LD>A federal grand jury in Miami indicted four police officers on
charges they severely beat a handcuffed suspect. A fifth officer was
indicted on charges he lied to investigators after killing a mentally ill
man.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect who allegedly was beaten, Alexander Anazco, had been
arrested in February 1997 while driving a vehicle used by someone who had
thrown a rock at an officer's car, said U.S. Atty. Guy Lewis. Officers
Jesus Aguero, Jorge Garcia, Wilfredo Perez and Jorge Castello could face
10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   In the other case, Officer Alejandro Macias was charged with
obstructing justice for the March 1999 fatal shooting of Jesse Runnels, a
psychiatric patient who was attempting to commit suicide.</LD>

<HD>Religious Zeal Infused Yates' Lives, Testimony Shows</HD>
<DH>Courts: Fears of demonic influences and social ills pervaded the
home where a woman drowned her children, witnesses say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The cloistered household in which Andrea Pia Yates drowned her five
children was laced with offbeat, even dangerous, religious zeal,
according to testimony in Yates' capital murder trial Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   It was a home in which the husband and wife stuck to traditional
roles. It was a home in which medicine was frowned upon, school systems
were unacceptable and institutional religion was a tool of evil. Doomsday
leaflets mailed to the house gave hysterical warnings against demonic
influences that threaten young children.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot stress how serious the whole thing is: By the time a child
is 14 or 15 years old, it's too late," the Perilous Times newsletter
said. Yates' husband, Russell "Rusty" Yates, read aloud from the tract
during Thursday's testimony. "If you feed them with the world's ways, you
reap what you sow."</LD>
<TE>   "Do you have any idea how the information you just read would play to
the mind of a psychotic individual?" defense lawyer George Parnham asked
Rusty Yates.</TE>
<TE>   When she confessed to killing her children on a summer morning, Andrea
Yates told detectives, "They weren't developing properly." Later that
week, she told her brother that Satan was living inside her. Yates has
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Andrea Yates suffered suicide attempts, catatonic states
and psychosis. In a quavering voice, her best friend told the jury she
watched helplessly while the 37-year-old mother wasted away, stopped
talking to her children and paced aimless circles with a baby on her bony
hip. Yates stopped bathing and grew too emaciated to breast-feed, said
Deborah Holmes. The two women became friends before Yates' marriage, when
they worked together as nurses in a Houston hospital.</TE>
<TE>   For two years before the Yates children were killed, Holmes had kept a
diary chronicling Andrea Yates' condition "in case something bad
happens."</TE>
<TE>   "I called her husband crying and sobbing, saying she needs help now,"
said Holmes. "He'd say, 'I'll look into it.' I'd say, 'She's not going to
make it through the weekend.' "</TE>
<TE>   Holmes said Rusty Yates considered child care a woman's responsibility
and refused to help his wife tend the children. "I'm not saying he didn't
play with them or enjoy them, but as far as care for them, he didn't,"
Holmes said. "If the kids' faces or hands were dirty, he'd say, 'Wait
till your mother comes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Therapist Earline Wilcott counseled Andrea Yates for months in a
Christian center. The only time she met Rusty Yates, he quoted from the
Bible: Wives must submit to their husbands. "Sense of [Andrea Yates]
being overwhelmed and trapped with no alternative," Wilcott jotted in her
notes.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped she could have more support from him in terms of helping with
home school and having more time off," the therapist testified Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The religious tracts apparently wielded a heavy influence over the
family's lifestyle. They were written by Michael Woroniecki, a preacher
who roams college campuses with a message: "You are going to hell."</TE>
<TE>   During his undergraduate years, Rusty Yates met Woroniecki on the
grounds of Auburn University and the two struck up a friendship. They
stayed in touch, and the preacher's wife exchanged letters with Andrea
Yates.</TE>
<TE>   The leaflets said women have a biblical duty to endure natural
childbirth as a "humbling" rite of passage. Andrea Yates gave birth to
all five of her children without the aid of medication.</TE>
<TE>   The pamphlets also insisted on the importance of home schooling. While
his wife sat catatonic in a mental hospital, Rusty Yates was out
house-hunting. He had a stipulation: There had to be space for a home
school, which was Andrea Yates' job. "The social interaction the world
tells you is so important is exactly what you need to protect your
children from," the leaflet reads.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to abandon their first suburban house in favor of a
nomadic life in trailer parks came after the birth of the Yates' two
eldest children. The family lived for a time in a converted Greyhound bus
Rusty Yates bought from the Woronieckis for $37,000. A pregnant Andrea
Yates--who had recently miscarried--slept on a couch because she was
afraid to climb over the steering wheel into the couple's bed, Holmes
said.</TE>
<TE>   The family adored its newfound simplicity, Rusty Yates said. "We had a
lot of stuff, a surprising amount of stuff," he told the jury. "It became
burdensome."</TE>
<TE>   But it was more than that, Holmes and Wilcott testified: The couple
insisted upon moving into the trailer, they said, because they feared the
children would become materialistic. So they held a garage sale, and
Andrea Yates lost her wedding gifts, furniture--just about everything
except her sewing machine and cookware.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw her give up everything she'd worked so hard to gather when
she was out on her own?" prosecutor Kaylynn Williford asked Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Holmes replied. Meanwhile, Rusty Yates rented a storage space
for his tools, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you very fond of Rusty Yates?" Parnham asked Holmes at the end of
her testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "That's irrelevant," Holmes replied. "It's her husband."</TE>

<HD>Budget Cuts Enacted Over Gov. Ventura Veto</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to cut nearly $2 billion from the state's deficit by
slashing spending and dipping into reserves went into law after the state
Senate, with little fanfare, overrode Gov. Jesse Ventura's veto, 60 to 7.</LD>
<LD>   The House overrode the bill with a 99-33 vote, easily more than the 90
votes--two-thirds majority--required for an override.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura had vetoed the bill Monday, saying it puts too much of the
burden on spending cuts. His plan would have raised gas and cigarette
taxes and cut state payments to local governments. It would have also cut
some programs and used some reserves.</LD>

<HD>N.Y. Cops Freed in Brutality Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judges overturn the convictions of three officers in the
beating of Abner Louima. One will get a new trial; the other two can't be
retried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In a stunning reversal, a federal appeals court Thursday overturned
the convictions of three New York City police officers in the 1997
beating and brutalization of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals, which reopened one of the ugliest cases of police brutality in
U.S. history, sparked furious protests from minority leaders. The Rev. Al
Sharpton called the decision a "travesty," vowing to mount massive
demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate effect of the decision was to order a new trial for
Charles Schwarz. He had been convicted of holding Louima down in a
Brooklyn precinct bathroom while Justin Volpe brutalized him with a
broken broom handle. Schwarz, who had been serving a 15-year federal
sentence, was expected to be freed soon to prepare for a new trial.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling also dismissed all charges against officers Thomas Wiese
and Thomas Bruder, who had been convicted along with Schwarz of
conspiring to suppress information and impede the investigation. The
decision prevents them from being retried, prosecutors said. The officers
had been free on bond pending their appeal of five-year sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving a 30-year
sentence, was not affected by Thursday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The Louima trial focused national attention on the New York Police
Department's friction with minorities and allegations that its officers
routinely mistreated people of color. It also highlighted the "blue wall
of silence," in which police officers refuse to provide damaging
information to investigators about fellow officers who break the law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sweet day when you can show the government was wrong and it
was wrong from the beginning," said Stuart London, Bruder's attorney.
Joseph Tacopina, Wiese's attorney, also hailed the ruling, saying
"justice has been served."</TE>
<TE>   Louima did not comment, but his attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, said his
client would "vigorously cooperate" with any new prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do anything to ensure that justice is finally done in this
horrible case," Rubenstein added.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, U.S. Atty. Alan Vinegrad said he was disappointed that
the court halted the conspiracy case through a "judgment of acquittal,"
which bars a retrial on the same charges. But he added that the
government will move to quickly retry the civil rights case against
Schwarz.</TE>
<TE>   The case was prosecuted by federal officials, who hoped to convict the
officers of violating Louima's civil rights--penalties carrying stricter
sentences than state law.</TE>
<TE>   In their decision, the judges ruled that Schwarz had received
ineffective counsel during his trial and that the jury had been tainted
by news reports during its deliberations. They also concluded that the
government failed to present sufficient evidence in the conspiracy case.</TE>
<TE>   The case began on a hot August night, when police responded to a melee
outside a crowded Brooklyn nightclub. Volpe, who was struck in the face
by one of the participants, mistakenly thought Louima had attacked him
and arrested the onetime security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the unarmed Louima was brutally beaten in the police
car on the way to the precinct house. They said Volpe and Schwarz
assaulted him with the broomstick later in the evening, leaving him
bleeding on a cell floor.</TE>
<TE>   Louima, who reportedly collected a $8.7-million settlement from the
city, moved to Florida last year, trying to shun the media spotlight. The
appellate court ruling "brings all of this pain back," Sharpton charged.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling cannot stand," he told a news conference, calling for the
appointment of a special federal prosecutor. "Our community is going to
start questioning whether we have a criminal justice system that gives
immunity to the police. In my most vivid imagination, I could not imagine
that a court would issue the kind of ruling that it did today."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said Schwarz's original attorney, Stephen Worth, had
a significant conflict of interest, since he was also representing the
New York Police Benevolent Assn. The judges said this may have created a
situation in which Worth failed to pursue a vigorous defense for Schwarz
that would have cleared him and put the PBA at risk in its battle against
Louima's multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In a key finding, the judges said jurors did not hear evidence that
another officer, not Schwarz, held Louima down during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Volpe, following his guilty plea, indicated through his lawyer that
Wiese, rather than Schwarz, was the officer who accompanied him to the
bathroom. Worth, however, decided not to put Volpe on the stand,
contending that his testimony would not have had any credibility with
jurors.</TE>
<TE>   The court also noted that during their deliberations, several jurors
apparently heard news reports that Volpe said another, unnamed officer
joined him in the assault. This information, along with Worth's refusal
to put Volpe on the stand, prejudiced the case against Schwarz, the
judges ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz's family has mounted a vigorous public campaign to free him
ever since he began serving a 15-year sentence. He has been placed in
solitary confinement for his own safety in seven federal facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I pray to God that this is the beginning of the end," said Schwarz's
wife, Andra, shortly after hearing the news. "He's innocent, he didn't do
it, and now I think he'll finally be getting the new trial he deserves."</TE>

<HD>Top EPA Enforcement Official Quits, Blasts Bush Policy</HD>
<DH>Environment: The White House is accused of being lax in its pursuit
of companies that spew millions of tons of pollutants into the air.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A top enforcement official with the Environmental Protection Agency
has resigned, saying in a two-page letter that the Bush administration
has failed to crack down on companies that pour 7 million tons of toxins
into the air every year.</LD>
<LD>   Eric V. Schaeffer ended his 12-year EPA career Wednesday with a
missive accusing the administration of dragging its feet on lawsuits
filed against nine power companies he blamed for one-fourth of the
nation's annual sulfur dioxide pollution--a gas known to cause haze, acid
rain and lung ailments.</LD>
<LD>   Schaeffer, the agency's director of regulatory enforcement and a
decorated civil servant, said he has been "fighting a White House that
seems determined to weaken the rules we are trying to enforce."</LD>
<TE>   Addressed to EPA Administrator Christie Whitman, the letter said the
administration's 90-day review of clean air laws had stretched to nine
months, derailing negotiations with the nine power companies and
weakening attempts to regulate coal-fired smokestacks built without the
updated pollution controls required by law.</TE>
<TE>Companies Adopt Wait-and-See Stance</TE>
<TE>   Two of those industries agreed more than a year ago to consent decrees
that would have decreased sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution
levels by 750,000 tons. But those companies--Cinergy Corp. and Virginia
Electric Power Co.--are now "hedging their bets," refusing to sign the
decrees until they see where the White House lands on reforming the Clean
Air Act, Schaeffer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen months ago it looked as though our lawsuits were going to
shrink these dismal statistics. . . . Today, we seem about to snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory," he wrote. "Other companies with whom we
were close to settlement have walked away from the table.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum we obtained with agreements announced earlier has
stopped, and we have filed no new lawsuits against utility companies
since this administration took office."</TE>
<TE>   The EPA rejected Schaeffer's contentions, saying it "remains
committed" to enforcement and to reducing air pollution caused by power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration believes that its 'clear skies' proposal will
dramatically cut air pollution from power plants at a rate that is
faster, greater and more reliable than under the current Clean Air Act,"
EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said.</TE>
<TE>   But environmental groups cited Schaeffer's parting words as a sign
that President Bush "is in full retreat from serious environmental
protection" and is "letting polluters get away red-handed."</TE>
<TE>   "The letter confirms our fears that the Bush administration is
preventing the nation's environmental cop from policing his beat," said
Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   "The health of millions of Americans will be the worse for his
departure," said John Coequyt, senior analyst for the Environmental
Working Group, a watchdog organization in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Industry insiders said it was rare for an official of Schaeffer's
stature to resign with such a candid critique.</TE>
<TE>Well Regarded in the Industry</TE>
<TE>   In August, Schaeffer was given the Justice Department's prestigious
John Marshall Award for exemplary public service and is highly regarded
even by industry lawyers. He joined the EPA in 1990 during the
administration of the first President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The resignation of someone at Mr. Schaeffer's level underscores the
fact that environmental enforcement is a very weak spot in the
administration's approach to environmental policy," said Joan Mulhern of
Earthjustice, a Washington environmental law firm.</TE>
<TE>   While environmental activists hoped Schaeffer's words would sound a
wake-up call in Washington, the EPA publicly dismissed his allegation.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of the points that he raises are points that have been
discussed in the public dialogue on this whole issue," Martyak said. "His
point of view is his point of view, and we stand by our projections and
our numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer said he informed his superiors weeks ago that he would be
leaving to work as a consultant for the Rockefeller Family Fund, a
foundation that supports environmental work. But he decided only this
week to write down his frustrations. He delivered his message Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The letter cites EPA data presented to a Senate committee last year
indicating the scale of pollution from the contested coal-fired
smokestacks and the attending health hazards they bring, including more
than 10,800 premature deaths, at least 5,400 incidents of chronic
bronchitis, more than 5,100 hospital emergency visits and more than 1.5
million lost workdays.</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer also faulted the Bush budget proposal to cut the civil
enforcement program by more than 200 staff positions.</TE>
<TE>Agency at Disadvantage Against Big Firms</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed budget cuts would leave us desperately short of the
resources needed to deal with the large, sophisticated corporate
defendants we face," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The enforcement division where Schaeffer worked has been the focus of
some recent controversy with the naming of John Peter Suarez as director.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists have protested the appointment, saying Suarez
formerly oversaw gambling laws in New Jersey and lacks the qualifications
to supervise enforcement of environmental law.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided we had hit a wall and it was going to be really hard to do
much more in enforcement without a change in the climate we were working
in," Schaeffer said in an interview Thursday. "I just wanted to bring
some public attention to the issue."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The debate over mammograms has confused and frustrated women
already frightened of breast cancer, senators told scientists involved in
the issue Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Women don't know who to believe or what to do," said Sen. Barbara A.
Mikulski (D-Md.).</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) told of a niece whose mother died of breast
cancer and who always was told to get mammograms. She telephoned him
recently to say, "Uncle Tom, what am I supposed to do now?"</LD>
<TE>   A Danish investigation of mammography studies last fall concluded they
are so flawed that it is impossible to tell whether routine mammograms
reduce cancer deaths.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a panel that analyzes data for the National Cancer
Institute agreed that the Danish work raised serious doubts.</TE>
<TE>   The institute itself urges women to get regular mammograms. Breast
cancer deaths are falling by 3.2% a year, an improvement partly as a
result of catching tumors earlier with mammograms and partly to better
treatments, the institute's director, Andrew von Eschenbach, told
senators.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Discount Drug Plan Seen as Little More Than 'a Start'</HD>
<DH>Health: White House's proposal is designed to tide the elderly over
until a prescription benefit can be added to the program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration unveiled a Medicare drug discount proposal
Thursday that even its creators said would not do enough to make
prescription drugs more affordable for seniors.</LD>
<LD>   The average 10% to 13% the plan could save participating senior
citizens in drug costs is "not a lot," said Tom Scully, administrator of
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "But it is a start,"
designed to tide the elderly over until Congress can add a prescription
drug benefit to Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   Drugstore owners and some consumer advocates called the proposal "a
charade" and "much ado about very little."</LD>
<TE>   Under the administration's proposal, Medicare would endorse private
pharmacy-benefit plans that had negotiated discounts on the types of
drugs most often used by the elderly. To receive what Ron Pollack,
executive director of the consumer advocacy group Families USA,
derisively called the "Medicare good housekeeping seal of approval," the
private plans also would have to demonstrate that they had the capacity
to handle the prescription claims of large numbers of Medicare
beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, approved private and state-run plans could advertise their
discount cards as "Medicare-endorsed," and Medicare would aim to educate
beneficiaries about the advantages of the overall discount program and
how to participate in it.</TE>
<TE>   Beneficiaries would pay a maximum enrollment fee of $25 to get a
discount card, which they would then present to their pharmacy or
mail-order supplier, along with their prescription. The plan does not
require a minimum discount level or that all drugs be discounted.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare does not cover the cost of prescription drugs administered
outside a hospital. And while many of Medicare's 40 million beneficiaries
have supplemental insurance that covers medications, roughly 38% have no
prescription coverage, according to a study by researchers of KPMG
Consulting Inc. and the Kaiser Family Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "The only people who walk into a drugstore and pay full price for
prescriptions are seniors and the uninsured," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   And prescription drug costs, which jumped more than 17% in 2000, hit
senior citizens especially hard because their incomes are relatively
fixed and they take, on average, many more medications than younger
people. Though they make up 13% of the U.S. population, 34% of all
prescriptions dispensed go to senior citizens; and they account for 42%
of all prescription drug spending, according to a Families USA study.</TE>
<TE>   So the question now facing senior groups, consumers, lawmakers, drug
manufacturers and pharmacies--who all have 60 days to give public
feedback--is whether this limited, intermediary step is better for
seniors than nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, we want a comprehensive benefit," said an
official with AARP, which represents 35 million Americans age 50 and
older. In the meantime, the administration's proposal would provide a
modest discount and, perhaps most important, serve as "a platform or
pilot project for how [the government] could run a comprehensive drug
benefit," said the official, who declined to be identified because AARP
officials had not thoroughly evaluated the administration's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Scully said the discount card plan "lays out the infrastructure" for a
Medicare drug benefit by "organizing the purchasing power" until Congress
appropriates money for a comprehensive Medicare benefit. He predicted
that 10 million seniors would sign up for a Medicare-endorsed discount
card.</TE>
<TE>   The administration introduced a similar discount card proposal in
July. But drugstore owners and pharmacists, concerned that much of the
promised discounts would come out of their slim profit margins, filed
suit in federal court to block the plan. They argued that the Bush
administration did not have the authority to implement such a program
without congressional approval and that it had violated federal rules by
failing to allow public comment on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman blocked implementation of the
program in September, saying President Bush had "acted without legal
authority."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials later said they would go back to the drawing
board, revise their proposal, publish it in the Federal Register and
submit it for public comment. In November, Friedman gave them permission
to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Drugstore owners made much the same argument Thursday that they did
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the judge will have to decide," said Larry Kocot, senior
vice president and general counsel of the National Assn. of Chain Drug
Stores. "But no one gave Medicare the authority to move forward with any
prescription discount plan." Such a plan should be openly debated in
Congress, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the drugstore owners, like everyone else, "believe any senior
with a valid prescription ought to be able to get it filled, someone has
to pay for it," Kocot said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Medicare proposal does not specify the size of discounts
or rebates that drug manufacturers would have to offer to win
endorsement, drugstore owners and pharmacists are concerned that the
discounts would eat away at their profit margins, which Kocot said are
"2% or lower."</TE>
<TE>   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade
association for drug companies, declined to comment substantively about
the proposal, noting that its members had not had sufficient time to
evaluate it.</TE>
<TE>   For consumer advocate Pollack, the proposal falls far short of
offering significant savings to senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unclear whether a senior purchasing a specific drug would get
any savings at all," he said. In addition, he said, the program does
little to promote the use of cheaper, generic drugs and does not directly
address the "bulk of drug costs, the three-quarters charged by drug
manufacturers."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Pollack said, even if the administration's plan is
implemented, continued increases in drug costs will leave more senior
citizens unable to afford the drugs they need.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush's proposal will provide very little relief."</TE>

<HD>Bush Team Signals Help Is on the Way for Steel Industry</HD>
<DH>Policy: The president is said to be sympathetic to workers and
companies squeezed by cheaper imported goods. A decision on tariffs
looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration signaled Thursday it is leaning toward
measures that would protect the beleaguered steel industry from foreign
competition, a decision that could save U.S. jobs but hike the cost of a
variety of goods.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said President Bush was sympathetic to the complaints of
steelworkers and the major U.S. steel companies that low prices charged
by foreign producers are undercutting them.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has until Wednesday to decide whether to impose tariffs of up to
40% on imported steel, the recommendation of a majority on the
International Trade Commission, an independent U.S. agency.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials, talking Thursday about Bush's readiness "to
go to bat for American workers facing undue pressure" from abroad,
indicated he was in favor of imposing some level of quotas or tariffs,
though probably not at the 40% mark.</TE>
<TE>   The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The decision looms as one of the most complex challenges Bush faces in
the trade arena. It puts his free-trade policies to a steep political
test in which the economy, foreign policy and national security come into
play.</TE>
<TE>   The steel industry and politically important steelworkers--thousands
of whom rallied near the White House on Thursday--favor the tariffs to
lessen foreign competition and protect U.S. jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting a tariff could cost Republicans a handful of House seats
this November, as well as damage Bush's chances of carrying states seen
as potentially key to a reelection bid, among them Pennsylvania, Ohio and
West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   But manufacturers that use steel for their products and groups
representing steel purchasers generally oppose them, arguing they would
make domestic goods ranging from toasters to tractors more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a terrible dilemma," says Susan Ariel Aronson, an expert on
trade and politics at the National Policy Assn., a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "He should come up with a solution that doesn't require us to pay
higher prices for toasters and automobiles in the interest of saving
jobs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That appeared less than likely on Thursday, although White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush had made no final decision.</TE>
<TE>   The president told a bipartisan delegation of lawmakers from
steel-producing states that met with him Thursday that he is still
mulling the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a senior administration official, in comments Thursday, said
the problems the U.S. steel industry was facing more than justified
action.</TE>
<TE>   "You have 30 companies in bankruptcy and you're facing the lowest
prices you've seen in 20 years and you still have these [trade]
distortions out in the worldwide market," said the official, speaking on
the condition that he not be identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   Among other issues troubling the industry in addition to low prices of
imported steel are a history of inefficient production in the old steel
mills of the East Coast, an excess capacity of steel production around
the world and the towering costs of meeting the pension and health-care
commitments once-healthy companies made to now-retired or laid-off
workers.</TE>
<TE>   That so-called legacy cost is holding up potential mergers that would
reduce production capacity and, the industry argues, lead to more
efficient operations.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the complexity and importance of the tariff issue,
various administration discussions on it have involved not only Bush, but
Vice President Dick Cheney; Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick;
Commerce Secretary Don Evans; Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill;
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Condoleezza Rice, the president's
national security advisor; Labor Secretary Elaine Chao; and Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of Rice and Powell reflects concerns that the nations of
the European Union are wary of any souring of trade relations.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, senior advisor to Bush, and other White House political
aides also have been part of the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Opting for tariffs, said Thomas Mann, a political scholar at the
Brookings Institution, would be "an abrupt departure from Bush's
free-trade philosophy and it threatens to make even more difficult our
relations with other countries when their noses are decidedly out of
joint" over several festering trade disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of those really knotty problems," said Mickey Kantor, who
as trade representative during the first Clinton administration completed
the negotiations that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement and
the establishment of the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Kantor said that for both political and trade reasons, a tariff was
necessary to help the U.S. steel industry. But he recommended a
three-pronged approach:</TE>
<TE>   * Imposing a low tariff initially "to meet the legitimate concerns"
over low-priced imports.</TE>
<TE>   * Telling foreign steel companies higher tariffs would be imposed if
they do not help deal with the import issue.</TE>
<TE>   * Getting Congress to help meet steelworker health-care and retirement
costs, to allow modernization of the U.S. industry.</TE>
<TE>   "These decisions in trade are always multifaceted and require one to
be a fairly adroit high-wire walker," Kantor said.</TE>
<TE>   The domestic political pressure surrounding the steel issue is
demonstrated by the prominence the Weirton steel plant in West Virginia
has played in two recent campaigns. As a presidential candidate in 1992,
Clinton stopped at the plant to pledge to keep foreign companies from
selling cheap steel in the United States. He won the state.</TE>
<TE>   Then as a president promoting free trade, he fought pressure for
protectionist tariffs. In the 2000 campaign, Cheney visited the same city
on behalf of the GOP ticket and declared: "If our trading partners
violate trade laws, we will respond swiftly and firmly and enforce our
laws."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush ticket carried West Virginia--typically a Democratic-leaning
state--with a 40,000-vote margin.</TE>
<TE>   After their no-votes-to-spare-victory in the 2000 race, Bush and
Cheney are paying sharp heed to the needs of other key states where
steelworkers are a potent political force.</TE>
<TE>   The industry and workers have not been shy about using their muscle.</TE>
<TE>   The "Stand Up for Steel" rally on the Ellipse south of the White House
on Thursday was preceded by a radio and television advertising campaign
reminding Bush of his promises to protect the industry, while presenting
the need for a strong domestic steel industry as a national security
issue.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side is the argument that obstacles to trade--tariffs or
quotas--have been used to try to help the domestic steel industry for
roughly three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems obvious more protection won't solve the problem," said David
Phelps, president of the American Institute of International Steel Inc.,
which represents companies in the international steel trade.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Allow Tests of 2 Tire Warning Systems</HD>
<DH>Transit: Direct pressure check of all four wheels will compete with
a less-accurate monitoring device. The move appears to settle a safety
dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The federal government will conduct what amounts to a massive road
test of competing dashboard warning systems that alert drivers when their
tires get dangerously low on air, Bush administration officials told
Congress on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, announced at a congressional oversight hearing, appears
to resolve a dispute between safety officials and the White House, which
had threatened to delay new consumer protections.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, lawmakers said the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration still has far to go in carrying out sweeping safety
improvements enacted after the deadly spate of Firestone tire failures
two years ago. Several major initiatives have encountered problems,
although the agency has pledged to resolve them.</LD>
<TE>   Separately Thursday, NHTSA issued proposed regulations to update
federal tire safety standards that have not been revised since the 1960s.
The new regulations call for more rigorous performance testing that takes
into account high-speed driving, under-inflated tires and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups and some lawmakers have long pushed for a monitoring
system to warn drivers of under-inflated tires, which can increase the
chances of a catastrophic blowout.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators at NHTSA have proposed a tire pressure monitoring system
that would directly check all four tires. A warning light on the
dashboard would alert the driver if there is a problem.</TE>
<TE>   But a White House office that has final say on new regulations refused
to sign off on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Officials there believe that a cheaper, less-accurate alternative
supported by some auto makers deserves a closer look. That system would
encourage auto makers to equip more vehicles with anti-lock brakes, which
help prevent skids and shorten stopping distance in an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   The less-expensive system monitors differences in wheel rotation,
which may be caused by low tire pressure. However, if all four tires lose
pressure at the same rate, the system favored by the White House would
not warn the driver.</TE>
<TE>   Under the compromise, auto makers will be allowed to offer either
system in new vehicles through the 2006 model year, and performance data
will be used to make a final decision. NHTSA's original proposal would
not have required the more sophisticated system until 2007 anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in harmony here," said NHTSA Administrator Jeffrey Runge,
noting that final details of the compromise are still being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Both types of systems are currently available on a limited number of
models. Luxury models such as the Lincoln Continental and Lexus SC 430
offer the system being proposed by NHTSA. Family vehicles such as the
Toyota Sienna and Ford Windstar offer the less-expensive alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers of both parties served notice that they oppose watering down
the safety bill.</TE>
<TE>   The White House "is not an agency with vehicle safety expertise," said
Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). "So I hope it
will be cautious when it decides to wade into vehicle safety debates." In
a statement, Tauzin said that a monitoring system that might fail to warn
in certain cases "is simply unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   "We have to move to the technology that is going to provide the safer,
more accurate warning to American families," said Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.). "This can't be something that is used by the industry to
achieve delays."</TE>

<HD>Tapes Show Blunt Side of Nixon White House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When President Nixon's ambassador to France got roaring drunk and
began groping the female flight attendants on a trip home from Paris, the
president didn't see that much to get excited about.</LD>
<LD>   "Look, people get drunk," Nixon said after a Jack Anderson column
regaled readers with a graphic account of Ambassador Arthur Watson's
behavior on a March 1972 flight to Washington. "People chase girls. And
the point is, it's a . . . lot better for them to get drunk than to take
drugs. It's better to chase girls than boys.</LD>
<LD>   "Now that's my position and let's stop this . . ," Nixon declared at a
March 14, 1972, Oval Office meeting with his chief of staff, H.R.
Haldeman. "Understand?"</LD>
<TE>   The episode, which prompted Democratic congressional demands for an
investigation and Watson's resignation, is one of thousands chronicled on
426 hours of White House tapes released Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The new batch deals with the tumultuous first half of 1972, which
included Nixon's historic trip to China, a fierce battle over the
Democratic presidential nomination, and an assassination attempt that
crippled Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace at the height of his popularity.
The tapes also included what the White House sought to dismiss as a
"third-rate burglary" at the Democratic National Committee headquarters
in the Watergate complex.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, in a discussion with national security advisor Henry A.
Kissinger about intensified bombing of North Vietnam, Nixon abruptly
suggested a nuclear strike. But he may have just been trying to get a
rise out of Kissinger, who quickly played down the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Nixon kept a shrewd eye on the Democrats who wanted to
challenge his reelection. He frequently expressed bafflement over
Democrats' embrace of Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota, who won
the nomination. More worried about Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, who never entered the race, Nixon dismissed McGovern with
expletives and called him a "socialist with a blind spot for communists."</TE>
<TE>   "The Democratic Party is going through the throes of a suicide, which
is fine," former Treasury Secretary John B. Connally told Nixon on May 9,
1972, after Connally had become head of Democrats for Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   Both talked of the nation's chaotic, antiwar mood. The president said
the news media was "one of the major culprits" in creating the
negativism.</TE>
<TE>   Talk shifted to what Nixon, "without getting into any anti-Semitism,"
described as the inordinate influence of "a terrible liberal Jewish
clique." Connally said there was too much of it in government as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh! Oh, God!" Nixon said with a sigh. "It erodes our confidence, our
strength. They're untrustworthy. . . . Look at the Justice Department,
it's full of Jews."</TE>
<TE>   "Any place of power," Connally agreed. "[The Securities and Exchange
Commission] used to be--all of them, those lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, the lawyers in government are . . . Jews," Nixon said.</TE>
<TE>   Both agreed that Nixon should try to reduce the Jewish influence in a
second term. Nixon told Connally on May 15 that he wanted no more than 2%
of the government's political appointees to be Jewish, in proportion to
the population. He later said 10% would be acceptable, "but certainly not
30% or 40%."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon kept such views closely held. In a June 21, 1972, meeting with
Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur F. Burns, the president listened quietly
as Burns told him of "a profound change" in Jewish attitudes toward
Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm talking about the Wall Street Jews," Burns said. "They're going
to vote Republican and they're going to contribute substantial sums. They
already have."</TE>
<TE>   Burns, who was Jewish, told Nixon, "In all the years that I have known
you, I have never heard of what even remotely resembles what could be
interpreted as a touch of anti-Semitism or anti-Catholicism."</TE>

<HD>Mobster's Son Pleads Guilty After FBI Taps Into Computer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>The son of Philadelphia's former mob boss pleaded guilty to
bookmaking charges Thursday in a landmark case in which FBI agents tapped
into his computer with a surveillance system that has national security
uses.</LD>
<LD>   Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 36, relented after losing court battles to
suppress the gambling records that the FBI secretly obtained from his
computer through the "key-logger" system.</LD>
<LD>   The case attracted attention from privacy advocates, who said the
system could be used to spy on computer users.</LD>
<TE>   Scarfo faces about three years in prison at his sentencing June 10.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the government dropped a loan-sharking charge,
letting Scarfo plead to running a sports book operation.</TE>
<TE>   Agents broke into Scarfo's office in Belleville and installed the
system on his computer. The system unlocked encrypted files and let FBI
agents record keystrokes, yielding a record of the entire gambling and
loan-sharking operation.</TE>
<TE>   Scarfo maintained the government needed to disclose all of the details
of the system to determine whether the bugging was illegal. He got some
relief in the fall, when authorities were forced by a federal judge to
release an unclassified summary of the key-logger system.</TE>
<TE>   The judge did not require full disclosure, after authorities claimed
it would hurt criminal and national security operations.</TE>
<TE>   The final blow for Scarfo came Dec. 26. U.S. District Judge Nicholas
H. Politan ruled that agents needed only the search warrant they had.</TE>
<TE>   Scarfo's father, the former Philadelphia-Atlantic City mob boss known
as "Little Nicky," is in prison.</TE>

<HD>Private Educators Muted on Vouchers</HD>
<DH>Schools: Choice is favored, but among more exclusive institutions,
the government subsidies aren't touted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Whether to fund private schools with public money is a question
that divides educators just as sharply as U.S. Supreme Court justices,
who are considering a Cleveland program that allows children to attend
religious schools at government expense.</LD>
<LD>   But the divide among educators is not simply between the public
sector, which complains that school vouchers sap already struggling
neighborhood schools, and the private sector, which stands to benefit
from the windfall of government money. Rather, private educators, in
particular, express nuanced opinions of school vouchers.</LD>
<LD>   Many in private education support vouchers as a way to give parents,
especially those with low incomes, more say in their children's
education. And while they do not typically include it in their arguments,
vouchers, even if they cover just part of tuition, bring money and
students to private schools that might need both.</LD>
<TE>   But particularly at the more selective--and more expensive--private
schools, educators say they favor "school choice" but stop short of
pushing for vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   Largely free to operate as they please, the independent schools don't
want the government regulation that might come with the money and, more
practically, they can't withstand a flood of students who can afford only
a few thousand dollars of the $15,000 tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the high-end schools don't want to advocate programs that might
benefit one type of school to the detriment of another.</TE>
<TE>'Aversion' to Seeming to Lure Public Students</TE>
<TE>   "There is an aversion to supporting something that might give the
appearance that we are trying to lure even more students away from the
public sector," said Thomas Hudnut, headmaster of Harvard-Westlake School
in Los Angeles and one of more than 3,000 independent school educators
meeting this week in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The voucher issue is on educators' minds because of a case from
Cleveland heard Feb. 20 by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The justices are expected to rule by late June on whether paying for
church-related schooling with public money compromises the Constitution's
doctrine of separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the Cleveland program argue that it is legal because
parents, not the government, choose where to apply the vouchers, which
are worth as much as $2,250 yearly for each child. Largely because of
their lower tuition, religious schools have been the choice for 99% of
voucher students, drawing opposition to the program from public school
teacher unions, education groups and free speech and civil rights
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The justices' questions during the case's argument suggested a slim
majority favors upholding the six-year-old program. A victory for the
pro-voucher side could encourage other states to subsidize nonpublic
schools, so those in private education are watching the case closely.</TE>
<TE>   Florida already has three statewide programs that offer money for
students to attend private schools, but there too it has largely been
religious schools that have admitted the students--and reaped the
windfall. Only a few of the state's independent private schools have
participated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have encouraged our [independent] schools to look at the programs
carefully before they buy into them, because we're all concerned about
the question of accountability," said C. Skardon Bliss, executive
director of the Florida Council of Independent Schools. For example, the
council does not want the state to impose standardized testing on its
schools that receive voucher money, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also concerned about governmental regulation is the National Assn. of
Independent Schools, the group holding its annual conference in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of more than 1,200 nonprofit private schools, the NAIS filed
a friend of the court brief with the Supreme Court generally supporting
more options for parents. But the association does not support programs
that extend vouchers to all parents regardless of their income, as did a
California initiative rejected by voters in 2000.</TE>
<TE>Aid Should Target 'Needs of the Poorest'</TE>
<TE>   "We support educational choice--but the real issue is making sure
money doesn't get drained off the public schools," said Debra Wilson,
staff attorney for the NAIS.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Catholic schools, which have received many of the Cleveland
students bearing vouchers, support programs tied to families' incomes,
said Ned Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that any serious voucher program in a society should focus
on the needs of the poorest first," which is why California's Catholic
schools also opposed the Proposition 38 voucher initiative.</TE>

<HD>Bush Again Pushes Stock Investments for Social Security</HD>
<DH>Savings: President restates his initiative as part of the reform of
retirement programs. But he doesn't call for Congress to act this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Thursday renewed his call to allow workers to
invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock
market, but he sought to deprive Democrats of a favored campaign issue by
not urging Congress to act this year.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Bush merely promoted his plan to partially privatize Social
Security in the larger context of ensuring retirement security.</LD>
<LD>   The call for reform of retirement programs gained new prominence after
the recent collapse of Enron Corp., which left many of the energy firm's
employees with virtually worthless company-sponsored retirement accounts.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans long have clashed over how to reform Social
Security--which was created in 1935--while actually doing very little.
This year may be no different, judging by Thursday's rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   In a luncheon address at a Labor Department-sponsored summit on
retirement security, Bush also touted his recently unveiled
pension-reform proposals as he alluded to the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent months we've seen how workers can lose a lifetime worth of
savings if their company were to fail," the president said. "So my
administration has proposed reforms to make sure that the money Americans
put away in their working years grows safely so it is available in their
retirement years."</TE>
<TE>   In separate remarks at the National Summit on Retirement Savings,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sought to inject a note of
reassurance into the increasingly partisan debate over Social Security
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot imagine a viable political scenario in which full payment of
benefits will not be forthcoming," he said. "Does anyone doubt that
Congress would prevent benefits from being curtailed if the trust fund
were depleted?"</TE>
<TE>   Even before Bush spoke, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
mocked the president's proposals as "retirement insecurity." And he
accused Republicans of intentionally delaying Social Security reform
because they want to hide the fact that workers would lose benefits under
the GOP approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think it ought to be postponed until after the election,"
Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the Capitol, House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Democrats would try to bring up Bush's Social
Security reform plan for a vote. "I think it's essential," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Bush is not alone in his desire to partially privatize
Social Security, which would give workers the option of using some of
their payroll taxes to create personal savings accounts whose investments
they would control.</TE>
<TE>   This week, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas called on his GOP
colleagues to embrace this approach.</TE>
<TE>   But many Republicans have been lukewarm in their reaction to the
president's plan. Historically, Democrats have staged significant
political gains by portraying Republicans as hostile to Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush pressed his case Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people like their Social Security exactly the way it is. And
they'll be able to keep it exactly the way it is," he said in his
luncheon address.</TE>
<TE>   "But for younger workers who want to take advantage of the power of
compounding interest, we should allow for personal retirement accounts."</TE>
<TE>   According to the president, the average return on Social Security is
less than 2%, and the program in the long run pays retirees less than 30%
of what they earned before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's not good enough. . . . We can do better," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there'll be an expanding number of retirees for Social
Security [to] support in the future, we must apply the power of savings,
investing and compound interest to the challenges of Social Security by
introducing personal retirement accounts into the system. Americans would
own these assets. After all, it is their money."</TE>

<HD>Bush Began 'Shadow Government' Hours After Sept. 11 Attacks</HD>
<DH>Defense: At least 75 senior officials work in secret outside D.C.
in case of an assault on the capital. The plan dates to the Eisenhower
era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has activated Cold War-era plans for a
"shadow government" consisting of 75 or more senior officials who live
and work secretly outside Washington in case the capital is crippled by
terrorist attack, a senior government official said Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the operation
has been in effect since the first hours after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but has evolved over
time.</LD>
<LD>   Originally designed to help the government withstand Cold War nuclear
threats, the shadow government plan was activated out of heightened fears
that the Al Qaeda terrorist network might obtain a portable nuclear
weapon. U.S. intelligence has no specific knowledge of such a weapon, but
the risk was great enough to warrant the activation of the plan, which
dates to the Eisenhower administration, the official said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the classified Continuity of Operations Plan, first reported by
the Washington Post in today's editions, high-ranking officials
representing their departments have begun rotating in and out of the
assignment at one of two fortified locations along the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Post said the first rotations were made in late October or early
November, a fact confirmed by a senior government official late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials who are activated for the duty live and work underground 24
hours a day, away from their families, according to the Post report. The
shadow government has sent home most of the first wave of deployed
personnel, replacing them most commonly at 90-day intervals.</TE>
<TE>   A government official said the groups usually number 70 to 150 people,
depending on the level of threat detected by intelligence groups. He said
President Bush does not foresee ever needing to activate the secret
government operation but believed it was prudent to implement the
long-standing plan in light of the gathering war on terrorism and
persistent threats of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The team, drawn from every Cabinet department and some independent
agencies, would seek to prevent the collapse of essential government
functions in the event of a disabling blow to Washington, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The underground government would try to contain disruptions of the
nation's food and water supplies, transportation links, energy and
telecommunications networks, public health and civil order, the Post
reported. Later, it would begin to reconstitute the government.</TE>
<TE>   The government-in-waiting is an extension of a policy that has kept
Vice President Dick Cheney in secure undisclosed locations away from
Washington. Cheney has moved in and out of public view as threat levels
have fluctuated.</TE>
<TE>   As first in the line of succession to power behind Bush, he would need
help running the government in a worst-case scenario.</TE>
<TE>   "We take this issue extraordinarily seriously and are committed to
doing as thorough a job as possible to ensure the ongoing operations of
the federal government," Joseph W. Hagin, White House deputy chief of
staff, told the Post, though he declined to discuss details. "In the case
of the use of a weapon of mass destruction, the federal government would
be able to do its job and continue to provide key services and respond."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Post, the backup government consists generally of
officials from top career ranks, from GS-14 and GS-15 to members of the
Senior Executive Service. The White House is represented by a
"senior-level presence," one official said, but well below such
Cabinet-ranked advisors as Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. and national
security advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Many departments, including Justice and Treasury, have completed plans
to delegate statutory powers to officials who would not normally exercise
them, the Post said. Others do not need to make such legal transfers or
are holding them in reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The report said civilians deployed for the operation are not allowed
to take their families and may not tell anyone where they are going or
why.</TE>
<TE>   The two sites of the shadow government make use of local geological
features to render them highly secure, the Post said. They are well
stocked with food, water, medicine and other supplies, and are capable of
generating their own power.</TE>

<HD>FBI Discounts Terrorist Link in Salt Lake Outage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>FBI investigators concluded Thursday that an electrical outage in
Salt Lake City on the last day of the Winter Olympics was caused by a
fairly powerful explosive device, but they do not believe the Games were
the target or that terrorists were responsible.</LD>
<LD>   "We could be looking at a disgruntled employee, we could be looking at
a prankster, someone looking to cause a nuisance," said Don Johnson,
special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City's FBI office. "We don't
know. But we have skulduggery here."</LD>
<LD>   The explosion about 10 a.m. Sunday knocked out a circuit breaker at a
power substation 1 1/2 miles from Salt Lake International Airport,
cutting electricity to about 33,000 homes in the area for about an hour
and later sparking a fire at a nearby oil refinery.</LD>
<TE>   No one was hurt, and the outage did not disrupt any operations at the
airport or at the closing ceremonies of the Games, which were held eight
hours later at Rice-Eccles Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   However, investigators thought the explosion was suspicious from the
outset. A hole was apparently cut in a fence at the Utah Power &amp; Light
Terminal substation, which had 24-hour security during the Olympics, and
indentations in metal near the site of the explosion indicated a possible
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is continuing, Johnson said. However, early evidence
"indicates it had nothing to do with the Olympics, it was not a terrorist
attack," because the circuit breaker that was damaged did not affect
power for Olympic venues and authorities received no claims of
responsibility or intelligence reports indicating that terrorists might
have been involved.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that investigators are awaiting the results of tests on
possible explosive residue from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   But he said investigators concluded Thursday from other evidence that
the explosion was not caused by a mechanical or equipment failure and
that it appeared to have been triggered by "a highly explosive device."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the circuit breaker was jolted out of place. "It's
pretty heavy. It would take a pretty good charge to move it."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
are leading the investigation. Authorities are asking anyone with
information to call (888) ATF-BOMB.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion was one of only a few episodes posing a security risk
during the 17 days of the Olympic Games, despite unparalleled concern
about possible terrorist attacks as a result of the Sept. 11 hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996 were marred by a bomb
at Centennial Park in downtown Atlanta, which killed one person and
injured more than 100. The main suspect in that bombing, survivalist Eric
Rudolph, has never been caught.</TE>

to America and his mistreatment after his arrival, testified before a
Senate panel Thursday on the need for U.S. officials to help juveniles
who come to this country unaccompanied by an adult.</LD>
<LD>   Edwin Munoz, 15, said he was abandoned by his parents at age 7 in
Honduras and then beaten by the cousin in whose care he was left. He
escaped at age 13, hitchhiking alone to the United States, only to be
thrown into a San Diego juvenile facility filled with violent offenders,
where he was taunted by other inmates, brought to court in shackles, and
for weeks had no lawyer or court-appointed guardian to assist in his
case.</LD>
<LD>   "The officers did not know why I or other children picked up by the
[Immigration and Naturalization Service] were being held there," Edwin
testified in Spanish. "They treated us the same as the others, as
criminals. Many of the other boys were violent, frequently looking for a
fight."</LD>
<TE>   As many as 5,000 children a year immigrate to the United States
without an adult, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) at Thursday's
subcommittee hearing on a proposal to establish an Office of Children's
Services to coordinate and implement laws for unaccompanied immigrant
children. The problem highlights the inherent conflict in holding the INS
responsible for the welfare of children while requiring the agency to
enforce immigration laws against them.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot continue to allow children who come to our country--often
traumatized and guilty of no crime--to be held in jails and treated like
criminals," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) agreed that a conflict of interest
exists in the INS. "Many convincingly argue that the competing
responsibilities of prosecuting and caring for these children make
impartial consideration of the children's best interest impossible," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A children's services office, independent of the INS, would be created
under the "Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act" introduced by
Feinstein last year. A companion bill has been introduced in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The measure calls for minimum custody standards, and an ordered list
of caretakers for children that would seek to place them with family
members or foster parents first. The bill also proposes appointing
guardians for the children and ensuring legal representation through pro
bono services or appointed counsel. Detention in facilities would be a
last resort.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has proposed its own Office of Juvenile Affairs as part of a
restructuring of the agency into separate service and enforcement
branches.</TE>
<TE>   An INS official testifying Thursday acknowledged a problem and wanted
to work with the committee, but said that the new INS office would
properly care for children and act more quickly than any separate office
requiring legislative approval.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good people who care deeply that children coming into the
system are treated fairly," said INS associate commissioner Stuart
Anderson. "INS Commissioner [James W.] Ziglar has no vested interest in
maintaining the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said the average unaccompanied minor immigrant was placed
with a parent, relative or other caretaker after about 43 days of
detention.</TE>
<TE>   However, Feinstein and Kennedy, along with Sen. Sam Brownback
(R-Kan.), said far too many children are falling through the cracks. "I'm
hearing from too many people in too many places that there are too many
problems," Brownback said.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration advocates urged passage of the bill, saying they had more
than enough capacity to place children in foster care rather than
detention facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Child welfare principles should guide our treatment of unaccompanied
alien children," said Julianne Duncan, director of children's services
for the U.S. Conference on Catholic Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates want to see more children end up like Edwin, who eventually
got a court-appointed lawyer and was placed with a foster family in
Michigan. Granted asylum and attending middle school, he said he wants to
be an FBI agent when he grows up.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy that there are now people like you who care to help
children like me," the teen told the senators.</TE>

<HD>Bush Team Thwarted in 2 Energy Panel Lawsuits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration was thwarted on two fronts Thursday as it
battled lawsuits seeking to pry secrets out of Vice President Dick
Cheney's energy task force.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan said, "I assume the government
is stalling" in one case, and U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman
scoffed at the administration's argument that another case should be
thrown out of court. Both suits were filed by Judicial Watch, a
conservative group.</LD>
<LD>   The White House is trying to avoid having to identify business
executives and lobbyists the Cheney task force met with as the
administration formulated its energy plan a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   The judges' comments follow criticism of the Bush administration by a
third judge, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler, who said the Energy
Department is moving at a "glacial pace" in a lawsuit filed by an
environmental group to produce documents on Cheney's task force. Kessler
ordered the department to release documents starting March 25. Documents
the department withholds must be identified individually in a list to be
made public by April 25, which would set the stage for a next round in
the court battle.</TE>
<TE>   At a court hearing Thursday, Justice Department lawyer Dan Bensing,
citing timing issues, said Friedman should dismiss the Judicial Watch
lawsuit seeking documents from all federal agencies that were members of
Cheney's task force.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just gamesmanship," Friedman said. In nine months, he said,
the Bush administration's Cabinet agencies have turned over almost no
documents and are withholding tens of thousands of pages from public
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan reluctantly gave the government seven more days to file
written arguments on why the Cheney task force should be allowed to
withhold all documents. The government had asked for 17 extra days.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth lawsuit, seeking records filed by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also is pending.</TE>

<HD>Study Examines Effect of Welfare Programs on Teens</HD>
<DH>Society: Findings come as Congress and the states begin a debate
about whether to renew or change benefits law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New research examining the well-being of children under welfare
reform suggests that teenagers perform worse in school when their mothers
go to work, possibly because they are left with household chores and
baby-sitting.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, grade-school children seem to benefit from mothers
working as long as their families continue to receive some level of
government financial aid.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, to be released today by a national research group, are
among the first cautious indicators that specific welfare policies can
affect the emotional, social and educational progress of children.</LD>
<TE>   And they come as Congress and the states begin to debate whether to
renew or change the nation's 1996 welfare reform law, which imposed
stricter work rules and lifetime limits on benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the New York-based Manpower Demonstration Research Corp.
appears to support the value of policies that supplement the wages of
working families with ongoing financial aid and loosen time limits for
parents who are trying to meet work requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "The broadest implication is that welfare policies do matter for
children," said co-author Virginia Knox, a senior research associate at
the Manpower organization.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that young children benefit from welfare programs that
supplement the incomes their families earn at work.</TE>
<TE>   The gains those youngsters made in school were analogous to increasing
their scores on achievement tests from the 25th to the 30th percentile
and appeared to be long-lasting, according to the study. The children's
behavior and health also improved.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like families are spending the extra money on food, clothing
and especially child care, and that may be one of the ways their income
is benefiting children," said lead author Pamela Morris.</TE>
<TE>   However, the studies found that when mothers went to work, their older
children were burdened with more household chores and child-care
responsibilities that harmed their school work. Specifically, a higher
proportion of teens whose parents participated in work programs (as
opposed to those in control groups) were likely to repeat a grade or be
enrolled in special education classes, although they were no likelier to
have been suspended or to have dropped out of school.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the authors said, the supposed positive attributes of
work don't appear to improve parenting skills, reduce maternal depression
or boost the mother's or children's self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   "Welfare reform programs may not undermine participation in school,
but they do affect the academic progress of youth who are already at
considerable risk of not completing school," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The study suggests that expansion of mentoring and after-school
programs for adolescents and greater reliance on child-care centers for
their younger siblings could ease some of the strain.</TE>
<TE>   The report looked at studies of 16 welfare and work programs,
including ones in Los Angeles and Riverside counties, that surveyed 9,500
elementary school children and 6,000 teenagers over several years.</TE>
<TE>   The well-being of children is emerging as a key issue as policymakers
consider reauthorizing welfare laws that expire this year and as more
single mothers are thrust into the work force during a weakened economy.
The Bush administration is proposing that states implement stricter work
requirements, which critics contend could harm children whose parents are
forced into low-paying, dead-end jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees
welfare programs, did not return a call seeking comment on the study.</TE>
