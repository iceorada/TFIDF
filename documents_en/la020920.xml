<LD>A small gasp escaped the tidy crowd of interior designers and
architects as workers assembled the green room for the 54th Annual
Emmy Awards backstage at the Shrine Auditorium. "It's the unrolling
of the Sotheby's carpet!" whispered one man from Architectural
Digest. (The magazine enlisted a New York firm to design the room.)
"It's insured for $60,000."</LD>
<LD>   Here, on this antique Persian rug, on mocha-colored sofas in this
largely beige room (sea grass carpets, grass cloth walls and a 19th
century Japanese screen), Sunday night's Emmy presenters and
performers will pass time before their cues. Outside, the stage was
crawling with denim-clad workers and the hall echoed with the whine
of a table saw. Occasionally a Steely Dan song burst from speakers
overhead, filling the cavernous hall. "It's beautiful in here, huh?"
one woman said. The Shrine's hardwood floors shone, the ceiling
paintings looked more vivid and the whole place (built circa 1926)
smelled new, thanks to a recent, $3-million renovation.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond the stage, a few women carefully placed name cards on some
of the auditorium's 6,200 red velvet seats. Proximity to the front of
the room, as always, delineated status. Ellen DeGeneres' card sat in
the third row, while those for Laura Linney and Jimmy Smits sat in
the eighth. Alec Baldwin's card sat in the fourth row, with Anjelica
Huston's behind him in the fifth. Producers for "Everybody Loves
Raymond" were posted in several rows closer to the stage than those
for HBO's "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, the women's restrooms were being redesigned by
Lancome's crew, complete with glowing makeup mirrors, lipstick and
powder bars and a makeup artist. "If Lancome was a woman, this would
be her powder room," a spokeswoman said. On Emmy night, a visit to
the ladies room means a professional touch-up and, of course, a gift
bag.</TE>
<TE>   But glamour is transient. And by Monday evening, it will have
rolled up its rug, hovering in wait for its next stop in this long,
long season of awards, ceremonies, fabulous free gifts....</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Brian Show</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was on their feet, and even seemingly disaffected
celebrities such as actors David Spade and Owen Wilson were dancing
in the aisles and singing along. "How often at concerts does everyone
know all the words to all the songs?" one woman shouted to an
acquaintance. But because the evening's performers were Paul
McCartney and Brian Wilson, familiarity was a given.</TE>
<TE>   For about two hours Wednesday night, in front of an adoring crowd
of about 900 at the Century Plaza Hotel, McCartney and Wilson
performed individual sets that featured their hits--etched in the
brain over 30 years. The show, which also featured a brief acoustic
set by Stephen Stills, was a fund-raiser for "Adopt-A-Minefield," a
charity that McCartney's wife, Heather Mills, has supported for
nearly three years, and tickets cost up to $1,000. (Wednesday's event
raised $750,000 for the group, which organizes mine clearance and
survivor assistance.)</TE>
<TE>   McCartney performed one new tune, written for "my beautiful
bride." It was an upbeat piece, but the lyrics-- featuring lines such
as "Tell me how to reach your love" and "What am I gonna do without
you?"--didn't jibe with the public image of his marriage.</TE>
<TE>   During Wilson's protracted vocal set, someone shouted out,
"Genius!" And just before McCartney performed "Blackbird," another
fan cried: "Run for president!" The former Beatle wagged his finger
at the man and said: "Now that's silly. You know it's silly."</TE>
<TE>   Rubbing Shoulders</TE>
<TE>   "I hit the phones in a panic," said Sir Howard Stringer as he
stood outside the ballroom on another evening at the Century Plaza.
Working the phones, Stringer would remind friends of the quid pro quo
of fund-raising: "I've done this for you."</TE>
<TE>   "Your worst fear is that no one shows up," he said. "I don't want
to be in a ballroom all alone."</TE>
<TE>   As chairman and CEO of Sony Corp. of America, he needn't have
worried. On Tuesday night, the hotel was teeming with Sony suits who
had come for the annual Dinner of Champions--an evening to honor
Stringer for his time on the phone raising funds for multiple
sclerosis research. It was also, of course, another chance for
networking.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sherak, a partner in Revolution Studios and chairman of the
dinner, made his way down the red carpet.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry just gives and gives and gives," he said, with no
trace of irony. He was interrupted by a man who had something to
give. "Hey, handsome," he greeted Sherak, with a handshake and a
macho air kiss.</TE>
<TE>   On the red carpet, Tom Arnold faced a dilemma: More face time with
a camera crew or pay his respects to the Sony head honcho? He decided
to throw himself into Stringer's arms.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bill Pullman made his way past the cameras. He had noticed
the prevalence of suits. "Hey, it's Sony Corp.," he said. "Maybe it's
all their compassionate men."</TE>
<TE>   Sightings:</TE>
<TE>   A divine fashion statement: The Inland Invasion punk music
festival last Saturday in Devore offered plenty of tattered shirts,
piercings and Dickies, but the best shirt of the day belonged to
Dexter Holland, the Offspring lead singer: "Even Jesus hates Creed."</TE>

<LD>OF MOTHS AND MEN</LD>
<LD>   An Evolutionary Tale: The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered
Moth</LD>
<LD>   by Judith Hooper</LD>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   378 pp., $26.95</TE>
<TE>   "Of Moths and Men" can serve as an elegant introduction to the
method of science and the ways of scientists. Judith Hooper tells the
intricate tale of how a British scientist's supposed "proof" of
Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was a staple of natural science
for years until an American scientist looked again and found the
proof wanting.</TE>
<TE>   The subject is the blackening of the peppered moth in the
industrial areas of Britain. The moth was seen, starting in about
1850, to become blacker than its dominant color of gray/white in
parts of Britain blackened by industrial smoke. The change toward the
darker color is called melanism.</TE>
<TE>   Was this an example of Darwinian natural selection at work? H.B.D.
(Bernard) Kettlewell, an English doctor for whom catching and
studying moths and butterflies was a passion bordering on the
obsessive, thought so and tried to prove it. In 1953 he studied
peppered moths in two locations, a smoke-blackened wood near
Birmingham and in an unspoiled wood in Dorset.</TE>
<TE>   He found, or thought he found, a higher incidence of blackened
moths among the smoke-blackened trees and a lower incidence in the
unpolluted ones. He discovered further, or thought he discovered,
that the blackened moths near Birmingham escaped being eaten by birds
by resting during daylight hours, when they are inactive, on the
darker parts of trees. Hence, he reasoned, the blacker moths were
evolving before his very eyes. The blacker the moths in the blackened
woods, the more easily they would survive to perpetuate the species.</TE>
<TE>   What Kettlewell presented to the world in scientific journals was
believed to be of great importance, because Darwin's great theory is
easier to infer from what has happened than to observe what is
happening now. Before long, photographs of Kettlewell's peppered
moths were being widely published in textbooks as a neat example of
Darwinism caught in the act.</TE>
<TE>   Alas for Kettlewell's experiment, but fortunately for science,
which lives by self-correction, Theodore David Sargent, now a
professor emeritus of biology at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, tried from 1965 to 1969 to replicate the part of
Kettlewell's experiment that showed how moths choose on which part of
a tree trunk to alight. Sargent couldn't do it. He found that the
moths' resting places were not matters of individual choice, as
Kettlewell believed, but were genetically determined. Other
naturalists showed that birds do not pick moths from tree trunks.</TE>
<TE>   Sargent went on to examine records of Kettlewell's experiment
closely, as few others had done. Sargent found, essentially, that
Kettlewell fiddled with his experiments until he got the results
he--consciously or subconsciously--wanted. Was it fraud?</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't have to be fraud," Sargent told Hooper. "There are
subtle ways to seduce yourself," he said, describing one of the traps
inherent in scientific inquiry: The scientist can fool himself into
seeing what he wants to see, finding what he hopes to find.</TE>
<TE>   Hooper's tale is engrossing. Contemporary scientists increasingly
do not work alone, and she describes with finesse the milieus in
which Kettlewell especially and also Sargent did their work.
Kettlewell's was that of snobbish, high-table Oxford, in which, as a
gifted amateur, he never felt quite at home. He was dominated by the
powerful and haughty scientist E.B. Ford. An unhappy child,
Kettlewell lived a troubled life and committed suicide in 1979.
Despite the doubts about his major experiment, no one doubted that he
was a brilliant field naturalist in the British tradition of ardent
amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   Sargent, also a natural in the fields and woods, was also a kind
of odd man out, in part because he challenged the supremacy of the
peppered moth doctrine, Hooper says. She makes it clear that in
science as in other endeavors, the person who questions the
conventions of the day runs the risk of isolation.</TE>
<TE>   No creationist herself, Hooper regrets that those who to this day
discount, in the name of religion or from obscurer motives, the
Darwinian theory of natural selection, have seized upon the peppered
moth story as evidence for their causes. But she believes in the
scientific method, and, in that spirit, presents in "Of Moths and
Men" an illuminating story of men and science always groping toward a
better understanding of nature.</TE>

<LD>   You can make ice cream right at home with just a few materials
that you probably find around the house. It only takes minutes and is
lots of fun!</LD>
<LD>   Here is what you need: 1 cup of milk (whole milk works best); 2
tablespoons of sugar; 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract; a gallon-and a
quart-size resealable plastic bag; ice (about a cupful); 12
tablespoons of table salt.</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Place the salt and the ice inside the gallon-size baggie.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Place the milk, sugar and vanilla extract inside the
quart-size bag. Squeeze out all of the excess air and seal it very
carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Place the smaller bag inside the larger bag. Seal the
large bag very carefully!</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Go outside and shake the bag back and forth and all
around. It may help to wear gloves since you hands will get really
cold. Keep shaking for at least 5 minutes. The ice cream mixture in
the small bag will start to thicken. (If the mixture remains soupy,
add more ice.)</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Carefully unseal the large baggie and remove the baggie
filled with your ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Open it up and enjoy right from the baggie, or pour it
into a bowl and serve!</TE>
<TE>   How It Works: The chemical reactions between the salt and the ice
cause the ice cream mixture to become super-cool in minutes, creating
homemade ice cream right before your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   To have a "mooo-ving" learning experience, visit the 2002 L.A.
County Fair continuing through Sept. 29 in Pomona. Visit the Dairy
Education Center in FairView Farms and see real ice cream being made
in Dr. Bob's state-of-the-art ice-cream making plant. You can also
see real cows being milked at the Dairy Processing Plant and much
more. For more information call (909) 623-3111 or visit

<HD>From Ground Up, a Chronicle of Sweat, Steel</HD>
<DH>'Iron,' a book of photos by Gil Garcetti, pays tribute to
the workers building Disney Hall</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Fitzgerald's famous observation that American lives have no
second acts never really applied in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But even here, the curtain seldom has risen on a shift quite as
abrupt as that made by former Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. His
forthcoming book--"Iron: Erecting the Walt Disney Concert
Hall"--signals his emergence not only as an accomplished
architectural photographer, but also as an artist with a deeply
empathetic connection to working men and women.</LD>
<LD>   "Iron," which will be issued in November by Balcony Press, the
Glendale-based publisher of fine art and architecture books,
documents the work of the 130 structural ironworkers--129 men and one
woman--who built the staggeringly intricate metal framework on which
architect Frank O. Gehry's gleaming facade hangs.</LD>
<TE>   The project, which Garcetti depicts in more than 130 oversized
black and white photographs, involved 22 million pounds of primary
steel joined out of 12,500 individual pieces that range from 13
inches to 110 feet long. No two are identical, and some weigh 165,000
pounds. Placed end to end, they would stretch 49 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "This man Garcetti astounded me," said 92-year-old Julius Shulman,
one of America's best known architectural photographers, who first
saw the ex-D.A.'s work two weeks ago. "He is a great photographer. In
all my 66 years of work, I've never seen such an exciting statement
on the erection of steel. No one has done such a book before, and I
think it is going to create a sensation."</TE>
<TE>   No small tribute from the man whose career was launched by Richard
Neutra's patronage and who Frank Lloyd Wright once praised for his
unequaled ability to capture an architectural idea photographically.</TE>
<TE>   In the early summer of 2001, about a year after losing an election
to Steve Cooley, Garcetti, a passionate photographer for more than 30
years, happened to be passing the Disney construction site. He became
mesmerized not only by the sculptural intricacy of the multistory
armature rising above the street, but also by the men at working so
strenuously and at such peril high overhead. He parked his car, took
out his camera and began to shoot. He continued shooting until April,
when the completed steel structure began to disappear beneath the
building's shimmering skin.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a kick," Garcetti said. "I just enjoyed being there
and getting to know these amazing guys. I thought I would just make
the photos for myself and give them prints. But the ironworkers kept
telling me, 'You've got to do a book about this building.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Gerace, who is overseeing the archival work on the project
for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, asked to see the photos and urged
the former prosecutor, now lecturing on race and politics in the
criminal justice system at Harvard's Kennedy School, to take them to
Balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti's admiration for the ironworkers' craft is shared by
Gehry. In the book's foreword, Gehry notes that while architecture
has been transformed over the past 40 years, "the role of ironworkers
has changed very little .... Rarely has high-quality steel
fabrication been so crucial as with the Walt Disney Concert Hall."</TE>
<TE>   What the ironworkers--whom he calls "the forgotten heroes of
architecture"--put in place, Gehry writes, "is itself a work of art."</TE>
<TE>   Their feelings are reciprocal. "I think Gehry is the ironworkers'
hero," said Johnny O'Kane, who worked on Disney Hall. "Every
ironworker likes a good challenge, and Frank Gehry throws an awfully
good challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the workers didn't know Gehry by sight, but on one of his
visits to the project, apprentice ironworker Cliff Neves was
introduced to the Priztker Prize-winning architect and told him, "You
made a crazy, fun building."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti set out to capture that spirit of adventurous labor,
played out with elan and skill in the face of real danger. "In this
country, we don't give craftsmen and tradespeople the respect they
deserve," Garcetti said. "We don't respect as we should what we used
to call the dignity of labor."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the deep feeling so evident in Garcetti's photos of the
ironworkers at their job stems, he said, from his modest origins. "My
dad was completely uneducated but eventually became a barber. My mom
went to high school, and she became a meatpacker. The first job I can
remember wanting was garbage collector. They seemed to have such
strength and agility. More important, my dad told me they made good
money."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti said doubts about whether he had done justice to the
ironworkers initially made him reluctant to publish his photographs.
"In the back of my mind," he said, "I kept wondering whether these
photos were really good enough. I didn't want the workers insulted by
critics slapping my photos around."</TE>
<TE>   According to Shulman, he needn't have worried. "When I saw first
the prints of Gil's photos," he said, "I said to his wife that it's a
very rare thing for any photographer to achieve this. I told him,
'Garcetti, you've been in the wrong business. Your life has changed
forever and for the good. Leave everything else behind and take
pleasure in the inspiration you're going to give so many people.' "</TE>

<HD>Can He Make It as the Comeback Kid of Fashion Design?</HD>
<DH>Up one minute, down the next. Miguel Adrover is banking on
his upcoming show</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With a touch of bitterness, designer Miguel Adrover speaks of being a
rising star one season and not even mentioned the next. He's trying
to move on. "I need to believe in myself and my work and not pay
attention to others."</LD>
<LD>   Still, a successful comeback rides on his 20-minute show Saturday
night at the Bryant Park tents and the critical response to his
spring 2003 collection after missing a season. Hailed as the hot new
thing after his debut two years ago when he sent a coat made from pal
Quentin Crisp's mattress ticking down the runway, he scored what
every designer dreams of: a deep-pocketed backer.</LD>
<LD>   But no sooner had he signed on with Pegasus Apparel Group then
things soured. "They wanted to grow too fast," he said last week.
"This is not Coca-Cola."</LD>
<TE>   Working From Home</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Adrover ditched his corporate digs and severed his
relationship with the conglomerate. And now the 36-year-old son of an
almond farmer in Majorca, Spain, finds himself again working from
home and sinking nearly his entire savings ($45,000) into the
comeback show.</TE>
<TE>   Sewing through the night with four friends who help him after they
leave their day jobs, Adrover is so wound up, he barely has time to
eat.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to do the collection for us is a goal because we express
ourselves through clothes," he said from his Chrystie Street home
studio. "Right now, it's important for us to say something. More than
just if it was a quiet time. The world is going kind of crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Two days before last year's terrorist attacks, Adrover presented
his fifth collection, called Utopia, which was inspired by the Middle
East. With models in caftans and head-to-toe veils, the show had the
feel of an Arab souk. It was actually a statement about women, said
Adrover, who is half Arab and half Jewish and has traveled
extensively in Egypt. "I live in New York 14 years and I see how the
Western world mistreats women in ad campaigns, in entertainment, the
woman is always an object of sex and desire, not an intellectual on
the same level as a man."</TE>
<TE>   Like others, he was horrified by the World Trade Center attacks.
He remembers the day well. His father, Sebastian, was in town from
Spain for the show. While out at the market, he saw the first plane
hit. He woke his son to tell him that it didn't look like an
accident. "I despise people who use violence," Adrover says. "I lived
with terrorism in Spain; every day something would blow up."</TE>
<TE>   Selling at Discounters</TE>
<TE>   Even before his last show, the fashion press began to dismiss
Adrover and moved on to the next hot new designer. His clothes were
selling in Neiman Marcus but also were showing up on the racks at
discount retailer Loehmann's.</TE>
<TE>   Trends don't mean anything, the designer continues. "How many
people in this world look at fashion magazines? Twenty percent of the
population? So many people don't feel represented, they feel horrible
if they don't wear their hair a certain way or that they are not
beautiful if they are not skinny. That has to change."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he isn't interested in a new backer and in his own
perfume someday. "I'm good at perfumes," he says. His new collection,
dedicated to New York and to peace, will feature shoes, made by
Lottusse, based in his village. They will be the only reminder of
home; his father won't be making the trek. "He's still a little
afraid," Adrover says.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he and his volunteer design team continue to work day and
night. "I feel I have a lot of responsibility on my shoulders,"
Adrover says.</TE>

<KH>The Latin Grammys</KH>
<HD>The Runway of All Flesh</HD>
<DH>The emphasis is on the epidermal at an eye-popping music
awards show</DH>

<LD>They came dressed up and dressed down with a few cultural style
references--a charro ensemble, zoot suits and cowboy hat-adorned
tuxes at the third Latin Grammys on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   But mostly, as comedian Paul Rodriguez noted, the trend along the
red carpet (which really was green because of a Heineken beer
sponsorship) was cleavage.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandra Guzman, exuberant and tattooed (monkeys dancing around
one arm, the letter "A" on her neck) looked every bit the
award-winning rocker with punked-out hair, black fingernails and a
gothic spider-woman get-up--one shoulder encased in webbing, the rest
of her on the brink of spilling out of the short fringed black dress
with a train. "I told my designer in Mexico that I wanted to look
wild. I wanted to come to Hollywood and shock everybody."</LD>
<TE>   Thalia drew fan approval in a lavender "I Dream of Jeannie" lace
and chiffon creation with a head wrap. Soap star Eva Longoria turned
heads in a tight strapless red cocktail sheath, courtesy of the
wardrobe department at "The Young and the Restless." "I'll wear it on
the show next month sometime," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Actress and dancer Roselyn Sanchez wore a revealing chartreuse
Eduardo Lucero mini. "I wanted to wear something striking and said,
'Let's just do it!' " Which also meant she had to look lean and mean.
"And so the only thing I've eaten all day is a bag of Cheetos." Nelly
Furtado struck an elegant silhouette in a mustard-green Betsey
Johnson patchworkfloor-length silk gown, reminiscent of yesteryear
Hollywood. Sombrero-wearing ranchera singer Aida Cuevas chose a
creme-colored, silver embroidered two-piece charro outfit made in
Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the men donned tuxedos or trendy suits with
open-collared shirts--Hugo Boss the winning brand of the night on
Emilio Estefan, Jon Secada, Gian Marco and Noel Schajris of the duo
Sin Bandera.</TE>
<TE>   The rock en espanol posse such as the guys from Kinky broke
tradition with vintage outfits: a rose-embroidered cowboy shirt, a
ruffled shirt with ragged hems, a T-shirt with a tie painted on it
and a striped shirt embellished with rows of buttons.</TE>
<TE>   Banda Pachuco members dressed in tough guy zoot suits--knee-length
coats and high-waisted trousers complete with a cadena or long chain
attached to belt loops-- from Fullerton's El Pachuco shop. Willie
Oropeza said the band decided to go with the look "because we're not
embarrassed by it. This look is part of the history of East Los
Angeles. We wear these suits with pride."</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Cabas Is the Life of Latin Grammy Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several Colombian artists took home four Latin Grammys on
Wednesday night, Colombian best new artist nominee Andres Cabas
electrified the EMI Latin after-party at the House of Blues with a
riveting 45-minute performance that demonstrated the 24-year-old
singer-composer is here to stay.</LD>
<LD>   But more than an opportunity to showcase Cabas' inspiring
Caribbean fusion songs, the night was historic for his homeland.
"When I started in this business, I never dreamed that I'd be in this
space where I'd be showing America my thing, that special thing I
share with my people," said Carlos Vives, who turned the folksy
vallenato style of Colombia into an international rage in Latin music
and picked up two Grammys on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Most people never thought a night like tonight was possible. But
being here makes me think a lot about my country, and it moves me a
lot to know that people are seeing a side of Colombia they don't
normally see."</LD>
<TE>   Vives, a gracious celebrity known for his hippie style, tucked his
signature long curls in a black beanie and wore matching psychedelic
paisley pants and a T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   With unadulterated excitement, he spent the night mingling and
posing for photographs, hugging and kissing anyone who let him. The
only things that stopped him were performances by Mexican norteno
band Intocables and Mexican pianist and singer Alex Syntex, who
played before Cabas.</TE>
<TE>   The EMI Latin bash was a private affair for artists and VIPs on
the second floor of the House of Blues, but tickets were sold to fans
for the ground-floor area.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating her first Grammy, veteran singer Alejandra Guzman
danced wildly to the merengue sounds of Los Ilegales while exclaiming
that she only wanted to speak to people who don't know her.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists who made appearances were Mexican superstar and
nominee Thalia and husband, Sony Music chief Tommy Mottola;
producer-of-the-year winner Kike Santander and his wife; best banda
album winners Banda Cuisillos; and Mexican sensation Alejandro
Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Best new artist winner Jorge Moreno, 28, who was up against Cabas,
was still in a daze when he arrived at the party with his girlfriend
and brother.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Shocking' is not a good enough word," said the Cuban American
pop singer-songwriter. "I am enjoying this, but I'm not even sure
that I'm here yet."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago we asked for your feedback on back-to-school
shopping. This annual ritual can confound even the best-prepared
parents, considering the time involved in shopping for one or more
children, confusing school dress codes, the cost of clothing and the
availability of suitable (i.e., not overtly sexy) styles.</LD>
<LD>   From your responses, we know these things to be true: Many parents
and their children (especially girls) are dismayed at the dearth of
traditional, conservative styles and the plethora of tight, skimpy,
spangly ones; sales are always welcome but sometimes hard to come by;
national chain stores such as Target, Old Navy, Sears, JCPenney and
J. Crew are on most parents' go-to list, as are catalog companies
L.L. Bean and Lands' End; most kids have strong opinions when it
comes to their wardrobes, and many parents try to respect that;
fast-growing kids are especially difficult to shop for; and shopping
for clothes is sometimes treated as more than just a trip to the
mall--it's an important lesson about budgets and getting the most for
your money.</LD>
<LD>   On the subject of school uniforms, views were split evenly, with
some parents practically begging for them and others decrying them
for, well, their uniformity.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to all who submitted your well-thought-out and articulate
responses. On to your comments:</TE>
<TE>   I don't consider myself a prude--in fact, I'm fairly liberal. But
I don't want my 11-year-old daughter looking like a streetwalker. I
could find almost nothing for her in the stores except shorts that
barely covered her [bottom], shirts that looked as if she should be
at a disco instead of math class, and no dresses at all. I did find a
few brightly colored T-shirts at Sears, but I had to order the rest
of her clothes from Lands' End--their clothes are modest but still
cute. I've noticed some parents are buying their daughters three-inch
heels that I wouldn't want to wear. The other day I saw a
third-grader in a pair! Uniforms? I'd be first in line.</TE>
<TE>   --Paula Radosevich, Temecula</TE>
<TE>   I took my seventh-grade granddaughter shopping at Target. I was
amazed at her complete confidence in knowing her school's dress code:
no logos, no spaghetti straps, no exposed navels. She tried on two
tops in gorgeous colors, and jeans-type pants, which fit perfectly,
above her waist but not up to her arms. I think teens today are so
down to earth that they know their own minds and do not slavishly
follow trends in styles.</TE>
<TE>   --Helen Baznik, Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My daughter will be going to a middle school this year where
uniforms are required. I love the concept of uniforms, and usually my
daughter did too. But this is the first year that she said she didn't
want uniforms. Too bad, said I. Uniforms are the great equalizer.
Plus, they cut down the dilemma of what to wear. If you don't have
much, you don't have a lot to worry about in terms of choices.</TE>
<TE>   --Stevie Wilson, Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For my fifth-grade son I bought a half-dozen T-shirts with his
favorite logos on them (Quiksilver, Billabong, etc.), four new pairs
of shorts (he won't wear pants, even when it's cold out) and two new
pairs of sneakers, all of it on sale. I take him with me only to buy
the sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   As for my seventh-grade daughter, who was away at camp, I bought a
lot of pants and shorts for her to try on. I also bought two new pair
of school shoes and a pair for gym class, plus a nice pair for
special events. She has some things left over from last year too. I
spend more money on her than I probably should, but I remember
seventh grade and how important it was to feel that you looked good.</TE>

<TE>   I have three daughters, ages 10, 12 and 14. I don't know if others
have this problem, but they are hard to fit. So instead of doing big
back-to-school clothes shopping, we buy stuff all year. We go
shopping together and although I make the purchases, they get to
choose. They won't wear it if they don't like it, and I have taught
them to make their own decisions. Also, we discuss things like fit,
quality, care, price, etc.</TE>
<TE>   I find it difficult to shop now because the clothes are made
poorly and my daughters think the styles look horrible. We constantly
lament that we are such a casual society now that "casual day" wear
consists of jeans and T-shirts, not slacks or cute little skirts or
dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Our school has voted a couple of times on whether or not to go to
uniforms, and I always vote no. I think uniforms are great if your
child is in private school or your district needs to do it for
disciplinary reasons. But I don't think it should be done just to
make it easier for parents. If you can't work with your young child
on the issue of clothes, what are you going to do when big issues
come up?</TE>
<TE>   --Sandi Consiglio, Arcadia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My daughter is almost 8 and going into the second grade. I would
love to see the school district adopt the ubiquitous blue uniforms! I
cannot believe what clothing manufacturers and department stores
think I should buy for a little girl: hip-hugger jeans with a frayed
waistband? See-through tops? If no one buys the trashy clothes, maybe
the stores and the manufacturers will stop trying to sell them!</TE>
<TE>   --Judith Ilene Bloom,</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have a 5-year-old daughter who is about to start kindergarten. I
have been described as a "dinosaur mom"; my tastes are conservative.
I won't buy clothes with Tommy Hilfiger, Old Navy or Guess logos, or
clothes with excessive sparkles, or stuff that looks like pajamas or
athletic wear. My daughter is now a size 7, which is making shopping
much tougher--most of the "'tween" stuff is just too old, sloppy and
awful. I like to shop, and though money is not a huge issue in my
household, I spend as little as possible because I don't want either
of us to feel bad if something gets trashed in the course of being a
kid. I don't often go above $30 for a school outfit.</TE>

<HD>And Now for Rosie's Next Disappearing Act</HD>
<DH>First she left her show, then her namesake magazine, but is
anyone still keeping score?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To her readers, it should have been obvious: Rosie O'Donnell--the
bighearted former talk-show host and renowned "queen of nice"--was
missing from the cover of Rosie, her own magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Gone were the days of O'Donnell hugging Fran Drescher, goofing
with Donny Osmond and posing in her hospital gown. After seemingly
endless covers of O'Donnell mugging with celebs and yukking it up for
the camera, she was slowly being replaced.</LD>
<LD>   In September it was "The Sopranos." In October it's Celine Dion.
Next, it will be Reba McEntire. Who knows who it will be in December,
when the magazine rolls off the presses and onto the newsstands for
the very last time? It certainly won't be O'Donnell, who withdrew
from her publishing agreement with Gruner &amp; Jahr USA on Wednesday,
taking her name with her.</LD>
<TE>   "I cannot have my name on a magazine if I cannot be assured that
it will represent my vision and my ideas," she said in a statement to
the news media.</TE>
<TE>   But does anyone even care? O'Donnell has been fading from the
public spotlight since May, when she gave up her daytime talk
show--and her No. 1 promotional vehicle for the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie boasts a readership of 3.5 million, but many of its readers
are carry-overs from McCall's--the 125-year-old magazine that morphed
into Rosie to increase its ad sales and circulation. And newsstand
sales have fallen sharply. When the magazine debuted in April 2001,
newsstand sales averaged 550,000 copies; in 2002, some issues have
sold as few as 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't have it, I wouldn't really miss it," said Allan
Brooks, owner of Al's Newsstand in Beverly Hills. Brooks, who has
been in business for 30 years, said he sells almost 90% of the copies
of Vanity Fair he receives each month but only 30% of Rosie, even
though both have premium placement in the front row. He said interest
was high when the magazine first came out but started declining
around the fifth or sixth issue.</TE>
<TE>   Such are the pitfalls of hitching a magazine to a star's
celebrity. Martha Stewart Living is feeling the pinch of insider
trading allegations against its namesake. Even O, the Oprah Magazine,
may suffer a similar fate as Rosie, when Oprah Winfrey pulls the plug
on her program in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless your name is Jesus Christ, nobody has been able to brand
their name for eternity," said Samir Husni, a journalism professor at
the University of Mississippi who calls himself Mr. Magazine. "When
your name, your picture and your message is all in there, sooner or
later it's going to backfire."</TE>
<TE>   According to Diane Salvatore, editor in chief of Ladies' Home
Journal, "Any time a new product enters the market--as Rosie did in
ours--it makes everyone play harder and smarter, and that's a good
thing. But Rosie magazine was not McCall's, and neither was it Rosie
the TV show. I think they suffered from mixing their mediums."</TE>
<TE>   In the six years her show was on the air, O'Donnell won six Emmy
awards for best talk-show host. She gave it up, she said, to raise
her family and pursue other projects. O'Donnell, whose girlfriend is
expecting the couple's fourth child in December, has announced plans
to direct a Showtime movie about a foster child coming of age and
will co-produce the new Boy George musical "Taboo," but as of
Wednesday, she has one less project.</TE>
<TE>   "She has walked away from her television show, her brand, her
public personality, her civility--and now her fans, the advertising
community, her business partner and her contractual
responsibilities," said Sue Geramian, spokeswoman for Gruner &amp; Jahr,
which also publishes Child, Family Circle and Parents magazines.</TE>
<TE>   The power struggles at Rosie began over the summer when Gruner &amp;
Jahr hired Susan Toepfer, a former People magazine editor, as editor
in chief. In July, O'Donnell threatened legal action but later
recanted because both sides were "trying to resolve creative
differences," according to Cindi Berger, O'Donnell's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But the creative differences didn't resolve. They worsened.
O'Donnell, who said she was hired to be the "editorial director and
control the editorial process," was no longer entirely in control of
its content. With Toepfer in charge, she fought (and lost) battles to
put Boy George on the cover and to run a photo feature of her
pregnant girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Neither subject is quite right for a mass-appeal, general-interest
women's magazine, according to some industry experts. Nor were most
of the causes O'Donnell championed as editorial director of the
magazine--causes such as gun control and gay adoption.</TE>
<TE>   "A woman living in the foothills of Kentucky or Tennessee is not
interested in why a gay couple should or should not adopt," said
Husni. "That's not the mass market."</TE>
<TE>   Husni predicted that neither O nor Martha Stewart Living would be
around in 20 years. "Maybe O, if it doesn't stand for Oprah. Or
Martha Stewart if it's Living magazine."</TE>
<TE>   As for the trend in namesake magazines, he said, "People will
think not only twice but thrice after Rosie."</TE>

<KH>SPRING 2003 NEW YORK COLLECTIONS</KH>
<HD>Fail-Safe Fashion</HD>
<DH>Taking few chances, designers follow consumers' proven
tastes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--It's tempting to attribute some greater symbolism to the
rather familiar clothes that are being previewed for next spring
during Fashion Week here.</LD>
<LD>   One might assume that designers are sending a message with their
intentional pairing of cargo pants, bomber jackets and Army green
fabrics with frail and pale lace and sensuous silk. War meets the
boudoir? Combat gear shelters our innocence? Barbie meets G.I. Joe,
borrows his wardrobe and they live happily ever after?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe all of the above are true, but this is, after all, New Yawk,
where fashion is about moving the merchandise, not artsy expressions
of angst. The telling sign of the bottom-line pressures surfaced
backstage at Tommy Hilfiger's show Wednesday. The designer who made
his fame and fortune with unabashedly patriotic red, white and blue
Americana clothing practically buried his stars-and-stripes heritage
in his newest collection.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not abandoning it," he said backstage, "but I'm incorporating
it in a more subtle way." Translation: Red-white-and-blue has new
connotations these days, and it's overused and overexposed as a
fashion statement. Hilfiger resisted attaching metaphorical meanings
to his multi-pocketed military wear, too. "It has nothing to do with
the state of the union," he insisted. "We live in an era when women
love military pockets for everything they carry."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: It looked great when John Galliano did this fall's
combat couture look for Christian Dior--and we all need to sell
fashion. To Hilfiger's credit, he gave what used to be a predictable
collection a new dose of sex appeal that put his women's clothes more
in step with those of other major Seventh Avenue designers.</TE>
<TE>   You know that fashion is paying closer attention to consumer
needs, street trends and, perhaps, the trend analysts when Hilfiger,
champion of the baggy hip-hop blue jean, starts to share the same
silk cargo-pants aesthetic with Carolina Herrera, the queen of
elegance. Herrera and even DKNY by Donna Karan and Kenneth Cole
shared their utility/safari/military territory with sexy civilians in
miniskirts and romantics in white.</TE>
<TE>   While Karan skillfully returned to her love of 1940s dressmaking
and sharp tailoring, Herrera less gracefully updated the silhouettes
of that era. Karan playfully accented her pink, polka-dotted and
peony-printed collection with makeup straight from a 1961 Barbie
doll, complete with painted-on lashes, a slash of blue eye shadow and
an up 'do nearly undone from numerous tours of duty in the toy box.
(They also looked like front-row regular Ivana Trump, who has shed
her famous Barbie up 'do for long hair extensions that make her look
like a cross between Donatella Versace and Dolly Parton.)</TE>
<TE>   If life-size Barbies can walk a runway, then fashion hasn't lost
its sense of humor. While many expected some sort of somber tribute
to the recently departed Bill Blass at his show Thursday morning,
there was none (fitting for the man who requested no funeral).
Instead, Blass' capable successor, Lars Nilsson turned out a happy
collection in uplifting pinks and reds. Whether he presented a
classic shirtdress or a voluminous ball gown, Nilsson lavished each
with frilly bands of lace or delicate rows of pin-tucked ruffles. We
all would have been a lot happier, however, if he'd left the suits
with Bermuda shorts in the backroom. No one has ever looked chic in
them and they never will.</TE>
<TE>   Like Nilsson, Oscar de la Renta designs for a wealthy,
discriminating clientele who consider grunge an insult to humanity.
While De la Renta's show featured his signature lace skirts, ruffled
and ruched evening dresses and lush fabrics, the collection, like
many here, rarely strayed from his lovely, but safe, territory.</TE>
<TE>   Innovation has been slow to appear this week, in part because many
of the top designers are seasoned pros who have mastered their
methods. That's what makes 21-year-old Zac Posen so interesting as a
fashion darling. Though he has shown only one other runway collection
earlier this year in New York, his show Thursday gave hope that he's
not a one-hit wonder. The pressure was intense as top retailers, a
crush of reporters and celebrities such as Natalie Portman,
Bernadette Peters, Julianne Moore and Ellen Barkin lined the front
row of his show, the first in the landmark Gotham Hall, once a grand
1922 bank.</TE>
<TE>   Posen's now trademark chevron-piecing, dramatic flourishes and
retro silhouettes gave his special-occasion clothes a lively glamour,
even though many carry the faint vapor of vintage shop costumes.
Though his fluffy, ruffly mini-dirndls are for the young and leggy,
his precisely tailored jackets and suits have appeal for a grande
dame looking for a showy dinner suit. Though some ideas seemed like
design school studies in contrast and construction, and others were
inspired by Martin Margiela (rows of snaps that can cinch folds of a
full-cut jacket), Posen's clothes don't look like much else in
fashion. And newness is the industry's lifeblood.</TE>
<TE>   The real future of fashion may not be with the wunderkind who
repeats the greatest looks of the 20th century, but with those who
reinvent them. Marc Jacobs, who also designs Louis Vuitton in Paris,
consistently invokes the grandmotherly looks of his '60s childhood
and the cocktail culture of the '50s. His skill, however, is making
clothes that were dowdy on Bubbe four decades ago look sexy on
fresh-faced young women today. For spring, his cocktail-culture
collection included the kind of tightly fitted, sweetly pretty and
potent dresses that women wore to sip martinis and win rich husbands.
He also poured models into skintight straight skirts and demure
cardigans perfect for a typecast sexy secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Giving women pretty but practical clothes may be the salvation for
a fashion industry challenged by the weak economy and waning consumer
interest in luxury items. Major and minor design houses alike are
focused on the same goal: enticing shoppers with a blend of styles
that have been popular in the recent past.</TE>
<TE>   It's not necessarily dramatic news, but it's refreshing to see
that designers of disparate ideologies had taken to heart one of the
year's most popular mottoes: United We Stand.</TE>

<LD>Kids, this script is based on excerpts from the first episode of the
new season of "Clifford the Big Red Dog," which is produced by
Scholastic Entertainment and airs Wednesdays on PBS Kids. Check your
local listings for the time and channel or go to pbskids.org/clifford
and click on "TV Schedule."</LD>
<LD>   The words in italics are stage directions that give you
information about the scene and tell you what to do. Have fun reading
the lines and acting out the parts!</LD>
<LD>   The characters for Scene 5 are Mac, Clifford, Cleo, T-Bone and
Emily Elizabeth. It is the next day. Mac, Clifford and T-Bone are
playing in the leaves outside the library. Cleo trots in.</LD>
<TE>   CLEO: (singsong) Oh, I'm a princess, I love being a princess.
Let's see--what will Princess Cleo tell her friends they're going to
play today?</TE>
<TE>   Cleo sees her friends near a huge pile of leaves. She scowls.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Hey, they're already playing--without me!</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Perfect! This pile is going to be great for jumping in!
OK guys--look out. Here I cooome!</TE>
<TE>   Clifford leaps. Brightly colored leaves fill the screen as he
lands.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: I don't believe it! They're jumping in leaves--without me!
(upset) What are you guys doing?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: We're jumping in leaves!</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: (upset) I can see that! Why didn't you invite me to jump
with you?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Well--the leaves are on the grass, Princess Cleo. You'd
get all grass-stained.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: I don't mind getting grass-stained.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: I never heard of a princess getting dirty.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: But I love getting dirty and grass-stained and all that
stuff!</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: But that was before you were a princess.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Just because I'm a princess doesn't mean I'm any different
than I was before.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: Then why were you acting so different yesterday?</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: I wasn't acting that different. All I did was make you
scratch my back and fetch the ball and.... Oops, I wasn't being very
nice, was I?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: You were being a princess.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Being a princess doesn't mean you can be bossy and unfair.
I'm really sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Clifford's doghouse that evening. Clifford, T-Bone and Mac
are cuddled around Emily as she reads a story.</TE>
<TE>   Emily: (reading) And so the princess, to prove that she was a real
princess, was ordered to sleep on a mountain of mattresses.
Underneath was a single pea. All night, the princess tossed and
turned.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: (whispers to Clifford) Clifford, I think it's a lot more fun
to read about being a princess than it is to really be a princess.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford smiles and winks at her.</TE>

<LD>Just when we'd almost recovered from the $6,000 shower curtain, here
comes the $2,200 trash can.</LD>
<LD>   Suitable for shredded remains of key documents or just
crumpled-in-despair copies of today's headlines, this wastebasket was
pulled from the 5th Avenue pied a terre of former Tyco CEO L. Dennis
Kozlowski, one of three Tyco executives recently charged with
unlawfully "enriching themselves at the expense of the company."</LD>
<LD>   The government report that led to these charges included
descriptions and price tags from the duplex that Kozlowski apparently
furnished on the company's tab.</LD>
<TE>   Of the many high-end decorative flourishes provided by Wendy
Valliere of Nantucket's Seldom Scene Interiors, none seem quite so
remarkable as the $2,200 wastebasket.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to imagine what would make a trash can worth two
grand. Historical notoriety--the receptacle in which Thomas Jefferson
chucked early drafts of the Declaration of Independence, the bin
containing Marilyn Monroe's last vial of Seconal--might raise the bid
at a Christie's auction.</TE>
<TE>   A Warhol trash can could also add another 0, and, of course,
precious metals and gems or a shard of the True Cross can cost a
pretty penny.</TE>
<TE>   But according to reports, Kozlowski's was a perfectly ordinary
$2,200 "gilt metal wastebasket," the kind any of us might have just
lying about, filled with, well, trash.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard that on the news and I just laughed and laughed," said
Jenny Armit, a high-end interior designer based in L.A. and London.
"I thought, 'Please, God, send me a client who's that stupid.' It's
just ludicrous, isn't it? I mean what on Earth could it have looked
like?"</TE>
<TE>   This is what everyone wants to know, or at least, this is what we
want to know. And so we asked a handful of designers to sketch for us
their visions of such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was thrilled with such a budget, and at least one--Jarret
Hedborg--had been fiddling around with an image from the moment he
read Wednesday's newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   But another, Brad Dunning, didn't think the expense was all that
outrageous. "Geez, we actually have clients who have spent that much
on small trash cans.... Italian designer leather or custom bronze can
do much damage to a budget. I could easily spend even more than that
if I wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Armit, unfortunately, had one foot on a plane to London when she
picked up the phone. But even if she had the time to sketch
something, she said, the idea of a $2,200 trash basket was simply
beyond her.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked for a vast amount of British royalty and they'd have
shown me the door, and rightly so, for something like that," she
said. "I've spent $200, $300, maybe six at the absolute max. But why
would you put something that would have to be so well-crafted and
ornate on the floor, at foot level, where someone could kick it
over?"</TE>
<TE>   "My rendition," she said, "is a blank page. Because it is simply
beyond my imagination."</TE>

<HD>A Religious but Not Preachy 'Joshua'</HD>
<DH>Billed as a 'spiritual western,' this tale of compassion
from a do-gooder stranger avoids cloying overtones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Jon Purdy aptly describes his picture "Joshua" as "a
spiritual western, a story about a stranger who comes to a small town
and instead of changing their way of thinking with his six-guns, he
changes them through a compassion that is revealed to the
townspeople." Indeed this gracefully wrought film, beautifully shot
by Bruce Surtees with apt production design by Brian Eatwell, has a
spirit of uplift that is well-earned.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Goldwyn is Joshua, a tall man with a serene presence who
arrives in Auburn, a leafy, 19th century Norman Rockwell town in the
Midwest and rents a barn to set up shop as a woodcarver and
all-around woodworker (and that's a pretty big clue to his true
identity). Joshua is low-key, unpretentious and dedicated to random
acts of kindness.</LD>
<LD>   Seeing that the black community's church has been ravaged beyond
repair, perhaps by a tornado, he sets about tearing it down and
rebuilding it from scratch. It's not long before the entire town has
pitched in to help, including the kindly assistant priest, Father Pat
(Kurt Fuller), of the local Catholic Church. The townspeople begin
realizing that they are experiencing a sense of community as never
before. Father Tardone (F. Murray Abraham), Father Pat's superior,
even commissions Joshua to sculpt a likeness of St. Peter.</LD>
<TE>   However, Father Tardone, an austere, formal man and a rigid church
traditionalist who was more at home in the Vatican, begins looking
askance at Joshua, especially when the already enthralled townspeople
begin insisting that he possesses miraculous powers.</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from Father Joseph Girzone's novel by screenwriters Brad
Mirman and Keith Giglio "Joshua" is a model of how to do a religious
film and harks back to the best of Billy Graham's productions. That
is to say that preachiness is avoided, the people and their
situations are lifelike and leavened with humor, and the filmmaking
meets professional standards.</TE>
<TE>   Purdy's direction and the film's script and notable cast make
"Joshua" more than that: It's a persuasive spiritual journey,
sentimental at times but never hopelessly cloying. It is also fair:
As uptight and negative as Father Tardone can be, he is undeniably a
conscientious, well-meaning man who is right to be concerned that
Joshua may well be some kind of charlatan whose increasing sway over
the townspeople alarms him--just as he is ultimately wrong to be so
stubbornly close-minded and unloving.</TE>
<TE>   Goldwyn never loses sight of Joshua's humanity or his humility,
and therefore never seems an insufferable paragon. Fuller has the
film's best role, as a sometimes klutzy and tactless man of God who
grows in assurance and poise as he increasingly defies Father
Tardone's escalating arbitrariness. Tardone is himself a complex
figure, and Abraham illuminates him with compassion. Giancarlo
Giannini makes a splendid pope in a sequence filmed in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   The film, however, suffers from the curse of so many films from
religiously oriented production companies: a gratuitously gooey
violin-and-harmonica score that doggedly underlines most of the
action in the most obvious, heavy-handed way.</TE>
<TE>   "Joshua" further suffers from a noisy overlay of Christian rock, a
little of which is appropriate but goes a long way; the overdose here
seems an overly strenuous bid to appeal to youthful audiences that is
at odds with the gentle, lyrical tone the filmmakers have so
thoughtfully achieved.</TE>
<TE>   That "Joshua" is not done in by its music, however, attests to its
innate strength.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: G (general audiences). Times guidelines: suitable for
all ages.</TE>

<HD>Latin Grammys Make Downbeat Showing</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The awards program's dismal ratings on CBS raise
the question of whether a televised ceremony can survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onstage, the short history of the Latin Grammys has been defined by
some sublime performances and a spirit of cultural exploration.
Offstage, however, the life of the show has been turbulent, with
political protests and the disappointment of a canceled broadcast in
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Now add another grim note--the third annual Latin Grammys.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary ratings reports show that Wednesday night's broadcast
on CBS turned in a dismal showing, drawing an average of 4 million
viewers. That's a 45% drop from the audience for the show's inaugural
broadcast in 2000--or about a sixth of the U.S. audience for the
regular Grammy Awards.</LD>
<TE>   The audience for Wednesday's show also declined steadily
throughout the two-hour broadcast and left CBS a distant fourth among
the networks in the prime-time race for the night.</TE>
<TE>   The contract between CBS and the Grammy organization gives the
network the option each year to broadcast the Latin Grammys and,
though no decision has been made for 2003, network executives insist
they view it as a long-term franchise. That may be, but within the
Grammy community there were whispers in recent days that the Latin
music ceremony needed big numbers this year to sustain it as a
separate entity.</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation of the second annual show--it was scheduled for
Sept. 11 last year and was scrapped in the wake of the terrorist
attacks that day--cost producers at least $2 million and delayed by a
year the plan for the Latin Grammys to reach financial independence
from the parent Grammy organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It's make or break this year," one key former Grammy official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "If the ratings aren't
through the roof, I doubt you will ever see this show again."</TE>
<TE>   Countering that point of view is the value of the show to CBS as
far as ad revenues and long-term marketing. Many corporations have ad
budgets earmarked for forums that specifically target Latino
audiences, so despite meager ratings, the Latin Grammys remain
lucrative for CBS. There is also the long-run demographic value of a
show geared to attract the nation's burgeoning Latino community, as
well as other fans of a wide-ranging music scene that has gained
footing in the U.S. mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tremendous demographic tailwind, this trend of the
growing Latino population in the U.S.," said Gordon Hodge, a media
analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if [the Latin Grammy show] is not a short-term success, it
seems to have a lot of long-range potential."</TE>
<TE>   Garth Fundis, chairman of the board of trustees for the National
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, dismissed outright the chances
that CBS will not be home to the Latin Grammys, and he said that the
presence of the main Grammys show on the network added more security
to its future.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a relationship with CBS," Fundis said. "And
there's a relationship between this show and our show being on CBS.
[The organizers of] the Latin Grammys have been very excited about
the support they've gotten from CBS and the genuine interest."</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural telecast of the Latin Grammy Awards in Sept. 2000
failed to generate much tune-in on a national basis but did perform
well in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. It finished that week at No.
47 in the Nielsen rankings of prime-time television shows. Its
audience averaged 7.5 million, a third of the audience generated by
televised awards galas such as, say, the Golden Globes. The second
annual Latin Grammys never made it to the air.</TE>
<TE>   This year's edition of the show arrived Wednesday with less
promotional advertising on CBS than in the previous two years. The
show also had fewer marketing alliances and arrived without the U.S.
pop culture heat that surrounded Latin music and Latin-heritage
performers in 2000, when the show debuted with innate timeliness.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Sussman, CBS network senior vice president for specials, said
in the hours before the Wednesday night broadcast that "the ebb and
flow" of music tastes have not diminished the show's luster.</TE>
<TE>   CBS values "high-quality programming and diversity," and the Latin
Grammys provide both, Sussman said. Indeed, the major networks have
all come under fire in recent years for a lack of multicultural
representations in their programming, which may make the Latin
Grammys worth more than numbers on a chart would indicate.</TE>
<TE>   And now there is competition on the horizon: MTV is launching its
first-ever Latin American Music Awards, Oct. 24 in Miami. It will be
shown in 22 countries in Latin America and will air in some abridged
form in the U.S. and other parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' Sussman sizes up the Latin Grammys with a long view.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not have gone into this without the expectation that we
would be creating another annual franchise," Sussman said. "You do
take these things year by year and you've got to be successful, but
our goal all along has been to create an annual franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Manolo Diaz, chairman of the Latin Recording Academy Board
of Trustees, conceded this week that other networks and television
syndicators have made overtures in recent weeks to check on the
availability of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that happens once a year and that does not have a long
tradition there is always in need of showing it has the interest of a
wide niche of consumers," Diaz said. "At the end of the day, the
effort that CBS is putting here has to make business sense and
economic sense."</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation of the 2001 broadcast presented a challenge to
the show's organizers, but Diaz believes the damage is not
irreparable.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a rupture, and we have been one year without connecting
with the crowds through television," he said. "But I believe Latin
music, at least internationally, is more fashionable than two years
ago. If you go to Japan, France, Germany, Denmark--Latin music is
very much in demand."</TE>
<TE>   The Latin music that gives the show its artistic core has been
praised by music critics and connoisseurs, but it has also failed to
register with the vast mainstream audience that networks covet.
Carlos Vives of Colombia and Alejandro Sanz of Spain, both of whom
performed Wednesday and collected major prizes, may be artistically
worthy of the show's spotlight, but they are not brand-name draws.</TE>
<TE>   Another subplot in the Latin Grammys saga is the departure of its
chief architect and most visible cheerleader, Michael Greene, the
Grammy chief who stepped down in April.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, who helmed the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp;
Sciences for 13 years, resigned after an ugly in-house battle and
accusations of sexual harassment. Greene quit at an emergency meeting
of Grammy trustees in which a report was presented on those
accusations, although the academy then released a statement saying
their investigation had cleared Greene of any misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was hired as a consultant for this year's Latin Grammy
shows but is expected to leave the Grammy headquarters in Santa
Monica for good in October. ( However, Diaz said Greene's expertise
makes him valuable enough that he may be considered as a contracted
consultant for future Latin Grammy broadcasts.)</TE>
<TE>   Greene said this week that the newly installed board of the Latin
Recording Academy has "been handed the baby, and the baby is in very
good hands." He scoffed at the suggestion by some Grammy insiders
that CBS or the academy itself has any second thoughts about the
Latin Grammys franchise. "All of that is antithetical to the
reality."</TE>
<TE>   He also cited the overseas vibrancy of the show, which this year
reached 140 countries, including two major new markets, Brazil and
Spain. The show's inventory of advertising time was sold out two
months ago, Greene said, with spot rates higher than in the 2000
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Any new approaches toward the Latin Grammys will wait until the
new leadership is put in place. The next chief executive of the
academy will find the job's powers whittled down from the Greene era.
Grammy sources also say the salary for the next top executive will be
reduced significantly from Greene's $2-million base salary, a figure
that swelled even higher with bonuses and, to the disdain of many
critics, made him the highest-paid leader of any U.S. nonprofit
organization. The new pay range is tabbed at $450,000 with potential
bonuses that could push it up to $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   The race to replace Greene has been narrowed to five candidates,
among them California state Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Los Angeles), who
has been a vigorous advocate in Sacramento on music-related issues.
The front-runner, however, appears to be Neil Portnow, the senior
vice president of West Coast operations for the Zomba Group of
Companies, the label home of the highly successful Jive Records. A
vote on the matter by Grammy trustees is expected by the end of the
month.</TE>

<HD>Yearning, Longing, Searching</HD>
<DH>Slow motion and lyrical movement, if not complete
revelation, highlight '/Asunder' in Yin Mei Dance's Los Angeles
debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are dozens and dozens of fuchsia feathered arrows in Yin Mei's
80-minute dance poem, "/Asunder,"  at UCLA's Macgowan Little Theater
on Wednesday night. At first, only a few of them arc across the stage
at intervals, in silence, landing with a plastic clatter on the other
side. You think, "Cupid, love, fate. Chances flying by and crashing."</LD>
<LD>   Then after a long parade of minimalist solos and duets that speak
of yearning, menace and emotional fragility, the four-person cast
starts throwing fists full of arrows at two white strips of cloth
that bisect the stage. Thanks to Velcro tips and very receptive
fabric, the arrows (designed by Cai Guo-Qiang) hang from a banner
like dying bougainvillea or sprout crazily from the floor like
trampled tulips. Either way, it doesn't look like good news for love.</LD>
<LD>   In the rhapsodic scenes that come before, though, it's clear that
romantic love is not the topic (the dance is nominally based on the
tale of a monk who falls in love). Longing for something and feeling
lost is more like it. And perhaps the meditative goal of searching
calmly, with no mandate to make sense of it all.</LD>
<TE>   Choreographically, that adds up to a lot of picturesque slow
motion, with non-sequitur gesture combined with a lyrical carving of
space that seems borne on delicate breath. The slash that precedes
the title, Yin Mei has said, stands for a breath taken before
plunging in.</TE>
<TE>   Born in China and now based in New York, Yin Mei has a strong
sense of design and is a dancer of luminous clarity. She retains a
few head tilts and sashaying from her early folk dance training, but
they are couched in postmodern phrasing. In the strongly evocative
solo that begins "/Asunder," her movement hallmarks emerge: a
combination of delicacy and strong intention, and firmly rooted feet
that support swooning explorations of arms and torso. Her hands
careen, grab, flutter and cup the air tenderly; a hip juts suddenly
like a puppet's joint, and a shimmer of shaking takes over. In her
face there is deep-rooted wariness as she seems to work out inner
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   A series of danced or mimed segments unfolds, sometimes in silk
and draperies, with masks and fans covering faces. Yin is often
paired with Nyoman Catra, a Balinese dancer whose deft
weight-shifting and outstretched, wavering fingers look menacing in
this context, as if he's a stalking shadow or seducer. He enfolds Yin
at one point, and their arms intertwine as if they're weaving a
spell. Alone, he collapses in sobs that turn to demonic laughter,
followed quickly by pain and calm stillness.</TE>
<TE>   A duet early on sets up Polyxeni Argyriou and Will Orzo in
opposition to their more stylized and weightless fellow dancers.
Wearing slim pants and T-shirts, they twist and turn as Orzo
manipulates Argyriou so that she never touches the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the couple provides the only swerve into comedy, after a
pose-driven solo in which Argyriou clutches a French horn to her bare
chest. She faces us, still holding the French horn, when Orzo, coming
up behind her, reaches the mouthpiece and keys well enough to play,
"Are You Lonely Tonight?" This tone shift sticks out, resulting
perhaps from the fact that the original cast collaborated with Yin on
the choreography--Argyriou and Catra are new to the work.</TE>
<TE>   What colors these various segments most vividly is Robert Een's
score, played by the composer and musicians who sit in the darkened
upstage left corner. Een's cello swells with the warm fullness of
loss at some points, or combines with Toby Newman's wordless singing
to create the feeling of a cool, sharp wind. Bill Ruyle's hammer
dulcimer ties together emotional hues like a pointillist painting;
and Jeff Berman bends a chord or strums his Appalachian dulcimer
straightforwardly to stunning effect.</TE>
<TE>   At the climax of "/Asunder," you look for resonance--elements
coming together or falling apart. There is Yin, crawling and picking
her way through the arrows, her face suddenly aglow (Amanda K.
Ringger's lighting is dramatically effective throughout). There are
the four dancers, spaced equally across the stage, coming forward
very slowly, their hands drifting in space. Three wear placid-faced
white masks, one, the face of a devil. There is a blackout.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the beautifully soaring pink arrows never becomes
clear; they appear to have fallen without piercing impact. The debut
appearance of Yin Mei Dance in Los Angeles produced a faint
afterglow, just not the miracle of revelation it aspired to at the

<KH>THE FALL SEASON</KH>
<HD>Fox and WB Offerings by Turns Soar and Bore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like an Energizer Bunny, the new prime-time season keeps going ...
and going ... and going.</LD>
<LD>   By far the best of tonight's four newcomers is Fox's highly
arresting "John Doe," which follows the moderately appealing space
western "Firefly," from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss
Whedon. And landing on the WB--opposite "John Doe," unfortunately--is
a promising comedy, "Greetings From Tucson," along with an insipid
one, "What I Like About You." As if there were something to like.</LD>
<LD>   "John Doe" generates excitement that recalls "24," whose arrival
on Fox last season wowed critics with a suspenseful format in which
individual episodes represented one hour of real time. Remaining to
be seen is whether "John Doe" is more successful than the
unconventional "24" at sustaining momentum for an entire season (if
granted that opportunity).</LD>
<TE>   The show's activity orbits mysteriously around a man (Dominic
Purcell) who surfaces in Seattle naked, colorblind and with knowledge
of every arcane fact imaginable. Doe is a human HAL. He knows the
population of Morocco and the first line of "Macbeth." He knows
Gilligan's first name, the number of bones in the human body and how
many dimples there are in a golf ball. He barks out answers to TV's
"Jeopardy!" while speeding through crossword puzzles. He's a phenom
who knows everything about everything.</TE>
<TE>   Except who he is.</TE>
<TE>   Finding that out will be his focus each week, along with
volunteering his unique gifts to help a friendly cop (John Marshall
Jones) solve impossible crimes. It's a stock TV scenario, but one
driven by an intriguing character played by an actor with magnetism
in a pilot that has Doe searching for a missing girl with whom he
feels a curious connection.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fun is imagining what you would do if as all-knowing
as Doe. The premiere indulges that materialist fantasy pretty
effectively, as Doe buys a swanky loft, a fancy sports car and a GQ
wardrobe with the fortune he makes from playing the horses. Yup, that
would work. He can use his brain to cure cancer later.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Doe takes a job as a musician in a bar. "It's one thing
to know the notes, it's another to feel them," he says while playing
the piano gracefully.</TE>
<TE>   He tells a guileless colleague he doesn't know his identity. "No
way," she responds. Then she lights up. "You're adopted?"</TE>
<TE>   Droll humor is another reason to like "John Doe." And what the
premiere of "Firefly" strives for, but lacks, while introducing (not
very clearly) a society 800 years ahead of ours. Fox calls
"Firefly's" characters "cowboys of the future," and the series opens
fittingly with a barroom brawl before getting on with business inside
Serenity, a small, clanky, low-lit space freighter operated by cheeky
Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion).</TE>
<TE>   The frontier "Firefly" crosses is not new. You're in the right
galaxy if you're thinking Han Solo.</TE>
<TE>   One difference is that early "Firefly" lacks majesty, and also
that its laborious pace is hardly Star Warsian. That's so even when a
homicidal criminal hires the cash-short Serenity's crew for a cargo
heist in the aftermath of a civil war between the totalitarian
Alliance and independence-minded rebels like Mal and his second in
command, Zoe (Gina Torres).</TE>
<TE>   Also notably on board are the volatile mercenary Jayne (Adam
Baldwin) and slinky Inara (Morena Baccarin). With prostitution now
legal and even admired, she has her own shuttle docked in the
Serenity.</TE>
<TE>   The production look is interesting if unspectacular, and the
characters have ambiguous appeal. If only "Firefly" would give them
tasks worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   America's Latinos might as well be occupants of a distant star
system given their near invisibility in prime time, thanks to TV
programmers who define them as outside the U.S. mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   That's why "Greetings From Tucson" is welcome, even though its
moving-on-up premise is a Mexican American cousin of "The Jeffersons"
and some of its nicest lines are obliterated by a blaring laugh
track.</TE>
<TE>   Now there are two English-language Latino sitcoms in prime time,
ABC's "George Lopez" and this autobiographical one from Peter
Murrieta, neither of which features stereotypical gangbangers or
characters driving cars with fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview
mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   Like "George Lopez," the WB series has middle-class values, as a
job promotion allows Joaquin (Julio Oscar Mechoso) to move his Irish
American wife, Elizabeth (Rebecca Creskoff), and their teenagers,
David (Pablo Santos) and Maria (Aimee Garcia), into a solid suburb.
Meanwhile, their neighbor exposes her bigotry when mistaking Joaquin
and his brother, Ernesto (Jacob Vargas), for yard workers and telling
Elizabeth they look "untrustworthy."</TE>
<TE>   "Greetings From Tucson" is from David's perspective and has a good
heart. Although Maria self-consciously identifies her family as
"Spanish," the series displays its Mexicana proudly, and is just
witty and offbeat enough to stand out from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "What I Like About You" is the crowd. It's deeply rooted in
decades of formulaic sitcoms--and pretty much a clone of the 1980s
series "My Sister Sam"--with 16-year-old Hollie (Amanda Bynes)
preferring to move in with her older sister, Valerie (Jennie Garth),
than accompany her dad to Japan, where he has a new job. He says yes
because a parent leaving a teenager behind is no big deal in this
universe.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the problem: Hollie is a silly little kook, and Valerie
is strait-laced. Hollie equals chaos and calamity; Valerie wants
order, relishing peace and privacy after ridding herself of a
roommate she disliked. Hollie turns Valerie's life topsy-turvy, and
Valerie will not stand for it, knowing that if her sister keeps it
up, her career and social life will suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Simple solution: Send the kid to Japan. But noooooo.</TE>
<TE>   Get those hankies ready for sisterly blubbering. Blood turns out
to be thicker than logic, and this unfunny live-in arrangement, with
its emphasis on lame physical gags, appears destined to last as long
as viewers will tolerate it. Which may not be long.</TE>
<TE>   "John Doe" will be shown at 9 p.m. Fridays on Fox. The network has
rated it TV-PGV (may be unsuitable for young children due to violent
content).</TE>
<TE>   "Firefly" will be shown at 8 p.m. Fridays on Fox. The network has
rated it TV-PGLV (may be unsuitable for young children due to coarse
language and violence).</TE>
<TE>   "Greetings From Tucson" will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Fridays on the
WB. The network has rated it TV-PGL (may be unsuitable for young
children due to coarse language).</TE>
<TE>   "What I Like About You" will be shown at 8 p.m. Fridays on the WB.

<HD>The Border Realigned</HD>
<DH>Though not of consistent excellence, 'Axis Mexico' shows
vibrant new ways of thinking among Mexican artists as well as at the
San Diego Museum of Art</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--"Axis Mexico: Common Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions" is
an ambitious survey of recent art, most of it made in Mexico City in
the past two or three years. But the sizable show is almost as much
about a new alignment for the San Diego Museum of Art as it is about
one in the country just across the border.</LD>
<LD>   The once-sleepy outpost in Balboa Park has been steadily coming to
life since a new administration took over three years ago. This
exhibition marks the major debut of its recently appointed curator
for contemporary art, Betti-Sue Hertz. Other cultural agencies in San
Diego have for years made their proximity to Mexico a productive
linchpin for their programs, but "Axis Mexico" represents this
museum's first big push in that direction.</LD>
<LD>   If there's anyone left who still thinks the most exciting and
provocative Mexican art today uses established School of Paris
traditions of painting and sculpture to assert a national cultural
identity, "Axis Mexico" will come as a shock. Since the mid-1980s, a
series of events has broken the hammerlock of state-run culture that
was once the norm in Mexico and that officially embraced European
Modernism with a south-of-the-border twist. That bland current of
middle-class escapism is thankfully over.</LD>
<TE>   "Axis Mexico" smartly opens with a terrific new video, "El
Bodhisattva," by Calimocho Styles--a duo composed of Eduardo Abaroa
and Ruben Ortiz Torres. (Calimocho is a made-up word, "Cali"
suggesting the two Californias and "mocho" slang for ordinary folks.)
The concept is simple, the effect radical.</TE>
<TE>   On a wall-mounted flat-screen monitor, pointedly suggestive of a
painting, "El Bodhisattva" shows a mesmerizing sequence of commercial
figurines seamlessly morphing into one another before a glittery
curtain of glass beads--Buddha, Hello Kitty, a Tyrannosaurus rex, the
Hulk, a Venus, Bart Simpson, a Ninja Turtle.</TE>
<TE>   The silent video remakes pop star Michael Jackson's famous 1991
music video "Black or White," whose climax used the latest
technological magic to make a pale redheaded girl meld into a
Rastafarian man with dreadlocks, who becomes an Indian woman with a
caste mark on her forehead, and so on through numerous ethnic
transformations.</TE>
<TE>   But the moral and spiritual wisdom of "El Bodhisattva" lies in its
eradication of pop culture's sentimental brand of multiculturalism.
Instead, in the gifted hands of Calimocho Styles, Jackson's escapist
fantasy of global unity through essential sameness is replaced by an
immersion into the transcendent spectacle of cultural chaos. The
video, with its funny, monstrous, hypnotizing array of the shifting
faces of commercial imagination and faith, is wildly beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   It also vividly represents the transformative speed of
contemporary life. Jackson's decade-old video, directed by a big
Hollywood name (John Landis) with exclusive high-tech access and a
$4-million budget, can now be improved upon by a couple of artists
with a computer and a better, more resonant idea.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade, Ortiz Torres has been a leading figure in forging a
new understanding of the artistic possibilities inherent in cultural
confusion, and this dazzling collaboration with Abaroa marks another
step.</TE>
<TE>   "Axis Mexico" reaches this high level only once more, in a 1997
video with accompanying research artifacts by Belgian expatriate
Francis Alys. (Alone among the show's 46 works by 19 artists,
it isn't a recent piece.) "Patriotic Tales" is wonderfully
subversive.</TE>
<TE>   A stationary camera fixes its gaze on the base of the monumental
flagpole in Mexico City's central square, as if doing surveillance.
From the left, a man enters the frame leading a sheep on a leash.
They walk in a circle around the flagpole. When they reach where they
started, a second sheep enters and follows them. The scene repeats,
over and over, until the man is leading a line of nearly two dozen
sheep around his makeshift maypole.</TE>
<TE>   As a sociopolitical metaphor, an image of sheep circling a
flagpole is obvious. What's wholly unexpected is the viewer's
reaction. Every time another sheep enters the scene--nine, 16,
21!--you find yourself rooting for it not to break ranks, which would
ruin the slowly building scene.</TE>
<TE>   Alys makes palpable the often unexamined conflict between
human urges for independence and conformity.</TE>
<TE>   Some selections in the show are disappointing--notably the
Minimalist monoliths made from audio speakers by the often
provocative Santiago Sierra, who takes the notion of "art work"
literally. Here he hired two blind street musicians to play for pay
for four hours in a gallery. The installation, which includes massive
and obviously expensive recording equipment that dwarfs a photograph
of the impoverished performers, is uninvolving.</TE>
<TE>   Some pieces feel like student work. The team of Marcela Quiroga
and Georgina Arizpe have made hundreds of fake driver's licenses in
which they appear in costume with false names--trivialized, Cindy
Sherman-style photos that "question" identity. Another team--Inaki
Bonillas and Santiago Merino--make pastiches of 1970s Light and Space
art, putting up bits of colored reflecting tape on gallery walls that
ostensibly chart ambient light in art-filled rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Others may not climb to the heights, but they are surprising.
Gustavo Artigas' "Spontaneous Combustion" is a witty take on the
strange expectations around contemporary art and exhibitions today. A
long, low white platform ends in a podium with microphone. At the
other end, the residue of a performance is left on the narrow stage,
in the form of smoky ash, skid marks and other dregs. A nearby
photograph shows a figure engulfed in flames--inspiration made
baroque, or the artist as Evel Knievel.</TE>
<TE>   A floor sculpture made by Jaime Ruiz Otis from automobile tire
treads apparently scavenged from Tijuana roadsides or salvage yards
is also compelling. It makes razor-sharp fun of Richard Long, the
British Conceptual artist who gathers rocks and sticks on romantic
country walks and spreads them on the floor as earthy sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Only one painter is included, but her work is impressive. Fernanda
Brunet uses Pop art references to abstract ends. Splashes of color,
reminiscent of Roy Lichtenstein, are carefully outlined and filled
in, like an Andy Warhol paint-by-numbers work. The result is
explosive yet controlled patterns, whose densely worked color at
first glance resembles magnified skin. Slowly the patterns
encapsulate paradise and hell, suggesting everything from jam-packed
petals in a chrysanthemum bouquet to Dante's roiling inferno.</TE>
<TE>   There may be just one painter, but the show is nonetheless haunted
by painting. In Carlos Arias' immense wall hanging of tangled, woven
and knotted white thread, the industriousness of a spider meets the
showmanship of an artist. The work's resemblance to an unpainted
canvas (and its recollection of Eva Hesse) is subsumed within elegant
domestic craft.</TE>
<TE>   More often, though, the work that yearns for painting feels
old-fashioned and listless. Cameras are a common culprit.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalo Lebrija's dull photographs record landscapes reflected in
the red enamel paint of automobiles. Domingo Nuno makes eye-numbing
digital collages (more than 30 are on view) incorporating images from
cartoons, pornography and advertising. Claudia Fernandez photographs
painted details on the sides of buses, unsuccessfully trying to
inject new life into Aaron Siskind's 1940s technique of photographing
urban walls and graffiti to make images that recall abstract
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Daniela Rossell's baroque photographic images of young women from
wealthy Mexican families don't have much to do with painting. But the
similarity of their upper-class subject matter to the far more
nuanced work of Tina Barney deflates much of their interest.</TE>
<TE>   Conceptual art and its fear of painting often lead to weak work
that wants to have it both ways--to replace painting, but not be it.
One serious curatorial misstep reflects the disjunction.</TE>
<TE>   Each artist is introduced by big, bilingual text printed high on
the wall, like civic platitudes chiseled into the entablature of a
public building or supertitles at the opera that translate
foreign-language lyrics from another time and place. Here, under the
educational guise of helping out the hapless museum visitor, the
voice of institutional authority above prescribes what the audience
should think about the art below--art that's meant to be open-ended
and without predetermined answers.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, what it tells you is often wrong. Calimocho Styles, for
instance, does not "elevat[e] ubiquitous objects to the level of high
art, only to bring them down again as kitsch," despite the wall text.
What makes these artists important is precisely that they get rid of
such foolish categories altogether.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "El Bodhisattva," video's obsession with painting
finds one hit and one miss. The latter is Monica Castillo's tepid
portrait of a ballerina with paint cans strapped to her ankles,
wrists and waist, so that paint splashes her body when she moves;
it's goofy and diverting, but Jackson Pollock she's not.</TE>
<TE>   The former is Sylvia Gruner's eight-panel "abstract mural" in
gray, projected on a gallery wall. A lone swimmer traverses
television's dreamy electronic fuzz, swimming up and down, back and
forth, over and over. Gruner's meditative ritual is weirdly
liberating.</TE>

<LD>"I don't mind the lines, because when I was younger, I just looked so
blank!" says actress Susan Sarandon, talking to Biography magazine
about the inevitability of aging.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever Sarandon thought of her younger face, today she is a ripe
stunner, all over autumn movie screens. She's the monster mother of
"Igby Goes Down" and Goldie Hawn's uptight, suburbanite old friend in
"The Banger Sisters." Soon, her "Moonlight Mile" opens, in which she
plays a woman grieving the loss of her child.</LD>
<LD>   Once, actresses shuddered when "mother roles" began appearing on
their agents' desks. It was a sure sign that bells were tolling the
end of their careers. But Sarandon has been playing moms for a while
and appears glad to do so. "Maybe it's my job to expand the
possibilities for mothers," she says.</LD>
<TE>   Listen, she's expanding the possibilities for actresses, too.
Sarandon, a woman of strong convictions, is proof that you can mature
with grace and dignity, even in a business not famous for encouraging
either.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In its current offering, "Nickel and Dimed," the Mark Taper Forum has
done a daring thing: It has put a play on its main stage that attacks
the economic privilege of 90% of the people who will see it.</LD>
<LD>   The adaptation, by Joan Holden, of social critic Barbara
Ehrenreich's book about the working poor is a heady evening, all
right, steering us at Wal-Mart-aisle level through the physical
hardship, corporate peonage, flophouse accommodations and other
indignities of life at minimum wage while suggesting that we, the
members of the middle class who have escaped such horrors, remain
complicit in the suffering of these 32 million other Americans being
described on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Based on Ehrenreich's tour of duty as a waitress, maid, nursing
home worker and Wal-Mart clerk, trolling for clues to survival at the
bottom of our famously prosperous nation, "Nickel and Dimed" comes to
the stage with Ehrenreich herself (played by Sharon Lockwood) as the
main character, narrating the plucky journalistic adventure that took
her from Florida to Maine to Minnesota. A remarkably versatile
ensemble of five actors plays multiple parts, bringing to life the
co-workers and other folks she met along the way.</LD>
<TE>   Some will no doubt see "Nickel and Dimed" as merely a hair shirt
of liberal guilt tailor-made for the high-minded, SUV-driving Music
Center crowd. But Ehrenreich's irrepressible sense of humor,
admirably translated by Holden from page to stage, softens the
agitprop by taking nonpolitical pleasure in a wide range of human
behavior on view, from a nursing home cook who brags he's "a big
player in tech" to a clueless clothing clerk who has dropped all her
problems in the lap of Jesus. Which is not to say that by the end the
play has not become a roar of protest that brings to mind antecedents
like Clifford Odets' "Waiting for Lefty," John Steinbeck's "The
Grapes of Wrath" and the farm worker-inspired actos of Luis Valdez.</TE>
<TE>   This is very much theater as an address, and Holden, the former
company playwright of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, closely follows
the form of the book, asking the Ehrenreich character to step outside
the unfolding scenes of waitressing hell and nursing home slobber and
speak to us as author to audience. If this is not drama of the
highest order, neither is it ever dull, staged with imagination by
director Bartlett Sher and propelled by the quality of Ehrenreich's
inquiry into how the other half (or the other third, to be precise)
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Like most adaptations for the stage or screen, this one can't
convey all the subtlety of Ehrenreich's top-drawer prose. But it's
surprisingly successful in what it does convey, and in some cases the
actors' characterizations add humor or insight.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with her slight resemblance to the author, Lockwood, a
Bay Area actress, is well suited to the main role and brings to bear
a warm-voiced, unglamorous charm that seems to build as the evening
goes on. It's a daunting part that requires her to offset the
occasional shrillness of Ehrenreich's argument with enough humor and
compassion that we like her even while she is making us
uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   There is a point in the book when Ehrenreich, during her stint
working for a maid service in Maine, confesses piously that she has
never in her life paid anyone to clean her house "because this is
just not the kind of relationship I want to have with another human
being." Oh, please, the reader is likely to say. And when this same
episode is revisited on stage, that is exactly what the other actors
do say, surprisingly, in one of two instances in which the play not
only breaks the fourth wall, but also brings up the house lights and
hurls the actors into our faces, so to speak, leading to a brief
discussion of what everybody in the audience pays their maids.</TE>
<TE>   Although the play begins in the pandemonium of Barbara's first day
in a Denny's-style restaurant, it flashes back to the story's true
beginnings, when an editor at Harper's magazine challenged her to
write a first-person account of an uneducated working woman's fate
since the cutbacks in welfare. Ehrenreich sets herself a strict
budget and tries in vain to meet it. Watching her episodic struggles,
we learn a lot about life in the trenches, and Lockwood makes us feel
that it's scary, even to someone just visiting with a laptop in the
trunk of her car and the knowledge that in a few months she can go
back to the security of a house, health insurance and meals that
consist of more than canned ham and Doritos.</TE>
<TE>   We watch the strain on her face as she checks her doctoral
credentials at the door and endures repeated "personality" tests
administered by odious low-level assistant managers who are
themselves corporate lackeys. She puts up with social agency
bureaucrats while trying to find temporary quarters when no
affordable apartments are available. She watches a young pregnant
colleague at the maid service refuse to stop working, out of fear
she'll be replaced, even after she collapses with an injury.</TE>
<TE>   The talented ensemble helping to bring all of these scenes to life
includes a terrific actor named Jason Cottle, who manages to range
from bow-tied editor to Eastern European dishwasher to "Mallmart"
manager with great style and comic timing. But the rest--Cynthia
Jones, Kristin Flanders, Olga Sanchez and Christine
McMurdo-Wallis--all do their part in fleshing out this colorful
canvas of sad, funny and desperate characters who inhabit an America
that the major political parties have forgotten but that Ehrenreich
and the company at the Taper remember all too well.</TE>

<LD>   As New Season Unfolds, Ratings Tumble Out</LD>
<LD>   Ratings roundup:</LD>
<TE>   * ABC's big advertising and promotion campaign for the launch of
"This Week" with George Stephanopoulos gave it only a slight boost.
The Sunday program edged out CBS' "Face the Nation" for second place
last weekend, with 3.07 million viewers to 3 million for CBS. In the
key demographic group of adults between the ages of 25 and 54, ABC
was third. Still, ABC said the number of viewers was 5% above the
week earlier and its highest number since March 10. NBC's "Meet the
Press" was in its usual first place with 4.54 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   * The fall season got underway last Saturday in the area of
children's programming. And in the Saturday morning slot, Nickelodeon
continued to outpace all contenders, followed by the WB. Led by
"SpongeBob SquarePants," Nickelodeon averaged 2.1 million viewers in
the 2-to-11 age bracket, according to Nielsen Media Research data,
followed by 1.9 million watching the WB. "Fox Box," a new Fox lineup
supplied entirely by 4Kids Entertainment, averaged just 660,000
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   * "Dr. Phil," the new afternoon talk show hosted by Dr. Phil
McGraw, appears to be a clear-cut hit three days into its run. Thus
far, the syndicated show, seen locally on KNBC-TV, is roughly
doubling the audience for the program preceding it in major cities
monitored by Nielsen, where it is being watched on average by more
than 5% of homes. Locally, however, the show is finishing behind
KABC-TV's "Eyewitness News" at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In prime time, Fox delivered respectable numbers Wednesday with
its premieres of "Cedric the Entertainer Presents" and the action
show "Fastlane," which averaged 10.4 million and 10 million viewers,
respectively. ABC, meanwhile, drew 9.3 million viewers with its
special "Christopher Reeve: Courageous Steps," finishing well behind
NBC's "Law &amp; Order" in its time slot.</TE>

<TE>   Glow Off Vilar Due</TE>
<TE>   to Late Donations?</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, rumors have swirled around Alberto W. Vilar.
The buzz: The high-tech billionaire and mega-opera donor has not been
meeting his commitments to cash-hungry arts organizations, possibly
due to stock losses affecting his company, Amerindo Investments Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar's refusal to contribute additional funds, as well as to
adjust his payment schedule to pay up front, recently resulted in the
cancellation of the $3-million "War and Peace" at L.A. Opera. But the
company and other arts organizations have insisted that Vilar has
paid all prior commitments according to schedule. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   According to the New York Times, Lorin Maazel, music director of
the New York Philharmonic, says that Vilar's discontinuation of
support for the orchestra has forced him to put up his own money and
seek other funding sources for the $700,000 needed to pay for final
stages of the Maazel-Vilar Conductors Competition, scheduled for next
week at Carnegie Hall. And the Vilar/Domingo Young Artist Program at
Washington Opera has reportedly removed Vilar's name from the program
because he hasn't come through with a $1-million pledge.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar has stated that he still plans to support the New York
competition--and said through a spokesman Thursday that he only
learned of the decision to take his name off the Washington Opera
educational program by reading about it in the New York Times. Though
he missed his most recent payment to Washington Opera, he said: "It
would be totally unorthodox, if not unprecedented, to change the
naming of the program just like that, given that I initiated the
idea, nursed it along for two years and have in principle made a
long-term commitment to it. An abrupt decision like that does not
compute."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Last-Minute Visas Save Balinese 'Sacred' Show</TE>
<TE>   Visas for Cudamani, a 30-member Balinese troupe of musicians and
dancers, came through early Wednesday--the day before they were
scheduled to leave for the World Festival of Sacred Music, organizers
said. The event is being presented in various L.A. venues through
Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Several prominent artists have missed their festival engagements
due to turmoil in the Middle East or visa problems related to
heightened post-Sept. 11 security checks by U.S. consulates. Among
them: The Syrian-based Whirling Dervishes of Damascus, which will be
replaced by an ad-hoc group of U.S.-based Middle Eastern musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Cudamani's performances are scheduled for Sept. 28 at the Wilshire
Ebell Theater and Sept. 29 at the Greek Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   International tensions and the travel barriers that have beset the
festival give "more reason than ever to advocate cross-cultural
awareness and reaching to understand each other," said festival
director Judy Mitoma.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   El Rey Dark Until Further Notice</TE>
<TE>   The structural damage that shut down L.A.'s El Rey Theatre earlier
this week will apparently keep the busy pop concert location quiet
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Sleater-Kinney's just-completed two-night stand had to be moved to
the Highlands nightclub in Hollywood. Tonight's Jazzanova show will
be held at Fais Do Do in Los Angeles, and Thursday's Pseudopod date
will take place at the A.D. nightclub in Hollywood. New locations for
Rilo Kiley on Saturday and the Aquabats on Wednesday have not been
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Miracle Mile venue could not be reached.
But Sean Healy, whose Hollywood booking service, SHP, uses the El Rey
regularly, said Thursday that he has heard "indirectly" that the
theater is hoping to reopen by Oct. 1.</TE>

<HD>No Sex, Please, They're British Teachers in 'Under the Blue
Sky'</HD>
<DH>Playwright David Eldridge defuses the sexual tension among
faculty couples in his playlets at the Geffen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A popular student pastime, at just about any school, is indulging in
speculation and fantasies about the love lives of the faculty.</LD>
<LD>   English playwright David Eldridge turned to the after-hours
activities of high school teachers for his trio of loosely related
one-acts, "Under the Blue Sky," now at the Geffen Playhouse. But
don't expect torrid fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the men and women in Eldridge's plays are prone to
platonic relationships with each other. When the subject of sex
arises, so does the discomfort level. Eldridge almost could have used
the title of a much older play--"No Sex, Please, We're British."</LD>
<TE>   The presence of all that sexual tension sounds potentially
exciting for the audience. Certainly the production, under the
skilled hand of director Gilbert Cates, has its well-executed little
moments. But the sense of excitement is never quite consummated. The
tidy structure of "Under the Blue Sky" defuses much of the tension.</TE>
<TE>   The production is divided into three playlets, set at 16-month
intervals from February 1996 through August 1998. Each scene has only
two characters--one male and one female teacher. All are unmarried
heterosexuals, but only one of the six could be called sexually
active.</TE>
<TE>   The characters in the first and second scenes are mentioned, from
a distance, in the later scenes. We hear a report of subsequent
chapters in their lives. But in each case we've now turned our
primary attention to the two characters who are currently on stage.
The production never overcomes the feeling that it's providing
superficial glances at its characters, not penetrating examinations.</TE>
<TE>   The first scene is set in an apartment kitchen as Nick (McCaleb
Burnett) prepares dinner for his colleague Helen (Margaret Welsh).
They're in their 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Nick has invited Helen over not to suggest a serious relationship,
which is Helen's hope, but rather to tell her he's thinking of taking
a job at another school that would separate them. We soon learn that
they slept together once, three years ago. The evening is full of
fumbles from both characters, but Nick is painted as the more
insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   This scene doesn't stand on its own as well as the others. The
writing isn't as well hewn, and the preceding and subsequent chapters
of the Nick and Helen story sound equally or more interesting. The
noise of a distant bombing in the streets is a heavy-handed symbol.
Burnett, with an appropriately trendy haircut, and Welsh are skilled
enough, but they're limited by the script.</TE>
<TE>   Opening with a fevered but unsuccessful attempt at sex, in an
actual bedroom, the second scene features much less guarded
characters, both in their 30s. We get a more decisive feeling that we
are indeed watching the turning point in their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's much of a relationship--the promiscuous Michelle
(Sharon Lawrence) is simply toying with the nerdy and needy Graham
(Willie Garson) for her own vindictive purposes. But the actors run
with their strong and somewhat obvious strokes--Lawrence as a callous
slut and Garson as a virginal misfit--in a way that perks up the
evening considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the sense of decisiveness in the third scene, set on a
patio on a lazy August morning, is a plus. Anne (Judy Geeson) is 16
years older than the 40ish Robert (John Carroll Lynch), but they've
been vacationing together, in separate beds, for years. This morning
becomes a do-or-die opportunity to advance that relationship into
something else. These two are the only likable characters in the lot,
and Geeson and Lynch endow them with the requisite charm.</TE>
<TE>   Why Eldridge has focused on teachers isn't quite clear. Although
he isn't explicit about it, perhaps he's hinting that a level of
superficiality and impermanence is an occupational hazard for
teachers. They become involved with a new crop of students each
year--but then the students move on. "Sometimes I feel like I'm
watching from the sidelines," says a character.</TE>
<TE>   This play looks at teachers in the same way they look at students.
Hearing what happened to the characters in the earlier plays is like
hearing what happened to the students after they graduated.</TE>
<TE>   These later reports aren't very happy in the cases of the
characters from the first two scenes. However, the third scene ends
on a much more positive note, which is the source of the cheery
connotations of the title, "Under the Blue Sky." This happy ending is
momentarily gratifying, but the fact is that the last two characters
are almost as coy on the subject of sex as those in the first scene
were.</TE>
<TE>   If Eldridge had been writing in America during the '70s, he might
have been tempted by the producers of "Love, American Style." His
writing is certainly better than that comment might indicate. But
it's so small-scaled that it would be easy to adapt for television,
even with the realistic sets, designed in fine detail by Tom
Buderwitz.</TE>
<TE>   The play might even work better on television, where the
expectations of scale and theatricality are lower. Beyond the first
scene's reference to a street bombing, a few other lines attempt to
broaden the play's concerns beyond those of these six characters,
such as references to the class distinctions among the students at
the different schools. But these don't amount to much.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers may find the play fascinating, for they're usually
represented on stage and screen in terms of what they do or don't do
in the classroom, not the bedroom. But the play's impressions and
impact dissipate rapidly after the actors take their bows.</TE>

<HD>Under the Spell of 'Spirited Away'</HD>
<DH>Hayao Miyazaki's anime masterpiece sends its heroine on an
adventure that mixes images of enchantment and terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prepare to be astonished by "Spirited Away."</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by one of the world's master animators,
Japan's Hayao Miyazaki, this visual wonder is the product of a fierce
and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike any you've seen
before.</LD>
<LD>   If you're dispirited by look-alike, sound-alike, think-alike
movies, disturbed by an art form that seems not only to tolerate, but
also to reward a paucity of imagination, you're not going to believe
your luck.</LD>
<TE>   That was certainly the feeling at the Berlin Film Festival, where
this dark, strange, mysterious but ultimately joyous film so held the
jury in its power that "Spirited Away" became the first animated
feature in the event's 50-year history to win the top prize, the
Golden Bear. It was true as well in Japan, where the film earned $234
million and unseated "Titanic" as that country's all-time box office
leader.</TE>
<TE>   As those Americans who saw Miyazaki's previous "Princess Mononoke"
know, his version of Japanese anime is quite different from American
animation. The style is more painterly, the feeling unmistakably
Japanese and the mood, even when it's light, is almost never jokey or
cartoonish.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, even for Miyazaki, there is something special about "Spirited
Away." It's a heroic adventure story worthy of "The Arabian Nights"
with an ordinary 10-year-old girl named Chihiro as the heroine. And
it's got a magical air of once-upon-a-time, a fairy-tale quality
reminiscent of the unexpurgated works of the Brothers Grimm, where
boys can turn into dragons, door knockers talk back and even evil
spirits can't go back on their word.</TE>
<TE>   Although likely too scary for small children, "Spirited Away" also
manages, in a casual, off-handed way, to teach lessons about the
power of love and friendship, the importance of knowing who you are,
the corrupting nature of greed and how much is possible for those who
believe.</TE>
<TE>   On a more everyday level, "Spirited Away" also shows the potential
for dubbing, usually the most onerous of film techniques, when it's
done sensitively. Under the supervision of "Toy Story's" John
Lasseter, a friend of Miyazaki's for 20 years, this film's
English-language version shows the original the best kind of respect.
The voices chosen are not strident and the believably colloquial
dialogue (written by Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt) was
timed to fit the Japanese lip movements and help make this extremely
foreign world accessible while conveying critical background
information.</TE>
<TE>   The voices have an easier time of things because of the power of
"Spirited Away's" facility with wonder and enchantment. It's not only
that Miyazaki's inventiveness never flags despite a two-hour-plus
length, it's the great gamut the visuals run that is most impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Although it comes to the sweetest possible ending, "Spirited Away"
is as at home with disturbing scenes of creatures throwing up as it
is with images of piercing tranquillity and purity, like the
unforgettable vision of a train gliding to nowhere on tracks
submerged in water that could have could have come from a painting by
Magritte.</TE>
<TE>   Miyazaki no doubt intended the opposition of these images to have
an effect on us. Dream and nightmare, the grotesque and the
beautiful, the terrifying and the enchanting all come together to
underline the oneness of things, to point out how little distance
there is between these seemingly disparate states, much less than we
might imagine.</TE>
<TE>   For a film that does so much, "Spirited Away" starts quietly, with
a skittish, reluctant Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase, Lilo of "Lilo
&amp; Stitch") sulking in the back seat of a car taking her and her
parents to their new suburban home. She's unhappy at leaving familiar
surroundings behind and not at all mollified when her mother says her
new life will be an adventure.</TE>
<TE>   That adventure starts sooner than anyone anticipates. In classic
fable fashion, Chihiro's father takes a wrong turn and thinks he sees
a shortcut through the woods that will solve his problems. The family
ends up in front of a mysteriously beckoning tunnel that leads to
what looks like an abandoned theme park.</TE>
<TE>   Wise beyond her years, Chihiro doesn't want to enter, but her
mother and father, lured by intoxicating smells, insist the family
plunge ahead. Although no one's around, they discover tables piled
high with food so irresistible that the parents, suddenly losing all
restraint, dig in with savage gusto. "Don't worry," Chihiro's father
says between heaping mouthfuls, "you've got daddy here." Then,
suddenly, everything goes incredibly wrong, and Chihiro finds herself
on her own in this decidedly spectral environment.</TE>
<TE>   In a panic, she comes upon an enormous building and watches in an
astonishment we share as a ferry pulls up and unloads one of the
strangest cargoes in film history. For the structure turns out to be
a bathhouse for the gods, a place where all kinds of nonhuman spirits
come to refresh, relax and recharge. Miyazaki shows them all to us
with a dazzling variety (don't miss the enormous walrus-like Radish
Spirit, as if you could) that words can't hope to equal.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to her aid is Haku (Jason Marsden), a severe-looking boy
with a Prince Valiant haircut. "Don't be afraid, I just want to help
you," he says, and Chihiro begins to feel that she and he have met
somewhere before.</TE>
<TE>   Haku sends Chihiro to one of the bathhouse's oddest corners, the
boiler room, where tiny, skittish motes of dust deliver coal to the
furnace one lump at a time and the wily six-armed Kamaji (David Ogden
Stiers), looking like a hipster-anarchist with his round dark glasses
and bushy mustache, is very much in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Kamaji sends Chihiro to see Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), a strange
and powerful witch who runs the bathhouse despite looking like a
petticoat-wearing, hair-in-a-bun 19th century Victorian lady. She
lives with her gargantuan infant son, Boh (Tara Strong), and three
goateed green heads that roll around her apartment for no apparent
reason like a trio of grumbling, muttering beach balls.</TE>
<TE>   Chihiro is given a job assisting bathhouse attendant Lin (Susan
Egan), and although it may sound like a lot has already happened,
it's here that her adventures truly begin. Starting as a spoiled girl
who never worked a day in her life, Chihiro gains in confidence and
ability as she copes with the singular challenges Miyazaki has
prepared for her. The writer-director's name, as it turns out, is the
last image to appear on the screen after the final credits roll. It's
hard to think of a filmmaker who deserves that prominence more.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for some scary moments. Times guidelines: a sweet
ending but a tone that is often dark and at times disturbing; too
intense for the youngest children.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For anyone having trouble reading between the lines, here's the
breakdown on Thursday afternoon's big news flash from the center of
the metropolis:</LD>
<LD>   The old LAPD is dead.</LD>
<LD>   Three outside candidates for police chief, only one of whom has
spent more than 10 minutes in Los Angeles, are the finalists to make
the department something other than a dispirited occupying army with
a colorful past.</LD>
<TE>   Six current members of the Los Angeles Police Department got a
phone call thanking them for their interest in the top job and
wishing them luck.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of former New York cops, one of whom lives in
Philadelphia, made the list. So did Oxnard Chief Art Lopez, who used
to wear an LAPD badge.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my dream job," Lopez told me a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   What the department needs most, he said, is a return to so-called
community policing, and someone with enough crackle and pop to rally
the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are my two strengths," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but don't put the house up for sale yet, Art.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, his department has had some messy police brutality
problems he's going to have difficulty explaining, and we're supposed
to be entering the current century here.</TE>
<TE>   For another, the message from Mayor Jim Hahn and the commission
was loud and clear:</TE>
<TE>   They want fresh blood.</TE>
<TE>   They want it so badly they completely snubbed a couple of strong
inside candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in shock," one Westside cop told me. "It's disbelief. We
tried this once before and it was a disaster, and people are just
walking around shaking their heads."</TE>
<TE>   This fear and loathing is not necessarily a bad thing, in case you
were wondering. That very resistance, in fact, is part of the problem
with the LAPD, and the main reason Mayor Hahn refused to trust an
insider to get the department in order.</TE>
<TE>   The "once before" was Willie Williams, and the fact that he did a
belly-flop off the high dive doesn't mean an outsider can't get the
troops marching in a straight line. I knew Williams' work from my
years in Philadelphia, and here's my take:</TE>
<TE>   Had the city with the cheese steaks thrown in the Liberty Bell,
Rocky Balboa and the canine unit, L.A. still would have lost out with
this stiff.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was mediocrity at its finest. On top of that, the Civil
Service rules in LAPD were different back then, and he couldn't bring
his own team in with him.</TE>
<TE>   That's like hiring a new football coach and telling him he's going
to have to use the same offensive and defensive coordinators. But the
rules are different now, and whoever comes in can bring some brass
along with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, there's going to be resentment on the part of police
officers," John Timoney told me by phone Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He would know, having become commissioner of police in
Philadelphia after a long career in New York. The Philadelphia Police
Department, which is a smaller version of the paramilitary jihad
we've got here in Los Angeles, didn't throw Timoney a party upon his
arrival.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always resentment to outsiders," Timoney said. "You
overcome it by going out to the troops. Yeah, they'll be ticked off.
But that's one of the barriers that's easy to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Now here's an interesting tidbit about the Timoney selection:</TE>
<TE>   When I talked to him the other day, he said he really didn't know
the LAPD and wasn't sure exactly what he'd do in the way of reforming
it.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, nobody here bothered to ask him. On
Thursday, Timoney told me that in his discussion with the Police
Commission, he was never asked about a specific plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed a whole bunch of things, including dealing with an
immigrant population, an alien population, a whole host of issues,"
Timoney said. "But it was very global."</TE>
<TE>   Call me nosy, but if I were looking for a new commander to deliver
the LAPD out of the Dark Ages, I might have asked another question or
two, like: Hey, John, would you mind telling us how you're going to
do this?</TE>
<TE>   They apparently didn't even ask much about the controversial
"quality of life" philosophy Timoney and the other New York
finalist--former NYPD boss William Bratton--executed in New York in
the 1990s. That's when they went after broken-window crimes, public
urination and whatnot, on the theory that bigger crimes grew out of
that kind of disregard and disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   It worked, by the way, and New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in
typical fashion, took most of the credit and all of the bows.</TE>
<TE>   Just one problem.</TE>
<TE>   As the crime rate dropped, citizen complaints and civil rights
suits soared. In some neighborhoods, law-abiding citizens were
terrorized by the presence of overzealous Robocops, and some did not
fare well in these encounters.</TE>
<TE>   If the commission didn't talk to Timoney about this stuff, what on
earth did they talk to him about?</TE>
<TE>   "What they were trying to do was not get involved in minutiae or
very fine specifics," Timoney said of his questioners in Los Angeles,
"but to looking at the person and judging their character, knowledge,
and the way they handle themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Fine. But now would be a good time to zero in on the minutiae.</TE>

<HD>Forget the Money-- Keep Radiation in Its Place, Gov. Davis</HD>
<DH>He should defy contributors and sign waste bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK MILES</AU>
<BD>Jack Miles, a former editorial writer for The Times,
won a Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1996.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why does the X-ray technician step into a protected control booth
before X-raying your broken leg? Why, when your kidney is X-rayed, is
the rest of your body shielded by a lead blanket? These precautions
are taken because radiation can disrupt the precise and continuous
process by which cells in the human body replicate and replace
themselves. Radiation can induce copying mistakes, and another name
for human cells that make copying mistakes is cancer. In the young,
whose cells multiply so rapidly as they grow, or in the vulnerable
old, a small mistake can have tragically large consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Because radiation can do this, laws exist to shield the public
from exposure to radioactive waste. But the public interest in
preserving this protection is chronically in conflict with the
private interest of those in possession of large amounts of
radioactive waste that they want to dispose of at the lowest cost
possible.</LD>
<LD>   This public-private conflict all too frequently becomes a conflict
of conscience in the life of a politician who must choose whether to
serve the public interest on this issue or the private interest of
his campaign contributors.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, just now, is facing exactly this conflict. Before
he became governor, he stood firm against the reckless disposal of
radioactive waste. For years, he opposed the licensing of a
radioactive waste dump in Ward Valley near Needles, Calif.,
that--because it was so poorly sited, poorly designed and poorly
administered--could easily have contaminated the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to decades of public activism, the Ward Valley dump
proposal has been stopped. But as governor, Davis seems no longer to
be the man he was as state controller or lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   Private interests, including Southern California Edison, Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric and Boeing, have contributed hundreds of thousands of
dollars in recent years to his gubernatorial campaigns. But the same
firms operate nuclear reactors and thus are major producers of
radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from them, the Davis administration has abruptly
demolished the shield protecting the public from harmful radiation
far more effectively than even the Ward Valley dump would have done.
In defiance of court orders and behind the back of California's
Integrated Waste Management Board, Davis' Department of Health
Services has ruled that large quantities of "low-level" (but
potentially lethal and long-lived) radioactive waste from
decommissioned nuclear power plants and other sources need no longer
be treated as nuclear waste at all. Instead, the material may be
disposed of as ordinary garbage and even as landfill--that is, not
just in dumps but in future building sites.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most appalling among the many disturbing consequences
of this redefinition of hazardous waste as nonhazardous is that it
legalizes the recycling of radioactive metals from decommissioned
reactors. Toys, kitchenware, costume jewelry are all ways in which
pieces of old reactors might end up in your house, even in your
mouth; the list is endless.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Health Services Department do not have all
California behind them on this one. Far from it: Lawsuits have slowed
the deregulation, and legislation by state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los
Angeles) that would bar it has won overwhelming approval in the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But will Davis--the new Davis, not the old Davis who fought the
good fight for public safety in years past--veto this legislation?
His major campaign contributors are confident that he will. The
California public can only hope that he remembers who he used to be.</TE>
<TE>   Politics, to be sure, is the art of the possible, and no
politician can manage a long-running career without making a few
compromises. But just now, Davis is not in the fight of his life. He
has a war chest far larger than his gubernatorial campaign
opponent's, and his victory over Bill Simon Jr. is all but
inevitable. If there were ever a moment when this champion
fund-raiser could afford to do the right thing, this would seem to be
the moment.</TE>
<TE>   The courts want protection from radioactive waste. The Legislature
wants it. The public wants it. Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and
Sen. Barbara Boxer have spoken out against the deregulation of
nuclear waste. Only a few deep-pocketed contributors stand in the
way.</TE>
<TE>   In years to come, the Romero bill may seem, for better or worse,
the defining moment in one of California's longer political odysseys.</TE>

<HD>We're Losing the Battle for Hearts and Minds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SATLOFF</AU>
<BD>Robert Satloff is director of policy and strategic
planning at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With high-profile arrests from upstate New York to faraway Karachi,
recent days have been good for the good guys in the "war on
terrorism." But in one critical arena--the battle for hearts and
minds in the Middle East, known in Beltway-speak as "public
diplomacy"--the United States isn't even putting up a fight.</LD>
<LD>   Public diplomacy is, according to one official U.S. government
definition, "the communication of U.S. interests and ideals to
foreign publics." At its core, public diplomacy is about ensuring
that our policies get a fair hearing in the court of international
public opinion.</LD>
<LD>   Regrettably, the year since the Sept. 11 attacks has seen the
State Department devise a feel-good public diplomacy campaign that is
more about being liked than being understood.</LD>
<TE>   Our natural allies in the war on terror are beleaguered moderates
throughout the Middle East fighting against cultural totalitarianism.
But U.S. officials have produced publications, Web sites and programs
that undermine our friends and lend endorsement to our adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   A prime example is the State Department's premier outreach Web
site, "Muslim Life in America,"
(http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/muslimlife/) which is featured
on the home page of every U.S. embassy in the Middle East. In its
effort to project the image of a tolerant America to Muslims around
the world, this site includes a collage of about 50 photos in which
virtually every adult woman and most girls are veiled or wearing head
scarves. Not only does that misrepresent American Muslim women but it
also sends precisely the wrong message to Afghan women now free to
choose whether to wear the burka, to Iranian women fighting to throw
off the chador and to Turkish women at the vanguard of building
democracy in an overwhelmingly Muslim state.</TE>
<TE>   Another government Web site
(http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/islam/overview.htm) offers a ludicrous
dictionary of Islamic terminology that states, for example, that
"jihad should not be confused with Holy War, [which] does not exist
in Islam"--a position held by no serious scholar of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The problem goes beyond Web sites. Government publications, such
as the widely disseminated booklet "Network of Terrorism," show that
we foolishly seek common cause with many in the Middle East by
celebrating the fair-weather condemnations of the Sept. 11 attacks by
prominent Muslim clerics who otherwise revel in the killings of
innocents (in Israel) through suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Taken in small doses, an effort to identify common values among
different cultures and to emphasize abroad the exemplary record of
U.S. religious tolerance makes sense. But to make this campaign the
centerpiece of our public diplomacy, especially at the exclusion of
policy advocacy, is to fight the wrong war. That is one of the key
findings of a just-published report of the U.S. Advisory Commission
on Public Diplomacy. For most Middle Easterners, the U.S. record on
tolerance is not a central issue. Indeed, if anything, most would say
we are too tolerant--too promiscuous, too libertine, too open to
various lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   The crux of the problem is that Washington has sent the message to
our diplomats abroad to win admiration for our values at the expense
of the admittedly uncomfortable task of advocating our policies.
Indeed, when our most senior public diplomacy
official--Undersecretary of State Charlotte Beers, a former
advertising executive--outlined her strategic goals before Congress
in June, advocating U.S. interests and policies didn't even make the
list.</TE>
<TE>   To fight the right war, we need to fight the xenophobic,
anti-Western, anti-American media and old-style educational systems
that dominate throughout the Middle East, reach out to help our hardy
but lonely allies and do more to provide Arabs and Muslims with the
tools, such as English language training, to access American
politics, culture and society for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 12, President Bush delivered an outstanding address at
the United Nations that advocated our policies on Iraq and promoted
our values of fair play, self-reliance and prudent multilateralism.
With proper direction, our diplomats too can project both our
policies and our values. As it is, our public diplomacy is doing as
much harm as good.</TE>

<LD>After months of congressional hearings and investigation, Martha
Stewart now appears at real risk of federal indictment. Last week,
Congress referred her case to the Justice Department with a request
for a criminal probe, and a critical witness has contradicted her
account. What is curious is that no one has called me to testify
despite the fact that I have sought to reveal her fraudulent conduct
for years.</LD>
<LD>   My encounter with Stewart occurred in 1990 at a baby shower for a
friend of my wife. Well actually, it was not Stewart but her
best-selling cookbook, and my wife was then my girlfriend. I was
called in to assist Leslie in a crunch to prepare a vital dish for
the shower. As a male interloper, I was secreted in the kitchen with
a towering pile of sliced salmon and Stewart's instruction for making
"salmon roses." Leslie placed the step-by-step instructions before me
and a picture of the final product, a delicate rose made of a
formerly living creature.</LD>
<TE>   I have never been more focused on a project in my life. With a
beer and a prayer, I set out to join the culinary and horticultural
worlds in a masterpiece of flowering fish. I proceeded to attempt
salmon rose after salmon rose, only to produce grotesque and
disturbing figures. While one salmon glob looked strikingly like
Abraham Lincoln, none looked even remotely like a rose. My cursing
and slamming in the kitchen grew with each failure. I sat in the
kitchen with 10 pounds of contorted salmon and looked at that picture
of a smiling Stewart and her demonic salmon rose.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that I realized Martha Stewart is not just a fraud but
quite possibly the antichrist. There was no way that a human could
construct a rose out of salmon. I was overtaken by conspiracy
theories ranging from photo enhancement to plastic salmon-colored
roses. Getting a grip on myself, I finally concluded that Stewart had
placed a large fish on a lathe and crafted a 2-ounce rose out of a
20-pound salmon.</TE>
<TE>   This experience in some ways may explain the current public
reaction to the Stewart investigation. Countless people have told me
that they want to see Stewart trussed up, tried and served. People
spontaneously present the evidence for the prosecution at parties and
meetings. Could they all be victims of the salmon rose scam? It is
actually more difficult to construct an insider-trading case than a
salmon rose. First and foremost, it requires knowledge and intent to
use nonpublic insider information to achieve a market benefit.</TE>
<TE>   While she denies this account, Stewart reportedly decided to dump
her stock after her broker told her that ImClone founder Samuel
Waksal was selling his stock. If she only knew of the sale and not
the reason (an unannounced regulatory ruling against ImClone's wonder
drug, Erbitux), the case falls short of an insider-trading case.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, Stewart may face a more serious threat from alleged
disclosures last week that she fabricated the entire story after the
fact--the basis of a possible obstruction-of-justice charge. Douglas
Faneuil, an assistant to Stewart's stockbroker, has reportedly stated
that, contrary to what Stewart said, there was never an agreement to
sell ImClone stock if it fell below $60.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Stewart is that, unlike insider trading, the
necessary intent for obstruction of justice is largely proved by the
evidence of participation in such a concocted story.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately there may be nothing more to this scandal than
Stewart's knack for using discarded things for profit. Perhaps, after
seeing Waksal dump his shares faster than holiday fruitcake, she did
what she always does: She made something out of it. It is the same
irresistible impulse that drives her to make centerpieces out of
discarded dental floss.</TE>
<TE>   While Stewart whips up a criminal defense, I plan to move on. That
brings me back to the salmon.</TE>
<TE>   After I realized that I had been taken in by a culinary fish
story, I rushed to complete my task. As the guests were leaving, I
emerged triumphant from the kitchen with my own signature dish: the
salmon knot.</TE>
<TE>   It will be featured this week in my new publication, Jonathan
Turley Living.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush continues to crank up the pressure against Saddam
Hussein and America's equivocal allies. On Thursday he asked for
authority to use every means he deemed appropriate, "including
force," against Iraq. He was speaking to Congress, but he knew full
well that the world, including the United Nations Security Council,
was listening.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is pressing that body to draft a new, hard-edged resolution
against Iraq, while making it clear that he'll go it alone if the
U.N. doesn't come through. The Constitution of course says nothing
about steamrolling past the U.N., but it couldn't be more clear in
insisting that Congress act as a check on the commander in chief.
Some Congress members are fulfilling that responsibility.
Unfortunately, with elections looming and Americans still enraged by
last year's terrorism, many timid lawmakers apparently think bravado
is a safe recipe for getting votes.</LD>
<LD>   Bravery, on the other hand, demands that elected leaders interrupt
their president's tough rhetoric with a barrage of tough questions
before risking young Americans' lives and launching the nation on the
radically new course of preemptive first strikes.</LD>
<TE>   Here are a few questions that demand full and complete answers
from the president:</TE>
<TE>   * If, as some hawks claim, Hussein's army is a feeble pushover,
much weaker than the forces he fielded during the Gulf War, what
immediate danger does he pose?</TE>
<TE>   * Weapons of mass destruction? Where's the concrete evidence that
the arsenal we've always known he had has significantly changed? And
be specific, please. We know, for instance, that Iraq has attempted
to import thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes of a sort used
for nuclear weapons construction. But the independent Institute for
Science and International Security is skeptical; it says those pipes
aren't anything like conclusive evidence that Iraq is close to
possessing nuclear weapons. Do you know otherwise? What else have you
got?</TE>
<TE>   * Speaking of evidence, tell us again why the U.S. shouldn't give
the U.N. a final chance to send in inspectors with full access,
backed by stiff resolutions and the threat of force. Certainly,
Hussein has an infuriating tendency to play responsible nations for
fools. Still, wouldn't it make more sense to follow the model of the
first Bush administration, which depended on an international
coalition and U.N. resolutions to pave the way for a successful war?</TE>
<TE>   * In fact, why should the United States abandon the policy of
containment crafted by your father? Hussein hasn't launched a Scud
missile since then--what makes you think he would do so now?</TE>
<TE>   * Realistically, what would this war cost and how would the United
States pay for it? How about the aftermath? What national and
international programs would the nation sacrifice to compensate?</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, perhaps most important, what do you envision a postwar
Iraq looking like? Would we seek to keep Iraq a single state? Would
it be a federation? What about a homeland for the Kurds? Who would
serve as the interim leader of Iraq? Does anyone really expect a
democracy to blossom in a nation with no such tradition? If not, what
form of government does the U.S. hope would emerge?</TE>
<TE>   Congress cannot approve Bush's resolution to wage war against Iraq
unless it trusts completely that he has solid reasons for attacking,
a well-conceived strategy for getting the job done and a reasonable
idea of what would happen in the region--and here in the U.S.--after
Saddam Hussein was overthrown.</TE>

<LD>North Korean President Kim Jong Il's admission that his countrymen
kidnapped Japanese citizens cannot undo the harm done, and his
apologies will not wipe history's slate clean. But his gesture does
seem to have removed a psychological obstacle to future dialogue
between Japan and North Korea--if doubts raised by some Japanese
relatives of kidnapping victims can be addressed. They want more
proof about the fate of their loved ones, and Pyongyang and Tokyo
should provide it.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has eased Asian tensions
by inducing Kim to agree to extend a moratorium on missile tests
beyond 2003 and to allow inspections by the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Reaching detente with Japan could mean increased
economic assistance for North Korea, not only from Japan but from
many other countries that have been waiting for the right signals
from that backward, isolated country.</LD>
<LD>   China also could feel the benefits of this development, because
North Korea, with its economy a shambles and large sectors of the
population ill fed or starving, leans heavily on its massive
neighbor. Diminishing the flow of impoverished North Korean refugees
to Chinese territory is a priority for Beijing.</LD>
<TE>   As dramatic a breakthrough between the two Asian countries as this
meeting appears to be, Kim was speaking to Koizumi with President
Bush in mind. It was Bush, after all, who teamed North Korea with
Iraq and Iran in the "axis of evil" and now is threatening to make
one member of that infamous club pay very steep dues.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans reportedly told the Japanese over and over that
they wanted to talk to the United States--something the U.S. has
heard in the past, only to have North Korea turn away at the last
minute. Washington knows that its concerns about North Korea's
nuclear reactor programs and export of missiles to countries such as
Iran and Pakistan are best addressed face to face. To help clear the
way for that, North Korean and Japanese leaders should address the
pain of relatives who have suffered from the kidnappings for too
long.</TE>

<LD>The United States is the only major industrialized country in the
world that lacks universal health care. As anyone who witnessed the
meltdown of the Clinton administration's universal health coverage
plan in the early 1990s can attest, leaders in Washington have not
agreed on how--or, more significantly, whether--the nation should
guarantee medical access. However, in recent weeks, in the shadows
cast by the media's spotlight on Iraq, a quiet but powerful coalition
of regional and national leaders has been building in favor of making
mandatory universal health-care coverage next year's No. 1 domestic
policy priority.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition is composed of large employers--stunned by a
twelvefold health-care premium increase in the last decade (even
after adjusting for inflation)--and of pension funds, including the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, which
have been stuck with even larger tabs. (California taxpayers pump
$1.58 billion a year into health-care premiums for CalPERS' 1.2
million members, an amount expected to double by 2005.)</LD>
<LD>   Demand for radical health insurance reform also is being driven by
health-care consumers, who are beginning to see the inadequacy of the
timid "solutions" that Washington has put on the table so far.</LD>
<TE>   State leaders can implement one significant, if admittedly
interim, solution right now: They can use billions of federal
dollars--set aside by Congress in 1997--to expand the State
Children's Health Insurance Program (called Healthy Families in
California) to cover not just children from low-income families but
their parents as well. Unfortunately, some governors, including
California's Gray Davis, are waffling on whether to approve such an
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   States cannot, however, solve the problem on their own. That's why
Americans should demand that national candidates seeking their votes
in the November election spell out what they plan to do to rein in
medical costs and help the 40 million Americans who go without
medical coverage. There is plenty of room for debate about the best
way to do this. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for instance,
wants any universal coverage plan to be managed by private insurers
and financed by tax credits. Most liberal groups think the government
should administer the new benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what's increasingly clear to all: The growth in health-care
premiums and in the numbers of people without insurance represents an
economic drag that business cannot long endure and a level of
unnecessary suffering a civilized nation cannot in good conscience
allow.</TE>

<LD>Re "Senate to Vote on Iraq Resolution Before Election," Sept. 18: I
have been a Democrat since first registering to vote. My first vote
was cast for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I am ashamed to say I am a
Democrat now and will think long and hard before casting my vote for
a Democrat again, only because they have caved in to President Bush's
tough Texas talk.</LD>
<LD>   I can't believe the Democrats think it's good for the country to
attack Saddam Hussein. Bush has to vindicate his father's error in
not wiping Hussein out when he had the chance, and now he wants to
divert the country from the economy, corporate corruption,
health-care issues and the fact that he wants to be reelected.</LD>
<LD>   Will the parents of boys really say, "Go, my son, fight and die
for your country"? Where will the money come from for another war?
Starting a war in the Mideast and the so-called hunt for Osama bin
Laden will leave us in a black hole, financially and morally. What a
sad day for all Americans.</LD>
<TE>   JoAnne Micon</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having long suspected that somebody was profiting from the drive
to go to war, I am indebted to the intrepid Michael Ramirez for
fingering the culprit (editorial cartoon, Commentary, Sept. 17).</TE>
<TE>   Turns out it isn't Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney or Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. No, it's former U.N. weapons inspector
Scott Ritter. Thanks a bunch.</TE>
<TE>   John C. LaMonte</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Rock</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those who think we must have evidence proving beyond any
reasonable doubt that Hussein is developing weapons of mass
destruction before launching a preemptive strike on Iraq invite
disaster. And those who think that weapons inspectors can verify with
100% accuracy that Iraq has no such weapons in development or
inventory are gambling with the lives of U.S. citizens and our
allies.</TE>
<TE>   No inspection process is sufficiently thorough that it can detect
every weapons factory in a country the size of Iraq, especially when
that country's leader has shown unambiguously for the last decade
that he has zero respect for the unenforced demands in the U.N.
resolutions. By saying yes to inspections, Hussein blocks U.S.
initiatives in the U.N. and deflates international support for an
invasion of his country. He is confident he can toy with the
inspection teams and that they will never be able to find his growing
arsenal. If the U.N. teams enter Iraq thinking differently, in one
year Hussein could be infinitely more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Do we have to wait until smoke is wafting from the barrel of this
criminal's gun before we go after him? I applaud the president's
policy. Waiting to act until there's a smoking gun could mean more
death and destruction than a preemptive military invasion of Iraq.</TE>

<TE>   Even if Hussein really does have weapons of mass destruction, why
would he use them? If he did, he would immediately be destroyed by us
and our allies. Does our government believe that Hussein is too
stupid to understand this?</TE>

<LD>Re "In the Gaza Strip, Terror Can Create a Language All Its Own,"
Commentary, Sept. 17: One cannot help but be moved by the danger and
fear confronting Ghada Ageel's family and neighbors in their Gaza
Strip homes. I can't imagine a single American who would tolerate
being strafed by tank fire. It is a tragic situation that cries out
for resolution.</LD>
<LD>   Equally tragic, however, is that Ageel seems capable only of
blame. She blames an impotent U.N., a U.S. president focused on war
with Iraq--everyone other than her own people and government, which
consistently and repeatedly reject every opportunity for peace
presented to them. We reap what we sow. If Palestinians would but
plant a seed of peace in their hearts and in the hearts of their
children, then perhaps the sounds of suicide bombings in the streets
of Jerusalem and the rumble of Israeli tanks in Gaza would fall
silent.</LD>

<TE>   Ageel asks to whom can she turn for peace in the Middle East. I
would suggest she become active in pressuring Hamas, Yasser Arafat
and whomever else might be prevailed upon to work toward peace with
Israel. There are as many or more of the incidents of terror and
death that she describes in Gaza in Israel. I don't read about the
Palestinian Authority conducting investigations of atrocities
perpetrated upon Israelis with "whitewashed" results, or any kind of
results.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians and the Israelis will have to want to work
together for a just peace. If Ageel wants a better life for her
children, as Israeli mothers want for their children, it's time to
move beyond playing the "blame game" and start working on figuring
out how to make peace with Israel, period. If she qualifies the word
"peace," only a stalemate will result.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "TV Ads Will Press Hollywood Secession" (Sept. 16).
Finally I have read material that really helps me decide against
Hollywood breaking away from L.A. I am now more convinced that
nightclub owner Gene La Pietra is really running for king of the new
Hollywood, especially since he is in the upcoming ads. My favorite is
La Pietra with his arms open, speaking over the closing strains of
"America the Beautiful." If this doesn't help people decide to keep
Hollywood a part of L.A., I don't know what will.</LD>
<LD>   Why is it that La Pietra will not explain where the money will
come from to pay for all of his improvements? With 75% of Hollywood
being renters, the money has to come from someone--and it will be the
property owners, who will pass the costs to the renters regardless of
rent-control promises. Why has there been no mention of where the new
Hollywood will get its water or power from? I hope the rest of
Hollywood and L.A. will vote to keep us a part of L.A.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for exposing L.A. Councilman Hal Bernson's pushing of
Airport Commission President Ted Stein's housing development in
Chatsworth ("City to Appeal Development Ruling," Sept. 14).</LD>
<LD>   I thought only some Eastern cities were guilty of having relatives
placed in high positions. It seems that Stein has gotten his wife and
daughter positions at city taxpayer expense. Mayor James Hahn
appointed Stein's wife to the city Public Works Board; his daughter
is Hahn's field representative. Stein held a fund-raiser at his
Encino home and collected nearly $500,000 for Hahn's anti-secession
campaign. I wonder who appointed Stein to his position. These seem to
be cozy arrangements, and the taxpayers are paying. Perhaps
Chatsworth residents should start a recall petition to have Stein
relieved of his position on the Airport Commission. I will be glad to
put my John Hancock right up there on the top. Maybe it is time for
Valley residents to secede from Los Angeles.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Tempest in the Treetops," Sept. 17: As a conservative, I
appreciate the concern for property rights, including the ability to
do (within reason) what you want to with the property you own.
However, the preservation of an area's natural beauty is an issue
that affects everyone and does not fall neatly within the boundaries
of property lines.</LD>
<LD>   The eucalyptus may burn ferociously; it may be a maintenance
nuisance; it may be nonnative. But after 150 years, it has become an
integral part of the heritage, the look, the feel, the image and the
idyllic beauty of California.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, a row of huge eucalyptuses in Etiwanda was needlessly
cut down to make room for a 4-foot-high wall around a housing
development, turning a very nice neighborhood into yet another ugly,
nondescript road--a noisy one now that the trees don't cut the noise
from the nearby freeway. If we continue to let our most beautiful
trees be cut down to make room for poorly planned development and
egregious homeowner "pruning," then we deserve the quasi-slum
strip-mall landscape that continues to expand on the blighted
California landscape.</LD>

<LD>Re "Nuclear Plant Safeguards," editorial, Sept. 16: A nuclear plant
is just about the safest place to be if terrorists attack. Making
plants still more secure is the aim of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the utilities. However, a meddlesome Congress may be
one cook too many. We so often have seen nonexperts try to "fix" a
highly complex technical problem, of which the security at nuclear
plants is one, only to make matters worse. The NRC has the mandate to
protect the public without regard to the impact on the nuclear
industry. It needs to be able to do its job without interference,
even in the guise of help.</LD>

<LD>"Infamous Prison City Torn Down" (Sept. 16) highlights the plush
conditions (just bulldozed away) of the craftiest racketeers. As a
volunteer chaplain at La Mesa State Penitentiary in Tijuana for the
past two years, I found the place truly Dickensian. Most of the
jerry-built quarters were crowded and plain. Prisoners had to pay for
medicine and were served unspeakable food. Their ability to endure
amazed me.</LD>
<LD>   Former prisoners volunteered to help others through drug
rehabilitation programs. There was an active Catholic chapel, with
retreats and frequent services, and dozens of evangelical
inmate/ministers with many adherents, referred to as "Los Hermanos."
A Beverly Hills native, known now as Madre Antonia, has lived with
these inmates and encouraged and assisted them for 25 years. It is
truly a story of light and shadow.</LD>

Commentary, Sept. 18:</LD>
<LD>   With the help of high tax rates for the very wealthy, a strong
labor movement and the GI Bill, the 25-plus years following World War
II became the greatest economic period in U.S. history by almost
every measure. There was another thing: the theory that everyone
shared equally in a company's prosperity, or sacrificed equally in
its hard times. Whatever happened to that? You don't even hear it
anymore.</LD>

<HD>Civil Rights Activist Sues Border Patrol Over Altercation</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Man alleges that he was jailed and his camera was
broken after filming agents as they questioned trolley riders.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A local activist filed a civil rights lawsuit against Border Patrol
agents Thursday, charging that officers tackled him, smashed his
camera and threw him in jail for 25 hours after he tried to film them
questioning riders on a downtown trolley.</LD>
<LD>   Benjamin Prado, a 26-year-old community organizer and coordinator
of the La Raza Rights Coalition, said he wants his lawsuit to send a
message to the Border Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   "Abusive acts like this happen far too frequently," said Prado's
lawyer, Michael Marrinan. "When abusive agents act in this manner, it
is important they be held accountable."</LD>
<TE>   Border Patrol spokesman Raleigh Leonard said he could not comment
on the suit because the incident is under investigation. But he said
the agent involved, J. Carroll, is still on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Prado's suit stems from an incident in February, when Border
Patrol agents were boarding buses and trolleys in San Diego to check
whether riders were in the U.S. legally. The operation provoked an
outcry and, according to transportation officials, contributed to a
30% decline in ridership on the city's transit system.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of riders, many of them legal U.S. residents and citizens,
complained that they had been pulled off buses and trolleys to show
their documents and in many cases made late to work, said Gonzalo
Lopez, director of community relations for the San Diego Metropolitan
Transit Development Board. "Nobody in this country is used to that
kind of action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the transportation agency complained to the Border
Patrol, and the checks stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol officials said they stopped the operation not
because of complaints but because agents were redeployed to more
vital places, such as airports. Leonard said the agency considered
the operation a success: 217 undocumented immigrants were arrested in
one week.</TE>
<TE>   But Prado and activists from the American Friends Service
Committee charged that the Border Patrol's actions amounted to racial
profiling. They said they began videotaping the actions of agents to
raise public awareness. Border Patrol officials said they were not
engaged in racial profiling, and were questioning all riders
regardless of whether they appeared Latino.</TE>
<TE>   According to his lawsuit, Prado went to the trolley station about
5 p.m. Feb. 25 and began filming agents as they checked riders'
documents. Suddenly, according to the lawsuit and a videotape of the
encounter filmed by Prado, an agent rushed up to Prado and accused
him of impeding the officers.</TE>
<TE>   The agent, identified in the lawsuit as Carroll, grabbed Prado's
camera and demanded to know his citizenship. Prado did not answer and
tried to protect his camera.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, agents forced Prado to the ground and ordered him
to state his citizenship or be arrested, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   When Prado responded that he was a U.S. citizen, he was allowed to
get back up and his camera was returned. About 10 minutes later,
several agents tackled him, handcuffed him and arrested him. His
camera was thrown to the ground and broken. Prado was choked and
agents shoved their knees into his back, causing him severe neck
injury, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Prado was packed into a Border Patrol van and driven to a
detention facility in Imperial Beach before being taken to a federal
prison in downtown San Diego. Twenty-five hours later, he was
released without charges being filed. His broken camera, with the
record of the incident intact, was returned three days later,
according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard said that after that incident officials provided legal
training for agents "just to make sure everyone was on the same page
in regards to pedestrian encounters."</TE>

<HD>Donald Campbell, 98; Fuel Refining Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald L. Campbell, one of four engineers who developed a process
that revolutionized the petroleum industry by turning fuels into a
variety of useful products, died Saturday at a nursing home in Brick,
N.J. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell was known within the industry as one of the legendary
"Four Horsemen" of what is now the Exxon Research and Engineering Co.
Along with Homer Z. Martin, Eger V. Murphree and Charles Wesley
Tyson, he invented a process called fluid catalytic cracking in 1942
that is considered one of the most important chemical engineering
achievements of the 20th century. It became essential to refinery
operations by increasing the yield of high-octane gasolines, such as
jet fuel and heating oils, from crude oil.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1930s, researchers had found that a finely powdered
catalyst would split hydrocarbon molecule chains into smaller bits
that could then be distilled to produce fuel-based products. Campbell
and his colleagues refined the process to ensure steady and
continuous cracking.</LD>
<TE>   Standard Oil of New Jersey, the company that later became Exxon,
opened the first commercial catalytic cracking facility in 1942, just
after the United States had entered World War II and was facing a
shortage of aviation fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Historians say the catalytic cracking process Campbell helped
develop enabled the nation's petroleum industry to increase
production of aviation gasoline by 6,000% over the next three years
and played a decisive role in the Allies' air victories in World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   It also helped usher in the age of the automobile and sped the
development of plastics, synthetic rubbers, new fabrics, cosmetics
and other products.</TE>
<TE>   The catalytic cracking process produces almost half a billion
gallons of gasoline daily, about half of the world's supply,
according to the North American Catalysis Society.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell was born in Clinton, Iowa, and attended Iowa State
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard
Business School. He worked at Exxon for 41 years, more than half of
which he spent in the research and engineering division. When he
retired in 1969, he held 30 patents. In 1999, he received the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Ronald H. Brown American Innovator Award.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two children; eight
grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Elizabeth Coblentz, 66; Columnist Wrote on Amish Cooking
and Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Coblentz, whose syndicated column "The Amish Cook"
fascinated readers across the country with observations of life in
her Old Order Amish community in Indiana, has died. She was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Coblentz died Tuesday after collapsing at a book signing in Blue
Springs, Mo. She was believed to have suffered an aortic aneurysm.</LD>
<LD>   Her weekly column began in 1991 and appeared in about 100 papers,
mainly in the Midwest. Penned by the light of a kerosene lantern in a
house without electricity or running water, the column offered
recipes for hearty, unusual dishes, such as Amish meatloaf,
sauerkraut bread and dandelion jelly.</LD>
<TE>   She began writing the column by chance when a 19-year-old college
student in Ohio conceived the idea of a cooking column with
old-fashioned appeal that would introduce Amish traditions to a broad
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Williams, the college student who went on to found Oasis
Newsfeatures in Middletown, Ohio, had become interested in the Amish
while working on a magazine story about the influx of Amish in
Michigan. He began randomly knocking on doors in the Old Order Amish
community near Fort Wayne, Ind., to find someone willing to write the
column. He was greeted suspiciously by most of the women he
approached until he met Coblentz, who had been writing for the
Budget, an Amish newspaper, since she was 16.</TE>
<TE>   Williams found that working with Coblentz posed unique challenges.
Because she hand-wrote her columns, Williams was the one who typed
them up and then e-mailed them to clients. Because she had no
telephone and certainly no computer, he sometimes relayed editing
questions by sending her flowers and enclosing his query ("How much
sugar in that cream pie recipe?") on the card.</TE>
<TE>   He edited lightly, preserving as much of the column's homespun
flavor as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally other editors would make adjustments for urban
readers, altering instructions calling for steps such as slaughtering
a hog for a recipe requiring pork.</TE>
<TE>   Readers sought her advice not only about cooking but about a
variety of domestic challenges, such as how to rid the garden of
Mexican bean beetles (grow marigolds) and bud-chewing deer (sprinkle
mothballs in the flower beds).</TE>
<TE>   The column also offered vignettes about Coblentz's daily life of
milking cows, baking, cleaning, ironing and sewing for her family of
eight children and 36 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In a folksy tone, she wrote about events such as her daughters'
weddings and deaths in the family. A few years ago, when she reported
the death of her husband of 42 years, Ben, she received more than
2,000 sympathy cards and 1,500 e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   She lived on a 100-acre homestead in northeastern Indiana, where
she obtained water from a hand pump installed in a closet off the
kitchen, and kept food cold in an outdoor icehouse.</TE>
<TE>   She did not permit herself to be photographed, citing biblical
prohibitions against "graven images." An occasional pizza delivery
was one of her few bows to modernity. "I don't much miss modern
conveniences," she once told an interviewer. "Our children are our
television."</TE>
<TE>   At an appearance in Quincy, Ill., just before she died, more than
400 women lined up, "waiting for her like a rock star," Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She thought she was unworthy of attention," he added, "but she
really had a following."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Ten Speed Press of Berkeley will publish her book,
"The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish
Family." Two earlier cookbooks, "The Amish Cook Cookbook" and "An
Amish Christmas," are out of print.</TE>
<TE>   Coblentz will be buried Monday in a simple Amish ceremony, her
body carried by horse and buggy to a graveyard near her home.</TE>
<TE>   Her column will be continued by one of her daughters.</TE>

<HD>Bob Hayes, 59; Olympic Gold Medalist Turned Football Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Hayes, the Olympic gold medal sprinter and Dallas Cowboy receiver
whose scorching speed prompted NFL coaches to design new defenses to
stop him, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Hayes died late Wednesday at Shands Hospital in Jacksonville,
Fla., his hometown, where he had been battling liver ailments and
prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who last season made Hayes the 11th
member of the team's Ring of Honor, released a statement Thursday in
which he called Hayes "an American sports hero" with
"once-in-a-lifetime athletic talent."</LD>
<TE>   At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Hayes won the gold medal in the 100
meters, tying what was then the world record of 10.05 seconds, and he
anchored the U.S. 400-meter relay team, which won in a world-record
39.06. His victory in the 100 meters earned him the unofficial title
"World's Fastest Human."</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys made the Florida A&amp;M track star a seventh-round pick
that year, hoping his astounding speed would make up for his
unpolished football skills. It did. In an 11-year career with the
Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers, he caught 71 touchdown passes,
made three trips to the Pro Bowl and became the only athlete to win
an Olympic gold and a Super Bowl ring. The "World's Fastest Human"
was "Bullet Bob Hayes" to NFL fans.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes' 20-yard career reception average is among the top five for
NFL receivers with a minimum of 200 catches.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970 season, when he helped the Cowboys to their first
Super Bowl appearance, he scored 10 touchdowns and averaged a career
high average of 26.1 yards a catch.</TE>
<TE>   But his most gratifying season might have been his rookie year,
when he made the Pro Bowl and proved he could make the transition
from track star to football hero.</TE>
<TE>   "I got more exposure in my rookie year with the Cowboys than a
Heisman Trophy winner would have gotten," Hayes told the Florida
Times-Union in 1999. "There was a negative aspect to me being there.
A lot of people didn't think a world-class sprinter of my stature
would make the team, never mind revolutionize the passing game of pro
football."</TE>
<TE>   Opposing teams found him too fast for traditional man-to-man
coverages, so they had to come up with zone defenses--in which
players were assigned to safeguard certain sectors of the field--to
keep pace with him.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes' coach at Dallas, Tom Landry, was able to incorporate
running backs into the passing game because Hayes had defenses so
preoccupied.</TE>
<TE>   "His speed was mind-boggling," former Dallas defensive back
Charlie Waters said. "When he got even with you, you'd already lost
the race.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the track guys I ever knew were kind of lean. When I met
Bob, the first thing I noticed was he had such a developed chest and
upper-body strength. Almost a barrel chest for a small man. He used
that piston action, with the pumping of his arms, to drive his legs.
I'd never seen that."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Roger Staubach once said of Hayes: "When he hit full
stride, there was a definite fear factor."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Hayes was never enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
largely because of drug and alcohol problems that tainted his legacy,
and eventually landed him in a Florida prison. He served 10 months
behind bars in 1979 after pleading guilty to delivering narcotics to
an undercover police officer. It was a transgression that "destroyed
my life," Hayes said in his autobiography, "Run, Bullet, Run: The
Rise, Fall, and Recovery of Bob Hayes." That he never made the Hall
of Fame was a monumental disappointment to him, friends say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question he really wanted that Hall of Fame
recognition," fellow Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson said. "He really
wanted to make that walk, wear that gold jacket. He really wanted
that before he passed on."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates remember Hayes for his spirited sense of humor as well
as his incredible athletic skills. He was the class clown, "one of
the most delightful, lighthearted, fun-loving guys I've ever known,"
Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Hayes' favorite victims were tight end Pettis Norman and
fullback Robert Newhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Norman was terrified of crickets and grasshoppers, so Hayes
routinely slipped them down the back of his jersey. Newhouse wore
shoes with a width of 7E, almost as wide as they were long.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob used to call him 'Elephant feet,' " Pearson said. "He'd say,
'They're not only wide, but they're crusty too.' "</TE>
<TE>   In August, Pearson got an unexpected phone call from Hayes, who
just wanted to chat. The Cowboys had just played an exhibition game
at Jacksonville, and the teams had asked Hayes to perform the
honorary pregame coin toss. He was proud to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew he was sick and his days were numbered," Pearson
said. "But you couldn't tell that by talking to him. He was trying to
make everyone else around him feel comfortable, make them feel at
ease. In his mind, he always thought he could overcome this."</TE>
<TE>   A strong case can be made that Hayes belongs in the Hall of Fame.
He ranks higher in career catches and receiving yards than Lynn
Swann, who was inducted last year, and averaged a remarkable 20 yards
a catch. On average, Hayes scored a touchdown every 5.23 times he
caught the ball, more frequently than Hall of Fame receivers Lance
Allworth (6.38), Raymond Berry (9.28) and Charley Taylor (8.22).</TE>
<TE>   Because he was not inducted within a 15-year window on the regular
ballot, Hayes' only chance to reach Canton, Ohio, rests with the
nine-member seniors committee, which presents one inductee a year.
Perhaps because he felt so snubbed, Hayes felt particular
satisfaction in being included in the Cowboy Ring of Honor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled, I'm grateful, I'm blessed," Hayes told the Texas
Stadium crowd when he was inducted. "I played for the world's
greatest professional sports team in history. Once a Dallas Cowboy,
always a Dallas Cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes is survived by five children, his mother, a brother and a
sister.</TE>

<HD>Davis Fund-Raiser to Follow Signing of Rail Bond Plan</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Backers of the bill will fete the governor,
who approved putting financing of a high-speed line on the ballot in
2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis will be feted at a fund-raiser today, put on by
builders and other advocates of high-speed rail, a day after he
signed legislation asking voters to approve a $9.9-billion bond to
finance construction of a high-speed train system in California.</LD>
<LD>   The fund-raiser is being held at the Santa Clara home of Rod
Diridon, the Davis-appointed chairman of the California High Speed
Rail Authority, which is advocating the bullet train.</LD>
<LD>   In an e-mail to potential donors, Diridon, a former Santa Clara
County supervisor, exhorted people "who will build, operate and
maintain the system throughout the nation and especially here in
California" to attend the event.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview, Diridon said there was a problem "only in
perception" with the timing of the fund-raiser. He added that he has
hosted fund-raisers for many Democratic gubernatorial candidates and
makes "no apology for trying to raise all the money I can possibly
raise to keep a person who supports my ideals in office."</TE>
<TE>   A California Republican Party spokesman, Sean Walsh, accused Davis
of timing his decision to sign the high-speed rail legislation with
the fund-raiser, a charge that Davis aides denied.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics and [gubernatorial] maneuvering surrounding the
signing of this bill were used as an engine to generate campaign
contributions," Walsh said. "This governor has a history of accepting
campaign contributions days before or days after he takes government
action."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar denied any connection
between the fund-raiser and the legislation, adding that this
evening's event is not solely for boosters of high-speed rail.
Salazar said that Davis' aides who help raise money had been unaware
of the approval of the rail bill.</TE>
<TE>   Several California newspapers gave prominent play to the
legislation when it was approved Aug. 30, the second to last day of
the legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way our finance team knows about legislation when
they put these types of things together," Salazar said, adding: "They
don't read that kind of thing" in newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been keeping a full fund-raising schedule, even though
September is one of the busiest months for a governor. In the first
17 days of September, he raised $2.5 million. Davis has until the end
of September to decide whether to sign or veto more than 1,200 bills
approved in the closing days of the legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was ever any question that the governor was
going to sign that bill," Diridon said. "There was no need for us to
run a fund-raiser to get him to sign the bill. That's silly. He has
been a supporter of high-speed rail since he first ran for office."</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed the bill Thursday to place the bond measure on the
2004 ballot. The money would help finance a bullet train that would
speed riders between Los Angeles and San Francisco and Sacramento in
two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, facing reelection on Nov. 5, signed the bill in a ceremony
at the California Railroad Museum, which is dedicated to rail cars
and locomotives from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Just imagine going from Sacramento to Los Angeles in two hours,
not flying, but on high-speed rail," Davis said, with a meticulously
restored locomotive from the era of streamliner trains as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the bill, SB 1856 by Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno), said
the project would be the biggest public works construction program
ever undertaken in the United States and would help meet escalating
transportation demands of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   For some high-speed rail enthusiasts, the bill's signing
represented a turning point in three decades of struggle. If voters
approve the bond measure, construction could start soon after the
2004 election and be finished around 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the bill launches a "new era" of transportation in
California that would rival the accomplishments of former Gov. Edmund
G. "Pat" Brown, who is credited with constructing the California
Water Project, expanding the University of California and leading the
nation in building freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Diridon's fund-raising e-mail calls Davis a strong supporter of
high-speed rail, and urges donations of at least $2,000 per couple
"to help assure his reelection."</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's campaign staff gave us 11 days to pull this off,
and I thought you might be able to help," the e-mail says. "We're
committed to $50,000, and are a far pace from that, so are really in
need of your assistance and that of any that you think might be
willing to help."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign fund-raiser Mike Montgomery, in an e-mail to
Diridon, said: "I know the time is limited, but let's make this one
hugely successful!"</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed several other bills on Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   Health: AB 2178 by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles)
authorizes small and medium-size employers who pay a "living wage" to
acquire health-care insurance for employees through a group
purchasing program. The bill was sponsored by the Los Angeles
Alliance for a New Economy.</TE>
<TE>   Junk faxes: AB 2944 by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego)
abolishes a weak California law in favor of a stronger federal law
requiring mass producers of junk fax advertisements to get
recipients' consent before the ads are sent. Some recipients,
particularly small-business operators, complain that their fax
machines are so overwhelmed with nonstop junk advertising that they
become unusable for business purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Davis disclosed that he owns a "little home office" where the fax
machine is "constantly getting junk faxes." The bill was co-written
by Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey).</TE>

<HD>Simon to Donate Loan Repayments to Charity</HD>
<DH>Politics: The pledge is dismissed by ethics watchdogs, who
say he stands to benefit from campaign donations by getting a tax
write-off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after ethics groups questioned the propriety of his $9 million
in loans to his gubernatorial campaign, Republican Bill Simon Jr.
pledged Thursday to donate any repayments to charity.</LD>
<LD>   "Given my track record of giving away money with my family and my
wife, I'll pledge to you that I'll give away that amount of money
that's repaid--if indeed it is repaid," Simon said.</LD>
<LD>   "And I'll give it away to help people--to help the poor, to help
the underprivileged, to help kids get an education, just as I have my
entire career."</LD>
<TE>   Simon's vow came a day after he disclosed a new $4 million loan to
his cash-strapped campaign, on top of the $5 million he loaned it
before the March primary. The loans were criticized by ethics
watchdogs. They said donations to repay the loans would go directly
into Simon's pocket, and the donors' names would only become known to
voters after the election.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who often accuses Democratic opponent Gov. Gray Davis of
trading state favors for campaign money, denied that the loans
created any ethical problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I disagree with the watchdogs," he told reporters at a campaign
stop in Montebello.</TE>
<TE>   Simon declined to say how quickly he would donate the $9 million
to charity if his loans are repaid. "Over the course of time, I'll be
giving away that amount of money returned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he also would give to charity the repayments of any
future loans to his campaign, Simon smiled, paused and responded,
"Yep."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's pledge failed to quell the concerns of ethics groups.
By writing off the charitable donations on his tax returns, they
said, Simon would still get a direct personal benefit from campaign
donors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shell game," said Jim Knox, executive director of
California Common Cause.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also questioned Simon's decision to lend--rather than
donate--millions of dollars to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, responding to a question about his own campaign
money, told reporters in Sacramento: "I'll tell you what is not in
the best interests of California is for Mr. Simon, my opponent, to
loan himself $9 million and say he hopes to get paid back with
contributions from all kinds of people that will go directly into his
pocket. These contributions to me help finance my campaign. They do
not finance my lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who runs a charitable foundation with his wife, Cindy, last
year donated $525,414 to charity, including $441,778 worth of Hanover
Compressor Co. stock that he bought for $20,866, according to his
income tax returns. A former Hanover board member, Simon bought the
stock before the energy company went public, said a senior advisor,
Jeff Flint.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's pledge to forsake the loan repayments came at a rare
campaign stop designed to promote his record as an investment banker:
a Montebello meat processing plant owned mainly by William E. Simon &amp;
Sons.</TE>
<TE>   Simon used the visit to the Custom Food Products plant to blunt
accusations by Davis that he is a dishonest and incompetent
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has relentlessly distorted my record," said Simon, who
is on leave of absence as co-chairman of the firm. "The fact is, we
have a firm with an outstanding record. The fact is that our
investments have helped provide the capital that has created or saved
thousands of jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's defense of his family investment firm came exactly a week
after a Los Angeles judge overturned a jury's fraud verdict against
William E. Simon &amp; Sons. In a summer-long barrage of television ads,
Davis has used the fraud case and a host of other Simon investments
that went sour to undermine Simon's contention that he has been a
successful businessman.</TE>
<TE>   A spot that Davis started running Monday says Simon "fired
hundreds of workers, many without notice," citing companies in which
the family firm had invested.</TE>
<TE>   At the meat processing plant, Simon sought to make the reverse
argument amid a rumble of conveyer belts carrying ground beef patties
into giant ovens. The Simon firm helped pull Custom Food Products out
of bankruptcy in July when it paid $12.5 million for a controlling
stake in the company, which employs 150 people at the Montebello
plant, said company President Eric W. Elk.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a white lab coat and a white hard hat over a white hair
net, Simon said Davis "cherry-picks" his family firm's bad
investments when, on balance, it creates jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 1 million Californians out of work right now, and the
fact is this: We've got to create more jobs for our citizens," Simon
said. "We've got to lower taxes. We've got to encourage the growth of
businesses like this that provide important products for our people."</TE>
<TE>   The main products at Custom Food are the meat used in Arby's roast
beef sandwiches, Subway's Philly cheese steaks and Hot Pockets frozen
food.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Custom Foods would hire more people if electricity
rates and workers' compensation costs had not risen dramatically
since Davis became governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said California has gained
900,000 jobs since the governor took office in 1999--"even with the
economic problems that this country has been facing."</TE>

<HD>Edison's Bid to Expand Newspaper Tie-In Denied</HD>
<DH>Trade: Utility hoped to build on its L.A. Times
subscription offer, but PUC opposes program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>State regulators on Thursday voted down a proposal by Southern
California Edison to expand its pilot program of offering new
customers subscriptions to The Times.</LD>
<LD>   With little discussion, the California Public Utilities Commission
voted 5 to 0 against expanding the program, and President Loretta
Lynch said it was a mistake to have conditionally approved the
program in January 2000.</LD>
<LD>   At a previous meeting, commissioners raised a barrage of
concerns--that the arrangement could hurt competing newspapers and
telemarketing companies, that it might erode Edison customer service,
that the privacy of utility customers might be violated and that
newspaper coverage of the utility could be blunted.</LD>
<TE>   Edison spokesman Gil Alexander said the company for the time being
will continue the solicitation, hoping the commission staff will come
up with an alternative proposal acceptable to the full commission.
The utility wants to expand the program to three newspapers, to be
determined by competitive bid.</TE>
<TE>   Times spokeswoman Martha Goldstein said the program "is well
within the norms of the newspaper industry.... A newspaper has
business relationships with many large companies, many of which we
cover."</TE>
<TE>   Edison estimated that about 150,000 of the 1 million customers who
call about service connections each year would receive newspaper
solicitations. Over the last three years, 212,000 Edison customers
were asked if they wanted to take The Times--and utility officials
say 6% to 7% of those solicitations resulted in subscriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Edison officials say they have not received any customer
complaints about the solicitation. "We believe that customers have
appreciated the convenience of this service," said Director of
Customer Programs and Services Lynda Ziegler.</TE>

<HD>Fairness of UC Policy Is Debated</HD>
<DH>Regents: Connerly questions new use of personal factors in
admissions reviews, wants an audit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>University of California Regent Ward Connerly asked fellow regents
Thursday to consider an outside audit of the university's new
comprehensive admissions policy, citing concerns about the policy's
fairness.</LD>
<LD>   UC President Richard Atkinson said he has seen no evidence of
unfairness in use of the policy, which allows personal factors, along
with academic ones, to be taken into account for all applicants.</LD>
<LD>   During the discussion at the regents' meeting, only Chairman John
Moores expressed support for Connerly's request. Several others said
they would wait for a UC-generated report, expected in November, on
how the new guidelines are working before making up their minds.</LD>
<TE>   First used in considering this year's freshman class, the policy
allows admission officers to look at personal achievement, as well as
grades and test scores, in reviewing all applicants. Previously, such
personal factors as athletic or artistic ability or a struggle
against poverty or other hardships could be considered for no more
than half the freshman class at each of the university's eight
undergraduate campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Connerly, who went along with the policy change in last November's
vote, said he has become concerned about it since then for several
reasons, including whether it is being used to get around the state's
ban on affirmative action. Connerly was one of the architects of that
ban.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, he asked, does the new emphasis on such subjective
factors as personal adversity "provide opportunities [for students]
to embellish life experiences that can never be proven?"</TE>
<TE>   Connerly said he based his concerns on conversations with high
school counselors and others within and outside the UC, as well as
anecdotal accounts of students adversely affected by the policy,
especially at the university's most selective campuses.</TE>
<TE>   But Atkinson offered a spirited defense of the admissions change,
saying that grades and test scores remain the most important factors
in evaluating any applicant for admission to the university. He said
neither race nor ethnicity is considered in the process.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl said he too believes the
policy is fair and said it has helped university officials identify
the best students. Admissions officers are not easily fooled by tales
of hardship that don't ring true, Berdahl said. "I don't think any
applicant is disadvantaged by anything in this other than a lack of
academic performance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, regents heard a preliminary report of the
university's anticipated challenges over the next decade. Enrollment
is expected to soar from about 187,000 now to at least 217,000 in
2010.</TE>
<TE>   The enrollment growth, largely the result of the children of the
baby boom generation heading to college, will create a need for new
housing, more classroom space and at least 550 new faculty members
each year, officials said.</TE>

<DH>Religion: Work with students and prisoners is expected to
suffer as ministries are curtailed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For 13 years as director of Catholic Ministries at Cal State L.A.,
Robert Warren met the needs of hundreds of students. He had joined
them at Mass, listened to their concerns and smiled at their
triumphs.</LD>
<LD>   So when he entered his office on campus earlier this week, Warren
was a little surprised by what he saw--students huddled to talk about
holding a bake sale to help his family.</LD>
<LD>   Warren, 52, is one of scores of employees of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles who are losing their jobs because of $4.3
million in cutbacks in the church's $42-million headquarters
operating budget.</LD>
<TE>   Offices of seven ministries, including outreach programs to
college students, women, gay men and lesbians, ethnic groups, and
those with physical and mental disabilities, are being closed in
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including family life, prison and religious education
ministries are seeing their work forces cut by as much as 50%. So
far, 60 positions have been cut.</TE>
<TE>   The retrenchment by the nation's most populous Roman Catholic
archdiocese, which covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties, began to take on a human face Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Suzanne Jabro, director of Detention Ministry, spoke of an
encounter between a prisoner and his departing chaplain, Deacon
Paulino Juarez-Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is going to care for us?," the prisoner asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't know yet," Jabro said the deacon replied.</TE>
<TE>   At archdiocesan headquarters in the Mid-Wilshire district, an
older employee offered to give up her salary so a man with a young
family could keep his job. A nun volunteered to call her superior to
ask if her salary could be paid to someone else. "I was really
moved," said Jabro, who spoke of the offers on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not just names and numbers," said Tod Tamberg,
archdiocesan spokesman. "They're friends and co-workers. I know these
people. That makes it doubly difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Along with sadness and anxiety, there has also been anger. Some
employees on Thursday wondered why Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was not
present when the headquarters staff was warned of the upcoming budget
cuts during a meeting Sept. 10. Mahony told The Times on Wednesday he
did not attend because Msgr. Terrance L. Fleming, who, as vicar
general is, in effect, his chief of staff, was in charge of
departments.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the answers to all the questions I didn't have," Mahony
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some employees also speculated that the meeting date--just a day
before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--was chosen
because the news media would likely be preoccupied.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the concern was over what would happen to those served
by ministries being closed.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has said he expects local parishes to pick up many of the
tasks. Others question whether that is realistic.</TE>
<TE>   In jails and prisons, "volunteers just can't walk in. These are
secure facilities. [Volunteers] have to be cleared. They have to be
trained and supervised. There are sections like solitary confinement
where a volunteer is not going to be wandering," said Jabro.</TE>
<TE>   The detention ministry is losing half of the 24 full-time Catholic
chaplains who serve incarcerated men, women and juveniles, as well as
their families, and victims of crime.</TE>
<TE>   The chaplains also have supervised 1,400 volunteers, who visit
jails on behalf of the church.</TE>
<TE>   "This will dramatically affect the L.A. County Jail and Twin
Towers," Jabro said.</TE>
<TE>   At the college ministry, Father Robert Sadowski, director of
University Catholic Center, which serves UCLA, said parishes near
many campuses already find it difficult to meet the needs of their
own people without adding campus ministry. The UCLA program is not
being cut, although programs at six other campuses will end.</TE>
<TE>   "Campus life is a different animal than parish ministry. It's not
something that is easy to succeed at if you're really not doing it
full time," Sadowski said. For a campus ministry to flourish,
students must feel a connection to a campus minister, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're doing things out of your back pocket, it's going to be
very difficult to succeed," Sadowski said. "I'm not saying you can't
succeed, but it just increases the difficulty level exponentially."</TE>
<TE>   At Cal State L.A., Warren said that even though he has lost his
job, he is focusing on keeping the Catholic student group together
after he leaves. He is leaving them with telephone numbers to call if
they want a priest to celebrate Mass or arrange a retreat or need
material for Bible study or personal growth workshops.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving them as many resources as possible," Warren said.
"Our students are really phenomenal. But they all go to school full
time and work a minimum of 20 to 40 hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been done before, but I've seen students do phenomenal
things," he said. "We've put together some incredible service
projects at the last minute."</TE>
<TE>   As for his own future, Warren said he is telling his students not
to worry about him. "I made it clear, we'll survive and I'll move on.
I have a severance package."</TE>

<HD>Family Fears for Safety of Deported Detainee</HD>
<DH>Mystery: INS escorts man to Pakistan, where he was taken
into custody. No one has heard from him since.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A longtime California resident, who a decade ago attended flight
schools with a now-convicted terrorist, has been deported to
Pakistan, and his whereabouts are a mystery to family, friends and
U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   Nasir Ali Mubarak agreed last month to leave the U.S. under
pressure from federal authorities who long ago determined that his
student visa had expired.</LD>
<LD>   But after being escorted to Pakistan by two INS agents, Mubarak,
35, was taken into custody by plainclothes Pakistani authorities,
according to the INS. Mubarak has not been heard from again.</LD>
<TE>   Mubarak's detention has angered his American-born wife and
prompted Amnesty International to formally request that the U.S.
government take steps to ensure his safety.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is the U.S. government sent him back, and then they say
they don't know where he is. And that is really disgusting to me,"
said Stephanie Mubarak, who lives just outside Chico, where her
husband ran an aircraft painting business.</TE>
<TE>   In letters to U.S. officials, Amnesty International raised "grave
and pressing fears" about the well-being of Mubarak, who moved to
California from the United Arab Emirates in 1991 and had not been in
Pakistan since he was 3 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has an obligation not to return anyone to a country
where they are at risk of serious human rights abuses," wrote Ignacio
Saiz, the program director in America for the human rights
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, a pilot who has two American-born children, was among
hundreds of foreign nationals questioned by the FBI immediately after
the attacks of Sept. 11. Records and interviews show Mubarak came to
the attention of federal authorities because he was a friend and
roommate a decade ago of Abdul Hakim Murad, a Pakistani sentenced to
life in prison for plotting to blow up 12 U.S. jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, more than 1,000 people detained across the country
for questioning have been deported for immigration violations. But
Mubarak's case appears to be a rarity, said Los Angeles attorney Paul
Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   "As a civil rights lawyer, I have been involved in litigation
where people detained after Sept. 11 have been deported," said
Hoffman, who was recently named chairman of Amnesty International.
"And I have not heard of any case like this where someone has been
deported and then not heard from."</TE>
<TE>   After questioning Mubarak several times beginning Sept. 11,
authorities never charged him with any links to terrorism. Indeed, an
FBI report in June detailed the friendship between Mubarak and Murad
but also noted that Mubarak is not a practicing Muslim and "is not a
member of any groups."</TE>
<TE>   That same month, he was taken into custody at Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport while traveling with his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak had faced deportation since 1999 for overstaying his
student visa and had remained free while appealing on grounds that he
was eligible for permanent residency based on his marriage. But after
the June arrest, authorities pressed their case to deport him and
contended that he was a flight risk who should not be released from
custody.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak, who had long challenged his deportation, became so
frustrated by his limited prospects of remaining in the U.S. that he
agreed to leave the country, according to his wife and attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "It was disconcerting for him to even go to Pakistan," said
Stephanie Mubarak. "He didn't know what he would do there. He didn't
know how he would make a living. He had no family there.</TE>
<TE>   "But he told me he didn't want to be in a country that didn't want
him," his wife said. "He said, 'I haven't done anything wrong ... and
I will not live in fear of being picked up when I have done nothing."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 29, Mubarak left the U.S. under the escort of two INS
agents, arriving at the Islamabad airport the following night.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed that they had not hear from him since, his wife and his
attorney requested information from the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   An INS attorney in San Francisco replied in a Sept. 10 letter that
after Mubarak and the INS officers arrived at the airport in
Pakistan, they were approached by "persons who our officers believe
were officials of the Pakistani government.</TE>
<TE>   "These persons were not in uniform and did not identify themselves
and so, the officers are not aware of the agency or agencies of the
Pakistani government to which these officials belong," Paul K.
Nishiie, assistant district counsel for the INS, wrote to Mubarak's
attorney, Marc Van Der Hout.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak and the INS officers were driven to an airport lounge
where their travel documents were examined, Nishiie wrote. "While in
the executive lounge," he added, "Mr. Mubarak told one of the INS
officers that he knew the person who appeared to be in charge of the
other officials."</TE>
<TE>   After their documents were examined, Mubarak and the INS officers
were escorted outside the airport terminal to two parked cars and a
jeep, Nishiie wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Mubarak was asked to get into the jeep with his luggage,
which he did. Once Mr. Mubarak was in the jeep it drove away,"
Nishiie wrote, adding that as the jeep pulled away, a Pakistani
official told one of the INS officers that Mubarak was being taken to
a detention center.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers have no knowledge as to the truth of the statement,"
Nishiie wrote. "This was the last time the INS officers had any
contact with Mr. Mubarak."</TE>
<TE>   While Mubarak's attorney and others have raised the specter that
he may have been turned over to Pakistani officials at the behest of
the U.S., Nishiie denied that notion.</TE>
<TE>   "At no time did either INS officer ask any official of the
Pakistani government to detain Mr. Mubarak," he wrote. "Nor are the
INS officers aware of any request or inducement, on the part of any
component of the United States Department of Justice to have the
government of Pakistan detain Mr. Mubarak upon his arrival."</TE>
<TE>   INS officials refused further comment on the case, referring calls
to the State Department. A spokesman there said he was unaware of the
case and knew of no legal authority requiring the department to take
responsibility abroad for non-U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokesman in Sacramento said agents there completed their
investigation of Mubarak after his case was referred to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   "We were finished with Mr. Mubarak when our agent last testified
at his deportation hearing," said Supervisory Special Agent Frank G.
Scafidi. "And we have made no requests of any government anywhere to
intercede on our behalf with him."</TE>
<TE>   An official spokesman for the Pakistan Embassy in Washington,
D.C., said he was unaware of the case but would not be surprised that
someone deported from the U.S. would be questioned upon their arrival
in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is a law-and-order matter, they are not obliged to tell us
what they are doing," said press attache Asad Hayauddin. "But we will
look into the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Mubarak's wife said she grows more concerned by the day
for his safety. "I just keep praying every day," she said, "and
hoping."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband's attorney, Van Der Hout, said, "They accuse him of
being involved in terrorist activity with absolutely no evidence to
support such charges, hand him over to the Pakistani government and
then attempt to wash their hands of the whole matter when he
disappears into the abysses of Islamabad."</TE>

<HD>POW Camp Atrocities Led to Treason Trial</HD>
<DH>Tomoya Kawakita claimed dual citizenship, abusing captured
GIs in Japan in World War II, then moving to the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Army veteran William L. Bruce, a survivor of Corregidor, the Bataan
death march and three years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp,
couldn't believe his eyes as he shopped with his bride one autumn day
in 1946 at the Sears department store in Boyle Heights.</LD>
<LD>   Standing a few aisles away amid the crush of shoppers in that
quintessentially American setting was the man responsible for
brutalizing Bruce and scores of other GIs held captive in Japan's
Oeyama prison camp on Honshu Island.</LD>
<LD>   Tomoya Kawakita, who held dual citizenship in the U.S. and Japan,
served as an interpreter and self-appointed taskmaster at the camp,
earning the nickname "Efficiency Expert" for his methods of
inflicting pain on inmates weakened by malnourishment and forced
labor.</LD>
<TE>   "I was so dumbfounded, I just halted in my tracks and stared at
him as he hurried by," Bruce, then 24 and attending college under the
GI Bill, said shortly after the encounter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good thing, too," said the former artilleryman. "If I'd
reacted then, I'm not sure but that I might have taken the law into
my own hands--and probably Kawakita's neck."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bruce followed him outside the store, jotted down the
license plate number of his car and notified the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Kawakita, who had returned to the United States after the war and
enrolled at USC, was tried and convicted of treason in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles and sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence was never carried out. In 1953, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, responding to appeals from the Japanese government,
commuted Kawakita's death sentence to life in prison. In 1963,
President John F. Kennedy ordered him freed after 16 years behind
bars on the condition that he be deported to Japan and never return.</TE>
<TE>   Now more than half a century since his trial, Kawakita holds the
distinction of being the last person prosecuted for treason against
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He was represented at his federal court trial by Morris Lavine, a
colorful Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer, who was fond of
describing himself as "attorney for the damned." Lavine's clients
ranged from the indigent, whom he represented at no charge, to the
likes of mobsters Mickey Cohen and Johnny Roselli, and Teamsters boss
James Hoffa.</TE>
<TE>   Heading the prosecution team was U.S. Atty. James M. Carter, who
went on to become a federal appeals court judge.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen former POWs testified against Kawakita. They
described how he forced prisoners to beat one another, and then beat
those he thought didn't hit the other prisoners hard enough. They
accused him of forcing prisoners to run laps until they collapsed in
exhaustion simply because they had finished their work assignments
early.</TE>
<TE>   The camp was set up next to a nickel ore mine and processing
plant, where most of about 400 American POWs were forced to work.
Kawakita was employed by the mining company.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he forced a prisoner to carry a heavy log up an icy slope.
The prisoner fell and suffered a serious spinal injury. Fellow POWs
testified that Kawakita waited five hours before summoning help for
the injured American.</TE>
<TE>   They also recalled being taunted by Kawakita with comments such
as: "We will kill all you prisoners right here anyway, whether you
win the war or lose it."</TE>
<TE>   And, "You guys needn't be interested in when the war will be over,
because you won't go back. You will stay here and work. I will go
back to the States because I am an American citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Kawakita's citizenship proved to be a crucial issue during the
trial and subsequent court appeals.</TE>
<TE>   By definition, treason can be committed only by someone owing
allegiance to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Calexico to Japanese parents, Kawakita held dual
citizenship under U.S. and Japanese laws. In 1939, at the age of 18,
he went to Japan to attend school. He remained there after the
outbreak of war, graduating from Meiji University.</TE>
<TE>   At the trial, Lavine advanced a novel argument. As a dual U.S. and
Japanese citizen, he argued, his client owed exclusive allegiance to
the country in which he resided. In this case, Japan. Lavine also
contended that Kawakita had effectively renounced his U.S.
citizenship by signing a family census register maintained by
Japanese authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In his instructions to jurors, U.S. District Judge William C.
Mathes made it clear that if they found that Kawakita genuinely
believed he was no longer an American citizen, then they must acquit
him of the treason charges.</TE>
<TE>   Sequestered during deliberations, the jury struggled mightily to
resolve the question--declaring several times that they were
hopelessly deadlocked. But ultimately they found Kawakita guilty on
eight of 13 overt acts of treason charged by the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   When he appeared for sentencing, Kawakita continued to insist he
was innocent. "As I have been found guilty by the jury, I ask your
honor for mercy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By law, Mathes had leeway to impose a sentence ranging from a
minimum of five years in prison to a maximum of death at Alcatraz.</TE>
<TE>   He chose the latter, saying: "Reflection leads to the conclusion
that the only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor, such as this
defendant has proved to be, is to serve as an example to those of
weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason
against the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Today, most of those involved in the case are either dead or, if
alive, could not be located. One exception is William J. Kelleher,
then a federal prosecutor and now a senior U.S. District Court judge
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not take part in the trial, Kelleher was assigned
to draft the government's response to Kawakita's appeal of his
conviction. As a result, he immersed himself in every detail of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week , Kelleher recalled being visited at his
office by Bruce and two other former POWs while he was working on his
brief for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and the boys had a little meeting last night," he said Bruce
told him. "And we want you to know that if he ever gets out, we'll be
waiting for him."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Kelleher said, the appeals court upheld Kawakita's
conviction by a 3-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   It was a much closer call when the appeal went before the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1952. The vote was 4 to 3 to uphold the conviction.
Two of the court's nine justices disqualified themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At the crux of the case was this question: Where does the
allegiance of a dual citizen lie when two nations, each claiming his
loyalty, go to war?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, a person caught in that predicament can resolve the
conflict of duty by openly electing one nationality or the other,"
said Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Kawakita, the court said, chose neither option, trying instead to
hedge his bets on the war's outcome while freely performing acts of
hostility against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "One who wants that freedom can get it by renouncing his American
citizenship," Douglas wrote. "He can not turn it to a fair-weather
citizenship, retaining it for possible contingent benefits but
meanwhile playing the role of the traitor. An American citizen owes
allegiance to the United States wherever he may reside."</TE>

<LD>The head of the quasi-public agency that promotes filming in Los

<LD>   He also said the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. has
given money to state and national film organizations when asked to do
so. Those contributions include money to support an awards event of
the San Jose Film Commission and to host a party at the Assn. of
International Commercial Producers in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   EIDC President Cody Cluff, who is under investigation by the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office for alleged misuse of
funds, Thursday defended the donation to the Pittsburgh commission,
saying it was made as a show of support for a film official who has
"led the charge" to keep filmmaking inside the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Breaking his silence for the first time since the probe became
public, he said the EIDC gave the Pittsburgh Film Office $5,000 in
each of the last two years to support its fund-raising efforts.</TE>
<TE>   EIDC's spending has been under scrutiny for alleged misuse of
funds, including money spent for personal expense accounts and
political contributions made by the office to elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley sent letters this week
to the EIDC board--composed of City Council members and county
supervisors as well as industry representatives--warning them about
using EIDC funds to pay for criminal defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's office maintains that the EIDC is a public entity, and
his letters ask board members to "carefully consider your fiduciary
obligation to ensure that public funds" are not being used in the
legal defense of the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was formed by the Los Angeles City Council and the
county Board of Supervisors in 1995 to provide one-stop shopping for
film permits and to keep movie production in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand the validity for that kind of contribution to
an out-of-city film office," said Vance Van Petten, director of the
Producers Guild of America. "It just doesn't make sense to me from
the standpoint of what the EIDC is suppose to do."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, whose office and home were searched by law enforcement
officers on Sept. 5, said that EIDC expenditures were warranted.</TE>
<TE>   He said the $10,000 contribution to the Pittsburgh office, first
reported in the Los Angeles Daily News on Thursday, was given to help
and recognize the efforts of Pittsburgh Film Commissioner Dawn
Keezer, who as chairwoman of FilmUS, leads a national organization
made up of 196 film commissioners. The group tries to stem the flow
of film and TV production to other nations.</TE>
<TE>   FilmUS has been lobbying Congress for tax relief for the film
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff and Keezer have had a close working relationship and even
attended the 2000 Academy Awards together. Both serve on the board of
directors for FilmUS.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, who described Keezer as "a friend and a colleague," said
the donation was made after he learned that the Pittsburgh office
might lose its funding, which could result in its closing.</TE>
<TE>   He said the EIDC decided to help the office "in recognition of the
leadership role Keezer played in the federal tax relief effort and
the critical need for an articulate, dedicated spokesperson who is
not from Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   FilmUS's work is important to the EIDC's effort to lobby for
federal legislation, Cluff said, and Keezer "is the only person who
has been willing to step up, assume a leadership role and do the
work."</TE>
<TE>   "EIDC wants to keep every production in Los Angeles to the extent
possible," Cluff said. "But, if for some reason the environs of Los
Angeles does not provide a film company what it is looking for, EIDC
would rather the film company take its business to Pittsburgh, and
not Toronto, because Toronto is more of a direct competitor than
Pittsburgh."</TE>

<HD>Defense Seeks to Purge Racist Remarks on JDL Tape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Besides denigrating Arabs, Jewish Defense League leader Earl Krugel
made racist remarks about African Americans during secretly recorded
conversations with an FBI informant, according to defense documents
filed in connection with his upcoming bombing conspiracy trial.</LD>
<LD>   Krugel's lawyer has asked U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew to
bar prosecutors from playing the offensive portions of the tape
recordings when the trial gets underway in mid-November.</LD>
<LD>   "The racist expressions used by Mr. Krugel are irrelevant to the
case at bar," defense attorney Mark Werksman declared in his court
papers.</LD>
<TE>   "And even if somehow relevant, the introduction of such evidence
could prejudice the jury or mislead or confuse them into forming a
negative impression of Mr. Krugel and possibly convicting him out of
a distaste for his language, rather than because he is guilty of the
offenses charged," Werksman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lew has scheduled a hearing on the motion in early November.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel, 59, the JDL's West Coast coordinator, and Irv Rubin, 56,
the group's national director, are accused of plotting to blow up the
Muslim Public Affairs Council offices in Los Angeles, the King Fahd
Mosque in Culver City and a field office of Rep. Darrell E. Issa
(R-Vista), an Arab American.</TE>
<TE>   The men, who are being held without bail, have denied the charges.
They say that Danny Gillis, a JDL member-turned-FBI informant,
concocted the bomb plot and tried to entrap them in order to oust
them as leaders of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to revolve largely around the contents of
the surreptitious tape recordings. Many of the conversations took
place at Krugel's home and at a popular delicatessen in the San
Fernando Valley. Most were between Krugel and Gillis but some
included Rubin as well.</TE>
<TE>   During the meetings, prosecutors allege, the bombing targets were
discussed and Gillis was directed to buy some of the bomb components,
including gunpowder and pipes.</TE>
<TE>   Werksman cited six instances on the tapes in which Krugel told
racist jokes or made racially obnoxious comments.</TE>
<TE>   Reached for comment about the remarks, Werksman denied that his
client is a racist.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a dedicated, zealous advocate of protecting the Jewish
community and, in unguarded moments, he used derogatory language that
does not reflect his true feelings about other peoples' race and
ethnicity," the defense attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner, the lead prosecutor in the
case, had no immediate comment on Werksman's motion. He said the
government plans to file a response with the court before the
scheduled hearing.</TE>

<HD>Court OKs Recall Bid in South Gate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court Thursday ruled that a voter recall drive targeting
South Gate's leaders may go forward.</LD>
<LD>   The state appellate court in Los Angeles rejected city officials'
contention that the recall petitions circulated among voters were
biased.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision, upholding a lower-court order, clears the
way for a possible recall election as early as January, though an
appeal to the state Supreme Court could push it back further.</LD>
<TE>   Also, the county registrar-recorder's office still must verify
some of the 8,000 signatures on the petitions. About 5,500 valid
signatures are required.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the recall targets were not available for comment on
the ruling. Recall supporters said the date of the recall was less
important than the fact voters may have a say at the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   "The court saw this appeal for what it was: an attempt to thwart
the will of the people of South Gate," said Stephen Kaufman, the
attorney for recall supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Recall proponents are trying to oust Treasurer Albert Robles and
his allies on the City Council, who form a majority. They are Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel and Councilwoman Maria
Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   The recall backers accuse the officials of corruption, charges the
officials deny.</TE>
<TE>   The legal battle began earlier this year after South Gate
officials threw out the recall petitions, saying they were flawed.</TE>
<TE>   According to election laws, circulated petitions must state the
proponents' reasons for the recall, as well as responses from
targeted officials.</TE>
<TE>   The petitions did provide the required content, but the officials
claimed that their answers were published in lighter type, creating a
biased presentation.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices said the petitions substantially complied with
the format rules. They also said that a balanced presentation was
irrelevant, because the leaders' answers did not address any of the
corruption charges. Instead, they warn residents in Spanish and
English to not sign the petition without consulting an attorney.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Leads Meeting of the Minds at 'Ground Zero' for
Homelessness</HD>
<DH>Aid: Activists and civic leaders gather to brainstorm on
remedies ranging from telethons for housing to declaring a state of
emergency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA and JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling Los Angeles ''ground zero'' for the problem of homelessness
in the nation, activists and civic leaders gathered downtown Thursday
to suggest remedies such as telethons to raise money for housing and
a Web site to reconnect homeless people to their families around the
country.</LD>
<LD>   The summit at the Central Library was convened by Los Angeles
County Sheriff Lee Baca, who has made ending homelessness a personal
and departmental priority. It was co-hosted by City Councilwoman Jan
Perry, who represents downtown's skid row, where more than 11,000
people live on the streets, in shelters or hotels. Studies estimate
that there are another 15,000 homeless people elsewhere in the
county.</LD>
<LD>   Perry set the tone of the gathering, noting that each night at
least 300 women, often with children, seek shelter on skid row and
that many are turned away because of a lack of beds.</LD>
<TE>   Allowing such people to sleep in the elements ''is inhuman,''
Perry said to applause from the 250 or so attendees. ''We have to
look at homelessness in a new way, as a public health issue.''</TE>
<TE>   Al Scaduto, chief of correctional services for the Sheriff's
Department, likened the situation regarding the homeless to an
earthquake that leaves thousands without shelter. He urged officials
to declare a state of emergency and to obtain federal and state funds
for housing and services.</TE>
<TE>   Summit participants offered ideas that included the heartfelt and
the practical.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them were: starting a national advertising campaign to
educate the public about the moral issues of homelessness;
establishing small bathing facilities around the county where people
could also obtain clean clothes and meal tokens; dedicating a portion
of politicians' campaign funds to dental care for homeless people;
holding a local or national telethon annually to raise millions of
dollars to help get people off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Eric Garcetti said he and fellow
Councilman Ed Reyes are exploring the idea of using abandoned
commercial buildings for permanent and transitional housing, which
would require amending zoning ordinances. There are also plans for a
year-round emergency shelter in Hollywood, home to thousands of
homeless youths, Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers noted that there are already many successful
programs that can be used as models. San Diego Police Sgt. Scott
Bender, for example, spoke about that city's 4-year-old program,
which teams police officers and health workers to find homes for
street people.</TE>
<TE>   Joel John Roberts, executive director of the group People
Assisting the Homeless, advocated more one-stop service malls,
providing shelter and linking homeless people with government aid and
charitable services under one roof. The group has already built one
such mall in Hollywood and has found permanent housing for many
clients.</TE>
<TE>   Other participants included state Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), who has championed services for the mentally-ill
homeless, and Tyrone Roy, a homeless Los Angeles man who sleeps on
church steps each night. City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel and county
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke also attended.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg stressed that agencies aiding the homeless must be held
accountable, both for results and for their finances. Such
accountability will help to offset the reluctance of many Los Angeles
area residents to locate services in their neighborhoods, he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We cannot proudly declare the most prosperous nation on Earth
while people are living on the streets,'' Steinberg said. ''It's not
a product of hard hearts. It's simply that people have not believed
there are solutions to these problems.''</TE>
<TE>   Many homeless people do not seek services because they feel there
is no hope, Roy said. He said that any solution must include input
from people like him.</TE>
<TE>   ''These people empathize,'' he said, ''but not one of them has
lived on the street.''</TE>
<TE>   Baca said that, within 90 days, he will mold ideas developed at
the meeting into an action plan on which the city and county can work
together.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of the need for urgency, noting that coming winter months
will worsen the spread of sickness and misery. He detailed how his
own department is involved in the problem, with jail as the only
housing for mentally ill and other prisoners arrested on skid row for
various crimes.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our Twin Towers jail houses one of the largest mental hospitals
in the nation, which is a startling testimony to the state of
affairs,'' he said. ''Every day, we release 35 to 50 individuals who
have no home or family to go to, and the options for them are slim.
So as much as anyone [here], I'm in the business and I want to make
it better.''</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the sheriff proposed establishing an encampment
near that jail to rehabilitate homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   Some said that the absence of Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn from
the summit symbolized the need for the city and county to collaborate
more. Many of the proposed solutions depend on more coordination to
obtain state and federal resources.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn aides said the mayor had already been booked elsewhere on
related issues. Hahn appeared in the morning at a low-income Van Nuys
apartment building to discuss affordable housing with a delegation
from the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting this week in Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by the delegation and residents of Offsay-Steinhauser
Village, Hahn raised some of the same concerns expressed at the
library summit.</TE>
<TE>   ''So many people in our nation's cities find themselves on the
street, homeless,'' Hahn said. ''Sometimes many of us are only a
paycheck away from finding ourselves without any place to live.''</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's major initiative has been support of a trust fund for
affordable housing that will grow to $100 million over time.</TE>
<TE>   He said some of the fund could assist those now living on the
street or in downtown's single-room-occupancy hotels. A trust fund
commission has been convened to determine the principles that will
govern allocations.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think that the homeless problem does have a relationship to
the fact that there's a lack of affordable housing. We want to build
affordable housing in this city,'' Hahn said.</TE>

<HD>Stars Come Out to Urge Arts in Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: At a special committee hearing in Burbank,
actors and lawmakers discuss ways to foster cultural instruction for
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood stars and Sacramento politicians Thursday urged schools in
California to pay the kind of attention to the arts that is given to
mathematics and reading.</LD>
<LD>   At a special meeting of a state legislative committee in Burbank,
arts education advocates insisted that youngsters' overall academic
achievements improve when they are involved in subjects such as drama
and music.</LD>
<LD>   Speakers such as actresses Helen Hunt and Debbie Allen lamented
that budget restraints have reduced fine arts classes at many
California schools.</LD>
<TE>   Hunt, who won the Academy Award for best actress in 1997, spent
the summer mentoring young drama students, she told the Legislature's
Joint Committee on the Arts. She said many others in the film
industry are willing to participate in arts education programs but
need to be approached by school officials.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt said the drama classes she took at Providence High School in
Burbank were critical to her at the time and later in her career.</TE>
<TE>   "Being able to express myself saved me," she said. "Think how
important [the arts are] now. We're asking our kids to grow up in
overwhelming times."</TE>
<TE>   Other witnesses at the hearing held at Burbank City Hall said
research shows the arts help students succeed in their core academic
subjects. For example, drama encourages students to understand story
lines and words before acting them out. Music incorporates math
skills through spatial reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that arts are frivolous add-ons to the curriculum
can't be farther from the truth," said James Catterall, a professor
at the UCLA Graduate School of Education who has studied the effects
of art on children.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative committee's chairman, Sen. Jack Scott
(D-Altadena), said the hearing was intended to gather information for
possible legislation next year to boost arts in the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who runs a dance center in Culver City and starred in the
hit TV show "Fame," described most arts programs in schools as
"abysmal."</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great void," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen said educators should take advantage of young people's taste
for hip-hop culture to spark their creativity at school. She said it
could inspire dance and songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   California has one art teacher for every 737 students, according
to the state Department of Education. In Los Angeles County, one art
teacher is available for every 1,200 students. Many school districts
are weathering severe budget deficits, and few people expect arts
programs to expand.</TE>
<TE>   The county Office of Education, acknowledging its deficiencies in
the arts, next week is scheduled to release a blueprint to improve
such instruction. The plan, in conjunction with the county Arts
Commission and Board of Supervisors, will call for more required
courses, better training for teachers, more links to nonprofit and
professional arts groups, and more funding by local districts.
Details of the plan will be released on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, however, is considered a
happy exception. It is in the middle of a 10-year plan that began in
1999 to include art instruction on its campuses. So far, $25 million
has been spent on the plan despite cutbacks in other areas. Today,
every L.A. Unified elementary school has a music teacher, and nearly
a third have dance, theater and visual arts programs as well,
district officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a period of great need," said L.A. Unified Supt. Roy
Romer, a jazz and opera fan. "But we have kept our faith in this
commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Robinson of the J. Paul Getty Trust and an advisor to
President Bush on education, said the arts have been marginalized in
education systems the world over. He said an international culture
has emerged in which people think arts education will not lead
children to employment.</TE>
<TE>   "Intelligence is diverse," he said. "Mathematicians think
visually. Dancers think mathematically."</TE>

<HD>District to Correct Tax Assessment Figure</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: A letter to parents understated amount that
property owners would pay under terms of proposed school improvement
bond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials said late Thursday that they would
correct a letter distributed to hundreds of thousands of parents that
understated how much property owners would pay for the district's
proposed school bond.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to pay for a mass correction came more than two weeks
after the district learned that a letter sent home with
back-to-school packages contained a typographical error that left the
impression that the tax assessment would be $5 a month.</LD>
<LD>   It should have said $5 per month per $100,000 of value, meaning
the owner of a house worth $500,000 would pay $25 a month.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to send a corrected letter was made Thursday evening,
after a Times reporter inquired about the problem. Gene Krischer, a
school district gadfly, had told the Board of Education about the
error Sept. 10 at a public meeting. Since then, he said, he has been
frustrated by what he considers a runaround.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wanted to pull teeth, I'd have been a dentist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they learned of the error before the
meeting, after a parent called a principal. The delay was the result
of deliberation on how best to get the information to parents, said
Glenn Gritzner, special assistant to the superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going back and forth," Gritzner said Thursday evening,
after confirming the decision with the district's budget office.
"Let's figure out what our options are. Let's figure out if it's
something that's easily done. Who pays for it? The call I just got
was from a budget person saying you can do this."</TE>
<TE>   The district plans to send new letters home with younger students,
and to mail them to the parents of older students.</TE>

<HD>8 Arrested in 'Date Rape' Drug Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Crime: Task force seizes substantial quantities of GHB in
raids in six L.A.-area communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight suspects were arrested and substantial quantities of illicit
drugs were seized in a series of raids on a Los Angeles-area ring
specializing in the sale and distribution of the "date rape" drug
known as GHB, a law enforcement task force said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Officers from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs
Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department and other agencies made the arrests and confiscated the
drugs Wednesday in Echo Park, Hollywood, Malibu, Pacific Palisades,
Tarzana and Toluca Lake. The raids were part of a nationwide
crackdown on distributors of GHB, or gamma hydroxybuteric acid,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Agents said the ring used the Internet and the mail to sell and
distribute GHB and its derivatives. The drug can cause dizziness,
drowsiness, memory loss and loss of inhibition. The DEA said it has
documented 72 deaths related to GHB and its derivatives.</LD>
<TE>   Booked on suspicion of possession of controlled substances for
sale and unlawful distribution of controlled substances were Kenneth
Kleckner, 32, Brian Riedlinger, 38, and Brian Smith, 42, all of Los
Angeles; Christine Laguna, 27, and Kevin Saltzer, 42, both of Pacific
Palisades; Craig Collins, 56, of Malibu; Richard Samaan, 28, of
Tarzana; and Kevin Lacy, 35, of West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Confiscated during the raids were a .30-caliber rifle, hypodermic
syringes and "substantial quantities" of GHB, anabolic steroids,
cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms and other
illicit pharmaceuticals, the DEA said.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Proposal for a Mob Museum May Spell Trouble for
the Careless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read in the Wall Street Journal where Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman
has proposed a "mob museum" to honor some of the illustrious founders
of the desert burg. Why should Tony Soprano get all the attention
these days? Whatever, let's hope no one disses Flamingo Hotel founder
Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel this time around--I mean, as far as spelling
his last name correctly.</LD>
<LD>   A previous tribute to the mobster, a street in a Las Vegas
development, was named Bugsy Siegal Circle. (And, no, it wasn't a
different Bugsy). This wasn't the first such snub. After the mobster
was shot to death in a Beverly Hills mansion in 1947, his toe tag in
the morgue read "Seigel."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of rest stops: Ken Johnson of Irwindale noticed that a
group called Alive After Five chose an ironic spot for a get-together
(see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Wait until the Humane Society hears about this: Passing through
Flagstaff, Ariz., Judy Post saw a sign that raises the question: How
would you apply the Denver boot? (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Quite a burden for the mail carrier: Carol Lamar of Fairmont
Elementary School in Yorba Linda was reading a brochure for a new
third-grade weekly newspaper when she "came across this incentive to
subscribe" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   While she'd love to have some help, the shipments are weekly, and
she's wondering if her tiny classroom would be able to hold the
accumulation of human cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Radio daze: Author Don Barrett shook up some of his readers the
other day, writing on his popular laradio.com Web site that he was
retiring his cyber column to collect $10 million from a mysterious
Nigerian e-mailer.</TE>
<TE>   It was a joke, of course, a reaction, he says, to the 300 or so
spam e-mails he receives a day, including the never-ending offers
from Nigeria. But another Web site picked up the report of his
retirement. Some readers hated to see him go, while one less
emotional fan asked about acquiring Barrett's archives.</TE>
<TE>   But talk-show host Hugh Hewitt of KRLA-AM scoffed at the
announcement, informing Barrett that he had beaten him to the
Nigerian money.</TE>
<TE>   Taming of the shrill: A colleague was about to board a Metrolink
train in Anaheim when he heard "two businessmen pacing back and forth
in front of me, blabbing loudly on their cell phones, passing each
other like royal sentries on patrol. Then they got on the train and
sat next to me.</TE>
<TE>   "I put on my headphones and tried to drown out their chatter while
I read my book. But they were both trying to talk over the other and
kept ratcheting up the volume."</TE>
<TE>   After several minutes of this audio assault, he decided "to begin
reading aloud to them from 'Taming of the Shrew.' They looked stunned
and asked what I was doing. I continued reading without acknowledging
them. Then they told me they were very busy and tried to go about
their business. So I ratcheted up the Bard.</TE>
<TE>   "When the train pulled into the station, I shut the book and
disembarked. I'm not sure they got the point, but it made my day."</TE>
<TE>   Good for him, even if a more appropriately titled Shakespeare play
would have been "Measure for Measure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

his home, the family hands the phone to his 3-year-old sister to
practice her singing.</TE>

<HD>Valley Cityhood Leaders Step Into a 'Lion's Den'</HD>
<DH>Secession: Two mayoral candidates carry their breakup
message to a skeptical audience of more than 250 downtown executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley secession leaders told a skeptical audience of
downtown executives Thursday that breaking up the city would force
Los Angeles to lower taxes and take other steps to nurture business
growth.</LD>
<LD>   Venturing into what one executive called a "lion's den," Valley
mayoral candidates Mel Wilson and Keith Richman addressed a forum of
more than 250 members of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce,
Central City Assn. and Los Angeles Headquarters Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The chamber and Central City Assn. oppose the Valley and Hollywood
secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot, and the Headquarters group
is expected to come out against them soon.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson and Richman found themselves outnumbered on a six-member
panel. During several heated exchanges with the candidates, secession
opponents said a municipal split would create financially weakened
cities and damage the area economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe secession will reduce Los Angeles' stature and
political clout and will negatively [affect] its economy," Central
City Assn. President Carol Schatz said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said Los Angeles does a good
job reaching out to businesses. She said it is first among major
cities in small-business start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a city that is much greater together than the sum of our
parts," Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom LaBonge said secession would be "morally wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody who has had a good divorce," he said. "It
hurts people. It's going to hurt our community for about 10 years
plus."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a Republican Assemblyman from Northridge, said the
secession measures were put on the ballot after the Local Agency
Formation Commission found that the split would not financially harm
the Valley, Hollywood or the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He said secession would improve city services to all parts of Los
Angeles by bringing government closer to neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "A new San Fernando Valley city will be the catalyst for
improvements here in the city of Los Angeles," Richman said, "a
catalyst for making it more efficient."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who manages realty offices for Re/Max, said the company
pays much more in taxes on property transactions in Los Angeles than
it does in the West Valley city of Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   "When we become two vibrant, thriving, independent cities, we all
become better off," said Wilson, a former chairman of the United
Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley. "Maybe after we
lower our taxes, Los Angeles will, too."</TE>
<TE>   After Wilson and Richman made their initial case, a show of hands
in the Wilshire Grand Hotel ballroom indicated only five of the
business leaders support breaking up Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Hollywood secession opponents alleged that breakup
advocates are circulating material that falsely implies Miscikowski
and L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, as LAFCO members, endorse
a split.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski voted against putting secession on the ballot, while
Yaroslavsky voted for the election but is neutral on a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sept. 14 letter to voters, secession leader Gene La Pietra
said, "County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, City Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski and the other prestigious LAFCO members ultimately voted
to bring the issue to the people of Los Angeles on November 5th."</TE>
<TE>   A La Pietra brochure featured LAFCO members' photos next to a
fragment of the agency's mission statement--"Essential to the social,
fiscal and economic well-being of the State of California."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Glazier, co-chairman of the anti-secession group Hollywood
and Los Angeles as One (HALO), called the material "lies."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said the letter and brochure were meant to show voters
that the LAFCO board is distinguished.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply point out that Cindy Miscikowski was one of those
people who was part of the process," he said of the letter. "It is
very accurate."</TE>

<LD>A West Valley mall was closed for 4 1/2 hours Thursday morning after
authorities received a phone threat and found buckets containing a
chemical near an air-conditioning unit.</LD>
<LD>   No one was injured, and authorities determined that the substance
was used for the cooling system at Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police received an anonymous call about 8 a.m. from a man who said
hazardous chemicals had been dispersed in the entrances, play areas
and restrooms at the mall.</LD>

antibiotics, it can be fatal if not treated properly. Two people in
the county have died this year of the disease.</LD>
<TE>   Children are required to have immunization shots before they are
admitted to school in California, but officials said that in some
cases immunity can begin to wear off after about five years.</TE>

<HD>Biggest U.S. Desalination Site Wins OK</HD>
<DH>Technology: More approvals still needed for Huntington
Beach plant, which would make seawater drinkable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State health officials said Thursday they have granted preliminary
approval for a desalination plant in Huntington Beach that could
produce drinking water for nearly half a million Orange County
residents. Using superfine filters, the plant, proposed by Poseidon
Resources, would turn seawater into 50 million gallons of drinkable
water daily, making it the nation's largest desalination plant.</LD>
<LD>   "We're saying ... we think it will work and meet drinking water
standards," said Dave Spath, chief of the drinking water and
environmental management division at the state Department of Health
Services. "All they have to do now is build it and demonstrate it."</LD>
<LD>   The proposal still must be formally approved by several federal,
state and local agencies, but the one state agency's conceptual
agreement is "testimony to the purity of the drinking water we can
develop," said Andrew L. Shea, vice president of Poseidon Resources.</LD>
<TE>   Desalination, widely used in the Mideast, is increasingly viewed
as a reliable source of drinking water in communities across the
United States. In California, the need is particularly acute as the
drought-prone state is forced to reduce its reliance on the Colorado
River.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the proposed plant in Huntington Beach, facilities in Dana
Point, Playa del Rey, Long Beach, Redondo Beach, El Segundo, Carlsbad
and Chula Vista are being considered. Poseidon is also helping build
a massive plant in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The state health department has been studying the Huntington Beach
proposal for two years. Spath said the approval means that the
reverse-osmosis filters and other treatment processes could
effectively remove contaminants and bacteria found in the ocean
water.</TE>
<TE>   The $240-million plant would be built next to the AES power plant
and would use the plant's intake and outtake pipelines to collect
seawater and dispose of leftover salty brine.</TE>
<TE>   The plant, which could be operating by 2006, still needs final
approvals from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
California Coastal Commission, the state Department of Health
Services, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board and the
city of Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental documents were released Thursday so the city's
Planning Commission can hear the matter in less than two months.</TE>

<LD>A La Verne city councilman whose car struck and critically injured a
man pushing an empty wheelchair across the street is not expected to
be charged, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The accident took place about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in front of
Bonita High School. Sharan Singh, 62, was airlifted unconscious to
County-USC Medical Center, where he was said Thursday to be in
critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   La Verne police turned the matter over to the Highway Patrol
because the driver, Patrick J. Gatti, is a city official.</LD>
<TE>   Highway Patrol spokesman John Escobedo said that Singh was not in
a crosswalk and that Gatti was going about 30 mph in a 35-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not appear that the driver was in violation of any laws,"
Escobedo said. Gatti had made a complete statement, and there was "no
hint he was intoxicated or driving under the influence of drugs,"
Escobedo said. The councilman was not taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Gatti, 59, is a businessman in La Verne and has served on the City
Council since 1982, according to a city clerk.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents throughout the Southland were startled Thursday night by a
spectacular light show caused by the launching of an unarmed
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air
Force Base.</LD>
<LD>   The missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m., and the colorful contrail
was seen over almost all of the state.</LD>
<LD>   The missile was launched from an underground silo. Its two
re-entry vehicles were expected to travel about 4,200 miles in 30
minutes, hitting predetermined targets at the Kwajalein Missile Range
in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the flashy display 150 miles to the north startled
the crowd at a Dodgers home game and brought calls to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a handful of calls about the panorama of colors over
Western skies," said a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman, Brian
Humphrey. "They were mostly from motorists who'd never seen what has
become a beautiful Southern California tradition."</TE>
<TE>   The launching was part of a program to test missile launching
systems and make missiles more accurate and reliable.</TE>

<HD>Woman Hit by Van in Crosswalk Dies</HD>
<DH>Accident: Second victim is in critical condition after
miscarrying. Authorities consider charges against driver.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of two women struck by a minivan while walking in a San Fernando
crosswalk died and the other was in critical condition after a
miscarriage, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the driver, whose name was not released, was not
arrested but that authorities are considering whether to seek charges
against her in the deaths Wednesday of Teresa Aguilera, 33, and the
other woman's fetus.</LD>
<LD>   Aguilera and Leticia Villagomez, 35, were crossing busy Maclay
Avenue at Lucas Street about 7:30 p.m. when they were hit by a Dodge
minivan and thrown several feet, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The women, who authorities believe were related, and other
relatives had arrived in San Fernando from Fresno a month ago,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   The fatal collision occurred about two blocks from the family's
home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real tragedy," Police Chief Anthony Alba said. "We
caution people that are crossing the road not to assume that because
they're in a crosswalk, that's going to provide them protection."</TE>
<TE>   A witness told officers the minivan was traveling 35 to 40 mph in
the 35-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not consider that to be speeding," Det. Adrian Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the driver "didn't see them in time," Flores said,
adding that she "hasn't given any specific statement" about whether
she was distracted by something.</TE>
<TE>   Officers detected no signs of alcohol or drug use and did not
administer a field sobriety test, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not ruled out seeking manslaughter charges in
the deaths of both Aguilera and Villagomez's 6-month-term fetus, Alba
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a possibility," he said. "We haven't yet determined whether
there was any criminal act."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Wilson, assistant manager of Cassell's Music, which faces
the accident site, said the crosswalk is difficult for motorists to
see "until you're right on top of it."</TE>
<TE>   "I've personally stood between these two lines and nobody would
stop," he said, adding that he would like to see flashing lights or
large warning signs installed. "Even if they've got to make it look
like Vegas, I don't care. They have to make it obvious that there's a
crosswalk here."</TE>
<TE>   City officials could not be reached for comment on the safety
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Alba said he has been with the city only since May and does not
know whether it's a problem corner, but he noted that state law
requires motorists to stop for pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "Engineering for traffic safety can never ensure that accidents
won't happen," he said.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Gets 24 Years for Molesting O.C. Boys</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former instructor argued that the youths were
framing him, but a judge doesn't buy it and gives him the maximum
term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former elementary school teacher who molested boys in two Orange
County school districts was sentenced Thursday to 24 years in prison
after the victims' parents spoke of how the crime devastated their
children and violated their trust.</LD>
<LD>   The parents said they thought Jason Abhyankar, 28, was helping
their three boys--only to learn he was abusing them. The betrayal was
all the worse, they claim, because he was able to commit crimes even
though administrators had suspicions about him.</LD>
<LD>   "I adored Jason," said the mother of one of the victims. "I
thought he had everything going for him. Unfortunately, he had this
desire to manipulate families to get access to their young boys."</LD>
<TE>   Other parents spoke of how their children were traumatized. Some
no longer trust male teachers and sometimes refuse to go to school.
Others have withdrawn from friends and no longer enjoy group
activities and school sports.</TE>
<TE>   "The children have [lost] their youth and innocence," said the
father of one victim. "This has been hell."</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the testimony, Superior Court Judge Carla Singer
sentenced Abhyankar to the maximum 24 years in prison. His lawyer
sought a three-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Abhyankar insisted he didn't molest the boys, and his family has
argued that the boys were framing him because he assigned too much
homework. But Singer didn't buy that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "You may have convinced your loving parents and your brother that
this was a case of vendetta ... but you haven't convinced anyone
else," Singer said.</TE>
<TE>   Abhyankar reacted angrily to the sentence. "Boy, what a day," he
said as he was taken into custody. "What a life."</TE>
<TE>   At the same moment, family members of the victims and their
friends let out sighs of relief and gave each other high-fives.</TE>
<TE>   "He left a path of destruction that we have to clean up. He has
caused so much pain," said one parent. "He's caused them a lifetime
of sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The parents filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the
Huntington Beach school system. They contend that officials wrote a
letter of recommendation for the teacher even though they suspected
him of acting inappropriately around his students. Abhyankar
subsequently was hired to teach at Portola Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the boys were molested at Village View Elementary in
Huntington Beach, the other one at Portola Hills Elementary School in
Portola Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Pelman, a board member at Ocean View School District in
Huntington Beach, declined to comment on the sentencing or the
lawsuit. "We are allowing the process to go through," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Abhyankar was found guilty of nine felony child molestation counts
on three boys between September 1998 and January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation began when a 9-year-old student from Portola
Elementary School woke up crying and refused to go to school, telling
his mother he had been molested.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators interviewed parents, teachers and students, who were
shocked. Abhyankar was a popular figure in the community. Some
parents allowed him to take their children alone on trips. He
frequently dined with students and their parents, according to court
records.</TE>
<TE>   "We took him like one of our own," said the mother of one victim.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also talked to those who knew him at his previous
school, Village View Elementary. They concluded that Abhyankar
molested two boys, 10 and 11. He locked his classroom and molested
the boys while the class was at lunch, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   One boy told him to stop but he refused, allegedly saying: "You
better not tell anybody because you could get in really bad trouble
and this thing could get on the news," according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney John Barnett said the sentence was too harsh,
considering he didn't have a criminal history. "Twenty-four years is
for the worst person, who has not done anything in society," Barnett
told the judge. "That's not him."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said he will appeal the decision. About 30 letters were
submitted from parents, teachers, students and his family seeking
leniency. The letters described Abhyankar as a "dynamic and
energetic" person and a "committed, skilled educator" who had an
"excellent rapport with students."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Berger, one of the jurors who convicted Abhyankar, said she
returned to court Thursday to see justice served.</TE>
<TE>   "We believed he deserved the maximum sentence," said Berger, 37, a
paralegal from Costa Mesa. "The families took him in as a friend and
a son and he violated their trust."</TE>

<HD>Slaying Results in Life Term</HD>
<DH>Court: Van Nuys gang member is sentenced in the April 2000
death of one teenager and wounding of another in Newbury Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Van Nuys gang member was given a life prison sentence Thursday for
gunning down two men, one fatally, during a shooting outside a
Newbury Park condominium complex two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Jesus Miranda, 24, sat stoically as Ventura County Superior Court
Judge Herbert Curtis III calculated the prison term for murder,
attempted murder and various gang and weapon enhancements.</LD>
<LD>   All totaled, Miranda must serve 94 years in state prison before he
is eligible for parole.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Donna Flory urged the judge to strike two
10-year gang enhancements, which would have reduced the sentence to
74 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Flory called the prosecution demand for the additional time
absurd, arguing that Miranda would never outlive his sentence. But
Curtis disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as absurd results, I don't see it that way," the judge
said. "This was a very vicious type of killing and it was
unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred at the Conejo Creek condominium complex on
the evening of April 28, 2000, as neighbors and their children stood
along the street talking and playing.</TE>
<TE>   About 8:30 p.m., two carloads of gang members pulled up near Edgar
Cruz, 19, and Andres Morales, 18, in the 600 block of Avenida Del
Platino.</TE>
<TE>   One man jumped from a car and fatally shot Cruz as he stood in the
street. The gunman then pointed his weapon toward Morales, who was
shot in the abdomen as he turned to run.</TE>
<TE>   The two cars sped away but were stopped by authorities. Seven men
were arrested, including Miranda, who was later indicted on suspicion
of murder, attempted murder and an allegation that he was an active
participant in a criminal street gang at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda was also charged with shooting at an occupied dwelling,
assault with a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm.</TE>
<TE>   At trial earlier this year, Flory argued that Miranda had been
misidentified as the shooter. But jurors found Miranda guilty on all
charges.</TE>
<TE>   During a sentencing hearing last week, in which a final judgment
was postponed because of a dispute over the calculation of prison
time, Cruz's father described the loss of his son as "like taking
away part of the body."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been completely destroyed," Jesus Caballero said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John West argued that Miranda shot Cruz and
Morales to look tough in front of fellow gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus Miranda fired a gun point-blank into the chest of an
unarmed man," West said. "In fact, he is a coward."</TE>
<TE>   The slaying alarmed some Newbury Park residents, who feared the
shootings would spark a cross-county gang war at the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Cruz was slain, shots were fired at a nearby
restaurant where friends of the shooting victims, who were not gang
members, had gathered before a memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured.</TE>
<TE>   West argued last week that the slaying has left other victims,
including children who saw the crime and residents whose apartments
were fired upon.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who live on that street, your honor, have lived in
fear," West said.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's hearing, West said Miranda's sentence should send
a message that gang crimes will receive the harshest penalties
allowed under state law.</TE>
<TE>   Flory, however, said the sentencing formula created by Proposition
21 will result only in "warehousing" a young man who stood a chance
at turning his life around.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda, born in war-torn El Salvador, came to the United States
at age 15 after his father was killed and his mother fled, seeking
political asylum in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "He was abandoned by his family and society," Flory said.</TE>
<TE>   "No wonder he is where he is."</TE>

<HD>A Father and a Neighborhood Grieve for 4</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Warnings came too late for a mother and her three
children killed in a crosswalk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI and DANIEL HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems everyone there saw Evelia Sanchez and her three children
step into the crosswalk at East 70th Street and Compton Avenue,
except for the driver speeding toward them at 45 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Watching from his frontyard with his own young daughter, Eduardo
Barraza yelled a warning. Cars idling at the intersection honked
frantically.</LD>
<LD>   "She turned around, but it was already too late," Barraza said. "I
blinked and they weren't there anymore."</LD>
<TE>   The 31-year-old Sanchez and her children--Andrea, 5, Carlos
Antonio, 3, and Rafael Alejandro, 2--were tossed 60 feet, their
bodies left broken and bleeding on the pavement as the van's driver,
alleged to be Martin Valadez, who police say was drunk, accelerated
to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the children died at the scene. Sanchez and Andrea died
later at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   As news of the tragedy spread through the South Los Angeles
neighborhood, neighbors wept and gripped their children's hands a
little tighter as they crossed busy streets.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, scores of people visited the accident scene,
where they lighted candles and filled a donation box with crumpled
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Police credited quick-thinking residents who gave chase and helped
corner the driver a few blocks away after he crashed his van into a
tree.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a concerted effort by citizens around here," said Officer
John Tye, a CHP spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred as the family crossed the intersection about
7 p.m. Wednesday after leaving a nearby health clinic. Sanchez
carried Rafael Alejandro and Andrea and Carlos Antonio held hands as
they stepped off the curb.</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, cars heading south stopped, but the Dodge
van barreling north did not. The vehicle struck the woman and the
three children without braking, police said. The speed limit there is
30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Barraza and others stopped traffic and tried to help Sanchez and
the children. Others chased the van after watching it turn onto 66th
Street and smash into a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Valadez, 30, fled but returned to retrieve
registration information from the vehicle. Witnesses then followed
him to a nearby telephone booth, where he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Girlfriend Had Reported Van Stolen</TE>
<TE>   Valadez's girlfriend, Rosa Navarette, had called police to report
the van stolen, leading to early confusion about whether she might
have falsified the report to protect Valadez. But he in fact had
taken the vehicle after a dispute with Navarette a few blocks away,
said a CHP spokesman, Joseph Pace.</TE>
<TE>   Valadez faces felony murder charges and is being held without
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving home to an empty house after work, Jose Antonio Sanchez
said he immediately sensed something was wrong. Normally, his
children would jump into his arms and shower him with kisses.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard the commotion about a family killed on Compton
Avenue, he said he somehow knew people were speaking of his wife and
children.</TE>
<TE>   He hurried to the scene, but witnesses said they prevented Sanchez
from approaching the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "They just left me, just like that," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   Evelia was remembered as a quiet woman who doted on her children
and rarely left them out of her sight. Andrea had just started
kindergarten at Miramontes Elementary School. She was the watchful
big sister to her rambunctious brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Sanchez's small, stucco home, Jose Antonio Sanchez
greeted a stream of well-wishers with quiet thank-yous. People
offered small gifts and condolences.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, something like this had to happen to bring us
together," said Betty Garcia, a neighbor, who stood on the Sanchezes'
porch holding a homemade sign with a message asking for donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I met neighbors that I didn't know before," Garcia said.
"People even came from other parts of town to help." For Garcia and
others, the accident also called attention to what they say are the
long-standing dangers for pedestrians along Compton Boulevard's four
lanes between 77th Street and Slauson Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1993 and 2001, seven pedestrians, including a 6-year-old,
have been killed on that stretch. Some residents had recently signed
a petition asking for a traffic signal at the East 70th Street
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities said a pedestrian education program and more
crosswalks had cut the number of fatal accidents in recent years.
Nothing, they said, could have stopped a drunk driver.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only do so much ... when somebody who doesn't have any
regard for his life or anyone else's decides to drive while
intoxicated," the CHP's Tye said.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Gets Probation in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Las Vegas judge keeps the San Bernardino woman, who
got involved with a student, out of prison. More charges are ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Tanya Joan Hadden, the San Bernardino teacher whose relationship with
a 15-year-old student began with innocent car rides and after-school
French fries but strayed into romance, was given a suspended sentence
Thursday and will avoid prison for now.</LD>
<LD>   As Hadden sobbed and struggled to dab away her tears, with her
rail-thin wrists chained to her waist, Clark County District Court
Judge Joseph Bonaventure handed down a 13-year prison term--then
suspended that sentence and put Hadden on probation for five years.</LD>
<LD>   Technically, Hadden, 33, will spend the first six months of her
probation in the Clark County Detention Center. But because she has
been in jail for 140 days--ever since she and her student took off on
an ill-fated road trip that landed them at a $39-a-night Vegas strip
hotel--she probably will be released in coming days, once she is
credited for good behavior behind bars, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Relatives of Richard Pena, who earned an A in Hadden's science
class before the two purportedly fell in love and began a sexual
relationship last spring, stormed out of the courtroom after
realizing that Hadden's sentence would be suspended in favor of
probation. They slammed the courtroom door behind them and left,
armed only with the satisfaction of having described in detail their
hatred of Richard's former teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Ida Pena, Richard's mother, recalled how Hadden had taken the time
during the trip to Vegas to call her brother, asking him to swing by
her house to feed her dogs. But, though they were missing for four
days, she never called Richard's relatives to tell them he was safe.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the open house at his school and I shook your hand,"
Ida Pena said. "I feel like you slapped me in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Hadden still faces charges in San Bernardino, where prosecutors
have pledged to proceed with a second criminal case in an effort to
put Hadden behind bars for years. What's more, Bonaventure listed
restrictions she will live under forever--from curfews to a
prohibition against teaching again and a requirement that she never
date a man who has male children.</TE>
<TE>   "This conviction is going to follow you around the rest of your
life, like a Scarlet Letter," Bonaventure said. "You were trusted,
Ms. Hadden, by our society. You marred the sanctity of that
relationship. And for this, you deserve to be punished. I hope you
never forget it."</TE>
<TE>   "I won't, sir," Hadden said.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden jumped at an opportunity to speak in her defense,
apologizing repeatedly to Pena's family; to Cajon High School, where
she was a popular teacher before she was fired this spring; and to
her former students, who, she said, "deserved better." She also
directly rebutted prosecutors' arguments that she had never taken
responsibility for the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Please make sure he knows that he is not to blame," she told
Pena's mother and older sister. "Every step of the way it was my
decision. I have screwed up his life." Still, Hadden seemed to send a
collective shudder through the room when she responded to allegations
that she had been trying to get pregnant by saying, in part, that
Richard "doesn't want children yet."</TE>
<TE>   "You should care less what he wants!" Bonaventure yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden, who was in her second year as a teacher, first met Pena
last year in her science class. It began innocently enough, she said
in recent interviews--he bummed a few rides home, then they began
sitting together at a McDonald's, then they discovered a shared love
of punk rock music and deep conversation.</TE>
<TE>   In April, police began investigating reports that Hadden had
purchased alcohol for Pena and another student at a party. Pena,
fearing his strict and protective parents, panicked, called Hadden
and asked her to pick him up at a nearby college campus. She did, and
on April 29 they began driving and talking. At the Nevada state line,
she told him that they needed to think about what they were doing,
she has said, but he pleaded with her to continue.</TE>
<TE>   They wound up at the same hotel where Elvis Presley reportedly
played his first Vegas gig. Despite a law enforcement search
throughout the West, it took four days for authorities to find them.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden initially faced 19 criminal charges in Nevada. In August,
she pleaded guilty to three of them--having sex with a student,
statutory sexual seduction and second-degree kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday, Hadden had shed more than 20 pounds from an already
frail frame--partly because she is a vegan and has trouble finding
meals she can eat in jail. She looked out of place when court began
Thursday morning. Bailiffs led in a batch of accused thieves and
alleged batterers, many of them muscular gangbangers and meth junkies
with bald heads and violent tattoos. Hadden, led out in chains, a
blue jumpsuit and jail-issued orange shoes like the rest of the
group, craned her neck to search the pews for her mother, who mouthed
the words "I love you" to her.</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged that he was torn between two markedly
different views of the case.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Las Vegas prosecutors stunned Hadden and her
attorneys when they threatened to seek a life prison term. Even after
Hadden pleaded guilty to three felonies, prosecutors said they would
seek 25 years--more than a criminal who shoots someone often
receives, her defense attorney said. Prosecutors said they were
taking a hard line largely because she was a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge also received numerous letters in Hadden's
support--including one calling the prosecution an overzealous "witch
hunt." He seemed swayed by her supporters' arguments: that she is
chagrined and contrite, that she will never teach again. As she
pointed out in court, she will be, not only a convicted felon, but a
registered sex offender for the rest of her life. She is getting a
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists who have interviewed her since her arrest attribute
her decisions largely to loneliness, and say she is by no means a
common pedophile who is likely to prey on other children.</TE>
<TE>   Her defense attorneys said that prosecutors, by bringing the
kidnapping charge, were seeking to send her to prison for more years
than even elementary school teacher Mary Kay LeTourneau, the most
notorious similar case. LeTourneau was found guilty of having sex
with a sixth-grader, then got pregnant while on probation and said
the 13-year-old was the father--and received a seven-year prison
term, far less than prosecutors were seeking in the Hadden case.</TE>
<TE>   "When was the last 'kidnapping' when the kidnapper was telling the
kidnappee to go home?" asked Hadden's attorney, Deputy Public
Defender Jordan Savage. "When was the last 'kidnapping' when the
kidnapper was telling her kidnappee to call his parents?</TE>
<TE>   "Justice is about proportionality," he said. "It is about the
sentence fitting the crime."</TE>
<TE>   Several legal analysts said that Hadden had become an emblem of a
national effort to correct a long-standing gender split involving
adults with sexual relationships with children--the divide that makes
"Lolita" so unsettling, while Mrs. Robinson's seduction of a young
man in "The Graduate" is seen as a frivolous amusement.</TE>
<TE>   Women, by some estimates, represent just 1% of sex offenders, and
male sex offenders tend to be far more violent than females. But new
research into the lasting effects that improper relationships have on
teenage boys, even the apparent epidemic of molestations in the
Catholic Church, have begun to shrink the gender gap in perceptions
of sexual impropriety, said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes
Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of our biology, the sexual involvement of juvenile girls
is always going to be considered more serious," he said. "We protect
female virginity and sexuality more. But I think people have come to
understand that this line is important to maintain in regard with
male juveniles as well. There is a new awareness of that. We have
gone through a kind of evolution in the last few years with regard to
issues of adult responsibility and maintaining appropriate boundaries
with young people."</TE>
<TE>   Ida Pena said Hadden could not possibly understand the effect the
relationship has had--and will have--on Richard.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the Las Vegas trip, Hadden told the boy that
she was considering suicide because her life had been destroyed, Pena
recalled Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell a 15-year-old boy that you are going to commit suicide?
What do you think that did to him?" Ida Pena asked Hadden from the
witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   "He feels responsible for you," she said. "You took what was a
happy-go-lucky boy who always had a smile on his face, and you
changed him. He is not the same boy."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Luzaich said she respected the judge's
decision to suspend the sentence--but said Hadden had duped him.</TE>
<TE>   "She paid lip service to the court," Luzaich said after the
judge's decision. "And it worked."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 10 FLORIDA (2-1)</LD>
<LD>   at No. 4 TENNESSEE (2-0)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: Channel 2.</LD>
<TE>   Line: Tennessee by 4.</TE>
<TE>   Florida update: With a 41-16 loss to No. 1 Miami behind them, the
Gators face an elimination game in the national title chase.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee update: The Volunteers have given up only 10
points--seven to Wyoming, three to Middle Tennessee--and neither
opponent scored until the fourth quarter. Receiver Kelley Washington
makes his season debut after missing the first two games because of a
sprained knee.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The Gators have won 12 of the last 16 against
Tennessee, and three of the last four at Knoxville. Can Ron Zook
continue the trend?</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Tennessee, although it's difficult to know much about
the Volunteers after victories over Wyoming and Middle Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 USC (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 25 KANSAS STATE (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4 p.m. TV: TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Kansas State by 3.</TE>
<TE>   USC update: Carson Palmer has completed 71.4% of his passes. The
Trojans--ranked No. 1 in the nation in total defense--held Colorado
to only 61 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State update: The Wildcats have won 37 consecutive
nonconference home games, many of them against suspect opposition.
Kansas State's 3-0 start is typical: The Wildcats have outscored
Western Kentucky, Louisiana Monroe and Eastern Illinois, 179-16.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Trojan fans have a habit of getting ahead of their
team, but maybe this group is something special.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: USC. Trojans have a decent shot at becoming the first
nonconference team to beat Kansas State at home since Northern
Illinois in 1989, when Kansas State went 1-10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 NOTRE DAME (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   at MICHIGAN STATE (2-1)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Michigan State by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame update: Tyrone Willingham takes his new team against
his alma mater--and Notre Dame's nemesis of recent years. Michigan
State has won the last five meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State update: Spartans are smarting from a 46-22 loss to
California--a 1-10 team last season. Willingham chooses to think the
Spartans were looking ahead. Charles Rogers can tie the NCAA record
of 12 consecutive games with a touchdown reception, joining Randy
Moss, Desmond Howard and Pacific's Aaron Turner as the only players
to accomplish the feat.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Just how real is this Notre Dame revival?</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Notre Dame. The burgeoning Irish confidence is an
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COLORADO (1-2)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 20 UCLA (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: UCLA by 11.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado update: Ugly keeps getting uglier for Colorado. The
Buffaloes' top-10 ranking is long gone after a season-opening loss to
Colorado State and last week's 40-3 home loss to USC. There's no
great hope for improvement with Robert Hodge forced to start at
quarterback again because of Craig Ochs' multiple concussions.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: The Bruins cleaned up some of their early-season
mistakes in a 38-24 victory over Oklahoma State last week, and Cory
Paus was markedly better at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Before the season began, the Buffaloes were in the top
10 and the Bruins were unranked. Can the turnarounds continue?</TE>
<TE>   The pick: UCLA. Hodge was one of nine for 20 yards against USC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BOSTON COLLEGE (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 1 MIAMI (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 4:45 p.m. TV: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Miami by 26.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College update: This isn't the most dangerous Eagle team
the Hurricanes have faced in a series known for Doug Flutie's Hail
Mary pass in a 47-45 Boston College victory in 1984. But Boston
College didn't look threatening last season until putting a scare
into Miami before losing, 18-7.</TE>
<TE>   Miami update: The defending national champions' winning streak has
reached 25 games and it doesn't look close to ending. The next
serious challenger is Florida State on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Just the names of the teams bring back memories of
Flutie and the close call for Miami last year. But remember, the
Hurricanes haven't lost to the Eagles since the 1984 game.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. Too fast, too strong, too good.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 VIRGINIA TECH (3-0)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 19 TEXAS A&amp;M (2-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 12:30 p.m. TV: ESPN GamePlan.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Virginia Tech by 2.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech update: Tailbacks Lee Suggs and Kevin Jones ran for
324 yards against Marshall in what was to be a big-splash game for
Thundering Herd quarterback Byron Leftwich.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M update: Coach R.C. Slocum is wavering on senior
quarterback Mark Farris after pulling him in the first two games.
Dustin Long and Reggie McNeal are getting long looks.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: It's a clash of strengths. The Aggies haven't given up
a 100-yard rusher in 14 games and have the nation's top-ranked run
defense.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Virginia Tech. Texas A&amp;M earned that rushing defense
statistic against Louisiana Lafayette and Pittsburgh. The Hokies will
expose it.</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Still Have Some Life Left in Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays did not play like the worst team in the
majors.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Sheets' game-winning RBI single with two out in the bottom of
the 10th inning led the Devil Rays to a 3-2 win over New York at St.
Petersburg, Fla., Thursday night, keeping the Yankees' magic number
for clinching the AL East at two.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays became the first team since the 1964 New York Mets
to take a series from a first-place team after eclipsing 100 losses.
Tampa Bay is 2-18-3 in its last 23 series.</LD>
<TE>   After losing two of three at Tampa Bay, the Yankees head to
Detroit to begin a three-game series tonight as they try to clinch
their fifth straight division title. Any combination of two New York
wins or Boston losses will clinch it.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played well," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "We
just didn't score."</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Huff hit a one-out single off Sterling Hitchcock (1-2) in
the 10th and went to third on Ben Grieve's double. After Toby Hall
was intentionally walk, Hitchcock fell behind 3-and-0 before striking
out Jared Sandberg. After falling behind 0-and-2, Sheets took two
pitches before singling to left.</TE>
<TE>   "I hung a split," Hitchcock said. "I've always been pretty good at
wiggling out of jams. It's frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   "I had faced him in a rehab start, and with two strikes he threw
that split," Sheets said. "So I was waiting for it."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay tied it at 2-2 when Randy Winn hit a solo homer off
Steve Karsay in the eighth-- New York's second blown eighth-inning
lead in the series. The Yankees had converted 12 straight saves since
closer Mariano Rivera went out with an injury before this series.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees fell one game behind Oakland for the race for best
record in the AL.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing for something," Tampa Bay Manager Hal McRae said.
"They really needed to win. We played with a heck of a club. We got
it done."</TE>
<TE>   Esteban Yan (7-8) worked a scoreless inning for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano went two for five, including an RBI single that
put the Yankees up 2-1 in the fifth. He had nine hits in 15 at-bats
during the series.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano remains one homer short of becoming the fourth player to
have 40 homers and 40 steals in the same season. Soriano hit his 39th
homer Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Canseco (1988), Barry Bonds (1996) and Alex Rodriguez (1998)
are members of the 40-40 club. Soriano would become the only one with
40 doubles during the same season.</TE>
<TE>   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams was out of the lineup for
the second straight game because of mild inflammation behind his left
knee. He flew out to the warning track as a pinch-hitter in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 9, Baltimore 3--Shannon Stewart had a career-high five
hits, and rookie Mark Hendrickson pitched eight innings of four-hit
ball at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bordick of the Orioles played his 101st consecutive errorless
game at shortstop, tying the major league record set by Rey Ordonez
in 1999-2000. Bordick also hit a two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota at Detroit--The game between the Twins and Tigers was
canceled due to rain with the Twins leading 9-0 in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   The game will not be made up. The Twins have clinched the AL
Central and the Tigers have been eliminated.</TE>

<HD>Two Fans Attack Coach During White Sox Game</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PHIL ROGERS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Add another ugly chapter to Chicago baseball history.</LD>
<LD>   Two spectators, father and son, charged onto the field to attack
Kansas City first base coach Tom Gamboa in the top of the ninth
inning Thursday night at Comiskey Park. They hit the 54-year-old
coach from behind and then landed a number of blows.</LD>
<LD>   Royal players, with shortstop Neifi Perez leading the charge,
mobbed the two until Comiskey Park security got control of the
situation.</LD>
<TE>   "No punishment could be stiff enough," White Sox first baseman
Paul Konerko said. "I wish they had left the players out there to
beat on them for an hour."</TE>
<TE>   The names of the attackers were not released, but according to
White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert, the father is to be charged with
two counts of felony assault, one on Gamboa and the other on an
off-duty police officer working with White Sox security. The son will
be charged as a juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   According to Royal Manager Tony Pena and many players, security
officials found a small pocket knife on the field after the brawl.
Some eyewitnesses thought one of the attackers may have been trying
to use it but there was no formal mention of the weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Gamboa, who said he felt "like a football team hit me from
behind," suffered a small cut above one eye and bruises. He left the
field for treatment as the Royals finished off a 2-1 victory over the
White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   White Sox General Manager Ken Williams was relieved Gamboa's
injuries were not worse. He visited with Gamboa and Pena immediately
after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's devastating, very devastating," Williams said. "When you
look in the man's eyes and try to apologize on behalf of the club and
the city, words don't adequately express the sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Violence has been a part of Chicago's baseball history, with the
most vivid examples being the brawl in the stands between the Dodgers
and Wrigley Field fans in 2000 and the fan who attacked Cub pitcher
Randy Myers during a game in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a reflection on the security or the White Sox," Kansas
City first baseman Mike Sweeney said. "It's just the result of two
complete losers."</TE>

<HD>Much Ado for A's Before Bidding Adieu to Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Oakland takes a one-game lead, wins season series
and clinches division-race tiebreaker with 5-3 victory in teams'
final meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels and Oakland Athletics bade farewell to each other
Thursday, at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   The A's won big, despite the modest 5-3 score, as Terrence Long
snapped a 3-3 tie by hitting the game-winning home run in the sixth
inning. The A's thus hopped one game ahead of the Angels in the
American League West. They also won the season series, 11-9, thus
winning the tiebreaker should the teams tie for the division title.</LD>
<LD>   Effectively, then, the A's lead the Angels by two games with nine
to play. The division champion earns home-field advantage in the
playoffs, whereas the AL West runner-up almost certainly will be the
wild-card entry, which will open the playoffs amid the ghosts in
Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Predictably, the A's were thrilled, while the Angels downplayed
the importance of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a playoff game," Oakland Manager Art Howe said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game is a big game at this point," the Angels' Scott
Spiezio said. "Yeah, this was a big game. So is tomorrow's. There are
still plenty of games left."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels need not be depressed. They had not lost consecutive
games since Aug. 22-23. Still, with two victories in Seattle this
weekend, they will clinch their first postseason berth in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels insist their eyes remain on the division title. If they
keep winning games, they say, they'll be fine.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be scoreboard watching," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "It's not going to do us any good to worry about what the A's
are doing. We haven't done that all year, and we're not going to
start doing it now."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides played with an urgency that reflected the importance of
the game. Oakland's Ray Durham startled Angel right fielder Tim
Salmon by tagging from first base on a fly ball. In the second inning
of a 1-0 game, with a runner at third base and one out, the A's
played their infielders in. The Angels batted for catcher Bengie
Molina in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   And Howe used closer Billy Koch for the fifth consecutive day, a
workload almost unheard of in the modern era. Koch, who set an
Oakland record by working in his 79th game of the season, pitched in
each of the four games of the series. He got the victory Monday, the
loss Tuesday and saves Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he sold his soul to the devil to be able to come back and
pitch every day like he does," Oakland starter Tim Hudson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson (15-9) held the Angels to six hits over 7 1/3 innings. He
has not lost since the Angels tagged him with consecutive defeats in
July.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Kevin Appier, with his delivery a bit out of whack
and with a breaking ball he said "wasn't being cooperative," needed
23 pitches to escape the first inning and 43 to escape the first two.
But, with two double plays from his defense and two sacrifice flies
from his offense, he endured into the sixth inning and departed with
the score tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   With one on and one out in the sixth, Brendan Donnelly relieved
Appier. Donnelly got the second out of the inning, then Long hit the
game-winning homer, very long indeed. Donnelly, who had not given up
a home run in his first 36 appearances, has given up two to the A's
in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and A's concluded their season series with nine one-run
games, seven in the final 11, leaving both sides anticipating a
possible rematch in the AL championship series.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a double-edged sword," Salmon said. "I'm almost tired of
playing them. Every game is tense and nerve-racking. But, if it came
down to that, it would be great."</TE>
<TE>   Said Oakland's Eric Chavez, "We've kind of set the standard
already. I don't think anybody would expect anything less. It would
be fun. It would be a great series."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Rodriguez Appears to Be on Fast Track</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>With all of two innings of major league experience, Francisco
Rodriguez is under consideration for the Angels' playoff roster.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez would offer the Angels a dimension none of their current
set-up men can provide. He can throw a 95-mph fastball, so the Angels
could consider using him when a strikeout is in order. He pitched one
inning Thursday, striking out the side, after striking out two in his
major league debut Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The two innings he's thrown are definitely an indication he's not
scared," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</LD>
<TE>   The probable playoff roster includes one vacancy in the bullpen,
with Troy Percival, Ben Weber, Scott Schoeneweis, Brendan Donnelly
and Scot Shields virtually assured of spots. The Angels are not sold
on adding the 20-year-old Rodriguez to that bullpen, but the other
candidates--Mickey Callaway, Dennis Cook, Al Levine and Aaron
Sele--recently have been injured, ineffective or both.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez dominated in the minor leagues this year, striking out
120 in 83 innings divided between double A and triple A. The Angels
hesitated to promote him because of concerns about his ability to
channel his excitability and respond to adversity, but those concerns
have evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in [Class] A ball last year," said triple-A pitching coach
Mike Butcher. "Mentally, he grew up. His mentality is not A ball
anymore, and his stuff never was."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels believe that first baseman Scott Spiezio and catcher
Bengie Molina deserve consideration for Gold Glove awards, along with
outfielder Garret Anderson for most valuable player and pitcher
Jarrod Washburn for the Cy Young award, but the team has not
organized any promotional campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Blue Jays have touted third baseman Eric Hinske for
rookie of the year in e-mails sent to writers voting on that award.
With a sellout crowd on hand for a nationally televised game here
Wednesday, the A's distributed placards to fans that promoted
shortstop Miguel Tejada for MVP and pitcher Barry Zito for the Cy
Young. Earlier this year, Pittsburgh Pirate Manager Lloyd McClendon
said he would send a video of second baseman Pokey Reese's fielding
highlights to league managers and coaches, who vote for the Gold
Glove awards.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in that," Scioscia said. "If you win something,
you should do it on your own merit. I don't think it should be a
lobbying issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Angels' 153rd game Thursday, Scioscia used his 100th
lineup. Even the most devoted fans probably could not name the only
lineup Scioscia has used on more than two consecutive days: David
Eckstein, ss; Darin Erstad, cf; Orlando Palmeiro, rf; Anderson, lf;
Troy Glaus, 3b; Spiezio, 1b; Brad Fullmer, dh; Molina, c; Adam
Kennedy, 2b.... Anderson doubled for his 85th extra-base hit of the
season, tying the club record set by Glaus two years ago.... The
Angels removed outfielder Elpidio Guzman and pitcher Elvin Nina from
the 40-man roster as they promoted Rodriguez, pitcher Lou Pote,
catcher Sal Fasano and infielder Alfredo Amezaga from triple-A Salt
Lake.</TE>

<HD>Bad Blood Thins for Vargas</HD>
<DH>Boxing: In first comments after loss, he gives De La Hoya
his due and says he wants a rematch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gone was the blood from under his right eye. Gone was the sneer from
his mouth. Gone was the shrillness from his voice.</LD>
<LD>   Five days after disappearing from the ring in Las Vegas' Mandalay
Bay Events Center after losing his 154-pound title fight against
Oscar De La Hoya on an 11th-round technical knockout, Fernando Vargas
reappeared in public Thursday at a news conference in a hotel near
LAX. Wearing a suit and tie and showing no evidence of the beating he
had taken from De La Hoya, Vargas grudgingly gave De La Hoya his due
but maintained he had the fight won until De La Hoya caught him with
a left hook at the end of the 10th round.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas said it was easier to accept this defeat than the one he
suffered at the hands of Felix Trinidad nearly two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "This is different," Vargas said. "I was mad at God then. I know
now God does things for a reason. I'm cool now. I go to church. I
have no problems with God. I'm at peace with myself and with God."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than continuing to spew his avowed hatred of De La Hoya, as
he had in the months leading up to the fight, Vargas gave his fellow
Southern Californian credit for his performance and appealed for a
rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was his night," Vargas said. "I would love a rematch."</TE>
<TE>   That won't happen in the near future. If Trinidad sticks to his
retirement announcement, De La Hoya is expected to grant a rematch to
Shane Mosley next May, nearly two years after Mosley beat him on a
split decision. Mosley, who has never fought above 147 pounds, hopes
to break in at 154 pounds in January or February against either World
Boxing Council interim 154-pound champion Javier Castillejo or World
Boxing Organization 154-pound titleholder Daniel Santos. Vargas' next
opponent probably will be International Boxing Federation 154-pound
champion Winky Wright, whom Vargas beat on a majority decision in
1999. Vargas is expected to return to the ring in March.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday, he was still looking back at Saturday night.
Although two of the three judges and the majority of boxing writers
had De La Hoya ahead by two points, 96-94, heading into the 11th
round, Vargas was adamant about his own mental scorecard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I was doing everything right and winning the fight,"
Vargas said. "I was catching him with more effective, harder shots. I
felt good and strong. He just caught me with a good shot. That's
boxing. You've got to be ready for anything."</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Garcia, Vargas' trainer, said through a translator that he
was concerned after De La Hoya started scoring in the eighth round
with his right hand, the hand he had seldom used effectively in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we had a problem," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia knew he had a crisis when Vargas plopped down on his stool
at the end of the 10th round, clearly hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to put cold water on him and give him strong words,"
Garcia said, "but we only had a limited amount of time. We didn't
have enough time to recover."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya knocked Vargas down with a left hook in the 11th round
and then finished him off with a flurry of 16 unanswered punches
before referee Joe Cortez stopped the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to information put out by Vargas' handlers late Saturday
night that he had a partial fracture of the orbital bone surrounding
his right eye, Vargas said Thursday he merely had a severe cut that
required two stitches.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas has been taking shots at De La Hoya for years over some
alleged snub by De La Hoya, an incident Vargas had promised to talk
about at length after the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to make good on his promise Thursday, Vargas said, "I would
love to talk about it ... before the rematch."</TE>
<TE>   Always leave them wanting more.</TE>

<LD>Nick Canepa in the San Diego Union-Tribune commenting on Charger
linebacker Junior Seau: "At 33 ... he remains the hunter. The
attacker. Animated. Relentless. Vigilant. Smarter. More in control of
his risks, but still fiercely independent. Still the leader of the
band, acting as if every battle could be his last....</LD>
<LD>   "If there is no letup in Seau on the field, there is no letup in
him off it.... He practices like a demon. Arrives early and stays
late. And why is that? Fear.</LD>
<LD>   " 'I'm afraid of being average,' he says. 'I have to win at
practice. I have to win in the weight room and I have to win in the

"As he tried to warm up for the rest of his life, there was too much

obligations blown off, too many regrets over opportunities missed to
make the city he claimed to love want to love him back unrequitedly."</TE>

time for the football 40-yard dash, Hayes said it was 4.3 seconds.
Football players at many universities are credited with 40 times of

UCLA will play their football game here a week from Saturday at 11

<LD>Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organizations released
the contents of a letter Thursday to CBS Sports in which she asked
the network to drop coverage of the Masters until Augusta National
Golf Club admits women members.</LD>
<LD>   In the letter, addressed to CBS Sports President Sean McManus,
Burk said that because the Masters is held at a club "flaunting ...
sex discrimination" she found it "astonishing that CBS would even
consider such a broadcast."</LD>
<LD>   CBS has televised the Masters on one-year contracts since 1958.</LD>
<TE>   McManus responded immediately to Burk and released the contents of
his own letter Thursday. McManus thanked Burk for corresponding, but
said the network has no intention of dropping the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "CBS will cover the Masters," McManus said in his letter. "To not
do so would be a disservice to the fans of this major championship."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Make Their Stand</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Perez goes all the way and L.A. scores all its
runs in third inning in 6-3 victory that trims Giants' wild-card
margin to one game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a grueling 14 hours and 4 minutes of baseball, 43 runs, 77
hits, 29 pitching changes, 1,265 pitches and a number of
hand-wringing managerial decisions over a four-game span, the Dodgers
and San Francisco Giants are right back where they started.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez threw a complete game and the
Dodgers, in their second must-win situation against the Giants in
nine days, throttled Livan Hernandez for six runs in the third inning
en route to a 6-3 victory before 43,921 in Dodger Stadium on Thursday
night, earning a split of a critical four-game series.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers trailed San Francisco by one game in the National
League wild-card race when the Giants arrived Monday. That deficit
remained at one as the Giants boarded a plane for Milwaukee late
Thursday night and the Dodgers packed their bags for San Diego, but
now there are only nine games left in the regular season.</LD>
<TE>   "To have a game like this, where you go from a potential
three-game deficit to one game is huge," said Dodger second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek, who opened the decisive third inning with a
double. "This was huge. This was a game we needed, no ifs, ands or
buts about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were in a similar predicament Sept. 11 in San
Francisco, when, after losing the first two games of a three-game
series, they fell a game behind the Giants in the wild-card race and
were in danger of falling two games back.</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo came up huge that day, gutting out a 6 2/3-inning,
two-run, six-hit, 132-pitch effort to lead the Dodgers to a 7-3
victory. Thursday night, it was Perez who might have saved the Dodger
season, giving up three runs on seven hits, striking out seven and
walking two.</TE>
<TE>   Perez limited the heart of the Giant order--Jeff Kent, Barry Bonds
and Benito Santiago--to two singles in 10 at-bats. Tsuyoshi Shinjo's
RBI groundout made it 6-1 in the fifth, and Reggie Sanders' two-run
home run in the ninth made it 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Perez gave an overworked bullpen a much-needed night off, though
closer Eric Gagne was warming up in the eighth and ninth, but Perez's
119-pitch effort may prevent the Dodgers from bringing him back on
three days' rest next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers open a three-game series against the Padres tonight
and then return home for two games against Colorado and four against
San Diego. The Giants open a three-game series against the lowly
Brewers tonight and then return to San Francisco for two games
against San Diego and three against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   If it has a bearing on the standings, the Giants would have to
travel to Atlanta for a makeup game on Monday, Sept. 30, the day
after the regular season ends. If, after that game, the Giants and
Dodgers have the same record, they would meet in a one-game playoff
on Oct. 1 in San Francisco to determine the wild-card winner</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between a one-game deficit and a
three-game deficit," Manager Jim Tracy said. "With nine games to go,
it doesn't get much better than that. A three-game deficit would have
made it very difficult. Not impossible, but it would have been a big
hill to climb up."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Dodgers put the Giants in a huge hole in the third.
Grudzielanek opened with a flare to shallow right, where Sanders,
after a long run, came within inches of a diving catch. The ball
popped out of Sanders' glove as he hit the ground, and Grudzielanek
had a double.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora lined a single to left, but Grudzielanek could only take
third. Perez bunted toward first, but Hernandez dropped the ball on
the glove-to-hand exchange, Perez was safe, and the Dodgers had the
bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts grounded a sharp single to right field, scoring two
runs, the leadoff batter's first runs batted in since Aug. 17. Paul
Lo Duca' bunt was turned into a force at third, but Shawn Green
walked on four pitches, loading the bases for Brian Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan didn't match Monday's grand slam, but he grounded a double
past David Bell at third base and into the left-field corner, scoring
three runs for a 5-0 lead. Eric Karros' RBI double made it 6-0 and
knocked out Hernandez.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ashby Feeling Frustrated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The numbers would seem to indicate Andy Ashby's return from last
year's elbow surgery has gone fairly well.</LD>
<LD>   His record (9-12) entering tonight's critical start in San Diego
could be better, but his earned-run average (3.71) is respectable, he
has thrown 179 2/3 innings and has missed only one start, because of
a blister on his middle finger.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers don't tell the whole story, though.</LD>
<TE>   "You miss a year and you come back and feel good, but the results
aren't there," Ashby said. "It makes you think. It makes you wonder,
'Will it ever feel completely right again?' It seems like it's
something new every time out, whether it's the arm angle, timing or
whatever it may be ... it's just not happening.</TE>
<TE>   "You go out there and walk six or seven guys a game ... that's
just not me. I'm not saying I've got great control, but I don't
remember the last time I walked six guys in a game. This year it's
happened twice."</TE>
<TE>   The frustration of Ashby's last three starts, in which he gave up
15 runs and 19 hits, including four home runs, in 12 1/3 innings and
lost three games, has obscured the six-game stretch that preceded it,
when the right-hander went 2-1 with a 1.76 ERA. The 14 walks in his
last four starts also weighs on Ashby's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so many things you see and say, 'Man, that's it right
there,' and then you can't repeat it because there's something that
won't let you do it, and I don't know what it is. It's frustrating as
an athlete when you know what feels right and you just can't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby will get at least one more chance to snap out of his funk
tonight, but if he doesn't, Manager Jim Tracy might have no choice
but to look for other pitching options in the final week of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Among those are Hideo Nomo on three days' rest, which would bump
Ashby from Wednesday's scheduled start against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are counting on me, and I'm going to do everything I
can to get it turned around," Ashby said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers don't feel Ashby can contribute to a playoff
rotation, "then I'm going to do what's best for the team," he said.
"But I'll never ask out of there. That's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Misery has some company. Left-hander Omar Daal has been rocked for
14 earned runs and 21 hits in 10 innings of his last three starts,
all losses, but Tracy has little choice but to bring Daal back Sunday
against the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Daal gave up five runs in 1 2/3 innings of Tuesday night's 6-4
loss to the Giants, an abbreviated start that put a heavy burden on
an already overworked Dodger bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "What other choice do I have?" Tracy said. "There's not a
multitude of options. You have to weigh the advantages of a veteran
in a pennant race against a kid.... I would like to see Omar rebound,
because his success has been a big part of this club."</TE>
<TE>   Like Ashby, Daal's slump was preceded by a hot streak--he went 4-0
with a 1.87 ERA during an eight-start stretch from July 20-Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally, I'm fine," Daal said, "and I feel good physically. I
think I've just been trying to be too perfect with my pitches, trying
to hit too many corners. I'm going to be aggressive, throw strikes,
and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros' third-inning RBI double Thursday night was his 580th
extra-base hit, moving him ahead of Steve Garvey into second place on
the Los Angeles Dodgers' list behind Willie Davis, who had 585
extra-base hits.</TE>

four games to the Rockies last weekend. "We were looking past them,
we expected to win, and came out flat," second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "We have to have a different attitude going into
this series." Tomko, the Padres right-hander, is 2-0 with a 3.00 ERA

<HD>Woods Takes Lead, Downplays Ryder Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one can accuse Tiger Woods of looking ahead to next week's Ryder
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Woods birdied the last two holes Thursday for a seven-under 65 to
take a one-stroke lead over David Toms and Steve Lowery in the
American Express Championship at Thomastown, Ireland, a tournament he
said means more to him than winning that little exhibition next week
at The Belfry.</LD>
<LD>   Asked which was more important, Woods chose an individual title
and the $1-million check over a team victory and a 14-inch gold
chalice.</LD>
<TE>   "Why? I can think of a million reasons," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has never had much success in the Ryder Cup, going 3-6-1.
Earlier this week, he complained that the team concept doesn't allow
him to prepare for the matches the way he would any other big
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   And he made it clear after his bogey-free 65 at Mount Juliet that
his focus is squarely on winning his sixth tournament of the year,
and a World Golf Championship event for the fourth consecutive
season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big event. These are the best players in the world," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're playing stroke play on a great golf course. That's pretty
important. I'm not saying the Ryder is not important. It's a
completely different animal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can play absolutely lousy and the team can win, or you can
play absolutely great and win all five matches, and lose the Ryder
Cup."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Solheim Cup captains Patty Sheehan (U.S.) and Dale Reid (Europe)
announced the pairings for today's opening four alternate-shot
matches at Edina, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   In the first match, Juli Inkster and Laura Diaz--the top two
Americans on the LPGA Tour this season--figure to be favorites
against Laura Davies and Paula Marti. In the second match, Beth
Daniel and Wendy Ward play Iben Tinning and Raquel Carriedo.</TE>
<TE>   In match No. 3, Kelly Robbins and Pat Hurst, go against Helen
Alfredsson and Suzann Pettersen. Finally, Meg Mallon and Kelli Kuehne
take on Carin Koch and Annika Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   K.J. Choi shot a course-record eight-under 63 in the Tampa Bay
Classic at Palm Harbor, Fla., while 18-year-old Ty Tryon had a 73 in
his first PGA Tour start since March.</TE>
<TE>   Choi had a two-stroke lead over Australia's Rod Pampling when the
opening round was suspended because of lightning with 17 players left
on the course.</TE>

<LD>Water polo players hoping to avoid the damaging effects of the sun
will have to be more selective in their sun screen choices if they
hope to remain in the game.</LD>
<LD>   A Santa Margarita player was disqualified last week for having
visible sun screen on his face, which, because of its slippery
nature, can not only give a player an advantage but is also a
violation of the sport's foreign substances rule.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Yancey, the head water polo official for Orange County and
the boys' water polo coach at Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley High,
said officials are required to give players one warning before they
are ejected for use of a foreign substance.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Margarita Coach Kevin Ricks said officials who refereed his
team's game against Anaheim Canyon told the Eagles' captains to warn
the player about the sun screen, but they failed to do so and the
player was disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tell my players not to use oil-based sun screen," Yancey
said.</TE>

<TE>   Weatherspoon, a senior receiver and defensive back for Lynwood,
was declared ineligible last Friday, when members of the San Gabriel
Valley League voted, 5-1, to find Lynwood guilty of undue influence
in Weatherspoon's transfer from Paramount last spring. Lynwood cast
the dissenting vote.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood lost its season opener to Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula,
16-7.</TE>

family has filed an appeal, which will be heard before the section's

during competition in Southern Section play, but section rules
currently prohibit it.</TE>
<TE>   In today's tournament, coaches may instruct players from the time
they hole out until they tee off on the next hole.</TE>

<HD>Kansas State Corner Plays All the Angles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terence Newman has waited a year for this, a chance to make Kareem
Kelly choke on his words.</LD>
<LD>   Mind you, Newman doesn't have anything malicious planned for USC's
senior receiver. The Kansas State cornerback just wants to show that
Kelly's assessment of him last season was perhaps a bit
disrespectful.</LD>
<LD>   After Kansas State had held on for a 10-6 victory over USC at the
Coliseum, Kelly was asked about his one-on-one battles with Newman,
who'd led the Wildcats with six tackles and three pass breakups.</LD>
<TE>   "He was good. He wasn't great," said Kelly, who had seven catches
for 75 yards. "I had read a lot of stuff about him. I made plays on
him. I go against Pac-10 corners that are better than that."</TE>
<TE>   A Kansas State coach saw the quote, highlighted it and left the
article on Newman's chair in the Wildcat locker room. It quickly
became Newman's favorite piece of bulletin-board motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I did a pretty good job on [Kelly], so what he said
kind of hurt me," Newman said. "It made me look forward to this game
all summer. I really marked this one on my calendar."</TE>
<TE>   So, with Kelly's words ringing in his ears, Newman will set out to
run rings around 11th-ranked USC when the Trojans play No. 25 Kansas
State on Saturday at Manhattan, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that Newman ranks among the nation's most athletic and
versatile players, that's not an enviable position for USC.</TE>
<TE>   Through three games, Newman has scored three touchdowns, one each
on a kickoff return, a punt return and a reception; has intercepted
two passes, and has twice been named Big 12 Conference player of the
week--once for defense, once for special teams.</TE>
<TE>   A candidate for the Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top
defensive back, Newman personifies perhaps better than any other
player the jack-of-all-trades ability of the award's namesake, Jim
Thorpe. Also a track star, Newman is the defending Big 12 champion in
the 100 meters with a school-record time of 10.2 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an incredible athlete," USC Coach Pete Carroll said. "He's
fast. He's aggressive. He's confident. He's a good technique guy.
He's caught touchdown passes playing wide receiver, runs kicks back
for touchdowns and he's one of their best players on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do what we have to do. We have a plan for him."</TE>
<TE>   Newman's plan is to keep Kelly from making any big catches.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I'll do a better job on him than last year," he said.
"He was one of the best receivers I played against, but I want to
hold him to [fewer catches] than he had last year."</TE>
<TE>   Newman's talents aren't limited to pass coverage. He can take over
a game in any number of ways with his explosive speed.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder dubbed him "Two-Play Terence" after
Newman scored two touchdowns in a span of one minute 26 seconds in
the Wildcats' 68-0 victory over Louisiana-Monroe on Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   On his first and only play of the season at receiver, Newman
sprinted past single coverage and caught a scoring pass from Marc
Dunn that covered 51 yards. After Kansas State stopped Monroe at its
two-yard line, Newman returned a punt 40 yards for another touchdown
and a 28-0 first-quarter lead.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder says what makes Newman an elite player is that he doesn't
rely solely on his speed to make plays.</TE>
<TE>   "He has demonstrated that he can do the things that good football
players do, with or without world-class speed," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, being fast never hurts. He is averaging 43.7 yards on
three kickoff returns, among them a 95-yard touchdown dash last week
in a 63-13 victory over Eastern Illinois, and is averaging 20.3 yards
on six punt returns. He ranks second on the team in all-purpose yards
with 311.</TE>
<TE>   Defensively, the 5-foot-11, 185-pound senior says he has never
been better.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I've improved a lot," Newman said. "Last year, it took me
three games to get my first interception. This year, I had one in
each of the first two games. That's helped me relax a little bit and
play my game."</TE>
<TE>   That could translate into a frustrating game for Kelly, or any
other USC receiver who lines up against Newman. Given a year to mull
things over, Kelly has upgraded his appraisal of the Kansas State
standout.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great corner," Kelly said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Informed that Newman had taken exception to his comments about him
last year, Kelly said, "I wasn't taking anything away from him. If
that's what it's going to take for him to get up come Saturday, then
so be it. But I know it's going to be a challenge out there for us."</TE>
<TE>   Newman indicated he had nothing to say to Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to play my game and not talk a lot of trash on the field,"
he said. "I let my game do the talking."</TE>
<TE>   As Kansas State's opponents can attest, it speaks volumes.</TE>

<DH>Armstrong's conquest of cancer, success in Tour de France
make him a fan favorite in U.S., but the French haven't taken to him</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>You have come to see the world's best cyclist and are taking the
elevator to the 39th floor of a posh hotel to meet him. You wonder
what awaits you. You have considered with wonder and awe his four
consecutive Tour de France victories. You hope he's not as ruthless
with you as he is with his competitors.</LD>
<LD>   You knock.</LD>
<LD>   The door opens.</LD>
<TE>   There stands perhaps the best athlete in the world today.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, I'm Lance," he says, offering a warm smile and a firm
handshake.</TE>
<TE>   The view from Lance Armstrong's suite is priceless. There's Coit
Tower in the foreground. Beyond lie San Francisco Bay, the Golden
Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Marin County is visible in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it stinks to be me," he jokes when you're finished admiring
the view.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong arrived in San Francisco to work, though, not moon over
the city's spectacular scenery. He rode Sunday in the 109-mile San
Francisco Grand Prix, finishing sixth, despite having trained little
since his fourth Tour de France victory in July.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest cheers from the thousands of fans lining the hilly
course were not for Charles Dionne, a 23-year-old Canadian who
outlasted Armstrong and five others at the finish line. Fans of all
ages held "Go, Lance" signs and cheered his every move around the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Without the requisite training to win, Armstrong nevertheless
stayed close until the end--buoyed he would later say--by the adoring
crowds along the course. A year ago, in the inaugural race here, he
dropped out after 80 miles, disappointing the throngs.</TE>
<TE>   Why try it again? Why bother making eight gut-wrenching climbs up
Fillmore Street and its 18% grade, and 13 more up Taylor Street and
its 16% grade? Why risk losing to an unknown like Dionne?</TE>
<TE>   "Primarily because it's an American race," Armstrong said on the
eve of one of his rare U.S. appearances. "That's probably the most
important aspect of it. There are other issues. San Francisco is a
great city. The crowds are big and enthusiastic.... "</TE>
<TE>   Winning is not one of them, however.</TE>
<TE>   If Armstrong, who turned 31 Wednesday, has proved nothing else
during his four-year reign atop the cycling world, it's that only one
race--the Tour de France--truly matters. The rest are tuneups. Or, as
in the case of the San Francisco race, an opportunity to give the
home fans an up-close view of him in action.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tour de France is the biggest race there is," Armstrong says.
"It would be mindless to say that I'm going to win the Tour of Spain
or the Tour of Flanders."</TE>
<TE>   Or to put it a way every red-blooded American can understand, he
adds: "Once you've won the Super Bowl, you don't shoot for a
wild-card spot the next year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You're probably familiar with Armstrong's story, how he battled
testicular cancer that spread to other parts of his body and nearly
killed him in 1996, how he regained his strength, slowly but
certainly, and became the world's dominant cyclist. His four
consecutive Tour victories are one shy of the record held by Miguel
Indurain of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   You also might have read recently that, upon testing, it was
determined that Armstrong's heart is a third larger than the average
person's and that his resting pulse rate is often 32 beats a minute.
At times of extreme exertion, his pulse rate can soar to 200 beats a
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you know all about the drug accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet I have been drug-tested more than any other athlete in
sports history," said Armstrong, who guessed he'd been tested after
races and randomly 30 to 50 times in the last 12 months. He has never
had a positive test.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a 21-month investigation into allegations that
Armstrong's United States Postal Service team used banned substances
during the 2000 Tour de France was closed by French authorities
because of a lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I struggle with it," Armstrong said of the suspicion that hovers
over him. "One day, I'll probably just stop thinking about it. Drugs
are a problem in every sport. In cycling, the spotlight was on it in
1998. It was probably the biggest drug story in the history of
sport."</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1998 Tour de France began, an assistant manager for a
European cycling team was caught with hundreds of vials of the banned
hormone known as EPO (erythropoietin), which increases the oxygen
supply to the blood stream and can greatly enhance performance in
endurance sports.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 Tour was nearly canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "I only have a couple of more years left, but the chances are that
I'll have to live with it for the rest of my career," Armstrong said
of the questions of doping. "I'll continue to do right by my family,
my team, my sponsors.... I'll be accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has his detractors, among them many French fans who
refuse to let the drug accusations fade. He also has staunch
defenders, among them comedian-actor Robin Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about friendship, man," said Williams, an avid cyclist who
competed in a short race for charity Sunday in San Francisco. "He
needs friends over there, riding through all those French."</TE>
<TE>   The French should admire Armstrong. After all, he admires their
nearly monthlong race above and beyond all others. And he spends a
lot of his time in France.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, he spends six months at home in Austin, Texas, with his
wife, Kristen, and their three children--his rest and recovery period
after the Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   But the other six months, he has lived and trained in France,
spending up to 35 hours a week in intense preparation for the Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Still, French cycling fans have not embraced Armstrong. Much of it
has to do with the doping accusations, but their dislike of him runs
even deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has been compared to cyber character Lara Croft, who
appears only in virtual reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Robocop on wheels, someone no fan can relate to or identify
with," wrote Robert Redeker, a French philosopher, of Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to show a more human side, Armstrong teamed with the
shoe giant Nike to film a clever television commercial in 2000.
Armstrong is shown completing a lengthy training ride, arriving at
home long after the sun has set. In the voice-over, he says,
"Everybody wants to know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on my bike,
busting my ... six hours a day. What are you on?"</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong also wrote a best-selling book, detailing his battle
with cancer and his interests outside cycling. Americans continue to
be drawn to him, as much for his remarkable victories in the Tour de
France as for whipping cancer and for starting the Lance Armstrong
Foundation, which helps to fight the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real person," said Dan Osipow, the U.S. Postal Service
team's director of operations and the man who designed Sunday's
tortuous course through and over San Francisco's famous hills.
"People have seen him through his ups and downs. He's an inspiration.
He is one of the amazing sports stories. Lance has taken cycling
where it's never been before. He's a son, a father, a cancer
survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the perception that Armstrong is not human, Osipow
said, "That's so not true. He's funny. He's charismatic."</TE>
<TE>   For a time in his hotel suite, Armstrong also was very serious,
pondering a question he has apparently never been asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Which do I prefer?" he asked, repeating a question about his
favorite cycling film, " 'Breaking Away' or 'American Flyers?' That's
a great question. I've been to the Little 500," he said of the
Indiana University student race that's the focal point of 'Breaking
Away.' "I was asked to ride the pace bike in the Little 500. They're
both great movies, but I would have to go with 'Breaking Away.' "</TE>

<LD>On the weekend after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States last year, sports in this country pretty much shut down. Major
League Baseball, the NFL, most college football, auto racing and
soccer canceled their scheduled events.</LD>
<LD>   Unlimited hydroplane racing in San Diego's Mission Bay was among
the exceptions.</LD>
<LD>   Promoter Jim Kidrick, a 21-year Navy combat pilot, decided that
people needed some relief from watching and talking about the events
of the previous Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Despite travel problems that prevented some racing personnel from
reaching San Diego until Saturday, the races went on.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough decision on his part and he got a little heat at
the time, but it turned out great," said Gary Garbrecht, president of
Hydro-Prop, operator of the Budweiser Unlimited Hydroplane Series.</TE>
<TE>   On race day, more than 75,000 spectators lined Fiesta Island and
Crown Point Shores. It was the largest crowd in several years.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, I think Jim felt the public needed a break, and maybe a
couple of hours of boat racing would be the right diversion," said
hall-of-fame driver Chip Hanauer, executive director of this year's
race. "It couldn't have worked out better."</TE>
<TE>   The three-ton, 28-foot long unlimiteds will be back this week,
churning up Mission Bay with their 220 mph trademark roostertails.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Thunderboat Regatta, sponsored by Classmates.com,
will have its 37th running Sunday with Nate Brown defending his Bill
Muncey Cup championship in U-16 Miss Elam Plus and Dave Villwock
seeking his sixth series crown in U-1 Miss Budweiser.</TE>
<TE>   In five races this year, Villwock has won three and Brown two,
giving the Miss Budweiser pilot a 772-630 lead in points.</TE>
<TE>   Other possible winners include Mike Hanson, U-9 Sun Harbor
Mortgage; Mark Tate, U-2 Miss Trendwest; and Terry Troxell, U-99 Miss
Troxilla.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mathematical scenario, and anything can happen," said
Villwock of his championship hopes. "The entire field will be letting
it all hang out because it is the last race of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Villwock, team manager of Circus Circus when Hanauer won the
drivers' championship in 1989, has won five times in San Diego, 1992
in Coors Light, and '94, '98, '99 and 2000 in Miss Budweiser.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Little, 76, owner of Miss Budweiser, was hospitalized this
season because of pneumonia and missed three races, but his team is
on the brink of winning its 22nd championship.</TE>
<TE>   "We've met every goal this year but one, and we're close," said
Little. "At the start of the year, I told the team we had three
goals. Our first goal was to win the first race of the season [at
Evansville, Ind.], which we did. Second, I told them I wanted a 14th
Gold Cup, which the team delivered [in Detroit]. And our final goal
was a 22nd championship. I hope to celebrate three for three on
Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Little, co-owner of Hydro-Prop last year, sold his 50% interest to
Garbrecht during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary is the premier businessman in powerboating today," Little
said after bowing out. "He has done a great job in helping get the
sport turned around. Now that he has his management team in place, I
think that it is best that I concentrate on running my team and let
Gary have total ownership of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the weekend will benefit Children's Hospital and
Health Center in San Diego.</TE>

<TE>   Sports Cars</TE>
<TE>   If the CART/IRL split has made a mess of open-wheel racing, the
American LeMans Series and the Grand American Rolex Series have done
much the same in sports cars. Two powerful groups, American LeMans,
led by Don Panoz, and Grand American, under Bill France family
management, have gone their separate ways, splitting an already thin
following.</TE>
<TE>   The American LeMans series, featuring factory competition among
Audi, Cadillac and Panoz prototypes and between Corvette and Porsche
production cars, will be at Laguna Seca's Mazda Raceway this weekend
for the eighth race of a 10-race schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The Grand American series, which ran last March at California
Speedway, will close its season Nov. 10 at Daytona International
Speedway, with a six-hour enduro on its home track.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we see it is that the Grand American, by its own
admission, focuses primarily on gentleman-type racers and is not
intended specifically for manufacturers and professional drivers,"
said Scott Atherton, American LeMans president and former California
Speedway president. "We are at the other end of the spectrum,
embracing manufacturers and incorporating the 24 Hours of LeMans
rules and trademark into our series."</TE>
<TE>   Audi will have two cars at Laguna Seca in the 38-car lineup
Sunday. Emanuele Pierro, defending American LeMans champion, and
Frank Biela will co-drive the Audi that won in France two months ago.
Tom Kristensen will co-drive the Audi that finished second at LeMans.
Biela and Pierro won last year's Laguna Seca event.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers often compete in both series. Bill Auberlen, who will
co-drive a Panoz with former CART driver Bryan Herta at Laguna Seca,
shares a Ferrari with Cort Wagner in the Grand American series.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective is to make sports car racing a factor in U.S. motor
sports scene, as it was in the 1970s and 1980s," said Atherton. "And
we think we are inching back toward that period."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the American LeMans Series race, the weekend at
Mazda Raceway will also include races for GT and touring cars, the
Mazda series and world superkarts.</TE>

<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale favorite Barefoot Billy Ziemann, home from a
seventh-place finish in the World Figure 8 championships, a
three-hour enduro at Indianapolis Speedrome last week, will be at his
home track Saturday night for the season's next-to-last Figure 8.
Ziemann completed 387 laps and finished seventh, 47 laps behind the
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Show Speedway's Chris Williamson made only 27 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, however, will be out to catch James Altman Saturday
night in Irwindale's Figure 8 standings. He trails by only eight
points.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Sapper won Orange Show Speedway's Twin 30-lap late model races
last week, but Gary Tamborelli's two second-place finishes enabled
him to repeat as NASCAR champion in the track's top class....</TE>
<TE>   Former Grand National motorcycle champion Gene Romero is bringing
his AMA sanctioned flat-track series to Perris Auto Speedway on
Saturday night. In addition to racing in the open class, there will
be main events for vintage Harley-Davidsons and novice riders.</TE>
<TE>   California Speedway closes its street-legal drag racing season
this weekend with action Saturday and Sunday on the quarter-mile
strip.</TE>
<TE>   As a side show, the SuperTT American Racing Series will hold races
both days on a makeshift course in the speedway parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians fared well in the Sports Car Club of
America's Solo II Nationals at Topeka, Kan. Stock class winners
included Scott McHugh, Santa Clarita, A stock; Mari Clements, Alta
Loma, E stock ladies. Street prepared: George Doganis, La Mesa, C
Street; James Gunn-Wilkinson, San Diego, street modified 2; Gary
Thomason, Oceanside, A street; Tom Berry, Alta Loma, E Street; Taka

<TE>   Indy 500 winner Helio Castroneves is testing for the Toyota
Formula One team today at the Paul Ricard track in France. Earlier,
CART's Cristiano da Matta, test driver Stephane Sarrazin and F1

<HD>Starters Will Determine Their Stretch Position</HD>

<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Let's not embellish.</LD>
<LD>   Just because Jarrod Washburn pitched eight shutout innings on
three days' rest, no one is suggesting the Angels now try him on two
days' rest, or one.</LD>
<LD>   Just because Ramon Ortiz has won five consecutive decisions, no
one is calling for him to join Washburn in a Spahn and Sain rotation
down the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   And just because Kevin Appier struggled for the second consecutive
start Thursday and John Lackey has lost some of his rookie groove and
Mickey Callaway is unlikely to be trusted with another start unless
it's in a game that doesn't matter next weekend, no one is saying the
Angels have a major problem with their starting pitching.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that any problem seems more than minor now because the
Angels lost a doubleheader of sorts Thursday and are looking at some
hard realities.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-3 setback to the Oakland A's in which a laboring Appier
threw 102 pitches in 5 1/3 innings and Brendan Donnelly threw a
fastball he wished he hadn't left the Angels one game behind the A's
in the American League West and gave Oakland the season series, 11-9.</TE>
<TE>   That means the A's are assured of the division title if they end
up tied with the Angels after the next nine games, and it means the
Angels will have to win the division outright if they are to avoid
the ultimate test for a team with no postseason experience--a
wild-card October in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Angels believe they have been playing
playoff-caliber games for weeks now, especially in the compelling
eight games that they split with the A's in the last 11 days.</TE>
<TE>   And although Manager Mike Scioscia wasn't about to deviate from
his philosophy, wasn't about to look beyond tonight's opener of a
three-game series in Seattle and wasn't about to label the loss to
the A's as a game the Angels had to win because of the tiebreaker, he
could easily have been thinking of the playoff-weathered Yankees when
he said the Angels will maintain the intensity and focus they first
displayed in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "That intensity is the strength that will carry through the rest
of the year and hopefully into the playoffs," Scioscia said. "It's
been incredible. They've never backed down from a challenge, and the
last month was probably the most challenging schedule of any club in
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that may be the first time anyone has categorized the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore Orioles as challenging, but what
Scioscia seemed to be saying is that the Angels didn't let down while
shadowing the A's during their 20-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to be saying that, even with Thursday's loss and the
three losses in four games here, a reversal of what happened in
Anaheim, the Angels have won 17 of their last 21 and there's no
reason "to start standings or scoreboard watching now or doing
anything differently than we have all year."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, the Angels can eliminate the Mariners and wrap up the
wild card by Saturday, and they still have time to win the division,
as A's General Manager Billy Beane acknowledged while also
acknowledging what the Angels wouldn't: that in the context of the
tiebreaker, Thursday's win represented a swing of two games and,
thus, carried "a lot of importance."</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it and they knew it," Beane said. "At least, I assume
they knew it. Of course, they have the ability to jump back ahead of
us just as we have the ability to extend the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you can't get caught up in one game. By the end of
next week it can change."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but the Angels will need the quality pitching that
enabled them to enter Thursday's game with the American League's
second-best earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   As it sets up, Ortiz, Lackey and Washburn will pitch in Seattle.
The Angels are off Monday, and Appier, Ortiz and Lackey are then
scheduled to face the Rangers in Texas, although Lackey could be
replaced by Washburn, who would be pitching again on three days' rest
as a prelude to entering the playoff opener on full rest.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finish at home with three games against the Mariners.
The rotation will depend on the importance of those games. The one
certainty is that Washburn, Appier and Ortiz will make up a three-man
rotation for the five-game division series.</TE>
<TE>   "Our starters have been so good for so long that it's inevitable
they hit a bump now and then," Scioscia said. "I'm confident they'll
be fine."</TE>
<TE>   With Aaron Sele sidelined by a torn rotator cuff and unlikely to
pitch again before the season ends, Washburn and Ortiz have sailed
over the bump, but Appier--who will start Game 2 in the playoffs and
is the one Angel with postseason experience aside from Sele--seems to
have hit it squarely.</TE>
<TE>   After pitching at least six innings in 13 consecutive starts, he
has failed to finish the sixth in his last two, giving up 14 hits and
10 runs in 8 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Appier was 3-0 for the New York Mets last September, and Scioscia
said he didn't think the 34-year-old right-hander was experiencing
fatigue "as much as the fact that he has a complicated delivery that
requires a lot of maintenance and he's had a couple of starts now
where he's just not as crisp. He had to work hard for every out
today, but he experienced the same thing earlier this season and
battled through it."</TE>
<TE>   After seven hits and three walks and those 102 pitches, Appier
handed a 3-3 tie to Donnelly in the sixth and was watching from the
bench one out later when Donnelly, who has been so good in this
late-career opportunity, yielded the decisive homer to Terrence Long.</TE>
<TE>   With Donnelly having given up a tying homer to Oakland's Eric
Chavez in Anaheim last week, time will tell if this was a second and
irreparable crack in his mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   Time also will tell if Appier and the Angel rotation are headed
anywhere but New York.</TE>

<LD>Defensive tackle Warren Sapp of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was fined
$10,000 for slamming Baltimore running back Chester Taylor to the
ground after the whistle during Sunday's 25-0 victory over the
Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay was penalized 15 yards on the first-quarter play.</LD>
<LD>   The All-Pro defensive tackle had been fined $5,000 the previous
week for hitting New Orleans center LeCharles Bentley in the head.</LD>
<TE>   No penalty was called on that play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Keith Brooking and the Atlanta Falcons have
discontinued talks on a contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Dye Jr., Brooking's agent, indicated that he and the Falcons
would resume their discussions when the season ends.</TE>
<TE>   "We both perceive the gap at this time to be insurmountable," Dye
said. "Secondly and probably more importantly, we believe it's best
not to let the situation linger on. It's probably best to try and
give it some closure for the time being."</TE>
<TE>   Brooking is in the final year of a contract he signed after the
club drafted him No. 12 overall in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Carolina Panthers added free-agent kicker Jon Hilbert to
replace the injured John Kasay.</TE>
<TE>   Hilbert was signed to the practice squad but will be moved to the
53-man roster later this week.</TE>
<TE>   The team is considering putting Kasay on injured reserve, in which
case he would be out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police are investigating the role of New York Jet rookie Bryan
Thomas in a dispute with his girlfriend at LaGuardia Airport on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas would not comment on the matter Thursday before he joined
the team for practice. But his agents and an attorney met with Jet
officials Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injured defensive starters Jeff Ulbrich and Zack Bronson returned
to practice Thursday and are expected to play for the San Francisco
49ers on Sunday against the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Ulbrich, a linebacker sidelined since the exhibition season by a
knee injury, ran at full speed for the second consecutive day.</TE>
<TE>   He might not reclaim his starting spot from Jamie Winborn yet, but
Coach Steve Mariucci expects Ulbrich to play.</TE>
<TE>   Bronson, a safety, returned to practice after spraining his
shoulder Sunday against Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right tackle Mike Williams injured his left knee during Buffalo
Bills' practice but is expected to play at Denver on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Close In on Division Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Cardinals couldn't have been much more efficient than
this: They came to Coors Field with a magic number of seven to clinch
the NL Central and left Thursday with the number at two.</LD>
<LD>   "We're closing in on the finish line," Manager Tony La Russa said.
"Our boys can smell it."</LD>
<LD>   Scott Rolen hit his fourth homer in three games as the Cardinals
beat the Colorado Rockies, 12-6, for their 13th win in the last 15
games.</LD>
<TE>   By sweeping the three-game series while second-place Houston was
losing two of three to Milwaukee, the Cardinals increased their lead
to 8 1/2 games. St. Louis has 10 games remaining and Houston nine,
and those teams begin a three-game series tonight at Busch Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "We all can feel it," said second baseman Fernando Vina, who had
three hits and two runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tough year for us with the tragedies and the things
that have happened. We've got to keep going hard so we can finish it
up at home. When it happens, it's going to be something real
special."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Houston 4--After losing two of three to the worst
team in the National League, the Astros have seen their postseason
chances all but fade away.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Hall's two-run double keyed Milwaukee's four-run fourth
inning at Milwaukee as the Brewers handed Roy Oswalt his first loss
in two months.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (19-7) gave up four runs and four hits in six innings to
lose for the first time since July 16, a span of 12 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Philadelphia 0--Tom Glavine pitched six scoreless
innings and Chipper Jones hit a three-run homer at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Braves' Manager Bobby Cox reached another milestone, becoming the
12th manager in major league history to win 1,800 games. His record
in 21 seasons is 1,800-1,400.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 3, San Diego 1--Arizona rallied for two unearned runs in
the eighth inning at San Diego to give Randy Johnson his fourth
straight win.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (23-5) tied teammate Curt Schilling for the major league
lead in victories. His September record, dating to 1993, is 27-1 in
38 appearances, including 37 starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks lowered their magic number to four for clinching
their second straight NL West title.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Chicago 2--Roger Cedeno drove home the winning run
with an infield single in the 12th inning at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Florida 5--At Miami, Bartolo Colon became the second
pitcher to win 10 games in both leagues in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Colon (10-3) joined Hank Borowy (New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs)
in 1945 as the only pitchers to win 10 games in both leagues in the
same season. Colon was 10-4 with Cleveland. He was acquired in a
midseason trade.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Pittsburgh 4--Kelly Stinnett hit the first grand
slam of his career with two out in the ninth inning to lead the Reds
at Pittsburgh.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK JETS AT MIAMI</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Miami by 6</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: All absolutely logic-defying and inexplicably amazing
things must come to an end some time.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: With apologies to the 2-0 Panthers and the 0-2 Rams, this
week's most mind-fogging NFL stat belongs to the Jets (and the
Dolphins are sick and tired of reading it/hearing it/being asked
after every practice about it): The Jets are 8-0 against the Dolphins
since 1997. Despite the fact Miami has made the playoffs every season
since 1997. To put it another way, the last time the Dolphins beat
the Jets, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells were matching wits on the
sidelines instead of quips on dueling pregame shows, Dan Marino was
quarterbacking the Dolphins and Neil O'Donnell was, well, Neil
O'Donnell.</TE>

<TE>   CLEVELAND AT TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 4</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Eddie George looks to get healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: George has carried the load for the Titans for so long, they
were still in Houston and he still had the knees of a young man when
he began. That was 1996, this is now. George turns 29 on Tuesday, two
days after his consecutive-starts streak is expected to hit 97. But
clearly all is not well with George, who is averaging 2.9 yards a
carry this season and labored painfully in a 21-13 upset loss to
Dallas. He badly needs a weekend off, but, failing that, he gets the
Browns, who rank 31st against the run and have yielded 120 or more
rushing yards in their last six games--150 or more in the last five.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "What's Brown and White and Gets Run All Over?"</TE>

<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT CHICAGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Chicago by 1</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Mike Ditka Memorial Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Ditka coached both of these teams, to wildly different
conclusions. With the Bears, he wound up in the Super Bowl. With the
Saints, he mortgaged the franchise's future for a running back who
now plays for Miami, then went 15-33 in three seasons. Now completely
Ditka-less, both teams are on the rebound--the Bears 2-0 after
winning by three points and one point, just like last year, and the
Saints a surprising 2-0 to open the post-Ricky Williams era. Both of
the Saints' victories have been against 2001 NFC playoff teams, Tampa
Bay and Green Bay. A win over the Bears in Champaign would be
another.</TE>

<TE>   DALLAS AT PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Quincy Carter won a game last Sunday. Let's see him
do it again.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Cowboys are 0-4 against the Eagles since 1999, having
been outscored, 133-48. In those games, the Eagle defense has forced
13 turnovers. Into this breach is thrown young quarterback Carter,
who missed both Eagle games last season and had lunch this week with
team owner Jerry Jones. Rumor has it Jones requested the sit-down to
counsel Carter on his recent dealings with the Dallas media, which
have been hostile. Carter will learn soon enough: Against the Eagles,
the postgame stuff is usually the highlight.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "How Do We Put This Nicely? Eagles Intercept
Carter Five Times"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 12</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Learning curve bound to quicken for someone here.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: In their 24-3 loss to San Diego, the Texans looked very much
the undermanned expansion team that might have exhausted a full
season's supply of adrenaline in their opening-night upset of the
Cowboys. Now continues the hard part: the rest of the schedule.
Meanwhile, the tackling-challenged Colts are still struggling to
grasp the fundamentals of defense. After two games in 2001, the Colts
had given up 50 points and 701 yards. After two games in 2002, the
Colts have yielded 46 points and 685 yards. Tony Dungy and the Texans
are slowly learning: It's going to be a long haul.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Giddy Dungy: 'You Mean We Get To Play Them
TWICE A Year?!' "</TE>

<TE>   KANSAS CITY AT NEW ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Pony express finally reaches Vegas bookmakers. "Holy
cow, it says here Patriots are good!"</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It didn't take a ton of bricks to fall on the
behind-the-curve types who set the NFL betting lines. No, only
victories by scores of 30-14 and 44-7 over 2001 playoff teams
Pittsburgh and the Jets. (Not to mention an 11-game winning streak
that includes, oh, right, the Super Bowl.) Finally, the Patriots are
favored to win a game, this one over Kansas City, which is one thrown
helmet away from an 0-2 start and cries for Trent Green's benching.
Oh, that has already started? Says Chief Coach Dick Vermeil of
Green's backup: "It would not surprise me to see Todd Collins go in a
football game and play very well."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Patriots Beat the Spread Again."</TE>

<TE>   CAROLINA AT MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Minnesota by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Gary, old man, we can only hope and pray you've
forgotten that unseemly pink-slip thing, given your advanced age and
all.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Why are the Vikings 0-2? In a word, "ageism." Gary Anderson,
the NFL's all-time leading scorer, turned 43 in July, so the Vikings
cut him, ignoring that in 2001, Anderson converted 15 of 18
field-goal attempts and missed only one of 30 extra-point tries. When
Doug Brien missed twice as many extra points in last week's overtime
loss to Buffalo, Anderson found himself getting pulled out of a
fishing stream and back onto the Vikings' active roster for Sunday's
game. In other codger news, Rodney Peete, 36, makes his third
consecutive start for undefeated Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Crow's Feet Don't Fail Vikings Now"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BUFFALO AT DENVER</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Drew Bledsoe versus kings of the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Bills have played 659 games in their history, 657
without Bledsoe. They have been quarterbacked by a Hall of Famer (Jim
Kelly), a league championship winner (Jack Kemp), a Pro Bowl veteran
(Joe Ferguson) and a cult hero (Doug Flutie)--and none of them passed
for as many yards as Bledsoe did in his second game with the Bills
last week: 463. Bledsoe has turned the Bills from a turn-the-channel
regular to a refrigerator-run-can-wait thriller almost overnight.
More edge-of-the-seat action is expected Sunday against the Broncos,
2-0 after wins over NFC West favorites St. Louis and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "All Bledsoe, All Overtime for Bills Again"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Diego by 1</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Will the real Thomas Jones please stand up?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: No Cardinal running back had rushed for 100 yards in a game
since September 2000, a streak that extended 29 games. Then came
Sunday in Seattle, when Jones got the ball 24 times against the
league's 32nd-ranked rushing defense and wound up netting 173
yards--103 more than his best previous day as a pro. Milestone? Or
mirage? In the desert, Jones and the Cardinals will search for clues
against the Chargers, owners of--yes, it says right here--the NFL's
top-ranked defense. The Chargers are 2-0 after successive byes,
otherwise known as games at Cincinnati and at home against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Chargers Advise Cards, Jones to Take a Seat"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GREEN BAY AT DETROIT</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 8</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Ford Field, where quality is job left undone.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: A funny thing happened on the way to the Lions' grand
opening of their $300-million stadium. The Lions kicked off the
season. Now 0-2 after losing last week by 24 points to a team that
lost its last 15 games last season, the Lions have hit panic mode a
month earlier than usual and are switching quarterbacks, benching
Mike McMahon in favor of first-round draft pick Joey Harrington.
Harrington has thrown only 18 passes for a rating of 23.8, but Ford
Field officials figure they have to do something to attract customers
before the new stadium smell fades.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Poll: Having Taken Test Drive, 93% of Detroit
Fans Prefer Tigers"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEATTLE AT NEW YORK GIANTS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 6</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Resistible force meets movable object.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Seattle surrendered 173 yards rushing last game to Arizona's
Thomas Jones, which can mean only one thing Sunday at the
Meadowlands: It's now or never for Ron Dayne. With Tiki Barber
limping, the Giants are asking more from Dayne, and receiving the
usual: no gains and one-yard losses in important short-yardage
situations. This might help explain why Giant quarterback Kerry
Collins has thrown for 300 yards or more in five consecutive games
and will tie the league record with another against the Seahawks.
Because, somewhere, somehow, there has to be an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Dayne Steps Back and Applauds Collins' Record
Performance"</TE>

<TE>   WASHINGTON AT SAN FRANCISCO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Remember the Osaka Dome!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Here's one more difference between the colleges and the pros
Steve Spurrier might have initially missed: Run up the score in an
early-season game in college and you might never have to schedule a
rematch. Run up the score in an exhibition game in the NFL and six
weeks later, you find yourself traveling to their place. "We'll see
you again!" 49er Coach Steve Mariucci promised/warned Spurrier and
his staff after the Redskins' 38-7 victory over San Francisco last
month in Osaka, Japan. Yes, they will, and there you are. Do Redskin
quarterbacks come equipped with air bags?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Spurrier Discovers Payback Is a Blitz"</TE>

<TE>   CINCINNATI AT ATLANTA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Atlanta by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Bengals, Falcons both 0-2. And other reasons
statistics lie.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If not for two plays--William Henderson ruled just short of
the goal line in Green Bay, Jay Feely hooking a field goal wide
against Chicago--the Falcons would be 2-0. If not for scheduled
league games against San Diego and Cleveland, the Bengals might be
undefeated too. The Falcons, with Michael Vick scrambling for big
gains, more time to throw and/or his continued well being, have
become the NFC's surprising must-see team. The Bengals are still
quarterbacked by Gus Frerotte, who can throw interceptions with
either hand, which is also something that must be seen to be
believed.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "All Hands on Deck for Falcons' Rout of

<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: History is at hand, one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: With 17 pass attempts Monday night, Ram quarterback Kurt
Warner will have 1,500 for his career, making him eligible for the
NFL's official all-time quarterback rating leaders list. Warner will
debut at No. 1, testament to how much he has thrown and how fast he
has grown since becoming a starter only three years ago. At the same
time, Warner is one road loss from an 0-3 start. The Patriots, of all
people, have provided inspiration for the Rams--New England started
the 2001 season 0-2 and went on to win the Super Bowl. Remind the
Rams: No 0-3 team has gone on to do the same.</TE>

<HD>World Cup Track Meet a Coup by Sports Council</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Sports Council has turned its loss in the race to
host the 2012 Olympics into significant victories on several fronts.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Games won't be held in Los Angeles any time soon,
winning the 2006 IAAF World Cup track and field meet for the Home
Depot National Training Center in Carson will keep the city in the
forefront of international sports.</LD>
<LD>   "We've consciously turned our attention to events we may not have
turned our attention to in the past, events that not only haven't
been in L.A., but haven't been in the U.S.," David Simon, president
of the Sports Council, said Thursday. "It's going to help us in
building our reputation with national federations."</LD>
<TE>   Besides the World Cup, which is held every four years and which
Simon called "the biggest track event economically and in every other
way in L.A. since the 1984 Olympics," the 2005 beach volleyball World
Championships will be held at the tennis center within the complex at
Cal State Dominguez Hills. A bid has been made to hold the 2005 NCAA
track and field championships there as well.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the 2003 world gymnastics championships will be
staged at the Arrowhead Pond, and Long Beach will host the 2004 U.S.
Olympic swimming trials. Staples Center hosted this year's U.S.
figure skating championships.</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup has never been held in the U.S. This year's edition
begins today in Madrid, where Thousand Oaks High graduate Marion
Jones, a quintuple medalist at the Sydney Olympics, will lead the
defending champion U.S. women's team. She will run the 100 and 200,
and said she's looking forward to competing here in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I go back to California, it's like I'm going home,"
said Jones, who lives in Raleigh, N.C. "To get the chance to go back
to the place of my birth for a major championship will be one of the
highlights of my career."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Thursday from Madrid that he and Craig Masback, chief
executive of USA Track and Field, began discussions in 1999 to stage
a major track event here. The key to making it reality was the
Anschutz Entertainment Group's commitment to build the $130-million,
multisport complex.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have never happened without them," Simon said. "They've
done it right by planning a stadium that can seat up to 20,000. If we
had 60,000 seats to sell, I'd worry, but I believe 20,000 will be
sold."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Montgomery, sore after setting a world record of 9.78 seconds
in the 100 meters Saturday, will be replaced in the 100 at Madrid by
Jon Drummond. Montgomery practiced handoffs for the 400-meter relay
and wants to run the anchor leg today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to sit back and just watch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians Sylvia Mosqueda and Milena Glusac joined the
elite field for the Nov. 3 New York City Marathon. Marla Runyan will
make her marathon debut in a field expected to include former world
cross-country champion Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland. New York Road
Runner officials are expected to announce next week that former UCLA
standout Meb Keflezighi, who won the U.S. men's 5K title last
weekend, will run in New York. Keflezighi won the U.S. 12K
cross-country, 15K roads, 10,000-meter track and seven-mile road
titles this year.</TE>

<TE>   World junior figure skating champion Ann Patrice McDonough was
added to the entrants at Skate America, Oct. 24-27 at Spokane, Wash.
That will be Sarah Hughes' first competition since her gold-medal
triumph at Salt Lake City.... Olympians Mark and Scott Fusco and the
late Joe Riley were elected to the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.</TE>

<DL>KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>This town's greatest charter captain hasn't caught a fish in years.
He no longer feels comfortable on a boat and, in fact, has trouble
getting around in his house.</LD>
<LD>   But it's understandable. George S. Parker is 91. He lives on a
small estate in the verdant hills above Kailua Bay and watches over a
refreshingly blue ocean he once plied with a passion unrivaled by any
of today's much younger captains.</LD>
<LD>   Parker, in his day, provided thrills of a lifetime to anyone who
stepped aboard his boat, and they, in turn, provided him with a sea
of precious memories.</LD>
<TE>   "I was fishing for over 50 years," he recalls, "and as I look
back, one of the biggest things outside of catching fish, as much as
I love the sea and the excitement, was the chance I had to meet
wonderful people from all over the world. Without going through a
secretary, you're able to talk with them face to face while you're
waiting for a fish to strike."</TE>
<TE>   Parker once took Jimmy Hoffa aboard his beloved yacht, the Mona H.
He remembers the leader of the Teamsters union as a "little Napoleon,
drunk with power," but nice enough to offer valuable advice.</TE>
<TE>   Recalls the captain, "When he left the boat he said, 'Remember
captain, there's only one way to live in this world. You've got to
live by the golden rule. You've got to do unto others before they do
unto you.' "</TE>
<TE>   Parker laughs and his blue eyes sparkle as he tells the story, but
then the laughter recedes and the eyes reveal a trace of sadness,
perhaps in the knowledge that such recollections are of a time long
past.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they're fond memories and the captain at least is
fortunate, at his age, to be able to recall his many great
experiences as though they happened yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   Among others to have fished on the Mona H were Jimmy Stewart,
Henry Fonda and Tennessee Ernie Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so damn lucky," Parker says of Ford, the late
country-western entertainer. "He caught a marlin every time he fished
with me. And he used to talk about it on his shows. He'd say, 'Go to
Kona, fish with George Parker.... ' "</TE>
<TE>   It should be mentioned that the man who helped pioneer
sportfishing on the big island of Hawaii--with such contemporaries as
Henry Chee, Charlie Machado and Tacks Waldron--caught the world's
first certified Pacific blue marlin.</TE>
<TE>   It was a grand specimen weighing 1,002 pounds, a beast he battled
for nearly four hours, well into darkness. The catch, in 1954, was
the highlight of his angling life and it put Kona in the spotlight as
never before.</TE>
<TE>   "But more on that later," the captain barks, when pressed for
details. "I'd like to cover a few other things first."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Diego in 1910, Parker was introduced to fishing by his
father off Point Loma. He worked as a lifeguard in Del Mar, at a
nearby bank and as a spokesman for Ford Motor Company.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Great Depression. Jobs were scarce, "and I couldn't
get out of there fast enough," Parker recalls. In 1935, he rolled his
Model A onto a ship and left for a tropical paradise he would forever
call home.</TE>
<TE>   "All the people were so nice and the weather was good, and the
mountains and the greenery and the beaches ... it was too much for
me," the captain says. "My God, I thought this place was heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Heaven had its realities, though. Parker worked first at an auto
dealership, then on a sugar plantation, which he enjoyed until a
promotion took him from the fields to an office. Still, life was
good. Warm breezes greeted him each morning as he made his way from
his apartment, in a lush valley overlooking Honolulu, to a city that,
back then, had a hometown feel.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the shattering day that led to U.S. involvement in World
War II. On the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, in with the breezes came
Japanese warplanes, flying low in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "We got up and saw the smoke rising from the ships that were being
torpedoed and at the same time we heard these planes coming in from
the mountainside, right out of the sun," Parker recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned on the radio and Web Edwards was trying to convince the
people of Hawaii that this was no joke: We were under attack by the
Japanese. He said, 'This is your friend Web Edwards. I wouldn't lie
to you. This is the real McCoy--we're under attack.' I'll remember
those words forever."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Parker quit his office job and bought a commercial
fishing boat. A group of businessmen asked him to take them on a
five-day sportfishing trip to the big island and back--a turning
point in his life.</TE>
<TE>   The stunningly blue waters off Kona were calm, whereas those off
Honolulu were rough. Parker remembers the first day's catch down to
the numbers: three marlin, 20 ono (wahoo), 20 mahi-mahi and 16 ulua
(trevally).</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I got back to Honolulu, my boat was full and I had a
picture taken, which ran on the front page of the Honolulu
Advertiser, and that really started things for me," the captain
recalls. "I said, 'I'm going back to Kona as soon as I can, and
whoever wants to fish with me can fly over there first.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The big marlin struck when Parker least expected it. He had
enjoyed a fine season chartering the Mona H for $60 a day. Now it was
November and the boat was en route to Oahu for off-season repairs.
Parker had forgotten about the two lures he had in the water as he
was crossing the Molokai Channel between Maui and Oahu. His mind was
on the military maneuvers underway in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the reel screamed and line flew from its spool. Parker
ran to the wheelhouse to pull back on the throttle, "And as I did so
I saw this huge fish come up ahead of my boat going away from me in
the same direction--and that fish was still pulling line out," Parker
recalls. "He had already passed me up and was way up ahead of my
boat. I said, 'Oh, my God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Parker had none of the cutting-edge technology today's anglers
enjoy. His 50-foot boat had a top cruising speed of only 10 knots.
His reel had only one speed and a spool that had come close to
buckling under the pressure of fish much less powerful than this one.
His fighting chair was a wooden bench.</TE>
<TE>   Because he was alone and had to act as both pilot and fisherman,
the odds were even greater against him. As if this weren't enough, he
now found himself in the middle of the military maneuvers. An
aircraft carrier and a destroyer seemed to be bearing down on the
Mona H. Airplanes were flying to and from the carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Parker was sweating profusely and struggling to maintain his
composure.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared," he says. "Then I noticed that a chopper had taken
off from the carrier. He came over and hung over and looked down on
me. The pilot ... I could see him looking down at me and laughing. He
hung over me and it was wonderful because the downdraft was cool and
felt so good."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, a friend arrived from Honolulu and took the controls.
By this time, the billfish had tired considerably. It was worked
first into shallow water, to prevent it from diving, and ultimately
to the stern.</TE>
<TE>   The "grander" was towed into Honolulu, where it measured 15 feet
and had a girth of 74 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "It caused quite a stir," Parker recalls. "I got telegrams from
all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At that time, it was widely believed there were no blue marlin in
the Pacific. Just as all billfish were once referred to simply as
swordfish, all large marlin were classified as black marlin and often
referred to as silver marlin, because they looked silver in the
water.</TE>
<TE>   But there were those who suspected a difference. Black marlin had
non-retractable pectoral fins and Atlantic blues had retractable
fins. Most of the marlin off Kona, as well as many of those off
Australia and New Zealand, had fins that retracted.</TE>
<TE>   It was Parker, after his monumental catch, who led the lobbying
effort to gain a classification distinct from Atlantic blue marlin.
The effort was eventually successful. Parker had an all-tackle world
record and the world had Pacific blue marlin. Since Kona's tranquil
waters had the biggest blues, the city became a top destination for
big-game fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Peter Fithian, as manager of the Kona Inn, started the
Hawaiian International Billfish tournament in hopes that it would
showcase the wonderful fishing available so close to shore. It did
that and more: The tournament became one of the most prestigious
fishing contests in the world and recently concluded its 43rd year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Honokohau Marina opened, providing shelter for a growing
fleet. Today, the charter fleet is about 70 vessels strong and has
accounted for more big blues than fleets from anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1960, at least 62 Pacific blue marlin have topped the
magical 1,000-pound mark, among them the all-tackle world record, a
1,376-pounder caught in 1982. Only a dozen or so active skippers have
logged a grander and far fewer have done it twice.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin Parker of Marlin's Magic is one of those. So is Randy
Parker of the Huntress. As two of Kona's greatest charter captains,
they're looking more like their father every day.</TE>

<LD>Imagine UCLA losing to USC on a questionable official's call, then,
at game's end, that referee joining the Trojans in singing the alma
mater.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA is outraged, so it complains to Verle Sorgen, the
conference's coordinator of football officiating.</LD>
<LD>   Sorgen says he'll review the matter.</LD>
<TE>   Sorgen is a USC graduate.</TE>
<TE>   We present this hypothetical only to illustrate the almost
unavoidable cross-pollination that takes place across the country on
football Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, things get dicey.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific 10 went 8-1 in nonconference games last week, but Utah
Coach Ron McBride can assure you it should have been 7-2 in the wake
of his team's 23-17 loss to Arizona at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Utah lost when an official ruled Ute receiver Josh Lyman's knee
was out of bounds in the back of the end zone as he hauled in the
potential game-winning pass with 38 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The lead official, Jim Fogltance, happens to live in Tucson and
has two degrees from Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   McBride couldn't hold his tongue.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big UA guy," he told the Salt Lake Tribune after the game.
"He lives there and has always been a big supporter of theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Also working Saturday's game was referee Bob Beal, a former
Arizona lineman.</TE>
<TE>   After a phone call from Mountain West Conference Commissioner
Craig Thompson, McBride issued a public apology. He still maintained
the referees blew the call, but admitted he should not have singled
out Fogltance, who was not involved in the controversial play.</TE>
<TE>   Still, was Fogltance's crew watching out for Arizona?</TE>
<TE>   Who could suspect such a thing?</TE>
<TE>   "Only people with evil minds," Sorgen said in a phone interview
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Fogltance, a retired principal, has been a referee since 1978.
Sorgen noted that earlier in the Utah-Arizona game, officials gave
Utah a break when they ruled a receiver down on an apparent Arizona
fumble recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had a problem," Sorgen said of boosterism charges.
"The flap at Arizona is not a problem either. This is something Coach
McBride seized upon."</TE>
<TE>   Fogltance's track record?</TE>
<TE>   An Arizona columnist did an archive search and discovered that
Fogltance had worked several Arizona games in which questionable
calls cost the Wildcats. In 1999, Fogltance's crew flagged Arizona
for 16 penalties in a close loss at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is no denying the perception problem. Before Sorgen
took over in 1986, the Pac-10 did not allow officials with local ties
to work traditional rivalries such as UCLA-USC or Cal-Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Sorgen let that rule slide, though, and now all 42 Pac-10
officials are free to work any game. Sorgen says allowing Pac-10
officials to work local games makes logistical sense.</TE>
<TE>   "The scheduling would be atrocious otherwise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for McBride's gripe? You understand why he was fuming mad in
the aftermath of an emotional defeat, but he was wrong to turn a
possible blown call into Oliver Stone's next film project.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is a lot of people involved in college sports attended
college somewhere. Can anyone be trusted?</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hansen, the Pac-10 commissioner, is a Washington graduate. Jim
Muldoon, the league's director of media relations, went to Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Every week in college football, a sportswriter somewhere
chronicles the football exploits of his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   You would think, or at least hope, that professionalism would
trump allegiances in these cases.</TE>
<TE>   Do those two Arizona graduates who worked last weekend's game wish
the Wildcat football program well?</TE>
<TE>   Deep in their hearts, probably.</TE>
<TE>   Did they conspire on a split-second, last-minute call to make sure
Arizona preserved a key nonconference victory?</TE>
<TE>   You make the call.</TE>
<TE>   Pac Bits</TE>
<TE>   This comes as a shocker, but Arizona Coach John Mackovic had
another view of the controversial finish against Utah. "I thought it
was an appropriate call," Mackovic said. "Had they called it a
touchdown, I might have been upset."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, look, Oregon State is back. A year after falling on their
tails, finishing 5-6 in a season they were supposed to compete for a
national title, the Beavers are 3-0 entering Saturday's game against
Fresno State in Corvallis. Five Pac-10 schools are ranked in this
week's AP top 25, but not Oregon State. "We haven't played anybody
yet, so we shouldn't be up in the polls," Coach Dennis Erickson said
of his team's wins against Eastern Kentucky, Temple and Nevada Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson won't need to deliver a pep talk to get his team ready
for Fresno State, which upset Oregon State in last year's opener,
44-24, in Fresno. It was a defeat from which the Beavers never
recovered. "It affected us some," Erickson said. "We were outplayed,
outcoached, everything. We deserved what we got."</TE>
<TE>   Fair-weather Ducks. Get this: There actually are Oregon fans
grumbling about Coach Mike Bellotti in the wake of former assistant
coach Jeff Tedford's remarkable first-year success at California. The
thinking: If Bellotti would have given more control to Tedford, his
former offensive coordinator, the Ducks would not have been in so
many close games last year. Oregon finished No. 2 in both polls but
the margin-of-victory component in the bowl championship series
computers cost the Ducks a trip to the national title game. For what
it's worth, Bellotti's 63 wins since 1995 are the most of any Pac-10
coach.</TE>

<TE>   For the second time in eight days, the Dodgers on Thursday scared
away a baseball game dressed in black robe and scythe.</TE>
<TE>   For the second time, they have grabbed the ankles of the San
Francisco Giants and, ever dusty and ragged, have refused to let go.</TE>
<TE>   Odalis Perez danced, Dave Roberts raked, Brian Jordan owned, the
Dodgers took a 6-3 decision at Dodger Stadium, and now things really
get nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "The emotion gets going," said Jordan, "and it really gets fun."</TE>
<TE>   Nine games remaining. The Dodgers trailing the Giants by one game.
A wild, wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tracy biting his lips white, Dusty Baker chewing his toothpick
to splinters, everybody waiting for the fastball and staring at the
scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   Six months boiled down to barely a week, and who has the edge?</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers board a bus today for three games in San Diego, then
host the Padres and Colorado Rockies for the final six.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants flew all night for three games in Milwaukee, then host
the Houston Astros and Padres for five.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there's a delay, I hope there's plane problems and they
can't get off the ground," said Eric Karros. "I have no sympathy for
them."</TE>
<TE>   But if the margin is one-half game at the end of the regular
season ... then the Giants play a final game in Atlanta on Sept. 30,
a makeup of an earlier rain-forced tie.</TE>
<TE>   The playoff-bound Braves would probably start a minor leaguer, and
Gary Sheffield would no doubt take a nap.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage, Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Dodgers refused to change Thursday's game to an
afternoon starting time--and do you blame them?--the Giants will not
arrive in Milwaukee until around 6 a.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   But for the next three games, because Milwaukee is in the Central
time zone, the Giants will be playing at least two hours earlier than
the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, because of odd starting times, on Saturday and Sunday the
Giants will be playing three hours in front of the Dodgers, so their
game will probably be finished before the Dodgers start.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the last time the Dodgers were in a pennant race this
juicy, this was a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves caught and passed the Dodgers during the final week of
that season by winning games in the Eastern time zone ... and
watching the Dodgers crumble under the pressure of later trying to
match them.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage, Giants.</TE>
<TE>   And so it will go, for the next 10 or 11 delicious days, two
evenly matched teams waiting for the other one to blink.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' starting rotation is doubled over. It consists of two
pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' veteran batting order is wilting. It consists of two
hitters.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers shouldn't be here. The Giants shouldn't be here.</TE>
<TE>   Would you rather be anywhere else?</TE>
<TE>   One game from virtual elimination Thursday, the Dodgers scrapped
back with a couple of the only punches they have left.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose this game, we're three games down and out of the
race," said Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, he was one of those punches. One of their two remaining
reliable starting pitchers blasted salsa music in the afternoon, then
twirled through the Giants at night, surviving two first-inning walks
to shut them down with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   And a complete game, too.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, no weary Eric Gagne, or struggling Paul Shuey, or one-batter
Jesse Orosco, or some kid from Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Perez didn't have enough to finish but he finished anyway, 119
pitches, three runs, two on a ninth-inning homer by Reggie Sanders,
no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   Said Perez: "Maybe in the end, it wasn't there, but my guys in the
bullpen needed a rest, so they got one."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tracy: "Tonight we found out a whole lot about the character
of this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Jordan, who is proving again this month why his
appearance, coupled with Sheffield's departure, was like trading
bright orange for deep blue.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about Sheffield but his mouth grew smaller in
September. Everything about Jordan is huge.</TE>
<TE>   His three-run double down the third-base line Thursday highlighted
the Dodgers' six-run inning, but that's not even the best thing he
did this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he hit a grand slam that gave the Dodgers the lead in a
victory. On Tuesday, he broke up a double play with the best NFL
tackle in this town in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan has 24 RBIs in 18 September games. Last September and
October, Sheffield only drove us crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is great to get production out of a position where we weren't
so fortunate last year," said Tracy, biting that lip again.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if only he can get that same production this weekend from
struggling Andy Ashby and Omar Daal.</TE>
<TE>   "You're hearing questions about this team--do they have the
resiliency?" Tracy said. "A lot of that has to with Andy and Omar
stepping up."</TE>
<TE>   Too late to step back. Too late to hide. Nine games, nine lives,
last breaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Tracy, cracking a tiny smile. "Fun."</TE>

<HD>Q &amp; A WITHSERENA WILLIAMS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Early Morning with Serena Williams" followed "Late Night with Serena
and Venus Williams" at the U.S. Open. Less than 12 hours after Serena
Williams dethroned her big sister Venus in the Open final earlier
this month, she was ushered into a post-victory interview in a
conference room at a midtown Manhattan hotel.</LD>
<LD>   If this was all becoming painfully routine--Serena had done the
same after beating Venus in the French Open and Wimbledon finals--she
didn't let on.</LD>
<LD>   "All I need is four hours to function," Williams said. A few
verbal ground strokes to warm up and the No. 1-ranked player was off
and ready to talk about her form, her fashion (a tight-fitting black
catsuit became a national talking point) and her future (acting,
perhaps?).</LD>
<TE>   By winning her third consecutive Grand Slam tournament, Serena
became the first player to do so since Steffi Graf took the French
Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1996. More and more, Graf, not
Venus, is the standard Serena is chasing.</TE>
<TE>   Should Williams win the Australian Open in January, it would be
four consecutive Grand Slam tournament titles, a Serena Slam of
sorts. The last to do so, again, was Graf, who won the final three
Grand Slam events in 1993 and opened 1994 by winning the first major,
the Australian Open. Serena, who will turn 21 on Thursday, will be
playing in the season-ending WTA Championships at Staples Center in
November before the Australian Open in January.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Has the reality of your accomplishments--four career
Grand Slam titles by age 20 and the No. 1 ranking--settled in yet?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: "It feels real. I've done a lot this year. I've had a
decent year. I've made my goals. I'll probably be player of the year.
But the match was so late, everything was so late."</TE>
<TE>   Q: The USTA was criticized for the late start of the women's Open
final, which followed the Miami-Florida college football game on CBS.
Which meant the first ball was not hit until nearly 9:30 p.m. in New
York. Did the lateness bother you?</TE>
<TE>   A: "It didn't make me mad. But it was just kind of strange. I
understand they had to put the football on. I had a meeting with the
president of CBS [Les Moonves] when I was in L.A. And football, last
year, women's tennis [the U.S. Open final] had more ratings when they
went opposite each other. And there was such a difference--they had
to put the football on earlier."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did you have a meeting with the network executive?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I'm trying to get into some shows. I'm a struggling actress.
My Hollywood manager [Jill Smoller] set me up with a meeting with the
president of CBS, so it was good. He was really nice. You get to see
the [network] schedule of everything."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have an ideal acting role in mind?</TE>
<TE>   A: "Do you remember the movie 'Clash of the Titans'? I really
think they should do a remake of the movie and I would like to play
the princess. I don't want to do it because it's a trend and
everybody likes doing it. I've always liked acting. I think it's
cool. We'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You said you've been working with an acting coach. Can you cry
on cue?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I'm not bad. Believe it or not. You'd be surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you handle the additional attention that comes with
being the No. 1 player in the world?</TE>
<TE>   A: "It's not that I really enjoy it, it's that I don't mind it. I
think Venus minds it more than me, but I definitely do enjoy it.
Maybe she has been in the public eye a little longer than I have and
it's just different. She's gone through some different things and
maybe tougher times and kind of paved the way for me. Now she just
has a different outlook."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: At the U.S. Open, Venus complained of being tired. Is she
simply worn out from too much tennis in 2002?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I don't think Venus is worn out at all. She defends her titles
so well. Had she been playing anyone else besides me, she definitely
would have won, especially at Wimbledon, which would have been her
third in a row, and the U.S. Open, which would have been her third. I
don't think she's worn out from defending or chasing me. I think it
presents a challenge. I have a challenge also to try to stay ahead
and she has a challenge to catch up and pass me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much of a difference does it make that the biggest threat
comes from Venus and not the other players on the tour?</TE>
<TE>   A: "At least I know Venus' game a little better. I feel more
relaxed. When I played Lindsay [Davenport] in the semifinals, I was a
little tight. I don't think I played well. Against Venus, I was way
more relaxed, maybe because I felt either way, we'd both walk home
winners. I really wanted to get to that point. I know Lindsay and
[Amelie] Mauresmo wanted to stop us. They did a good job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How have you changed in terms of discipline and focus since
winning the first U.S. Open at age 17 in 1999?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I've gotten older. When I won in '99 I wanted it so bad. I
wanted it so much that when I got it I didn't know how to keep up the
level. I didn't know mentally how to stay there. It was great to win
at that age. I would never rewind time and say I'd wait till I was a
little bit older. I just think now I've won a lot more tournaments,
I'm just a bit stronger mentally because I realize you just can't win
one Slam and drop off. You have to keep working hard. When I went to
Australia [in 2000], people were really gunning for me, and I wasn't
ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How aware are you of your increased impact on positive body
images for young women?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I used to be self-conscious with my arms a little, 'They're
too strong.' Actually, I think they were bigger in 1999 when I won
the first time but I don't know. You have to be happy with who you
are and if I'm successful with who I am that's fine with me. I always
say you have to look your best, you never know what can happen. I
thought my arms were too muscular, that they were too cut. They're
not as cut as they used to be. Everybody would say: 'You have the
greatest arms, they're so nice, I would give anything to have them.'
So I decided to show them off. I like my arms."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much better can you get?</TE>
<TE>   A: "I think I'm definitely nowhere near my peak, for sure. I can
rally a lot better. My strokes can be better. I hardly come to the
net, so there's so much more I can do, it's scary."</TE>

<HD>Suitors Vie for 'Sunday Ticket'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're an NFL fan, "NFL Sunday Ticket" is, well, just the ticket.
If you have it, all Sunday games are available--except for the Sunday
night game on ESPN--thus eliminating complaints about which games the
networks pick. The games are on successive channels, so it is easy to
surf.</LD>
<LD>   The package is reasonably priced at $179 for existing subscribers
and $199 for new subscribers as part of a fall promotional package.</LD>
<LD>   "NFL Sunday Ticket" is by far the most popular sports package of
its kind. It has been around since 1995, but only on DirecTV and old
C-band satellites.</LD>
<TE>   That may change. By next season, "NFL Sunday Ticket" may also be
available on digital cable. Or maybe on only digital cable.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV's deal with the NFL expires at the end of this season. A
new deal is being negotiated, and digital cable wants at least a
piece of the action, if not an exclusive deal.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations have been going on for several months, but are
intensifying.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL this week brought in Steve Bornstein, former president of
both ABC and ESPN, to help with the negotiations. Bornstein was named
senior advisor to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at an important and opportune time in the area of NFL
television," Tagliabue said. "We must consider our alternatives with
respect to our 'NFL Sunday Ticket' satellite package and the evolving
digital cable universe.</TE>
<TE>   "We will focus intensively on the NFL's strategic choices. Steve
Bornstein's extensive experience and knowledge of broadcast, cable
and new media will be a tremendous asset to us in this task."</TE>
<TE>   So where is "NFL Sunday Ticket" headed?</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident we can make a new deal," said Michael Thornton,
DirecTV's senior vice president of programming and acquisitions.
"Getting it exclusively may be another story."</TE>
<TE>   Digital cable provider InDemand, as well as several major cable
companies such as Comcast and Time Warner, are also after the
package. Comcast and Time Warner own stakes in InDemand.</TE>
<TE>   It's believed "NFL Sunday Ticket" is now in about 1.3 million
homes. The addition of digital cable could push that figure to 3
million in the not-too-distant future. If that were the case, and if
the price were to go to $200, the package could conceivably generate
$600 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   That's about what each of the four network carriers--Fox, CBS, ABC
and ESPN--now pay.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV now pays about $150 million a year for "NFL Sunday
Ticket." Media analysts expect that fee to more than double, which
would mean a pretty good chunk of change for the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   One problem, though. There's the eight-year, $17.6-billion
contract with the networks to be concerned about. If "NFL Sunday
Ticket" takes too many eyeballs away from the free Sunday telecasts
on CBS and Fox, that's not good from the league's standpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd rather the package be supplemental and not dilute the
network package," said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   However, McCarthy said there were provisions in the contracts with
CBS and Fox that provide for monetary compensation.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed that CBS and Fox now are compensated $8 million-$15
million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Increased compensation would help CBS and its parent company,
Viacom, and Fox and its parent company, News Corp., offset their
financial shortfalls on pro football.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing hundreds of millions of dollars on our NFL
contract," News Corp. President Peter Chernin told Cable World
magazine. "If the NFL finds a way to make tens of millions of extra
dollars, we would expect to see some of that shared with us."</TE>
<TE>   A potential problem for DirecTV is its uncertain future. A merger
was announced last October in which EchoStar would take over DirecTV
for $25.8 billion, pending approval by the Federal Communications
Commission. The merger would give EchoStar, which owns the Dish
Network, control of the satellite industry. But EchoStar and its
controversial chief executive, Charlie Ergen, are facing resistance.</TE>
<TE>   There's a possibility that the merger will not be approved by the
FCC, which is expected to make a ruling by early November. If the
merger is not approved, that will open the door for Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., which also attempted to buy DirecTV from its parent
company, General Motors, to get back into the picture.</TE>
<TE>   But DirecTV's Thornton says the proposed merger and the resistance
have not affected negotiations with the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still business as usual," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever way the NFL goes--a new exclusive deal with DirecTV, an
exclusive deal with digital cable or a combination of the
two--options are key for viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, in future years the pay package will become more
available but not to the detriment of free telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Big Hit: 900,000 Buys</TE>
<TE>   HBO reports that Saturday's Oscar De La Hoya-Fernando Vargas fight
had 900,000 pay-per-view buys, generating $45.6 million. It ranks
second all-time among non-heavyweight fights, surpassed by only De La
Hoya-Felix Trinidad in 1999, with 1.4 million buys and $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya-Vargas will be replayed Saturday at 9:45 p.m. on HBO
and again Sunday at 9 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on HBO2.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Update</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lakers aren't saying anything, word is a replacement
for Chick Hearn will be named early next week. Paul Sunderland
remains out front, but Fox Sports Net's versatile Bill Macdonald and
longtime Seattle SuperSonic play-by-play announcer Kevin Calabro
might still be in the running. Joel Meyers, a candidate at one time,
already has a lot on his plate, working St. Louis Cardinal radio
broadcasts and San Antonio Spur telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are apparently determined to stick with simulcasts for
at least another year.</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   Colorado-UCLA on Saturday is a 12:30 p.m. game on ABC, with Keith
Jackson and Dan Fouts, and USC-Kansas State will be on TBS at 4 as
part of a new Pacific 10-Big 12 package.</TE>
<TE>   The TBS announcers will be Ron Thulin, best known for his NBA work
for TNT and TBS, and Charles Davis, a defensive back for Tennessee in
the mid-1980s and an assistant athletic director at Stanford in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Davis left Stanford in 1996 to work in Disney World's sports
ventures in Orlando, Fla., and was the tournament director of the
Disney Golf Classic in 1998 and '99. He is now a full-time
broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Angel fever continues to spread. Tuesday night's 1-0 victory at
Oakland averaged a 4.3 rating with a peak of 7.2. The 4.3 is the
highest rating for a September Angel game since 1998.... Good move by
Fox Sports Net 2 to pick up Saturday's two big prep games in Hawaii.
Long Beach Poly faces defending state champion Kahuku live at 8 p.m.,
and Concord De La Salle, which has won 126 consecutive games, faces
St. Louis High of Honolulu live at 11 p.m. Long Beach Poly and
Concord De La Salle meet Oct. 12, and that game will also be
televised by Fox Sports Net 2.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal is the host of Shaq Jam 2002, a charity concert
at the Wilshire Theater at 7 p.m. Saturday. The event, featuring DMX
and a long list of musicians and comedians, benefits Athletes and
Entertainment for Kids and is being taped for a pay-per-view showing
later this year.... "Survivor Africa" winner Ethan Zohn will be part
of the Galaxy telecast on Channel 9 Saturday night.... KXTA (1150)
station manager Greg Ashlock said in this space last week that Lee
Hamilton of XTRA (690) has the top-rated afternoon drive-time
sports-talk show in Los Angeles. Actually, that is not the case,
according to Tony Siracusa, national manager of Spanish-language
Radio Unica. He says Radio Unica's KBLA (1580) has the top-rated
sports talk show in L.A. with an average rating of .4. Siracusa said
Hamilton averages a .2 rating among men 18-49.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   CBS commentator Brent Jones, the former San Francisco 49er tight
end, got off a good line during Buffalo's 45-39 overtime victory over
Minnesota last Sunday. When the Vikings' Randy Moss was shaken up and
had to leave for one play, Jones said, "The Vikings are now in their
Roberto Duran offense: No Moss."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>In 1995, Job Was Barnett's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Dalis made Gary Barnett an offer that--after considerable
waffling--he decided he could refuse.</LD>
<LD>   Barnett was the hottest commodity in coaching in 1995, leading
long-struggling Northwestern to a 10-1 regular-season record. But
after losing to USC in the Rose Bowl, he decided to stay at
Northwestern.</LD>
<LD>   So Dalis, then the UCLA athletic director, turned to assistant Bob
Toledo and offered him the chance to succeed Terry Donahue as Bruin
coach.</LD>
<TE>   Seven years later, Barnett will make his way back to the Rose
Bowl--as coach of disappointing Colorado. He downplayed his long-ago
decision, preferring to focus on getting his current team to rebound
from an embarrassing loss to USC.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very serious [about the UCLA offer], but I really don't
want to talk about that this week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dalis offered Barnett $500,000 a year. Northwestern countered with
a similar offer but with far more security, a 12-year deal worth $6
million.</TE>
<TE>   Dalis even brought in UCLA Chancellor Charles Young to meet with
Barnett the day before the Rose Bowl. The coach asked to wait until
after the game, and the more time he had to think, the greater the
pull became to remain at Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   "As the discussion went on, I could sense Dr. Young really wanting
me to take the job," Barnett wrote in an autobiography published
after the season. "Everything they said was terrific, everything they

<LD>Hershel Dennis expects to return a kickoff against No. 25 Kansas
State on Saturday and show, for the first time, the open-field speed
and moves that made him one of the most highly recruited players in
the nation last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis, a freshman running back, returned seven kicks for
touchdowns at Long Beach Poly High.</LD>
<LD>   Auburn did not kick the ball to Dennis in the opener. Last week
against Colorado, he fielded a kickoff deep in the end zone and took
a knee for a touchback.</LD>
<TE>   "I should be getting one this week," Dennis said Thursday. "I do
what I do best with the ball in my hands, starting off in open space
where I can make things happen. I can't wait till I get my first
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis gained 32 yards in five carries and caught a pass for four
yards in last Saturday's 40-3 victory at Colorado. Coach Pete Carroll
and offensive coordinator Norm Chow see Dennis as the heir apparent
to senior Malaefou MacKenzie, a running back who catches the ball out
of the backfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that role, especially following Malaefou," Dennis said.
"That's what NFL teams are looking for too. They like that Marshall
Faulk type.</TE>
<TE>   "I just try to have a good practice every day. Whatever comes at
me, I'm going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State quarterback Ell Roberson, who rushed for 119 yards in
21 carries in last season's 10-6 victory over USC, did not play last
week against Eastern Illinois because of an undisclosed injury. Marc
Dunn started and helped the Wildcats to a 63-13 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn and Roberson are expected to play Saturday, and Carroll said
he would not be surprised if Roberson plays another position such as
wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Gregg Guenther, who caught three passes and recovered a
fumble against Colorado, said he hopes to build on that performance
by improving his blocking against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "My blocking against Colorado wasn't as bad as I thought," he
said. "But that's an area that is always going to be a challenge for
me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Sultan McCullough took limited repetitions during
practice and wore an icepack on his left foot afterward. McCullough,
who gained 110 yards against Colorado and scored on a 62-yard run,
said a teammate accidentally stepped on his foot. McCullough said he
would be at full strength for Kansas State.... Defensive tackle Shaun
Cody has a sprained right ankle but will play Saturday. Carroll said
Mike Patterson, Bernard Riley and LaJuan Ramsey could be rotated
between tackle and nose tackle if Cody is slowed.... Senior Zach
Wilson will start at right guard, Carroll said.... David Davis, who
missed an extra-point attempt and had a field-goal and extra-point
try blocked against Colorado, held off a challenge from Ryan Killeen
and enters the Kansas State game as the No.1 placekicker.</TE>

<LD>There could very well be a logjam on the front end in today's Pio
Pico Stakes, which would play right into the hands of the long-fused
Warren's Whistle and Fairplex's all-time leading rider, Martin
Pedroza.</LD>
<LD>   If you draw a line through her last grass effort, Warren's Whistle
looks to hold the edge in the feature. Two races back, she was
runner-up to Kalooken Queen, who would have this field for breakfast,
and go back another and she's coming home with a rush to take the
Fantastic Girl at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   An earner of $557,000 in her career, the 4-year-old is already a
stakes winner over this course, so you know she can handle the tight
bends.</LD>
<TE>   Song Of Summer is another late runner who would benefit by some
fast early fractions. Craig Dollase conditions the daughter of
General Meeting, who is looking for her first victory of the year but
has been facing tougher and figures to get a much better set-up this
time around.</TE>
<TE>   Early speed is always important here, and the speed of the speed
may be on the rail in the form of Miss Santa Ana, who is rarely
outrun to any of the early poles.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Vladimir Cerin's protege has won three of her seven tries,
and even though she has never raced at Fairplex, she's awfully nimble
and the feeling is she will take just fine to the new surroundings.
Her main problem will be the two or three others in the field who
have a similar style. If this filly can shake loose to that first
turn, however, she could pull off a theft.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Streakn Cheynne 2. Ms. Johnson 3. His Reverence 4.
Sir Bertrando 5. Potra Girl 6. Kahless 7. Rico Fighter 8. World Of

<DL></DL>
<LD>After taking center stage with its gutsy performance against Santa
Ana Mater Dei a week ago, Orange Lutheran High was lured back into
the shadows Thursday by an Anaheim Servite team that showcased a bevy
of playmakers and dominated every facet of the game.</LD>
<LD>   The Friars, No. 22 in The Times' rankings, converted 10 of 12
third downs and limited the Lancers to one field goal in four
possessions inside the Servite 15-yard line during a 34-3 nonleague
victory at Brea Olinda High.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Coffelt was the statistical leader for the Friars (2-0),
completing eight of 11 passes for 172 yards, but he was hardly the
only standout for an offense that amassed 382 yards. Chris Blanco led
the rushing attack with 75 yards in 15 carries, Joel Rubalcaba added
52 yards in 10 carries and Dillon Bedard had 39 yards in eight
carries, including touchdown runs of one and seven yards.</LD>
<TE>   "Just give Servite all the credit," said Lutheran Coach Jim Kunau,
whose team committed three turnovers. "They did a great job of ball
control all night long."</TE>
<TE>   The Lancers (0-2) had a chance to take the lead during their
opening possession after quarterback Casey Whieldon scrambled 38
yards to the Friar five to give Lutheran a first and goal. But two
plays later, Whieldon fumbled the ball. Servite then drove 95 yards
for a touchdown on Bedard's one-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Lutheran got back inside the Servite 10, the Friars
led, 28-3.</TE>
<TE>   The Friars had their share of defensive standouts. Defensive back
Darryl Williams made two touchdown-saving tackles and defensive back
Chris Bibolet made a one-handed interception of a Seth Blackamore
pass in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a contrast from the Lancers' opener, in which they
suffered a 21-20 defeat after a Mater Dei defender knocked away a
late two-point conversion attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks 30, Ventura Buena 14--Chris Owens completed 14 of 19
passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns in the Lancers' nonleague
victory at Ventura High.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, a junior transfer from Simi Valley Grace Brethren who was
making his second start in place of injured Brad Sievert, threw
touchdown passes of 38 yards to Shawn Love and 23 yards to Corey
Mazza.</TE>
<TE>   The scoring pass to Love came after the ball was tipped by Buena
defensive back Cory Ford and gave Thousand Oaks (2-0) a 20-14 lead
with 43 seconds left in the second quarter. The touchdown pass to
Mazza extended the Lancers' advantage to 27-14.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Sandlin rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown in 27 carries
for Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Garfio of Buena (1-1) was held to 86 yards in 22 carries
after rushing for 252 yards and three touchdowns in a season opening
victory against Agoura.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Damien 24, Rancho Cucamonga 22--Daniel Venti scored a
touchdown with 1:25 left in the game and the Damien defense had two
interceptions after that to seal the nonleague victory at Chaffey
College.</TE>
<TE>   Venti rushed for 93 yards in 12 carries and Ian Johnson had 76
yards and a touchdown in 16 carries for Damien (2-0), which lost
quarterback Nick Davila in the first half with an apparent broken
right clavicle.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Cucamonga (0-1-1) had a 22-12 lead early in the third
quarter.</TE>

<HD>Fans Clearly Don't Like League-Mandated Nets</HD>

<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not going to happen, of course, but King fans voiced their
opinion loud and clear Thursday night about the new protective
netting at Staples Center:</LD>
<LD>   Take it down.</LD>
<LD>   The netting, a black nylon mesh shielding pucks from flying into
the stands behind the goals and in the corners, was mandated in June
by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman after a 13-year-old girl was struck
in the head by a puck last March during a game at Columbus, Ohio, and
died two days later.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard enough to see the puck at the other end, and this
obscures it even more," said Mark Benson of Whittier, a
season-ticket-holder watching from behind the south goal as the Kings
opened their exhibition season with a 1-0 victory over the San Jose
Sharks in front of 13,751. "I might as well just go home and watch on
TV. I don't want to come to any more games if it's going to be like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Said Paula Frankel of Porter Ranch, a season-ticket-holder
attending the game with children William, 10, Heather, 8, and Lucas,
4: "Obviously, it's safer, but it's more difficult to follow the
puck. I mean, the puck's black, the net's black.</TE>
<TE>   "But who knows? Maybe it will just take some adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Kings hope.</TE>
<TE>   "The first reaction is always going to be the worst reaction,"
said Kurt Schwartzkopf, the club's vice president of sales and
marketing, "but I think after a while they're going to get used to
it."</TE>
<TE>   If not, Schwartzkopf said, the Kings will try to find them new
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav Chistov, who signed with the Mighty Ducks this summer
after they picked him fifth in the 2001 draft, scored a goal and had
an assist in the Ducks' 5-3 victory over the Kings in a rookie game
at Arrowhead Pond.</TE>

<LD>Tonight's most intriguing question might not be who wins the $15,000
Cerritos Handicap, but whether talented but inconsistent Debut Dasher
can reach the finish in the ninth race without incident.</LD>
<LD>   Three outings ago, he was bumped at the start but went on to beat
Los Alamitos Million winner Your First Moon in a stakes race. But in
two recent derby trials at 400 yards, Debut Dasher finished seventh
after bumping another horse and eighth after dashing wide. And on May
25, Debut Dasher finished third but was disqualified.</LD>

<LD>The Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz has been in a season-long battle with New
England's Taylor Twellman for Major League Soccer's scoring title, a
feat that could go a long way toward deciding the league's most
valuable player. And before the final weekend of the regular season,
Twellman (49 points on 22 goals and five assists in 27 games) is
ahead of Ruiz (47 points on 23 goals and one assist in 25 games).</LD>
<LD>   But should Ruiz lose out to another first-year MLS All-Star, the
Guatemalan striker would seem to have reason to complain.</LD>
<LD>   One of Twellman's goals came on a play in which the forward never
touched the ball. Rather, in the Revolution's 2-0 victory over Dallas
on May 11, Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan was "pressured" by Twellman on
a corner kick by Ted Chronopoulos and, in the ensuing collision
between Twellman and Jordan, Jordan accidentally punched the ball
into the net.</LD>
<TE>   Critics have charged that either Chronopoulos should have been
credited with the score or Jordan should have been given an own-goal.
Some have even said that the goal should have been disallowed and
Twellman charged with a penalty for interference.</TE>
<TE>   Stone Cold Move</TE>
<TE>   A Rolling Stones concert at the Meadowlands has forced the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars out of their home stadium for the MLS Cup
playoffs, should they qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials announced Thursday that the MetroStars would play
postseason matches at Riverfront Stadium, a 6,200-seat baseball park
in Newark, N.J., home of the independent Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "We get the incredible, intimate atmosphere of Riverfront Stadium,
which should provide us with the perfect environment as we try to
bring home the MLS Cup." MetroStar President Nick Sakiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   The MetroStars averaged 18,155 for their 14 home league games and
Riverfront Stadium will be expanded with temporary seating to at
least 8,500.</TE>
<TE>   Currently in sixth place in the playoff table, the MetroStars can
clinch a spot with a victory Saturday at New England, although they
could also get in with a loss and help in other games.</TE>
<TE>   Pachuca's Surprise</TE>
<TE>   Walter Silvani's 48th-minute goal gave upstart Pachuca a 1-0
victory over Morelia in the final of the CONCACAF Champions Cup late
Wednesday at Mexico City's Estadio Azul, giving Pachuca its first
continental championship.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in the tournament's 40-year history that two
teams from the same country met in a championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Morelia, which is in third place in the Mexican first division's
opening tournament, was a decided favorite over Pachuca, which is
tied for 19th place in the 20-team league.</TE>
<TE>   Man U Update</TE>
<TE>   Despite UEFA's edict that Maccabi Haifa play its home European
Champions Cup matches in Cyprus because of security concerns in the
Middle East, Manchester United Coach Sir Alex Ferguson said he was
willing to take his team to Israel for the return game.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't affect us," Ferguson said after his team defeated
Haifa, 5-2, Wednesday night at Old Trafford.</TE>
<TE>   But then again, Ferguson was confused earlier in the week as to
which Israeli club was preparing to play.</TE>
<TE>   At a pre-match news conference, in which he spoke on his upcoming
opponent, Ferguson referred to the accomplishments of Hapoel Tel
Aviv, not Haifa, the first Israeli club to make it this far in the
competition.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Valley's Mason Knows Score</HD>

<LD>Something extraordinary happened to Santa Ana Valley High running
back Cliff Mason last March.</LD>
<LD>   He scored 1,510 on the SAT, the highest of any junior on campus.
Making his accomplishment more startling was that he's a C student.</LD>
<LD>   "There are A students who can't get that score," counselor Kathy
Ochoa said.</LD>
<TE>   College football recruiters dropping by last spring rolled their
eyes in disbelief. They wondered how a 17-year-old can earn a perfect
score of 800 on the math portion of the SAT but get a C in chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more me not doing my work," Mason said.</TE>
<TE>   If Mason's grade-point average weren't 2.6 beginning his senior
year, he might have every Ivy League school recruiting him for
football, considering he rushed for 1,106 yards last season and runs
40 yards in 4.5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I shut the door to a lot of options," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the doors could be reopening. He rushed for 227 yards in a
16-14 season-opening loss to Anaheim Canyon last week. And Mason is
vowing to raise his GPA this year.</TE>
<TE>   Mason never loses his commitment in football. Optional practices
aren't optional. During the summer, he was running up and down stairs
at a local junior college, running hills in Costa Mesa, running along
the sand of Huntington Beach and lifting weights at school.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 feet 10 and 195 pounds, he's the strongest player at Santa
Ana Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I know if I apply myself, I can achieve any of my goals," Mason
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mason's father, Cliff Sr., an ex-Marine, spent years lecturing his
son on the importance of good grades to help him reach college. When
Cliff Sr. saw his son's SAT score, it validated his belief in his
son's academic potential.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty frustrating," Cliff Sr. said. "I know he can do it.
He's done it in the past. He thinks football alone will do it for
him. Hopefully, he'll realize."</TE>
<TE>   Mason had motivation for the SAT. He made a lunch bet with Ochoa
that he'd score at least 1,400 and studied far more extensively than
he did for any of his regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   "He studied like there was no tomorrow," Ochoa said.</TE>
<TE>   When the results arrived by mail, Mason wasn't surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "When I took the test, it didn't seem too difficult," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa has Mason's SAT score framed in her office.</TE>
<TE>   "I still owe him lunch," she said. "I know how much he eats. I'm
going to have to take him when I get paid."</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Sr. is hoping his son's success with the SAT will encourage
him to focus more on school.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball is in his court," he said. "I've said all I can say and
done all I can do. You can only preach the sermon so many times."</TE>
<TE>   Mason is filled with untapped potential, both in football and in
the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to earn a 3.5 GPA in his senior year to help his college
chances. He wants to become a commercial pilot if a football career
doesn't work out. There are subtle signs he's starting to understand
what is required to reach his goals.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he'd tell freshmen about high school, he said, "I'd
have a lot to say. I'd tell them, 'Grades are more important than
anything else. Pay attention to your studies.' If I had done that
since freshman year, we wouldn't be discussing this."</TE>

<LD>Girls schools--The review of Karen Stabiner's "All Girls" in the

daughter at Marlborough while she was doing research about the school
for her book. In fact, Stabiner's daughter did not start classes at
Marlborough until the fall of 2001, several months after the book had
been completed.</LD>

<HD>Questions Linger Over N. Korean Kidnappings</HD>
<DH>Asia: Many relatives of the Japanese victims call
Pyongyang's revelations a cruel hoax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>New details are emerging about the fate of a dozen Japanese citizens
who the North Koreans acknowledged this week were abducted in the
1970s and 1980s. But many in Japan still wonder: Are the revelations
true?</LD>
<LD>   Megumi Yokota, who vanished in 1977 at age 13 on the way home from
badminton practice in northwestern Japan, is said to have died in
North Korea 10 years ago. A 15-year-old identified as her North
Korean daughter says she still has the racket her mother ostensibly
carried the day of the abduction.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the victims reportedly died on the same November day in
1988, at ages 28 and 31, five and eight years after their abductions.
Other kidnapping victims also died young: one in his 20s, the rest in
their 30s and 40s.</LD>
<TE>   And the man identified as Kaoru Hasuike, one of the four victims
reportedly still alive, says he isn't sure he wants to return to
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on Tuesday admitted for the first
time that his nation kidnapped at least 12 Japanese citizens. He gave
the news to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during a summit
in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.</TE>
<TE>   The families learned Tuesday only if their relatives were alive or
dead--and if they'd had children in North Korea. Most of the details
to emerge since have been supplied by Japan's Foreign Ministry and
have been slow in coming. In addition, a senior Japanese diplomat met
in Pyongyang with Yokota's purported 15-year-old daughter and
Hasuike.</TE>
<TE>   But many relatives of the kidnapping victims have branded the
details a cruel hoax, more lies from a North Korean regime that for
years denied the abductions.</TE>
<TE>   Kim revealed that North Korean agents had abducted the Japanese
while relations between the two countries were, as he put it,
"abnormal." The victims were used for two purposes, Kim indicated: to
provide false identities and to teach their language to spies who
with Japanese identities could more easily infiltrate South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   How at least eight victims died still isn't known. North Korea has
said only that they succumbed to "disease or disaster."</TE>
<TE>   The victims' survivors in Japan minced no words in belittling the
actions of their own government, not only for failing to take enough
action in the past but also for bungling the present. Authorities
didn't bring to North Korea photographs of those said to be alive, or
DNA samples, or even ask the Japanese families about physical
characteristics that might help verify identities.</TE>
<TE>   Without those, there's little left other than North Korea's word.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't take any sort of recording device, no cameras, no
video cameras, nothing," charged Hasuike's brother, Toru. "All the
ministry did was transmit North Korea's information."</TE>
<TE>   Tsutomu Nishioka, a spokesman for the National Assn. for the
Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea, said he suspects that
most or all of the victims are alive. "But now there's a real risk
that Megumi Yokota and others may be killed for real."</TE>
<TE>   The long-standing support group includes 25 civic organizations
and families of 70 people also thought to have been kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the issue is so highly charged here that it could cloud
negotiations set to begin next month toward establishing formal ties
between Japan and North Korea. Kim and Koizumi agreed to the talks as
part of a declaration issued at the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe of Japan told the Daily
Yomiuri newspaper that allowing the four surviving victims to return
home would be a prerequisite for resuming talks. But a spokeswoman
for the prime minister said Koizumi plans to start the talks
regardless. "We first have to respect the will of the families and
those still alive in North Korea," said Misako Kaji, the spokeswoman.
"The government is trying to help and facilitate visits."</TE>
<TE>   Visas are being arranged for any relatives who want to visit North
Korea, though it isn't clear when the surviving abductees might be
able to visit Japan.</TE>
<TE>   How and when the details of the kidnappings and deaths were
released also have become controversial. News reports Thursday night
suggested that Koizumi may not have known until just before he signed
the summit declaration exactly how many of the kidnapping victims had
died. Whether that was because his own bureaucrats or Kim had held
back the information isn't clear.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi said Thursday that he was "shocked by the number of
deaths."</TE>
<TE>   Yasuo Fukuda, chief Cabinet minister, acknowledged that the
government was still withholding some of the information North Korea
had provided, saying it was important to confirm it before going
public.</TE>
<TE>   Megumi Yokota's father, Shigeru, said the Foreign Ministry told
him that Japanese diplomat Kazuyoshi Umemoto met in North Korea with
the teenager said to be Megumi's daughter, Kim Hae Gyong. The teen
reportedly said that she knew her mother as Ryu Myong Suk and that
the woman had married a North Korean.</TE>
<TE>   According to Shigeru Yokota, the girl reportedly said, "My mother
loved me, and we often went swimming and hiking." She said she heard
that her mother "had died of disease, but I don't really know." She
didn't know where her mother was buried or her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The teen brought along a photo that showed a woman about 20 years
of age with a badminton racket and racket cover.</TE>
<TE>   Hasuike and Yukiko Okudo, abducted at the same time while on a
date in July 1978, reportedly are now married with a 22-year-old
daughter and an 18-year-old son who do not know that their parents
are Japanese, Toru Hasuike, the brother, was told.</TE>
<TE>   The long-missing Hasuike is said to be working as an interpreter
at a North Korean research institute. By one account, he initially
had trouble speaking Japanese but warmed up as the conversation
continued. He remembered the birthdays and names of his parents as
well as the names of his elementary school and high school.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he wanted to return to Japan, he reportedly said: "I have
two kids here, and I'm not sure if I would have to go back to Japan
forever. But I would like to consult my wife."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bomber Kills 5 in Tel Aviv; Arafat Besieged</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel seeks the surrender of 19 militants it says
are in Ramallah compound. Two Palestinians are reported slain in
Gaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>For the second time in as many days, a Palestinian suicide bomber
blew himself up Thursday, this time killing five Israelis on a
passenger bus here during the busy Sukkot holiday-eve lunch hour.
Israel retaliated by laying siege to the headquarters of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and infantry invaded
Arafat's compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah after dark
Thursday. Witnesses reported fierce machine-gun battles and
explosions at the compound as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in
Jerusalem summoned his Cabinet for an emergency session and some
ministers demanded that Arafat be captured and exiled.</LD>
<LD>   At least two of Arafat's bodyguards were reported wounded. Tanks
took up positions in the parking lot and outside the front door of
Arafat's battered compound, where the Palestinian Authority president
has been holed up almost continuously for months.</LD>
<TE>   Israel said it was attempting to "isolate" Arafat and was
demanding the surrender of 19 militants who it claimed had taken
refuge in Arafat's office. Early today, eight men were seen handing
themselves over as Israeli bulldozers flattened trailers used by
Palestinian security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships, meanwhile, blasted their
way across the northern Gaza Strip early today. Palestinians reported
at least two people, a man and a woman, killed and several houses
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's suicide bombing, more than 70 people were injured,
several critically, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with another attack less than 24 hours earlier, it shattered
a 45-day hiatus in the suicide bombings that have terrorized Israelis
and again set the nation on tenterhooks. Thursday's blast on Allenby
Street, in the heart of Tel Aviv, occurred outside the city's largest
synagogue in one of Judaism's holiest seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the bomber had just boarded Bus No. 4, which plies Tel
Aviv's restaurant and cafe district, when he exploded near the door.
The driver was killed instantly, his charred body slumped over the
steering wheel as the bus continued to roll down Allenby for half a
block before stopping.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke poured from the limping vehicle as passengers screamed and
leaped from windows. A soldier whose arm had been torn from his body
lay on a sidewalk spewed with glass, metal pieces from inside the
bomb and blood. The fiery force of the blast melted garbage
containers and shattered glass storefronts 200 yards away and two
stories high.</TE>
<TE>   The military wing of the radical Islamic movement Hamas claimed
responsibility and said the bombing was part of a campaign to avenge
Israel's killing of its leader in July. Hamas leaders promised more
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Carmit Ovadia, a 24-year-old secretary, stood at the bus' back
door, about to get off, when the massive explosion threw her to her
knees. Everything went black around her, and pieces of glass pierced
her blue denim halter top.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could think about was I was going to die and I had to get
off," she recalled later in Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, her arms,
legs and back pricked by shrapnel. "I know it sounds selfish, but I
elbowed people to get to a door. I was being trampled. The doors were
blocked. I stood on a seat and someone from outside pulled me through
a window."</TE>
<TE>   Reuven Ragiv was standing on the stoop of his watch-and-jewelry
store at 97 Allenby when the bus exploded before his eyes. The glass
facade of his shop was chopped into jagged shards.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could see of the bomber were guts, spilled guts
everywhere," said the 71-year-old Ragiv, who has owned his small
store for 30 years. He said the relative tranquillity of the last six
weeks was an illusion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never going to calm down," he said. "I've been in Israel for
52 years and it's always been like this. I've seen five wars. The
solution? The solution is to expel them all."</TE>
<TE>   Next door, at the upscale Lotus Book Store, religious burial
society workers cleaned up the human blood and flesh in the shattered
storefront display case.</TE>
<TE>   Yaakov Heyn, who has operated the shop for 50 years, was pausing
in the doorway when the blast brought a shower of glass onto his
head. He was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we find a solution between the two sides, this today is
not the last time, and even if it stops for a few months, it will
start again," said Heyn, 81. "Israel has to withdraw [from
Palestinian territory] and not evade this responsibility with
excuses."</TE>
<TE>   Two doors away, the window of a guitar store looked as if it had
been a practice target for a tank gunner. Nails and bolts added to
the bomb to enhance its lethal potential punched more than a dozen
holes in the glass.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to taking over Arafat's compound, Israel also imposed
a blanket 24-hour curfew on the entire West Bank, home to about 2
million Palestinians. A similar measure has been in place in most
cities since June, in response to an earlier wave of suicide
bombings, but was being gradually relaxed in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   Some Israelis argued Thursday that lifting the curfew had allowed
the new attacks to be set in motion.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute we opened Jenin and Nablus, and opened the road
between them, we saw two suicide bombings," Sharon's spokesman,
Raanan Gissin, said Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Gissin said the government, in its emergency meeting, decided on
"operational" moves in its "difficult and arduous campaign against
the despicable terror led by" Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Gissin would not elaborate, but the operation underway in Ramallah
was clearly the first step.</TE>
<TE>   A senior government official said the purpose was to "isolate"
Arafat, to promote those Palestinians willing to replace his
leadership and to "send a clear message that we are tightening our
grip."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said they were also taking advantage of the
moment to seize 19 Palestinians wanted on a variety of "terror"
charges and who purportedly have taken refuge inside Arafat's
compound. They include Tawfiq Tirawi, the head of Palestinian
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's government maintains that the 45 days in which no Israeli
civilian was killed inside Israel were the result of tough military
action.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, Palestinians have been engaged in a
debate over the direction of their 2-year-old uprising against
Israeli rule, and public opposition to violence against Israeli
civilians has been growing.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians also noted that while the killings of Israelis have
plummeted, an estimated 70 Palestinians were slain by Israeli forces
in the last month and scores more arrested. Meanwhile, they say,
Israel's occupation of much of the West Bank and parts of the Gaza
Strip continued.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, for example, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was
shot dead by Israeli forces in Ramallah when he broke the
Israeli-imposed curfew to buy cigarettes for his father, Palestinians
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah, tanks seemed to be settling
into a long-term standoff with the Palestinian leadership. Israeli
forces have repeatedly besieged Arafat inside his bunker during the
last many months of warfare, but they have always stopped short of
capturing or physically harming him.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil abu Rudaineh, said from inside the
compound that Arafat had once again escaped injury but that the
"situation is very dangerous."</TE>

<HD>German Comparison of Bush to Hitler Irks U.S.</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House expressed outrage Thursday that Germany's justice
minister had compared President Bush's aggressive stance on Iraq to
the tactics used by Adolf Hitler.</LD>
<LD>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the United States
and Germany have long had a strong relationship, "but this statement
by the justice minister is outrageous and is inexplicable."</LD>
<LD>   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin told a small group of labor
union members Wednesday that Bush was going after Iraq to divert
attention from domestic problems. "That's a popular method. Even
Hitler did that," the German newspaper Schwaebisches Tagblatt quoted
her as saying.</LD>
<TE>   The minister called the report misleading but did not deny the
remarks. "I would regret it very much if this matter were to cast the
slightest shadow on my respect for the president of the United
States," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's ambassador in Berlin conveyed U.S. displeasure to the
German government, a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the U.S. and Germany over Iraq policy have been
growing in recent weeks. The Bush administration has been none too
pleased that in campaigning for reelection, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has vowed that Germany will not join the U.S. on what he
calls an "adventure" in Iraq. But the U.S. has refrained from
publicly commenting on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Stoiber, who is challenging Schroeder in Sunday's election,
also said Thursday that he would not let American forces use Germany
as a strategic base for an attack on Iraq if the U.S. took unilateral
action.</TE>

<LD>Despite a four-year absence from Iraq, the U.N.'s top nuclear weapons
inspector said Thursday that his team is armed with information that
will help it look for signs of a clandestine atomic weapons program
if it is sent back to Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The International Atomic Energy Agency's core team of 18 nuclear
inspectors will rely heavily on new sleuthing technology if its
members are deployed to uncover evidence that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein may have concealed, head inspector Jacques Baute told
reporters.</LD>
<LD>   "We're like policemen trying to find one murderer among millions
of people," Baute conceded. "The probability seems quite low. The
group of inspectors is small, while the country is quite big.</LD>
<TE>   "But if you use the right techniques, the chances become quite
good," he added. "A nuclear program needs a large infrastructure.
That's something that benefits us."</TE>
<TE>   Baute said the four-year hiatus--during which detection technology
and analytical tools and software have improved dramatically--has not
been wasted time.</TE>
<TE>   "We've used the last four years to analyze in detail the masses of
data that we had collected" from 1991 to 1998. "We have a plan.... We
are ready to leave at short notice."</TE>
<TE>   Baute said the team has photographs, soil and water samples, and
hundreds of hours of video footage, all of which has been
painstakingly analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not expecting to find a full-blown [uranium] enrichment
facility," he said. "Small-scale operations are difficult to find.
But there are plenty of nuclear operations that can induce leaks and
leave traces in the atmosphere, soil and plants. We can find them."</TE>
<TE>   The team will use two new gadgets: The Ranger, a portable scope
that can detect gamma radiation, and Alex, a compact machine that can
tell if a metal object is a potential nuclear component.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors also will be armed with global positioning systems and
conventional radiation detection equipment. They will transmit data,
still images and video back to Vienna for analysis via a secure
digital link, Baute said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Text, as provided by Reuters, of the joint Iraq resolution the
president asked Congress to approve:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Whereas Congress in 1998 concluded that Iraq was then in material
and unacceptable breach of its international obligations and thereby
threatened the vital interests of the United States and international
peace and security, stated the reasons for that conclusion, and urged
the president to take appropriate action to bring Iraq into
compliance with its international obligations (Public Law 105-235);</LD>
<TE>   Whereas Iraq remains in material and unacceptable breach of its
international obligations by, among other things, continuing to
possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons
capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and
supporting and harboring terrorist organizations, thereby continuing
to threaten the national security interests of the United States and
international peace and security;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the United
Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal repression
of its civilian population, including the Kurdish peoples, thereby
threatening international peace and security in the region, by
refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi citizens
wrongfully detained by Iraq, and by failing to return property
wrongfully seized by Iraq from Kuwait;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its capability
and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other
nations and its own people;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its continuing
hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the United States,
including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former President Bush
and by firing on many thousands of occasions on United States and
Coalition Armed Forces engaged in enforcing the resolutions of the
United Nations Security Council;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas members of Al Qaeda, an organization bearing
responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and
interests, including the attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, are
known to be in Iraq;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international
terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten the
lives and safety of American citizens;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the attacks on the United States of Sept. 11, 2001,
underscored the gravity of the threat that Iraq will transfer weapons
of mass destruction to international terrorist organizations;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the United States has the inherent right, as acknowledged
in the United Nations Charter, to use force in order to defend
itself;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use
weapons of mass destruction, the high risk that the current Iraqi
regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack
against the United States or its armed forces or provide them to
international terrorists who would do so, and the extreme magnitude
of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from
such an attack, combine to justify the use of force by the United
States in order to defend itself;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Iraq is in material breach of its disarmament and other
obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 to
cease repression of its civilian population that threatens
international peace and security under United Nations Security
Council Resolution 688, and to cease threatening its neighbors or
United Nations operations in Iraq under United Nations Security
Council Resolution 949, and United Nations Security Council
Resolution 678 authorizes use of all necessary means to compel Iraq
to comply with these "subsequent relevant resolutions";</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military Force
Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has authorized the
president to use the armed forces of the United States to achieve
full implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662,
664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674 and 677, pursuant to Security
Council Resolution 678;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Congress in section 1095 of Public Law 102-190 has stated
that it "supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the goals
of Security Council Resolution 687 as being consistent with the
Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq (Public Law
102-1)," that Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates
United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and "constitutes a
continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of the
Persian Gulf region," and that Congress "supports the use of all
necessary means to achieve the goals of Resolution 688";</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Congress in the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338)
has expressed its sense that it should be the policy of the United
States to support efforts to remove from power the current Iraqi
regime and promote the emergence of a democratic government to
replace that regime;</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the president has authority under the Constitution to take
action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism
against the United States, as Congress recognized in the joint
resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law
107-40); and</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the president has authority under the Constitution to use
force in order to defend the national security interests of the
United States;</TE>
<TE>   Now, therefore, be it</TE>
<TE>   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,</TE>
<TE>   SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE</TE>
<TE>   This joint resolution may be cited as the "Further Resolution on
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   SECTION 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES</TE>
<TE>   The president is authorized to use all means that he determines to
be appropriate, including force, in order to enforce the United
Nations Security Council resolutions referenced above, defend the
national security interests of the United States against the threat
posed by Iraq, and restore international peace and security in the
region.</TE>

<HD>Confessed Wash. Serial Killer Is Convicted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Confessed serial killer Robert Lee Yates Jr. was convicted Thursday
of aggravated first-degree murder--a verdict that could cost him his
life.</LD>
<LD>   After less than two days of deliberations, the Pierce County
Superior Court jury found Yates' murders of two prostitutes here
involved all three aggravating factors cited by prosecutors: that he
robbed his victims, that he killed them to conceal other crimes and
that more than two people had been killed in a common scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Yates, 50 and a father of five, confessed two years ago in Spokane
County to 13 murders and is serving 408 years in prison under a plea
deal there that spared his life. Pierce County prosecutors refused to
go along with that agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Yates also admitted to the two Pierce County slayings, and his
trial here centered on whether the killings met the legal definition
of aggravated murder, and thus could be punishable by death.</TE>
<TE>   His jury will decide whether he receives the death penalty or life
in prison without the possibility of parole. The penalty hearing
begins Tuesday. "We look forward to the next phase," said Chief
Deputy Prosecutor Jerry Costello. "We want to get the full measure of
justice for these victims."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Roger Hunko said the verdict came as no shock.
The defense's message during the penalty phase, he said, would be
"that one should never kill when one doesn't have to. If you have a
choice between life and death you should choose life. That's what our
society says."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Fasy, a public defender who represented Yates in Spokane,
said: "I'm very disappointed. I'm chagrined, but I can only hope that
a jury will decide to forgo the death penalty. I have every
confidence in his present attorneys."</TE>
<TE>   Hunko and fellow defense attorney Mary Kay High opened their case
conceding their client shot Melinda Mercer, 24, in 1997 and Connie
LaFontaine Ellis, 35, in 1998, but argued he should only be convicted
of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors countered that the murders fit the pattern of Yates'
10 Spokane-area slayings between 1996 and 1998, thus constituting a
common scheme of crime.</TE>

<HD>Environmental Review of Navy's Sonar Testing Upheld</HD>
<DH>Court: A judge rejects U.S. effort to exempt a variety of
ocean activities, including tests that might harm whales, from
far-reaching law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles has rejected efforts by the Bush
administration and the Navy to exempt from environmental review a
broad range of activities, including military testing, that take
place in the deep ocean.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling made public Thursday, Judge Christina A. Snyder said
the National Environmental Policy Act does apply to activities, such
as testing of a Navy sonar system potentially dangerous to whales and
dolphins, that are conducted beyond U.S. territorial waters but
within the nation's "exclusive economic zone." That zone extends 200
miles from shore.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists warned that if the administration prevailed in
the case, it could exempt not only military experiments and exercises
from review but a host of other activities, ranging from oil and gas
pipelines to ocean dumping and commercial fishing.</LD>
<TE>   Snyder ruled, however, that the Navy does not have to submit to an
advance environmental review of its entire planned program of sonar
testing, which consists of at least 17 separate tests of experimental
anti-submarine warfare technologies. The judge did affirm that
"individual sea tests will still be subject to NEPA requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides expressed satisfaction with the ruling. "They found in
our favor. We are very pleased with the result," said Dana Perino,
spokeswoman for the Justice Department. "It's a complete victory for
the government."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has long signaled an impatience with the
National Environmental Policy Act, one of the nation's most
comprehensive environmental laws. The White House has initiated a
broad review of the environmental policy act, which governs projects
on land including highway and airport construction, energy
exploration and timber-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Bush issued an order calling on the secretary
of transportation to speed up reviews under the act of high-priority
projects, such as roads, bridges, tunnels and airports.</TE>
<TE>   Passed by Congress in 1969, the National Environmental Policy Act
charges the federal government with restoring and maintaining
environmental quality, and requires federal agencies to prepare
"environmental impact statements" for any major projects. Contractors
affected by the law have often complained that opponents of projects
exploit the act to cause lengthy and costly delays.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for environmental groups that opposed the Navy in the
case hailed the judge's decision to uphold the act's jurisdiction in
the oceans. "That's very good news because NEPA is the law that
provides the public with the opportunity to comment on federal
actions that will have negative effects on the environment and
requires federal agencies to look before they leap and consider the
environmental consequences of their actions," said Andrew Wetzler, an
attorney in Los Angeles for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy program uses ships to emit high-intensity bursts of sound
off the sea floor. The Navy had acknowledged that one type of sonar
was "highly likely" to be connected to mass strandings of beaked
whales in the Bahamas last year.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental reviews now are conducted for individual sonar
tests, which have been occurring since 1996. Though the Navy says it
takes great care to ensure that no whales or dolphins are harmed by
the tests, environmentalists dispute that and have challenged that
contention as part of the lawsuit. The court has yet to rule on that
matter.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a series of tests the Navy has been conducting from
Japan to the Carolinas to the Mediterranean of its "littoral warfare
advanced development" program. The goal is to find an effective sonar
defense that can be deployed aboard warships to protect them in
shallow coastal waters, where a new generation of stealthy enemy
submarines can lurk. During the tests, ships dangle microphones and
deliver a 218-decibel blast, equivalent to standing next to a jet
aircraft taking off. Many of the midrange frequencies used appear to
interfere with sensitive hearing organs in whales, dolphins and other
marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   There is wide agreement among scientists that high-intensity
underwater sounds can cause temporary or permanent loss of hearing,
abandonment of habitat, disruption of mating, feeding, nursing and
migration.</TE>
<TE>   After one test in the Bahamas two years ago, numerous whales were
washed up dead and necropsies revealed extensive damage to their
hearing. The Navy concluded that one particular type of sonar being
used was "highly likely" to be connected to the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, environmentalists have been pressing for more rigorous
review of Naval operations, including those up to 200 miles from the
U.S. coast. Although that area is a well-established economic zone,
and subject to many U.S. laws, the Navy argued that the National
Environmental Policy Act did not apply to those far-off waters. The
Humane Society, Defenders of Wildlife and Santa Monica BayKeeper
joined the suit against the Navy seeking more thorough reviews of the
sonar tests.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Fleischli, executive director of Santa Monica BayKeeper,
said the finding that environmental reviews of individual tests are
necessary ensures that the Navy will have to provide some
information.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, in upholding federal environmental requirements
outside of U.S. territorial waters, Fleischli said the judge stopped
further erosion of the National Environmental Policy Act. "I think
that's very important. There have been arguments for some time that
it doesn't apply [in the economic zone.] But it's critical to
recognize the need to protect that environ."</TE>

<LD>Federal authorities ordered inspections of more than 1,000 small
aircraft after engine faults were found that played a role in a
Michigan plane crash that killed three in August. The order takes
effect today.</LD>
<LD>   The order from the Federal Aviation Administration covers 1,150
plane engines made by Textron Lycoming, a Textron subsidiary in
Williamsport, Pa. The FAA had previously recalled 400 of the engines
in February and an additional 500 in August.</LD>
<LD>   A problem in the production process caused a defect in the
engines' metal crankshaft, said FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto. The
engines are in planes made by Piper Aircraft Inc., Textron's Cessna
and high-end business aircraft manufacturers, Takemoto said.</LD>
<TE>   The most recent FAA order was prompted by a nonfatal incident in
Colombia in July, Takemoto said. The crankshaft in that engine was

<HD>Unintended Effect of War on Drugs Found in Study</HD>
<DH>Crime: Of inmates in survey, more than half were nonviolent
with no serious narcotics record. Also, minorities made up a large
percentage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than half of convicted drug offenders at state prisons have no
history of violent crime or serious drug offenses, and a
disproportionate number of them come from poor, minority communities,
a study to be released today has found.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy
group that promotes alternatives to prison, offers a detailed look at
state-incarcerated drug offenders, who made up almost a quarter of
all inmates. It is based on information collected in 1997, when the
last federal survey of state drug prisoners was conducted. An
estimated $5 billion is spent each year to keep drug offenders locked
up.</LD>
<LD>   The findings suggest that what critics call harsh sentencing laws
and shortsighted law enforcement policies to combat illicit drug use
have had the unintended consequence of imprisoning mostly nonviolent
drug offenders, many of them black and Latino.</LD>
<TE>   The record-setting incarceration policies over two decades of the
country's war on drugs have been misguided, ineffective and costly,
said Marc Mauer, coauthor of the study and assistant director of the
Sentencing Project.</TE>
<TE>   "If you listen to the tone of discussions, there is more
receptivity to relying less on harsh sentences and more on
constructive intervention," Mauer said. "The question is, will
[government officials] begin to extend use of treatment diversion
options for offenders currently being sent to prison who don't need
to be there?"</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration declined to
comment about the group's findings but defended the government's
policies, saying that many drug offenders do not seek treatment until
after they are arrested.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, 58% of the 216,254 drug offenders held in
state prisons in 1997 had never been charged with a violent crime or
a "high-level" drug offense. Most of those convicted were street
dealers or people caught using or carrying drugs, Mauer said.
According to the report, high-level drug offenders are those who
manufacture, import, grow or distribute drugs to dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that four out of five drug prisoners are
minorities--more than three times the rate of minority drug use in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts were not surprised by the racial disparities, noting
that even if the prison population was cut by 90%, a disproportionate
number of minorities would remain incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a scandal, but it's old news," said Franklin Zimring, a
professor at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. "The big change
is that the number of people impacted has gotten tremendously larger
as the prison market share of minorities has gotten larger."</TE>
<TE>   Mauer said the racial inequalities at state prisons reflects
society's two-tier system in which drug abuse is seen as a health
issue among white, middle-class families who can afford treatment,
but it is criminalized in low-income minority communities that don't
have access to drug treatment and prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   The study comes as more states facing crippling budget deficits
consider scrapping mandatory sentencing laws that critics say fail to
reduce serious drug crime and drain state legislatures of precious
taxpayer dollars. Instead, these critics want states to enact less
punitive measures to deal with nonviolent drug offenders.</TE>
<TE>   The study cites a recent national poll showing that 71% of
Americans favor mandatory drug treatment and community service over
prison for people convicted of selling small amounts of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But federal law enforcement officials argue that a balanced
approach that combines strong anti-drug policies and education--not
just treatment--has proved more effective in winning the country's
war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In June, DEA Director Asa Hutchinson told a conference of British
criminologists that overall drug use in the Unites States has
declined 50% since the late 1970s, with 9.3 million fewer people
using illicit drugs. The former U.S. prosecutor cited what he called
a shift in the criminal justice system to divert nonviolent drug
convicts to treatment and prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   In California, for example, a voter-approved law offering
nonviolent drug offenders treatment options is drawing praise from
state officials who say the year-old initiative has helped thousands
of people.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one-third of the defendants referred to treatment had
dropped out or failed to show up during the first six months the law
was in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Zimring said it's too early to tell how successful these drug
offender diversion initiatives are, adding that the public is
"enormously ambivalent" about drug punitive laws and politicians are
too scared of being perceived as soft on crime to take a stance. The
anti-drug policies of the war on crack cocaine in the mid-1980s, he
said, continue to resonate.</TE>
<TE>   "Once that kind of policy initiative is launched, it's very
difficult to un-launch," Zimring said. "Now we've got hundreds of
thousands of people in state and federal prisons and there is no end
in sight, even though the moral panic that produced drastic changes
in penal policy and drug enforcement law has passed."</TE>

<HD>White House Backing of Farm Conservation Plan Falls Short</HD>
<DH>Environment: Some in Congress balk at the $5.9-million
offer. The USDA requested $34.5 million for technical aid for two
programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House has agreed to supply less than 20% of the money
requested by the U.S. Agriculture Department to support a major
expansion of two farm conservation programs, prompting alarm from
conservation groups and some influential members of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Following a congressional directive, the USDA asked the White
House for $34.5 million this year to hire experts and provide support
for two conservation programs. One helps landowners turn plowed
fields back into wetlands, and the other pays landowners not to sell
to developers.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the White House released $5.9 million for the programs,
infuriating members of Congress who sponsored them.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe I should conclude that this administration does not support
conservation, and this is the way they'll get at it--they'll bleed it
dry by not providing technical assistance money," Sen. Tom Harkin
(D-Iowa) said to Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman at a hearing
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials responded that they are committed to the
goals of helping farmers restore wetlands and conserve open spaces.
The programs will not be diminished by the reduced funding for
technical assistance, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have worked this out in a manner in which we will be able to
continue implementation of programs for 2002 in a manner that won't
be noticed by farmers and ranchers in the countryside," said Bruce
Knight, chief of the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional staffers expressed skepticism that the
government can provide the farmers with the assistance they need to
launch their conservation efforts without more funding.</TE>
<TE>   "Without money to pay for that work, it's difficult to see how
they can get it done," said a Harkin staff assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress also criticized the administration for
exceeding its legal authority by failing to spend funds as directed
by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "The president can delay but cannot defer spending," said a
spokesman for Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee and a member of the Agriculture Committee.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress passed the farm bill earlier this year, it included
$4 billion a year for a host of conservation programs. Because
farmers and ranchers own so much land, they can play an important
role in protecting the environment, and the Bush administration
joined members of Congress from both parties in supporting programs
with that goal.</TE>
<TE>   The wetlands restoration program gives farmers grants to reconvert
fields and grazing lands that were originally wetlands. This provides
more habitat for wildlife and results in cleaner waterways. The farm
bill called for more than doubling the amount of acreage to be
restored as wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The Conservation Reserve Program, which is used to buy development
rights from farmers to preserve open spaces, was expanded by 2.8
million acres from 39.2 million acres.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Boffeli, Harkin's spokesman, said the senator considered the
administration's decision to withhold money for technical assistance
for these programs as a serious problem.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to implement these programs, we need to have someone
from the Agriculture Department to provide technical know-how,"
Boffeli said. "There are hundreds of millions of dollars that
potentially could go unspent."</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups were concerned that Bush's Office of
Management and Budget's stance signaled trouble for all conservation
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's potentially a sign that all the money in the farm bill for
conservation programs is still up for grabs," said Ferd Hoefner,
Washington representative for the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition,
a Midwest coalition of farm and conservation groups.</TE>
<TE>   Hoefner said farmers and ranchers would feel the impact of this
bureaucratic squabble. "They can't deliver the programs to the farmer
without the technical assistance money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Knight said it was premature to question the Bush
administration's commitment to the conservation programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The final judgment will be made by our deeds and actions after
we've had time to fully implement the farm bill," Knight said.</TE>

<HD>Deal Frees Up $275 Million for Holocaust Payouts</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: After two years, panel reaches agreement with
German group on reparations for insurance claims from World War II
era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims
announced Thursday that it reached an agreement with a German
foundation that will free $275 million for reparations.</LD>
<LD>   The pact came after two years of contentious negotiations, which
pitted Jewish groups and U.S. regulators against the foundation, with
commission Chairman Lawrence S. Eagleburger in the middle.</LD>
<LD>   "This agreement is a major step forward for many [Holocaust]
survivors and their heirs who had no readily available routes for
pursuing valid German insurance claims," said Eagleburger, who was
secretary of State under former President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement calls for German insurance companies to publish
lists of likely affected policyholders from the World War II era,
making it easier to determine who has a potential claim. It also
extended the deadline for filing claims from Sept. 30 to March 31, to
give the public time to review the lists.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for survivors have long maintained that disclosure of
policyholder lists is the key to an equitable process because nearly
all Holocaust victims lost their records when they were taken to the
Nazi death camps. Consequently, hardly any survivors or their heirs
have valid paperwork for claims, making them dependent on insurance
companies to search their files and make them public.</TE>
<TE>   The German companies' earlier refusals to publish those lists, and
contention that they had failed to honor various agreements during
the last four years, nearly unraveled the international negotiations.
Nat Shapo, who heads the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners'
Holocaust Task Force, had threatened to bolt the international
commission and seek fines against the U.S. affiliates of the German
companies unless they complied.</TE>
<TE>   Shapo, who heads Illinois' Insurance Department, also strongly
resisted a request by the insurance companies--primarily Allianz, the
largest German insurer--for a $30-million reimbursement for operating
funds they had provided to the commission. The reimbursement would
have come out of money set aside for survivors' claims.</TE>
<TE>   After months of haggling, the companies backed off that demand,
removing the last obstacle to a settlement, several sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The international commission was formed four years ago to resolve
claims by Holocaust survivors and heirs of people murdered by the
Nazis who contend that insurance companies have refused to pay on
life insurance policies written in pre-World War II Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with massive class-action lawsuits in U.S. courts, several
major insurers agreed to join the commission, hoping to resolve the
conflict outside the U.S. legal system.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has been under fire for excessive spending and
failing to deliver compensation. Since its creation, the commission
has run up about $40 million in costs, while only $12 million in
payments have been made, according to a House committee report.</TE>
<TE>   More than two years ago, as the commission foundered, negotiators
for the U.S. and German governments reached a $4.6-billion
deal--funded by a foundation of more than 6,300 German companies and
the German government--that would pay the insurance claims, as well
as slave labor reparations to Holocaust survivors. Hundreds of
millions of dollars have been paid to those who were forced to work
in concentration camps.</TE>
<TE>   But the $275 million allocated in that deal to cover insurance
claims has been hung up over disputes about disclosure of the
policyholder lists, reimbursement for operating expenses and other
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal announced Thursday, survivors will be able to lodge
claims against dozens of German insurance companies, not just the
original five companies that agreed to work with the commission--only
one of which is a German firm. The settlement also relaxes the
standards of proof required for claims.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, expected to be finalized by the end of the month,
was hammered out in talks between Eagleburger and Hans Otto
Brautigam, the former German ambassador to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Praising the agreement, Eagleburger said the companies have an
electronic database of more than 5 million Holocaust-era policies.
Under the proposal, the names of Jews who lived in Germany from 1933
to 1938 will be matched against the database, with results published
on the commission's Web site, http://www.icheic.org.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Frank, a spokesman for the German companies, and California
Insurance Commissioner Harry Low also praised the deal, but there
were voices of discord.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Dubbin, a lawyer for survivor groups in Florida, said the
agreement contained nothing about the publication of names from
Allianz, which issued about 1.5 million policies from 1920 to 1945.
He said that left a void in determining the number of people who have
potentially valid claims. So far, Allianz has disclosed the names of
only 380 policyholders, according to commission records.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources close to the talks said that Reuven "Bobby"
Brown, the key Israeli representative in the negotiations, is close
to reaching an agreement with Allianz to disclose about 250,000
policyholder names that Brown considers most likely to be valid.</TE>
<TE>   There also is likely to be a pitched battle concerning the
allocation of more than half of the $275 million the original
agreement set aside for Jewish organizations to use for humanitarian
purposes. Israel Singer, president of the Claims Conference, a
U.S.-based organization that long has been involved in Holocaust
reparations issues, has been a strong proponent of using the money
for Jewish education and other long-term causes.</TE>

Survivors Foundation, is pushing for the money to pay for current

<TE>   "Money is needed now for these people," said Joe Sachs, a Polish
Holocaust survivor living in Miami. "Survivors should not have to get

<HD>GOP Gains Democratic Ally in Homeland Security Fight</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Sen. Zell Miller joins Republican Gramm on
compromise to end labor dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seeking to turn up the heat on the Democratic-led Senate to approve
President Bush's proposed Department of Homeland Security,
Republicans rolled out a new weapon Thursday: a Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) joined Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) in
proposing a compromise to end a dispute over labor rights that has
sidetracked the homeland security legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, a conservative who earned a scolding last year from Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle for joining Republicans in supporting
Bush's tax cut, took the unusual step of publicly excoriating his own
party for the disagreement over homeland security.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not doing our party any good by feeding the perception
that Democrats are undermining the president of the United States on
the war on terrorism," Miller said at a news conference. "The purpose
of homeland security should be to protect lives, not jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Welcoming Democratic support, Bush called on lawmakers, before
they head home early next month, to approve legislation that would
give him broad power to hire, fire and transfer employees in the
massive new department.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a time of war, and the Senate shouldn't be making it
harder for an administration, whether it be this one or future
administrations, in terms of doing their job," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   But the compromise offered by Miller did not have any immediate
effect in breaking the legislative logjam.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats pressed ahead to try to pass their version of the
homeland security bill, which the White House has threatened to veto.
But with a 50-49 vote, they fell short of the 60 votes needed to
limit debate and bring their version up for consideration. That means
the debate will continue indefinitely. A vote on the proposed
compromise could come next week.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Republicans--who have assailed Democrats for moving
too slowly--opposed limiting debate because it would have prevented
them from trying to fashion a bill more to Bush's liking.</TE>
<TE>   The debate, now in its third week, is a sign of the legislative
gridlock pervading the Capitol as the fall elections near.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to be against a governmental reorganization that the
president says is essential to preventing future terrorist attacks,"
said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center
for Politics. "But now, the realities of Senate and election politics
are settling in. Bush believes that the GOP can batter Democrats if
this bill is deep-sixed for any reason. Democrats are loath to
alienate their labor and public employee allies so close to Nov. 5,
especially when they are providing many of the troops for election
day."</TE>
<TE>   Don Kettl, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who
studies federal administration, said: "In the end, neither party will
want to face the voters without a Homeland Security Department in
place."</TE>
<TE>   One amendment to the bill, approved Thursday, would increase the
maximum sentence to 20 years in prison for a cyber-attack that causes
serious injury and life imprisonment for an attack that causes death.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment for a
cyber-attack that causes serious injury or death.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.)
launched a drive Thursday to amend the bill to create an independent
commission to examine intelligence lapses surrounding the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, a move adamantly opposed by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The homeland security bill, approved by the Republican-controlled
House in July, would set in motion the most significant governmental
reorganization of the last half-century, merging all or parts of more
than 20 federal agencies--from the Coast Guard to the Customs
Service--to create the third-largest Cabinet department, after
Defense and Veterans Affairs, with as many as 170,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is one of a broad range of issues--from bankruptcy
reform to proposals to thin forests to cut the threat of
wildfires--that is stalled in Congress, with lawmakers preferring to
do nothing than risk offending one of their constituencies so close
to an election.</TE>
<TE>   The Gramm-Miller compromise offered Thursday would give the
president the right to waive work rules for national security reasons
provided Congress is notified in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said that the administration needs a "streamlined personnel
system that can react quickly to meet the challenges of these
dangerous times, not one that takes five months to hire a new
employee and more than a year to fire a bad employee; not one where a
federal worker can come to work knee-walking drunk and he can't be
fired for 30 days."</TE>
<TE>   But the initial reaction to the proposal from labor-friendly
Democrats was cool.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have accused the administration of exaggerating the need
for loosening employees' labor rights and say they want to preserve
civil service protections for workers, many of them represented by
unions.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Witiak, a spokeswoman for the 600,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, said the Gramm-Miller measure
would give the president authority to "strip collective bargaining
rights and civil service protections" of employees.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, the chief architect of the Senate bill, said that the
Democratic measure would give the administration all the management
flexibility it needs--something that the White House disputes.</TE>
<TE>   But he said there should also be limits to how much power Congress
cedes to the president.</TE>

<HD>Promise Seen in New Cancer Therapy</HD>
<DH>Health: Patients' immune systems were destroyed and
rebuilt. Few side effects reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ten of the most desperate skin cancer patients have had their tumors
stopped or nearly destroyed by a new treatment that involves
replacing virtually their entire immune systems with specially
targeted killer cells, researchers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the treatment failed completely in three patients, those
who responded had few side effects and several were able to go back
to work or school, said the National Cancer Institute's Dr. Steven
Rosenberg, who led the study.</LD>
<LD>   "Here we are trying to take advantage of the body's own natural
defenses," Rosenberg told a seminar sponsored by the American Medical
Assn.</LD>
<TE>   His team experimented on 13 advanced melanoma patients. Melanoma,
which annually affects an estimated 50,000 people in this country, is
easily treated if caught early but is deadly if not.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the patients probably only had months to live, despite
having had surgery, chemotherapy and treatment with the hormone
interleukin to stimulate the immune system, Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg wanted to see if there was a way to use some of the
body's own immune system cells to destroy the cancer. "The body
recognizes the cancer as foreign, but not foreign enough to reject
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So they took out little pieces of each patient's tumor and checked
for lymphocytes--immune system cells--that actually were attacking
the tumor cells. They grew these in the laboratory and looked to see
which ones were the most active against the tumor.</TE>
<TE>   They then used drugs to virtually destroy each patient's own
immune system. Often doctors do something similar to treat leukemia:
destroying the bone marrow, where the immune cells are produced, and
replacing it with bone marrow from a donor.</TE>
<TE>   The NCI technique, described in today's issue of the journal
Science, was different.</TE>
<TE>   The team replaced the destroyed immune systems with the cells that
had been found to be most active against the tumor cells. All it took
was a 20-minute intravenous infusion. These cells thrived in the
patients, Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do you get the large numbers, but they stay there,"
Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the patients, 97% of the lymphocytes specifically
targeted the cancer cells, and they can last as long as five months,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   One 16-year-old boy had a tumor that started on his knee and
spread through his body, despite treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a volleyball-size tumor in his pelvis. He was on
round-the-clock narcotics," Rosenberg said. "I would guess his life
expectancy was a couple of months. The patient, two years later, is
completely disease-free."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg also was pleased to find that the patients' immune
systems seemed to have recovered fully from the treatment. Two
patients contracted infections while undergoing the therapy, but they
survived with treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg warned that the treatment is highly experimental and
will not be available for years. "Some patients have not responded at
all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he hopes it can be used against a range of cancers.</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Loosen Citizenship Rules for Airport Screeners</HD>
<DH>Congress: Senate panel approves the measure. Many
experienced checkers are noncitizens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two powerful senators joined forces Thursday to win committee passage
of an amendment that would ease the U.S. citizenship requirement for
about 60,000 airport screener positions in the new Transportation
Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, sponsored by Sens. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) and
John McCain (R-Ariz.), would allow most current security screeners
who are legal, permanent immigrants to apply for the new,
better-paying TSA jobs. Honorably discharged military veterans who
are not U.S. citizens would also be entitled to apply.</LD>
<LD>   To be eligible, screeners would have had to be employed on or
before Nov. 19, 2001, the date on which last year's sweeping aviation
security bill was enacted. But passage of the amendment by the full
Senate and the House would still be required before President Bush
could sign the measure into law.</LD>
<TE>   The move provides a glimmer of hope for thousands of screeners at
California airports. Noncitizens, who constitute the majority of
screeners at several large U.S. airports, account for 40% of the work
force at Los Angeles International Airport and 80% at San Francisco
International Airport, according to the Service Employees
International Union.</TE>
<TE>   Those employees--most of whom are minorities--will find themselves
out of a job in the next few weeks if the measure does not pass. The
issue is so important to lower-income California workers that the
American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Transportation
on behalf of nine California screeners in January, seeking to block
the requirement that airport security screeners be U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "About 50,000 noncitizens are serving in the military. To say they
can fight to protect national security but they can't work in
airports as screeners seems unjust," said Ben Wizner, an attorney for
the ACLU of Southern California. "The lead plaintiff in our lawsuit
served for three years in the Army before she was honorably
discharged. She's waiting for the [Immigration and Naturalization
Service] to process her citizenship application. Under the law as it
now stands, she would not be eligible to apply for one of the federal
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Federal security officials at LAX have been working with
noncitizen screeners to speed the citizenship process so they can
apply for the federal jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The airport's federal security director, David Stone, has said
repeatedly that retaining these workers is crucial. About 1,200
screeners work at LAX for private companies; the TSA needs to hire
3,100 to meet federal requirements by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings and McCain attached the provision to broader aviation
security legislation as it was voted out of the Commerce Committee.
That bill would extend for some airports a year-end deadline for
screening checked bags for explosives, and would make improvements in
cargo security.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment was hailed as a hopeful sign by the SEIU, which
represents thousands of screeners, that many of the country's most
experienced screeners would be eligible to apply for federal
positions.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill is relatively noncontroversial," said a committee aide,
who said its chances could be good if it can reach the floor before
lawmakers go home to campaign.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Juror Gets 2 Years for Simpson Drug Search Tip-Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A former federal grand juror was sentenced Wednesday to two years in
prison for leaking information on an Ecstasy drug ring investigation
before agents searched O.J. Simpson's home.</LD>
<LD>   John Acosta, who pleaded guilty in April to obstruction of
justice, also will have to serve three years' supervised release and
perform 300 hours of community service.</LD>
<LD>   Acosta tipped a friend that the friend's girlfriend, Zenaida
Galvez, had been charged Nov. 27, 2001, under a sealed indictment,
and that target locations in the sting included Simpson's home and
the home of defendant Andrew Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Galvez then told someone else in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Just days later, on Dec. 4, search warrants were served at
Simpson's and Anderson's homes, and agents found little or no
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Personal loyalties must never be placed above civic responsibility
or commitment to the common good, especially for a grand juror, U.S.
District Judge Patricia A. Seitz said in sentencing Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   "A grand juror's oath of secrecy is one of the cornerstones of our
system, and any violation of it undermines the public trust and
confidence in our judicial system," said U.S. Atty. Marcos Daniel
Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators targeted Anderson in the probe, alleging sales of
more than 20,000 Ecstasy tablets. An FBI agent testified at a
co-defendant's trial that Anderson supplied the party drug to the
retired football star.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson has denied through his attorney that he received the drug.
He has not been charged.</TE>
<TE>   All defendants in the Ecstasy case pleaded guilty, except for a
Toledo, Ohio, developer, who was acquitted after admitting he bought
Ecstasy for recreational use.</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Camp Scared Terrorism Suspect, His Lawyer Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Buffalo-area man quit training early, attorney
says at a bail hearing for six accused.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>One of the six men suspected of being part of a terrorist cell here
grew afraid after being taken to an Al Qaeda training camp in
Afghanistan and repeatedly asked to leave, his lawyer said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   During a bail hearing, lawyer James Harrington said Sahim Alwan
had asked several people at the camp if he could leave.</LD>
<LD>   He could not get out until a few days after Osama bin Laden spoke
at the camp, Harrington said. Alwan then got a ride to Kandahar.</LD>
<TE>   "I was scared and missed my family. I did not agree with the
mentality of some of the people at the camp," Alwan, 29, told FBI
investigators. "After realizing the crazy, radical mentality of
people at the camp, I decided to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Alwan spoke to the FBI several times before his arrest, according
to the criminal complaint, which disclosed details from the
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the men are flight risks and also should remain
in jail because some claimed tiny net worths while carrying thousands
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have moved to dismiss the charges. The men,
accused of supporting Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network, are all
American citizens.</TE>
<TE>   William Clauss, who represents Yahya Goba, 25, said prosecutors
had no evidence suggesting Goba took orders from Al Qaeda or linking
him to an e-mail prosecutors said was from one suspected cell member
to another.</TE>
<TE>   At their arraignments, U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder
entered not guilty pleas for Alwan and Goba, as well as Faysal Galab,
26, Shafal Mosed, 24, Yasein Taher, 24, and Mukhtar al-Bakri, 22.
They could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Patrick Brown said Mosed's family received
pledges for real estate valued at about $600,000 for bail if needed.
"These are people of rather modest means, I think, who are willing to
risk it all. That says something."</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Rodney Personius, Taher's lawyer, questioned Alwan's
credibility and disputed the claim that their clients ever visited
Afghanistan. Joseph LaTona, representing Galab, said there isn't any
proof his client went except the statements of Alwan and Al-Bakri to
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder said the bail hearing would continue this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the men were arrested last week after a series of raids in
Lackawanna, five miles south of Buffalo. The sixth was detained in
Bahrain and flown back.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. William Hochul said a July 18 e-mail sent by
Al-Bakri to an uncharged co-conspirator uses language similar to that
used by Bin Laden in a December videotape and discusses an attack
using explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Hochul said other evidence found at Al-Bakri's last known
residence in Lackawanna included a rifle, a telescopic sight and a
cassette tape that "asks Allah to give Jews and their enablers [the
U.S.] a black day."</TE>
<TE>   John Molloy, Al-Bakri's lawyer, conceded that his client went to
Afghanistan. He said the hunting rifle and scope belong to Al-Bakri's
father, the cassette dates from about 1980 and refers to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, and the e-mail quotes hearsay Al-Bakri
gathered from an old man and a taxi driver at dinner in Jidda, Saudi
Arabia, in May.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have said they had no evidence of any pending attacks
planned by the cell but became alarmed this month when conversations
among the men intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Two other suspected cell members, identified as Jaber Elbaneh and
Kamal Derwish, are believed to be in Yemen. Authorities say they
believe Derwish is the ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said the defendants and Elbaneh traveled to
Pakistan last year for religious training before heading to
Afghanistan for instruction by terrorists linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>Stronger Acetaminophen Warning Urged</HD>
<DH>Health: Accidental overdoses of the popular painkiller are
blamed in more than 100 deaths a year, perhaps because users don't
know risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too many people are dying or being hospitalized from accidental
overdoses of acetaminophen--the active ingredient in Tylenol--and
drug makers should print stronger warning labels on bottles of the
drugs, federal scientists said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At least 100 people die of accidental acetaminophen poisoning
every year and another 15,000 make visits to an emergency room
because they are simply not aware of the risks, a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel was told.</LD>
<LD>   Although an estimated 100 million people take the drug every year
in safety, taking more than eight extra-strength pills (4,000
milligrams) per day, or taking fewer pills while consuming alcohol,
can cause severe liver damage and death.</LD>
<TE>   "You cannot allow more innocent men, women and children to
suffer," said Kate Trunk, whose 23-year-old son Marcus died of an
accidental overdose. "Death is not an acceptable side effect."</TE>
<TE>   McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Johnson &amp;
Johnson Inc., has already strengthened the warning on the label of
Tylenol and said Thursday that it will further upgrade the warning in
the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Tylenol's label says, "Overdose warning: Taking more than the
recommended dose (overdose) can cause serious health problems."</TE>
<TE>   The new label will say, "Taking an overdose may cause liver
damage," Dr. Anthony Temple of McNeil told the panel. "We think
others in the industry should follow."</TE>
<TE>   The panel also recommended that the phrase "contains
acetaminophen" should be present on the label in large bold type in
all products containing it. As many as 200 over-the-counter products
contain the drug, including headache remedies and cough-and-cold
syrups. It is also present in a few prescription painkillers, such as
Percocet and Vicodin.</TE>
<TE>   Patients combining such drugs can now receive a dangerous dose of
acetaminophen without realizing it. That is apparently how Marcus
Trunk died. He was taking an over-the-counter version of
acetaminophen for pain from a wrist injury, and unwittingly also took
a flu remedy containing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems obvious to me, from a labeling point of view, that
someone should be able to buy something in the supermarket and know
what's in it," said Dr. Nathaniel Katz of New Rochelle, N.Y., a
member of the advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also advised clarifications of dosages for infants.
Several infants die each year when parents mistakenly administer
children's liquid acetaminophen instead of infant acetaminophen
drops. Labels on these products now tell parents to consult their
physician about the proper dose. The panel suggested that proper
doses should be printed on the label.</TE>
<TE>   McNeil has applied to the FDA to make such a change, and the
agency is considering it.</TE>
<TE>   Acetaminophen has been available over the counter in the United
States since 1960. Many physicians and patients prefer it because it
has pain-relieving effects similar to aspirin but causes much less
stomach distress.</TE>
<TE>   But high doses of the drug can be lethal, and many people attempt
suicide using the drug. An earlier FDA review found more than 41,000
emergency room visits every year by people who attempted suicide with
acetaminophen.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide problem became so severe in England that there are now
restrictions on how many tablets of acetaminophen can be sold at one
time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the FDA warned that people taking three or more alcoholic
drinks per day should not take acetaminophen because of the high risk
of liver damage when the two are combined.</TE>
<TE>   FDA is not required to follow advice from its advisory panels, but
it generally does so.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, scientists reported new research on how
acetaminophen differs from aspirin. Aspirin and similar drugs work by
inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase or COX. Ten years ago,
researchers discovered that there are actually two forms of the
enzyme, called COX-1 and COX-2.</TE>
<TE>   COX-2 is the culprit responsible for pain, fever and inflammation,
but COX-1 actually has a positive effect, protecting the stomach and
gastrointestinal tract from acid. Aspirin has adverse effects on the
stomach because it inhibits both enzymes. That discovery led to the
development of a family of pain relievers called COX-2 inhibitors,
such as Celebrex and Vioxx, which do not cause stomach problems.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, biochemist Dan Simmons of Brigham Young University
reported that there is actually a third enzyme in the family, called
COX-3. This enzyme is the target of acetaminophen, he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seizes 7 Taliban Suspects</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. Special Forces soldiers have seized seven men suspected of being
Taliban fighters and truckloads of weapons in an operation near the
border with Pakistan, the U.S. military said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The arms found at Orgun, about 110 miles south of Kabul, the
Afghan capital, on Wednesday filled three trucks and included
rockets, mines and two antiaircraft guns, said Col. Roger King, a
U.S. military spokesman. He called it "a significant haul."</LD>
<LD>   He said the soldiers had discovered literature in the compound
where the men were found calling for a holy war against coalition and
U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations' special envoy for
Afghanistan, said the world body will investigate alleged war crimes
and mass graves where many people died under "suspicious
circumstances"--including a mass grave near the northern town of
Sheberghan where as many as 1,000 Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters
reportedly suffocated in container trucks after surrendering.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi, who earlier had indicated that he did not favor a full
inquiry, said additional security will be needed from the Afghan
government, local authorities and the international community to
enable investigators to do their work.</TE>

<HD>Annan Bows Out of the Tug of War Between the U.S. and Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>It is one thing to be the middleman. It's another to be caught in the
middle.</LD>
<LD>   After working for more than a year to get Iraq to agree to a
resumption of U.N. weapons inspections--and being criticized for the
results by the White House--Secretary-General Kofi Annan has decided
that it is time to bow out of negotiations over the issue and leave
the next steps to Baghdad, Washington and the Security Council, his
spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a week when the Bush administration called Iraq the "greatest
threat to the world" and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein insisted that
he had no weapons of mass destruction, the Security Council is left
to ferret out some form of truth. It's at this pivotal moment that
could be the difference between peace and war that Annan is stepping
back into the shadows.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a question of what is appropriate for him to do," said Fred
Eckhard, the U.N. chief's spokesman. "The secretary-general doesn't
run a government. He is serving them. He can go only so far and then
it is up to them to act. He feels he is at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Annan declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear what impact Annan's decision might
have, though he has been instrumental in the past in mediating
between the Hussein regime and the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   As the head of an organization founded to preserve world peace,
Annan--known fondly here as "the SG" or simply "Kofi"--has said that
his duty is to help find solutions without bloodshed. But some
diplomats say his attempts in the last week to forestall an attack on
Iraq went beyond the call of diplomatic duty.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri surprised the U.N. on Monday
with a letter to Annan and the Security Council announcing that Iraq
would allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their work "without
conditions." What is just as surprising to some is the genesis of the
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, Annan had a meeting with Arab League foreign
ministers seeking their help persuading Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions and allow the return of weapons inspectors. The
alternative, they agreed, might be a war that would destabilize the
Persian Gulf region.</TE>
<TE>   Arab League chief Amr Moussa brought in Sabri. Under pressure from
the other ministers, Annan and Russian officials, as well as the
weight of the General Assembly's majority opinion, Sabri called
Baghdad to discuss a concession.</TE>
<TE>   With the advice of Annan and his staff on the wording, Sabri
exchanged drafts of a letter with Baghdad and eventually came up with
a 1 1/4-page announcement about resuming weapons inspections. While
Iraq wanted to include its roster of conditions about lifting
international sanctions and requiring Israel to give up its nuclear
weapons, the secretary-general and others persuaded Sabri to keep it
"short and simple," said officials who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, after a day of swirling rumors, Annan announced
that he had received Sabri's letter and welcomed it as "an
indispensable first step." Annan's office sent the letter to the
Security Council and, half an hour later, released it to journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The prevailing reaction at the U.N. was that Iraq had robbed the
U.S. of a pretext for war.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time that the media received copies, an aide
interrupted a meeting here to give U.S. Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell the letter. The White House didn't receive its copy until
later, stirring intense U.S. dissatisfaction with the way the world
body had handled the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Several administration officials said they spoke with Annan about
their frustration. They requested anonymity in discussing the issue
because they regard continued cooperation between the U.S. and the
U.N. as essential.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said that though the letter was addressed to the
secretary-general, he should have respected U.S. sensitivity to the
issue and given Washington more time to consider the matter before
releasing copies to the media. His presentation made it seem like the
issue of inspections and disarmament was resolved, they said, while
the White House considered the letter a ploy that shouldn't have been
taken at face value.</TE>
<TE>   Most importantly, they said, the secretary-general shouldn't have
been working so closely with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The British, who along with U.S. officials are drafting a U.N.
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, concurred that
Annan's role should recede at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "The SG represents a very wide range of opinion in the U.N.,"
Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador to the world body, said
Thursday. "If he is now saying the council has work to do and he's
leaving them to do it, I would entirely agree with that."</TE>
<TE>   At the U.N., a diplomat familiar with the situation who requested
anonymity said he thought that Bush administration officials were
angry because "they were trumped at their own game. Someone put out a
media message before they had a chance to.... There are those who are
unhappy that the SG once again thwarted a war effort."</TE>
<TE>   The case of Iraq has required Annan's intervention before. He
helped avert a U.S. and British bombing strike in November 1998, when
Baghdad blocked weapons inspectors from searching the sites around
Hussein's presidential palaces. As the bombers were in the air on the
way to Baghdad, Annan pressed Hussein for a compromise, and at the
last minute the planes turned around.</TE>
<TE>   Annan's influence had its limits though--the inspections regime
completely broke down by December, and as soon as weapons monitors
left Baghdad the bombers struck. Iraq has refused since to let the
monitors return.</TE>
<TE>   Annan has been trying since to break the U.N. stalemate with Iraq
and get the inspectors back on the ground. This year, at the request
of the Hussein government, the secretary-general held three rounds of
face-to-face talks with Iraqi officials, only to have the
negotiations stall on technical issues. President Bush's challenge to
the U.N. last week to confront Iraq or stand back kick-started the
most recent dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Eckhard, Annan's spokesman, said the letter issue is not what
prompted Annan to step back and is merely an example of the perils of
a peacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to get between Washington and the Security
Council," Eckhard said. "He made his pitch for a peaceful,
multilateral solution, and now he'll get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that he will be missing in action. Annan will respond
when asked to help, Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have incidental contact with ambassadors, be on the phone
with ministers," Eckhard said. "He may want to nudge things in the
direction of unity and a peaceful outcome. But this will work itself
out in the coming weeks one way or the other."</TE>

<LD>French leaders said they would try to overturn the release from
prison of former Vichy official Maurice Papon amid angry protests
against the clemency shown to a man convicted of helping send Jews to
Auschwitz.</LD>
<LD>   Papon, 92, was freed by a court Wednesday after serving only three
years of his 10-year sentence for crimes against humanity. The move
angered many, including President Jacques Chirac.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Minister Dominique Perben instructed prosecutors to seek a
reversal of the order because the release could cause "trouble for
public order."</LD>

<HD>Ex-Leader, Official Slain in Ivory Coast Troop Revolt</HD>
<DH>Africa: Plan for forced retirement of 750 soldiers
apparently sparked the uprising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>The interior minister and a former junta leader in Ivory Coast were
killed Thursday after rebellious armed forces attacked government and
security installations across the West African nation, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   President Laurent Gbagbo, who was visiting Italy when the violence
erupted, declared the rebellion had been halted after hours of heavy
gunfights and mortar exchanges left at least 10 rebel soldiers and
seven loyal police dead.</LD>
<LD>   However, military sources said renegade soldiers remained in
control of the cities of Bouake and Korhogo.</LD>
<TE>   Gbagbo's government has been struggling to ease ethnic and
political tensions and calm a restive military in this country, which
has been on edge since Gen. Robert Guei seized power in a coup in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Guei was forced out after elections in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, government troops killed Guei when his car refused to
stop for a roadblock in downtown Abidjan, the commercial capital,
paramilitary police Sgt. Ahossi Aime said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials accused Guei of attempting to retake power.</TE>
<TE>   "Gen. Guei, the main instigator, was killed this morning," Defense
Minister Moise Lida Kouassi said in a national address. "The
situation is under control across the country." Kouassi said a
nationwide curfew had been imposed until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting, which began at 3 a.m., was apparently precipitated
by Gbagbo's announcement two weeks ago that he was forcing the
retirement of about 750 soldiers from units that were known for their
loyalty to Guei.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the men left the army, the officials said, they
refused to turn in their weapons, apparently stashing them for use in
the uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Abidjan said the rebels were armed with automatic
rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Emile Boga Doudou apparently was killed in a
rebel attack on his residence, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalist military sources in Korhogo and Bouake said rebel troops
appeared to be in control of both cities.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels in Bouake said they had killed the local military commander
and abducted the country's sports minister, who was visiting the
area.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble comes just as Ivory Coast was trying to regain its
political balance following several years of turmoil. Gbagbo recently
won plaudits from donors and diplomats for including opposition
members in his new Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling African Union condemned the fighting and reminded
member countries that they have pledged to oppose unconstitutional
changes of government. But many diplomats fear Ivory Coast could fall
into anarchy because of the deep ethnic and religious splits
underlying its political divide.</TE>
<TE>   The main fault line is between the south, mainly loyal to Gbagbo,
and the north, loyal to opposition leader former Prime Minister
Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara was banned from contesting the 2000 poll
because of doubts as to his nationality.</TE>

<HD>Nicaragua Assembly Divided Over Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER and ARACELY ACOSTA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MANAGUA, Nicaragua</DL>
<LD>Nicaragua seemed on the verge of political crisis late Thursday as a
deeply divided National Assembly battled over whether to pursue
corruption charges against former President Arnoldo Aleman.</LD>
<LD>   A slim majority voted Thursday to expel Aleman from his position
as head of the 93-member assembly, a move that would allow
prosecutors to pursue charges that Aleman and allies stole nearly
$100 million during his presidency from 1997 to 2002.</LD>
<LD>   But the vote was immediately declared invalid on procedural
grounds by Aleman and the 44 deputies loyal to him, signaling a
possible constitutional clash between the two factions.</LD>
<TE>   The vote "is absolutely null," Aleman said. "What these
congressional deputies are doing is committing a crime against the
chamber."</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the assembly, Aleman enjoys legislative immunity
from criminal prosecution. And in his position as president of the
assembly, he has bottled up efforts to strip him of that immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Aleman relented to growing political pressure and
appointed a committee to study the charges against him. But he packed
it full of supporters, leading to calls from the opposition for a
protest march that drew thousands into Managua's streets Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition members, most of them members of the Sandinista party
that ruled Nicaragua as a socialist state during the 1980s, arrived
en masse early Thursday morning for a vote in the assembly building
in downtown Managua.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-seven deputies then voted to remove Aleman from his position
and appointed a new leadership committee to oversee the process to
strip his immunity. There was one abstention. The 44 deputies loyal
to Aleman did not show up.</TE>
<TE>   The new committee contains three Sandinistas and four supporters
of current President Enrique Bolanos, Aleman's former vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Bolanos, who has waged a tireless battle to oust Aleman since
taking office, said from Florida that he supported the new
congressional commission. He also urged calm in the face of rumors of
violence between the Sandinistas and Aleman supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a first step, an important step," said Bolanos, who was
in Miami for a conference. "What happened in the assembly today is a
historic milestone."</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Aleman's daughter left the country
Thursday to visit her husband in Costa Rica. Maria Dolores Aleman
Cardenal, who has been implicated in the scandal, enjoys legislative
immunity since she also is a member of the assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman denied that his daughter was fleeing the country. Several
of those charged in the corruption case have already fled the
country. They include Aleman's brother Alvaro; Alvaro's wife, Mayra
Estrada; and their son Arnoldo Aleman Estrada.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman's personal secretary, Alfredo Fernandez; the former head of
the country's largest telecommunications company, Jorge Solis Faria;
and ex-Finance Minister Esteban Duque Estrada also have left the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman's sister Amelia is hospitalized under police custody. His
former tax chief, Byron Jerez, is in jail. Jerez's wife, Ethel, and
his daughter Valeria have also been implicated in the scandal but
have fled.</TE>
<TE>   All have been ordered to stand trial on charges tied to the
diversion of nearly $100 million in state funds to banks in Panama.
The money was then allegedly passed to a foundation controlled by the
former president.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman angrily declared his innocence, portraying himself as the
victim of political persecution.</TE>
<TE>   "The Aleman family has never committed a crime," said Aleman, who
remained holed up at his estate outside of Managua on Thursday. "Our
only crime has been to maintain our leadership positions."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Miller reported from San Jose, Costa Rica, and
special correspondent Acosta from Managua.</TE>

<HD>Singapore Cells' Aim Was Jihad</HD>
<DH>Probe: Islamists arrested last month planned to ignite a
regional holy war, investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Eighteen Muslim extremists arrested recently in Singapore had plotted
to bomb the island nation's airport, Defense Ministry and water
pipelines in the hope of igniting a holy war in Southeast Asia,
Singaporean authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Providing their first detailed account of the August arrests,
officials said they had uncovered seven highly organized secret
cells, or fiahs, that began conducting surveillance of potential
bombing targets in the mid-1990s. Targets included a U.S. naval
vessel and a bar frequented by American military personnel.</LD>
<LD>   The cells are part of Jemaah Islamiah, a group with strong roots
in Indonesia that was discovered last year plotting to blow up the
U.S. Embassy and six other high-profile targets in Singapore using
suicide truck bombs, authorities said. The group is linked to the Al
Qaeda terrorist network, and several of its members trained in camps
in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The newly released details on the suspected cells and their
targets illustrate that the terror group had embedded itself more
deeply into Singaporean society than previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities also said their investigation uncovered
evidence that Jemaah Islamiah is at the center of a regional alliance
of extremist groups formed in 1999 to plan terror attacks. Their goal
is to create an Islamic state that would include Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei and southern parts of the Philippines and Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore, operating under its strict Internal Security Act, has
ordered 31 Muslim men held indefinitely without trial for their
alleged role in the plots, including 18 of 21 suspects arrested last
month. The three others were released. Thirteen men were detained in
December in connection with the suspected plot against the U.S.
Embassy and other targets.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore's announcement came as the anti-terrorism campaign in
Southeast Asia reached new heights. A series of arrests and
disclosures in recent days has demonstrated the close cooperation
among extremist Muslim groups in different countries. It also has
revealed the wide range of targets they are believed to have plotted
to attack:</TE>
<TE>   * Omar Faruq, an Iraqi captured in Indonesia and quietly handed
over to the United States, confessed that he was Al Qaeda's top
operative in Southeast Asia and that he plotted to assassinate
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, according to a
confidential U.S. summary of his interrogation. He admits being the
mastermind of a series of deadly bombings in Indonesia carried out
with the help of Jemaah Islamiah operatives.</TE>
<TE>   * Seyam Reda, a German of Arab descent with alleged ties to Al
Qaeda, was arrested in Indonesia and found to have video footage of
armed civilians training in an area of conflict somewhere in
Indonesia, police said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * Uskar Makawata, an Indonesian suspected of belonging to Jemaah
Islamiah, was arrested Saturday in the southern Philippines on
suspicion of taking part in an April bombing near a department store
that killed 15 and injured more than 50. One of his accomplices was
allegedly a member of Abu Sayyaf, the rebel gang that kidnapped two
American missionaries last year.</TE>
<TE>   * Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, a Jemaah Islamiah member from Indonesia
who has admitted carrying out deadly bombings in Manila, said in a
confession submitted to a court in the Philippines on Thursday that
he was ordered by leaders of the group to buy five to seven tons of
explosives for use in Singapore. He said he carried out bombings with
operatives from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, another rebel
group in the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have for months said that they regard Southeast
Asia as the "second front" in their worldwide campaign against
terrorism because of the large number of Al Qaeda followers and an
active network of cells. A precursor to the Sept. 11 plot in which
terrorists first conceived of hijacking planes and crashing them into
buildings was hatched in the Philippines seven years ago. Some of the
Sept. 11 hijackers held planning meetings in Malaysia in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities said leaders of several extremist groups
formed their alliance three years ago to share resources for
training, procuring arms and conducting terrorist operations.
Authorities said the group was called the Moujahedeen Rabitatul, or
Moujahedeen League, and included a central committee of leaders from
militant Islamic organizations in the Philippines, Thailand and
Indonesia, among other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective was to unify the Islamic militant groups in the
region, with the ultimate goal of realizing ... an Islamic state,"
said the Singaporean government statement. "Secrecy was very strictly
maintained and only the invited senior members of these groups were
allowed to participate."</TE>
<TE>   Cooperation has been especially close between Jemaah Islamiah and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Singaporean government said.
In the past, Jemaah Islamiah provided funds to the Philippine group,
which in turn provided combat training and facilities for Jemaah
Islamiah. At one point, Jemaah Islamiah leaders were allowed to run
their own camp at the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's training base.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore first discovered Jemaah Islamiah's activities when a
resident informed police that a group was planning to carry out
bombings late last year. Singapore continued its investigation this
year, and in August authorities staged another series of raids,
capturing some suspected members of the group who had fled the
country but eventually returned.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence found in the homes of three suspects included photos of
potential targets, hand-drawn diagrams and notes. In addition to the
airport and Defense Ministry building, one possible target was the
pipeline from Malaysia to Singapore that provides much of the city's
water. Another was the island of Jurong, which houses many of
Singapore's chemical factories.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of the bombings planned to make it look as though
the attacks were carried out by the Malaysian government, thereby
causing animosity and mistrust between the two countries and setting
the stage for a holy war, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "The aim was to create a situation in Malaysia and Singapore
conducive to overthrowing the Malaysian government and making
Malaysia an Islamic state," the Singaporean statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities allege that Jemaah Islamiah's overall
leader is Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, and that its operations are
run by cleric Riduan Isamuddin, who also goes by the name Hambali.
Both are Indonesian. Bashir, who denies involvement in any terrorist
activity, lives freely in Indonesia despite pressure on Megawati's
government to arrest him. Hambali is wanted by four
countries--Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines--for
alleged terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Hambali aimed to stir up ethnic strife," the Singaporean
government said. "He hoped that this would create a situation which
would make Muslims respond to calls for jihad."</TE>

<HD>Hussein Denies U.S. Charges in Letter to the General
Assembly</HD>
<DH>United Nations: Iraqi foreign minister says Baghdad wants a
comprehensive solution to its 12-year conflict with the world body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraq does not have nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, despite
Washington's "noisy propaganda," President Saddam Hussein said
Thursday in a letter to the General Assembly, and he invited experts
from any country at any time to visit Iraq and see for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Hussein's comments, delivered by Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri, came as President Bush asked Congress for authorization to use
military force against Iraq, and while U.N. diplomats considered how
to best prepare weapons inspectors to force Baghdad to disarm.</LD>
<LD>   Reading Hussein's letter, Sabri said Iraq wants a comprehensive
solution to its 12-year confrontation with the United Nations to
"bring to an end the cyclone of American accusations and fabricated
crises against Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   While extending sympathy to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks,
the letter accused Bush of shedding "crocodile tears" for Iraqi
people suffering under U.N. sanctions. It charged that the U.S.
president's "lies, distortions and falsehoods" were leading the
American people to believe that Iraq was now the world's greatest
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is pushing war, the letter said, as "a fait accompli, as if
it were the solution ... that would allow American citizens to live
in security and stability after what they had gone through in the
Sept. 11 events." The speech received loud applause.</TE>
<TE>   Despite inviting international experts to search for suspected
weapons "without conditions," Hussein appeared to throw up the first
potential obstacle--and potential cause for invasion--by demanding
respect for Iraq's "sovereignty and security." In the experience of
previous inspection efforts, those terms have been interpreted to
mean different treatment for "presidential sites," wide swaths of
territory surrounding Hussein's numerous palaces. In 1998, the U.N.
secretary-general and the Security Council agreed that those sites
would be off limits to inspectors without Iraqi escorts.</TE>
<TE>   British and American diplomats continued work on a resolution to
be introduced early next week that, at the least, would strengthen
the mandate of weapons inspectors. A new resolution would supersede
earlier agreements involving the "presidential sites," U.S. officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   A previously divided Security Council unanimously agreed that it
would support a new resolution to grant inspectors the means they
need to verify disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   "We all agree that disarmament is the key issue," said Russian
Ambassador Sergei V. Lavrov after a council meeting Thursday. "If
there is a desire for a resolution, we can consider it."</TE>
<TE>   But Russia--one of five permanent Security Council members that
hold veto power--is still resisting a U.S.-and British-backed
resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq doesn't comply with a
broad range of past U.N. resolutions addressing issues ranging from
human rights to black-market trade.</TE>
<TE>   France, another dissenter, may be willing to find a middle ground,
diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said Thursday that a
new resolution was not essential but "could be useful." He reaffirmed
France's opposition to any resolution that would approve military
action without first giving the inspectors time to do their work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a temptation in the United States toward a regime change
at any costs," De Villepin told Europe1 radio. "That is not the
French position."</TE>
<TE>   One potential compromise would be to set a deadline for Iraq to
comply with a dozen past U.N. resolutions, which if violated, would
constitute "a material breach."</TE>
<TE>   If the U.N. invokes a material breach, the U.S. argues, it would
provide grounds for an attack on Iraq and serve as a substitute for a
direct authorization of military force, which many countries are
reluctant to approve. Although the material breach maneuver would be
questionable under the U.N. charter, the United States and Britain
used a similar argument in 1998 to justify a punitive bombing raid on
Baghdad after inspectors were blocked. The language would allow
countries that are wavering to say that they never explicitly agreed
to the use of force. British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock will meet
with the 10 nonpermanent members of the council today to discuss such
options and lobby for support of a tough new resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure to act quickly, the 15-member Security Council met
Thursday with the United Nations' chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix,
to determine how soon inspectors could begin work and what they would
need for support.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said an advance team could be on the ground by Oct. 15 and
begin some preliminary inspections soon after, if a meeting with
Iraqi counterparts in Vienna on Sept. 30 goes smoothly. Although Blix
said last week that proper inspections were not something that can be
rushed, Washington wants to compress a timeline set up in 1999 that
gives the team 60 days to define "key remaining tasks" before getting
approval from the Security Council to begin intrusive inspections.</TE>

<HD>Congress Gets Resolution for Action on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Capitol: Bush seeks sweeping powers, including use of
force, to disarm Baghdad. Hussein, in a statement to the U.N.,
accuses the U.S. of ulterior motives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush asked Congress on Thursday to authorize sweeping
powers--including the use of force, if needed--to disarm Iraq and
possibly oust the government in Baghdad. He also bluntly warned the
United Nations that Washington will act if the world body fails to
ensure that Iraq surrenders any weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The White House sent its draft resolution to Congress as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, in a statement read at the U.N., said his
country no longer has any such weapons. Hussein charged that the
United States has other motives in pushing its case against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. administration wants to destroy Iraq in order to control
Middle East oil--and consequently control the politics as well as the
oil and economic policies of the whole world," Hussein said in the
statement read by Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri to the General
Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration, faced with domestic questions and
international dissent about how far to go in confronting Iraq,
dismissed Hussein's statements as nonsense. Bush described it as "the
same old song and dance" the world has heard since the Persian Gulf
War ended in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The White House's proposed resolution cited a litany of threats
posed by Iraq--from its past use of chemical weapons and internal
repression to the alleged presence of Al Qaeda members within its
borders--to justify the request for Bush to have "all means that he
determines to be appropriate, including force," to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to keep the peace, you've got to have the
authorization to use force," Bush told reporters in the Oval Office
after talks with his foreign policy team. The resolution, he added,
is "a chance for Congress to say, 'We support the administration's
ability to keep the peace.' That's what this is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers predicted that a form of the resolution would pass,
though some may push for significant wording changes. Several
Democrats expressed concern that the White House version was too
broad.</TE>
<TE>   In another signal of his determination to plow ahead, the
president issued a firm warning to the U.N. about American intentions
to confront Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. Security Council must work with the United States and
Britain and other concerned parties to send a clear message that we
expect [Hussein] to disarm," he said. "And if the United Nations
Security Council won't deal with the problem, the United States and
some of our friends will."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution and the president's combative words represented a
White House effort to recapture the initiative in its face-off with
Iraq. Bush appeared to have seized control of the debate with a
speech to the U.N. last week, as he called for the world to force
Iraq to disarm and live up to other international demands. But the
drive for a tough U.N. stance toward Iraq met new resistance when
Hussein agreed Monday to allow weapons inspectors to return to his
country for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   At a White House briefing, a senior administration official who
requested anonymity said the resolution was drafted to provide Bush
with the broadest possible authority. But she pledged that the
president would continue to consult with Congress on the Iraq issue
even after a resolution passes.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution is expected to be voted on within a few weeks,
before Congress adjourns ahead of November elections.</TE>
<TE>   "It will pass overwhelmingly," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). He
predicted that the reservations expressed by some Democrats would
vanish by the time of a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Norman D. Dicks of Washington state, a senior Democrat on the
House Defense Appropriations Committee, joined in quickly backing the
resolution. "I think we have no choice but to have the strongest
support possible for the president's efforts here," he said after a
White House breakfast Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But other key Democrats were either cautious or openly critical,
with many saying the resolution should be rewritten to narrow its
focus.</TE>
<TE>   The draft authorizes the president to use the military to enforce
U.N. resolutions, defend U.S. national security interests and
"restore international peace and security in the region."</TE>
<TE>   "What exactly does that mean? If some Security Council resolutions
are not met, and let's say [the Iraqis] don't return Kuwaiti
prisoners, do we go to war?" asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
"I don't believe this resolution is going to fly through the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers expressed concern that the reference to
stabilizing the region would give Bush license to use force outside
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I am for a generous grant of authority to the president in
dealing with Iraq and Saddam Hussein," said Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.).
"If you are going beyond Iraq, then I think we need to have a little
more scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   A small band of liberal Democrats said they would oppose the
resolution. Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) called the draft "a
nonstarter" and "an affront to the Constitution" because it would
authorize such open-ended powers to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Other prominent Democrats remain wary of authorizing action
without endorsement from the United Nations or reference to the
outcome of renewed international weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long way to go in working through the draft," Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said after meeting with Senate
Democrats. "Many of us are suggesting that we continue to try to
resolve these issues--with U.N. involvement, with U.N.
participation."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell appealed to Congress not to
weaken the language.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very unfortunate if we got a lukewarm response or if
in the next several weeks members eviscerated it and watered it down.
It would undercut my efforts" on the diplomatic front, he said in
testimony to the House International Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Speedy passage of a resolution would not mean that military action
is imminent, because the U.N. inspectors are in the process of
attempting to return to Iraq to search for chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution never mentions Hussein by name and does not
directly call for his ouster, a long-standing goal of the Bush
administration but a sensitive issue in the deliberations over an
international resolution at the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution instead cites the Iraq Liberation Act passed by
Congress in 1998, which says U.S. policy should "support efforts to
remove from power the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence
of a democratic government to replace that regime."</TE>
<TE>   The White House wants Congress to move quickly on the resolution
to add leverage to the administration's efforts at the U.N., where
the diplomatic sell is proving difficult.</TE>
<TE>   At the world body, the administration has launched a full-court
press to win backing for a new U.N. resolution targeting Iraq, amid
signs that Russia and France--two of the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council that have veto powers--are balking.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to sway the Russians, the administration will share
intelligence on Iraq's weapons programs, U.S. officials said
Thursday. Washington is also willing to discuss guarantees that
Moscow's economic interests in Iraq--particularly billions of dollars
owed by Baghdad for past weapons purchases and future commercial
deals once U.N. sanctions are lifted--will not be affected by any
change of government.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia publicly is not yielding. With Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld at his side, Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov
said during a visit to Washington on Thursday that he believes U.N.
weapons inspectors could "easily determine" the status of Iraq's
weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a matter of trust or mistrust," he said. "It's a
question of facts."</TE>
<TE>   To counter Iraq's move to allow the return of weapons inspectors,
the Bush administration charged that Hussein has already begun to
backtrack.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement read at the U.N., Hussein called for U.N. weapons
inspectors to respect Iraq's "rights, sovereignty and security,"
which he has invoked in the past to keep inspectors out of his
presidential palaces and other sites.</TE>
<TE>   "He is already backing away," Powell said in his congressional
testimony. "He is stepping away from the 'without conditions'
statement that [Iraq] made on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Powell added: "He's not deceiving anybody. It's a ploy we have
seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Bush will hold key talks today with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
S. Ivanov to try to convince the Russians of the need for unified
global action.</TE>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix, scheduled to meet the
Iraqis in Vienna the week of Sept. 30 to discuss resuming the
disarmament process, told the Security Council on Thursday that the
earliest he could get an advance team into Baghdad is Oct. 15.</TE>
<TE>   And relaunching the inspections process, which would be carried
out by new teams, could be a lengthy process, the U.S. and U.N.
officials acknowledge.</TE>

<HD>Finalists Offer Distinctly Different Pluses for Hahn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn now faces a choice between two
nationally known East Coast police managers and a veteran of the LAPD
who departed in 1998 to become a small-town chief but returns in
hopes of claiming the department's top job.</LD>
<LD>   William J. Bratton, former commissioner of the New York Police
Department, offers Hahn the option of a proven crime-fighter. Under
Bratton's watch, serious felonies in the nation's largest city
dropped by 33% in about two years; murders dropped by half.</LD>
<LD>   John Timoney, who served under Bratton in New York, went to
Philadelphia, where he inherited a historically troubled agency and
steered it toward respectability. The department was widely credited
with successfully handling the national Republican Party convention
in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Art Lopez spent much of his career at the LAPD, only to leave for
Oxnard after being passed over for chief here. Unlike his
competitors, Lopez's time with the LAPD arms him with a sense of the
department's political history and its hidden strengths and
weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "All three have experience as chiefs, which in some sense makes it
easier for Hahn to evaluate them for this role," said USC law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who helped write the City Charter and
led an investigation commissioned by the police union into the LAPD's
Rampart scandal. "Hahn can look at how they have performed with
regard to the key criteria: How have they done with morale with the
rank and file; what kind of culture did they instill in their
departments; what is their record with regard to civil liberties;
what are their administrative skills, and what is their ability to
work with the many constituencies the chief has to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Hahn has spelled out in increasing detail the
particulars that he is seeking from his new chief. The candidates
named Thursday by the Police Commission each meet some of those
criteria while appearing to fall short elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has said he wants a leader who will reduce crime, reform the
department, boost morale and strengthen community policing. The mayor
also says he wants a chief who will appreciate and accept Los
Angeles' system of civilian oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton and Timoney are viewed as the candidates for major change
who have led large police organizations through periods of stress.
Bratton headed the NYPD after having run the Boston police force and
the New York transit police. Timoney rose through the ranks in New
York City before becoming commissioner of the Philadelphia Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Both are considered experts in policing as well as top managers,
and both reduced crime in the cities where they worked.</TE>
<TE>   Both cracked down on corruption, and both have experience with
negotiated settlements with the federal government--a particularly
important qualification in Los Angeles, where a consent decree
imposed under Mayor Richard Riordan and negotiated by then-City Atty.
Hahn's staff governs many police procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, who worked under Bratton in New York City, once was
considered Bratton's protege. Bratton recommended Timoney to lead the
Philadelphia police.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's strengths include his decades of experience inside the
LAPD, where he previously was a finalist for the top job. According
to his supporters, Lopez understands community policing and the
mayor's desire to make the city's diverse neighborhoods feel less
disenfranchised from the department.</TE>
<TE>   Some, including civil rights lawyer Connie Rice, have argued that
a candidate such as Lopez who has inside experience would in some
ways be preferable for a mayor seeking to make profound change at the
LAPD. Outsiders have not always found the LAPD easy to grasp, and
some city leaders remain mindful of the experience of Willie L.
Williams, who came to Los Angeles from Philadelphia in 1992 and was
faulted for failing to take command of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Greenebaum, who was president of the Police Commission under
Riordan, said he does not know Timoney or Bratton well enough to
comment on their qualifications. But he warned that outsiders with no
LAPD experience could find the going difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "This organization is almost impossible to break into unless
you're really born and bred of it," he said. "All the other issues
get lost in the shuffle."</TE>
<TE>   Without mentioning Williams, Lopez addressed those concerns
Thursday, saying that he knows "how to navigate the politics" in Los
Angeles and that he understands large organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the specific goals that Hahn has set for a new chief, the
mayor and his aides have indicated that he wants to form a strong
partnership with his choice. The three choices before Hahn offer him
distinct alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton is viewed principally as a police executive while Timoney
is considered a cop's cop. Bratton, according to those who know both
him and Timoney, would work most closely with upper management while
Timoney would free up lower-level commanders and captains to make
decisions. Timoney would be in police roll calls and on the streets
while Bratton would be in meetings with other officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton is considered an innovator and an intellectual, while
Timoney is viewed as an implementer who would rather have beers with
officers after their shifts than attend a fancy dinner.</TE>
<TE>   And Bratton, who clashed with Mayor Rudy Giuliani over who
deserved the most credit for New York's record decline in crime,
could cast a large shadow in Los Angeles as well--one that Hahn may
or may not appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, though no stranger to publicity, is seen by some at Los
Angeles City Hall as a potentially less threatening top cop. During
the selection process, he has less aggressively sought attention than
has his former boss.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney's early forays to Los Angeles have left him with boosters,
even among some longtime police adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Yagman, a plaintiff's lawyer who has sued the LAPD many
times alleging police brutality, is touting Timoney as his candidate,
in part because Yagman maintains that no LAPD veteran is qualified to
lead the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have been obvious to any intelligent person that no one
from inside the LAPD culture could change that culture," Yagman said.
"John Timoney is exceptionally intelligent and well-read. He
understands policing and police cultures."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, meanwhile, is seen as an ambitious, affable officer who
rose through the ranks of the LAPD with little acrimony. He started
as a patrol officer in 1971, serving in North Hollywood. Over the
years, he commanded a number of LAPD functions, including Central
Bureau in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and others have stressed that the chief must be someone who
will follow the direction given by the mayor and the Police
Commission. That chief must contend with the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney showed little sophistication for those issues during his
recent meetings with top city officials. Bratton, who has served as a
consultant for the LAPD, has greater knowledge of the department and
its relationship to the city's civilian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But neither of the East Coast candidates have the hands-on sense
of those nuances that Lopez could be expected to bring with him to
office.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, in fact, once served on an LAPD disciplinary board that
heard charges of misconduct against a police officer named Dennis
Zine. Zine now sits on the City Council as one of its 15 members.</TE>

<HD>No LAPD Insiders Make List of Three Finalists for Chief</HD>
<DH>Police: Mayor Hahn is given a choice between New York,
Boston and Oxnard candidates. Many in department express
disappointment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission on passed over all contenders from
the LAPD and chose three outsiders Thursday as its top candidates to
become the city's next police chief--former New York Police
Commissioner William Bratton, Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez and
former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney.</LD>
<LD>   Commission President Rick Caruso, who led the panel in its
five-month nationwide search, said he and his colleagues opted for
outsiders because Los Angeles "is a city at the crossroads, at a
historic turning point."</LD>
<LD>   The three finalists are "proven leaders, each willing to listen
and to lead," he said. "They understand the challenges ahead of us
and have been tested and recognized for their distinguished record in
police work."</LD>
<TE>   The list was forwarded to Mayor James K. Hahn, who will make the
final choice, subject to council confirmation. He called the
selections "outstanding," and said he was "confident that the next
chief is on this list."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn played a strong role in the selection process, dispatching
his top aides to sleuth out the backgrounds of outside contenders. He
will begin interviewing candidates on Monday. The mayor has known
Lopez for years and has met Bratton, but not Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has stressed in recent interviews that he believes the Los
Angeles Police Department is a deeply troubled institution in need of
a strong leader who can overcome a culture stubbornly resistant to
change.</TE>
<TE>   The department is plagued by low morale, rising crime and a
history of controversies ranging from the Rodney G. King beating to
the Rampart scandal. But while there is wide consensus among city
leaders on the need for department reform, there has been much debate
over whether an insider or outsider would be best for the job.</TE>
<TE>   The commission delivered a blow to the department by rejecting all
inside candidates. Lopez is the only finalist with any connection to
the LAPD, having served as deputy chief.</TE>
<TE>   One of the inside candidates, LAPD Assistant Chief David Gascon,
said he was "devastated" by the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess if I had one wish, it would be that people would start to
recognize the significant contributions and outstanding work that
have been done by a lot of people in the LAPD," said Gascon, a
25-year department veteran. "They need to be appreciated and
supported.''</TE>
<TE>   A citizens committee appointed by the Police Commission had
advised the panel that an insider would likely have a smoother time
reforming the department of 9,020 officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I must say I was very surprised that no insider was selected,"
said Ann Reiss Lane, who was on the committee. "To others in the
department now, that the commission went outside must be
discouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective
League, said she fielded numerous phone calls from union members
disappointed by the omission of department insiders. Nonetheless, she
credited the commission for its diligence.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were looking at innovative ways to bring a breath of
fresh air to the LAPD," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said the selection of three outsiders should not be seen
as a slight to those in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the commission looked very seriously at all the
candidates and felt there were outstanding men and women in the
department that we hope will stay with the department and work with
the next chief," Hahn said. "I don't think it's a slap at the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner David S. Cunningham III said the
''million-dollar question'' for commissioners was whether to limit
themselves exclusively to candidates from the LAPD or look
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   ''Originally my view had been that I wanted an insider. But in
looking at the resumes and the presentations ... I tried to do it
based on the facts,'' he said. ''I'm really hoping that the men and
women of the LAPD understand that we still think those deputy chiefs
and commanders that came before us were each incredible. I want them
to continue to stay part of the LAPD. We need them.''</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who also served on the
citizen's committee, said she was more concerned about the three
finalists' qualifications and the records of the departments they
led.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some pretty serious questions," she said. "None of
these cities has shown any particularly good solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's tenure as NYPD commissioner from 1994 to 1996 gained him
national acclaim. It was marked by historic declines in homicides and
other serious felonies, as well as by complaints from civil
libertarians over the department's crackdown on low-level crimes. He
also was the head of the Boston Police Department and the New York
City Transit Police.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton resigned as New York City police commissioner in April
1996 to take a job as head of the New York City division of
Boston-based First Security Services Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish-born Timoney, 54, was second in command under Bratton in
New York and took over the Philadelphia Police Department in 1998. He
stepped down shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to work as
a consultant for a New York City private security firm.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Chief Lopez, meanwhile, held a number of jobs during his
tenure in the LAPD. He was in charge of the Hollenbeck Division,
headed the department's training efforts and oversaw the Hollywood
vice squad. He also served as the Watts field commander during the
1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   The new chief will replace Bernard C. Parks, who resigned after
being denied a second five-year term by Hahn and the Police
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The commission choose the three finalists from a list that
included six members of the LAPD brass and seven outside candidates.</TE>
<TE>   After watching Hahn praise him on television, an exuberant Lopez
said from his Oxnard office that he wasn't surprised he is a
finalist, partly because he has known Hahn for more than two decades
and they've always worked well together.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he promised the Police Commission that he would find a
way to "build a bridge" between the powerful Los Angeles police union
and police and city administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his long history with the LAPD--working his way up to
deputy chief--and his knowledge of the agency's distinct culture
worked to his advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was in Caracas, Venezuela, advising the police department
there on its law enforcement strategies when he heard the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased and excited," Bratton said in a telephone
interview. "I want to work with the mayor; he has a good team. They
really understand what the problems are in the LAPD. They fully
embrace community policing, which is refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton also said that he believes that he has an advantage
because he has spent more than a year working with the outside
monitoring team tracking reforms in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what the problems are," Bratton said. "I'm in a good
position to deliver in a very short period of time."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Timoney expressed pleasure with the selection
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us were worried that maybe this wouldn't be an open
process, that they only wanted insiders," Timoney said in an
interview. "But that's been put to rest. I'm looking forward to
opportunity to moving to the final phase. I've never met the mayor
before. I'm looking forward to that."</TE>
<TE>   If he gets the job, Timoney said his first order of business will
be "to win over the troops ....With a good plan, a good vision and a
good message, I can do that."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD insiders passed over included Gascon, Deputy Chief David
Kalish, Assistant Chief Margaret York and Cmdrs. George Gascon, James
McDonnell and Sharon Papa.</TE>
<TE>   The others of the 13 who had been up for consideration were former
Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, now chief of the Portland Police Bureau in
Oregon; Sacramento Police Chief Art Venegas, Cambridge, Mass., Chief
Ronnie Watson and Santa Ana Chief Paul M. Walters.</TE>
<TE>   Some candidates who failed to make the final cut expressed their
disappointment but said they looked forward to working with Hahn's
choice.</TE>
<TE>   ''All three have vast experience in law enforcement, and all three
have positive reputations,'' said Kalish. ''Any one of them would do
a fine job. Because he won't be an insider, it will be important for
those of us in leadership positions to get behind the new chief and
inspire support from the rank and file.''</TE>
<TE>   "The selection, I think, has been a fair process," said George
Gascon. "I think we have both the moral and legal obligation to
support whoever the chief is." The commission began interviewing the
13 top candidates for the position two weeks ago, and on Tuesday was
briefed by members of Hahn's staff who spoke with people close to the
outside candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he plans to interview the candidates with the
assistance of Council President Alex Padilla and Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski, chair of the Public Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the charter the selection I make is still subject to
approval of the council," said Hahn, "so I think key individuals on
the council who have a lot to say about that--I thought it was
appropriate to have them begin interviews with me to set the tone
that the mayor and council and Police Department need to work
together in a strong partnership to keep our community safe."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti said the commission sent a positive
signal with its choices.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's clear that there's fresh air coming into Los Angeles one
way or another. Definitely with three outside candidates--although
one has LAPD experience--it seems like there was a clear decision
made to air out the LAPD a little bit and bring in some experience
from the outside.''</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and commissioners emphasized the need for a chief who can
manage a diverse city--one that has experienced racial tensions
between the community and its police force. Minority leaders
expressed cautious optimism on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   ''The issue is not the race of the candidates. The question is
whether they have a demonstrated ability to recognize and address the
policing needs of the African American community as well as the city
of Los Angeles as a whole,'' said Kimberly West-Faulcon, Western
Regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Cunningham echoed that.</TE>
<TE>   ''We wanted to look for cultural competency,'' Cunningham said.
''Cultural competence means understanding the diversity in this city.
Certainly, looking at the backgrounds of each of the individuals we
reviewed, that was very much an issue for us.''</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Urban League President John Mack said he is impressed
by Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think there are many parallels between New York and Los
Angeles--extremely diversified cities and both having police
departments that have gone through some major scandals and problems.
He seemingly handled that very well and seemingly is sensitive to
some of the issues that are important to the African American
community and the minority community.''</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not set a deadline for making a selection but said he
hoped to complete his evaluation within a month.</TE>
<TE>   "The candidates here have certainly proven that they can manage a
police department, have been in position to prepare them for being
the next police chief," Hahn said. "I don't think there is any
particular advantage or disadvantage to being an outsider."</TE>
<TE>   He said the next chief should have a plan to reduce crime and
improve officer morale and recruitment, as well as implement reforms
of the department and improve police-community relations.</TE>
<TE>   "I will select a candidate who best embodies these qualities and
makes Los Angeles the safest big city in America," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he wants to develop a good personal relationship with
the person who becomes the next chief so personal chemistry with
candidates will be a factor in his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely imperative that the mayor have a strong
relationship with the chief of police," Hahn said, adding he will
play a role in coming up with a public safety plan for the city.</TE>

<HD>Big City Voted Off the Island</HD>
<DH>A tiny community in Maine, feeling neglected by Portland,
showed a decade ago that secession efforts can succeed. But the real
work came later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOWN OF LONG ISLAND, MAINE</DL>
<LD>An ice-encrusted metal ladder on the ferry that links this tiny New
England town to the mainland was the unlikely catalyst for a
municipal revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Day after dank day, the residents of Long Island climbed the
frozen ladder that joined boat to land. They clung to rungs in snow,
and they clung to rungs in rain. Morning and night. Sometimes, they
slipped.</LD>
<LD>   And though they complained, nothing was ever done.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, in the early 1990s, islanders decided they'd had enough.
Their list of grievances with Portland, the mainland city to which
they were attached, included much more than the ladder, but its icy,
slippery steps crystallized many of their feelings of neglect,
disrespect and isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Today, some of those same emotions are propelling the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood to consider breaking away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, on the nation's opposite coast, it was Long Island,
Maine, that was pushing to become its own city.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes were far different. Together, the Valley and Hollywood
have roughly 1.4 million residents; Long Island boasts about 1,000 on
a busy summer day, and year-round, its population is about 200.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the complaints of Long Islanders a decade ago sound
strikingly similar to those debated in Los Angeles' secession
campaigns. Residents felt they paid too much in taxes for too little
in public services.</TE>
<TE>   They feared a diminishing quality of life. They thought they could
govern themselves better than downtown bureaucrats did.</TE>
<TE>   Geography also adds to the separatism in both cases. Substitute
saltwater for mountain ranges, and the sense of being cut off from
City Hall is powerful in both communities.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, secession campaigns have occasionally piqued
the interest of unhappy communities, but most fall short.
Neighborhoods in Atlanta, Seattle and Tucson tried to break away, but
failed. Staten Island came close in 1993 when residents voted to
leave New York City, a plan ultimately denied by the state.</TE>
<TE>   When Key Biscayne formed an upscale, water-ringed community off
the South Florida coast in 1991, it sparked an unsuccessful but
attention-getting drive to dismantle Miami.</TE>
<TE>   An international brouhaha erupted in 1998 when a Minnesota fishing
community tried but failed to break from the United States and become
part of Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In Maine, tiny Frye Island split from the town of Standish in 1998
while the even-tinier Hope Island launched a one-family effort last
year. Long Island, however, reigns as one of the nation's few
secession successes.</TE>
<TE>   The ferry ride between Portland and Long Island takes about 45
minutes across Casco Bay, comparable to a freeway trek from the
Valley to downtown Los Angeles. Commuters include sunscreen-slathered
tourists donning Maine-made L.L. Bean gear, as well as professionals
in ties and heels. Similar to Southern California, workers making the
daily trek from downtown Portland to the islands bemoan their
exhaustion, boredom and lack of time.</TE>
<TE>   The 4.5-mile boat ride stops at two islands en route to Long
Island, a rustic town three miles long and one mile wide, a place
where neighbors decorate lawns with wire lobster traps and squawking
seagulls sunbathe on white Adirondack chairs. The coast alternates
from sharp-edged rocks to fine white sand beaches.</TE>
<TE>   The centuries-old town served as a fuel base for the North
Atlantic fleet during World War II before year-round fishermen and
summer vacationers claimed the island's Victorian beach cottages and
two-story New England farmhouses. Most homes in the largely
middle-class community have waterfront views of private wharves and
bobbing lobster buoys, and most stay within families for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesdays, a popular day for grocery shopping, islanders crowd
the ferry with banana boxes for packing food and wagons for lugging
home goods.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, the ferry ride invigorates like a splash of
saltwater on a hot afternoon. In the winter, when the bay becomes
rough and icy, there are fewer boat runs. Air chills the bones while
gray skies obscure the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   It was under these conditions, more than a decade ago, that the
frozen ladder confronted islanders exiting the ferry--and then,
angering residents further, Portland jacked up property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that talk of secession began. Mark Greene, a longtime
island resident, was the first to mention it. He invited islanders to
town meetings and to his beach cottage, served strong cups of coffee
and advocated seceding from Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "You're nuts," said Nancy Jordan, 57, who helps at the two-room
schoolhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But then Jordan considered the pros: The more than $700,000 that
Portland reaped from Long Island taxes could be better spent
improving the town's battered roads, dilapidated dock and substandard
rescue boat.</TE>
<TE>   It could be used to stop zealous developers from destroying
forests of perfuming balsam firs, pines and maple trees and wild
blueberries.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan quickly came around to supporting the breakup, and others
joined as well. Chris McDuffie and Ruth Peterson were early
advocates, and the core group set out to build their case.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists divided up the research, meetings and clerical work
to include all supporters in the movement and prevent burnout. They
succeeded, they said, because of this strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew what was going on," said Peterson, 67, a longtime
resident who now serves as a Long Island elected official who sits on
six committees. "Everyone was so committed and dedicated."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the effort tapped deep veins. Islanders pride
themselves on their Yankee roots and independence--as well as their
knowledge of history. Secession seemed to speak to all those notions.</TE>
<TE>   "A small government allows for true democracy," said Greene, a
quick-talking, 56-year-old science teacher who splits his time
between Sterling, Mass., and Long Island, where his family has had a
home since the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Island independence campaign grew in 1991 and 1992 as
secessionists collected petition signatures and argued their cause
before state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the breakup won the right to put the measure on the
November 1992 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was strong on election day. Lines greeted voters at the
polls. Secession opponents, though in the minority, tried to sway
supporters until the last minute. "You're going to be sorry," they
warned.</TE>
<TE>   When ballots were counted, secession won 129 to 44. Long Island
had its independence. At Greene's beach cottage, supporters cheered,
hugged and celebrated into the wee hours.</TE>
<TE>   But that was the beginning of a process, not the end. That first
year, the new island town had no money to budget. Portland
bureaucrats did not help matters. Since the island was now on its
own, they argued, it should return the city's lawn mower.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders reacted by urging residents to pay their
property taxes early and by selling $15 green and gray T-shirts
promoting the town's birth.</TE>
<TE>   Long Islanders also organized fund-raisers--a hit in a town where
a typical summer week of social activities includes a boat-naming
party on Wednesday, an annual island potluck on Saturday afternoon, a
wine-tasting soiree Saturday night and a housewarming brunch on
Sunday. For even more money, they recycled aluminum cans and glass
bottles (and still do). "We'd have a drink for the town," Greene
joked.</TE>
<TE>   Most islanders agree their town benefited from independence,
though they also acknowledge it was not easy. Under the divorce
settlement, Long Island had to take on $1.3 million of Portland's
debt. In return, it received $600,000 worth of city property on the
island.</TE>
<TE>   Problems still exist for the town, where most of the residents are
white. Roads need fixing. Affordable housing is rare. Environmental
and conservation issues abound. The deer population is multiplying,
and no one is quite sure what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers continually drive outside road lanes, a problem that may
seem laughable by L.A. crime standards but that nevertheless nettles
Long Island residents.</TE>
<TE>   Property taxes dipped only slightly after secession. But money
went toward fixing their potholes, not Portland's. A boarded-up Navy
office and fuel depot became a cozy town hall painted white with
green trim. The town is constructing a new library with a
climate-controlled room for historical archives. Long Islanders plan
to add a medical clinic in the town, which lacks a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   One of their biggest achievements, residents say, is buying a
high-speed rescue boat that can zip across sometimes-choppy Casco Bay
and dock in Portland in 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old system, they said it sometimes took more than an
hour. For people in trouble, Greene said, islanders used to offer a
New England prayer: "Good luck to you and the Red Sox."</TE>
<TE>   The new government was so successful that other island and
mainland towns in Maine also started breakup efforts, secessionists
said. Portlanders paid little attention to Long Island when it
threatened to secede. But once it broke away and other islands
threatened to follow, the city appointed a liaison to other island
neighborhoods and coordinated public meetings with ferry schedules,
said Joe Gray, Portland's city manager.</TE>
<TE>   Because Long Island is small, its departure left only a bruise on
Portland's economy, Gray said. But money is money, and Portland's
schools could use more to improve education, particularly for
immigrant students who may speak any of 40 languages. The city could
use extra funds for housing programs and harbor projects, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Now, secession threats are common in Maine, a state with 1.27
million people and 492 municipalities. The tiniest town, Glenwood
Plantation, has six residents while Portland, its largest, has
64,358, according to the Maine Municipal Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents want to keep their communities small so they can be
involved in and control local issues. "I can't think of a year when
there hasn't been a secession campaign," said Michael Saxl, Maine's
Democratic House speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Some see that as a turn for the worse. "Long Island opened
Pandora's box," said Orlando Delogu, a law professor at the
University of Maine. "The idea that every enclave should be the king
of its own hill is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than shatter towns and lose tax revenues, Maine politicians
said they try to negotiate problems with dissatisfied neighborhoods.
For its part, the state Legislature has made it harder for
communities to secede by increasing the number of signatures required
for a cityhood petition. "We generally prefer to keep the cities
together," Saxl said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Islander Tony Donovan is one who wishes the town never left
Portland, where he also has a home. Zipping through Portland's
historic streets and coastal roads, past art museums and upscale
boutiques, the 47-year-old real estate developer said secession
happened because of a high school-like clique of connected and vocal
people who wanted to duck out of their responsibilities to the
mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan parked at a Portland dock as a green truck hauled away
Long Island's trash. "See, they still depend on the city," Donovan
said, throwing up his hands in exasperation. "They come into the
city, enjoy its restaurants, libraries and shows, but they don't want
to help with its problems."</TE>
<TE>   The alimony agreement takes care of Long Island's obligation to
Portland, secessionists countered.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession generally doesn't benefit minorities or people without
a lot of wealth," said Donovan. "This is a Yankee mentality. We don't
want to share. We want to do our own thing."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's Long Island neighbors see things differently. The island
today, they said, is self-sufficient and proud of it, looking forward
to its 10th anniversary next summer as its own town.</TE>
<TE>   And the ice-coated ladder that once was a touchstone for island
anger? Today, when the ferry pulls up, passengers still can step off
onto the ladder, but if it's slippery, there's a nearby launch that
provides safe passage to shore.</TE>

<HD>Transfusions Can Spread West Nile, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Health: Authorities also warn that the virus can cause
paralysis that may be misdiagnosed and improperly treated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the infections and death toll attributed to West Nile virus rise
by the day, federal health officials said Thursday they are
reasonably certain that the virus can be spread through blood
transfusions.</LD>
<LD>   They also warned that West Nile patients can develop a polio-like
paralysis that is easily misdiagnosed and improperly treated.</LD>
<LD>   The new information has created urgency within the public health
community to address a disease that didn't even appear in the United
States until 1999. This year alone, 84 people have died and 1,745
people have become ill in more than 30 states and the District of
Columbia.</LD>
<TE>   California has reported one locally acquired infection, in a young
woman in Los Angeles County who has recovered.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile disease remains rare, however. Although as many as
200,000 people are estimated to have been infected nationally, four
in five infected people don't develop symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Elderly people are most vulnerable to the disease, which normally
is harbored by birds and spread by mosquito bites.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are investigating four
cases of possible West Nile transmission through transfusions from
the general blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, they are fairly sure that a 24-year-old Mississippi
woman became infected through a transfusion because three of her
blood donors also tested positive and one became ill a few days after
giving blood.</TE>
<TE>   One transfusion recipient, a 77-year-old man, died of encephalitis
caused by West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said they are "urgently" working with blood banks
and the makers of diagnostic tests to find a way to accurately and
quickly screen for West Nile in the general blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   "While the investigations are ongoing, we believe there's
sufficient evidence, when you put it all together, to say that there
is likely a risk" posed by blood transfusions, said Dr. Jesse
Goodman, a senior official at the FDA's Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone news conference, Goodman said patients should
discuss the risk with their physicians and potentially delay elective
surgery or donate units of their own blood in advance to be used if
transfusions are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials took pains not to discourage people from giving
or receiving necessary blood transfusions. Each year, about 4.5
million people in the United States receive blood products, which can
be life-saving.</TE>
<TE>   "For people who need a transfusion or transplant, the potential
benefits will outweigh the risks, including the risk of West Nile
virus infection," Goodman said.</TE>
<TE>   People cannot contract West Nile by giving blood.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA also is encouraging blood banks to ask that donors notify
them if they develop fevers or flu-like illnesses after donating
blood so that the blood can be immediately removed from the general
supply.</TE>
<TE>   One big problem, Goodman and others said, is that there is no
practical method available to test for West Nile in the blood supply.
Tests that detect antibodies--or the body's immune response to the
virus--aren't necessarily accurate because antibodies take time to
develop after the virus enters the blood.</TE>
<TE>   One possible solution is to find a blood test that detects the
genetic material from the virus itself. Such tests are still being
studied, but Goodman said, "we can't just implement [it] overnight."</TE>
<TE>   The tests will also need to be more sensitive than those for HIV
and hepatitis, because it appears that levels of West Nile in the
blood are far lower.</TE>
<TE>   Another technology being reviewed by the FDA, called pathogen
inactivation, kills potential infecting agents--perhaps including
West Nile--in blood products. Goodman said his agency has been
working with manufacturers to evaluate its potential effectiveness
and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, officials said they had found six cases of
paralysis resulting from West Nile infection. Although the risk of
paralysis had been reported previously, officials said those cases
had been misdiagnosed as stroke or another neurological ailment,
Guillain-Barre syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   The cases involved three men from Mississippi, ages 50, 56 and 57,
and three people from Louisiana--a 56-year-old man, a 46-year-old man
and a 69-year-old woman, all diagnosed in July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials encouraged doctors to perform diagnostic tests to
differentiate between West Nile-induced paralysis and Guillain-Barre
syndrome, which also causes an inability to move the limbs. The
distinction is important because Guillain-Barre patients receive
treatments that don't help, and may even hurt, West Nile patients.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who experience West-Nile-related paralysis typically are
not in pain and can still feel sensation in their affected limbs.
Also, this paralysis affects only one side of the body;
Guillain-Barre generally affects both sides of the body.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have been observing some of the patients for more than a
month, "and they have shown very little improvement," said Dr. Jim
Sejvar, a medical epidemiologist with CDC.</TE>
<TE>   More typically, West Nile virus has been linked to meningitis, an
irritation of the brain's membranes, or to encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   In another development announced Thursday, federal health
authorities identified a fifth case in which the virus may have been
transmitted through organ transplantation. A 47-year-old man became
sick with encephalitis weeks after receiving a liver transplant on
Aug. 14. But authorities do not know if he received the disease from
the transplant, a mosquito bite or the 39 units of transfused blood
he got in the seven days after his transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the CDC confirmed that four people contracted the
virus after receiving organs from an infected Georgia woman, who died
of injuries from an automobile accident. Authorities do not know how
the donor contracted West Nile. She had, however, received blood
transfusions from 63 different donors before her death.</TE>
<TE>   CDC officials said their "best evidence" suggests that West Nile
has peaked in the southern United States, but one expert said that "a
significant number of infections are still occurring, and people have
to be vigilant to avoid mosquito bites."</TE>

<HD>Bush Puts Democrats on the Spot With Resolution on Iraq War</HD>
<DH>Congress: Most likely will support a war, but the
open-ended request concerns lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush's formal request to Congress for broad, open-ended
authority to wage war against Iraq sent a clear message to Democrats:
The time for fence-sitting is over.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks, many Democrats have dodged the question of whether
military action against Baghdad is needed, deferring judgment because
Bush had not yet asked for such authority. Now he's asked, sending
Democrats scrambling to balance their reluctance to oppose him
against their misgivings about giving him a blank check.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic strategists say they expect a majority of party members
will rally behind the resolution in the end. But on Thursday, many
Democrats voiced grave misgivings about how much power Bush was
seeking.</LD>
<TE>   After a late-afternoon meeting to discuss the proposal, many
Senate Democrats said Bush's proposal was too broad and that they
would not support it in its current form.</TE>
<TE>   "This resolution is extremely open-ended," said Sen. Patrick J.
Leahy (D-Vt.). "I don't think people would want to sign a blank
check."</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl
Levin (D-Mich.), were wary of authorizing the use of force without
international support.</TE>
<TE>   A few--such as Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia--were ready to support
the draft resolution without major modifications.</TE>
<TE>   Still others--including a small but feisty band of House
Democratic liberals--flat out oppose a war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is whether or not we're going to authorize a
preemptive strike," said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), one of those
foes. "This is the biggest vote any of us have ever taken."</TE>
<TE>   Bush is seeking broad bipartisan support--rather than a narrow
party-line victory--to convey a message of national unity behind his
foreign policy. That, lawmakers believe, will strengthen the
president's hand in the United Nations and the international
community as he seeks to build a multilateral coalition against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The fence-sitting Democrats who had hoped Bush's proposal would
make concessions that would make it easier to draw bipartisan support
were disappointed. In its draft form, the resolution is a bold
proposal seeking authorization for Bush to "use all means he
determines to be appropriate, including force," to enforce U.N.
resolutions Iraq has flouted, to defend U.S. security interests and
to keep peace in the region. And that raised some qualms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this resolution is going to fly through the
Senate," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who indicated she
would rather the United States not act without multilateral
international support. "Let's be patient."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said of the resolution: "It's a
blank check. I could never support that."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal was labeled a "discussion draft," and Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he remained hopeful that
the administration would consider modifications to make it more
acceptable to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long way to go in working through the draft," Daschle
said.</TE>
<TE>   For most Republicans, nothing more than fine-tuning is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds pretty good to me," said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   But it's a trickier matter for Democrats, many of whom have been
raising pointed questions about the prospects for military
action--queries that they complain have not been answered. For such
Democrats, the decision on the war resolution is a politically
delicate matter. They are caught between their post-Sept. 11 desire
to stick with Bush on foreign policy issues and the concerns many of
their constituents and liberal activists have raised about waging war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A top Democratic strategist estimated that in the House, there are
a couple of dozen hard-core Democratic opponents of going to war, a
somewhat larger group ready to support Bush, and an even bigger
faction on the fence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a large group in the middle that needs to be convinced,"
this Democratic aide said. "In the end, you'll get an overwhelming
number for it, but they need to hear more."</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats who already have rallied to Bush tended to be
conservative Democrats like Miller, strong supporters of Israel like
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), and pro-Pentagon lawmakers
like Rep. Norman D. Dicks (D-Wash.), who is a senior Democrat on the
House Defense Appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have no choice but to have the strongest support
possible for the president's efforts here," Dicks told reporters
after meeting with Bush on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also was welcomed by House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.), a prospective presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its
weapons of mass destruction," he said. "Today's release of a draft
resolution on Iraq is an important first step."</TE>
<TE>   Another group of Democrats seems prepared to support the
resolution if the administration agrees to narrow its scope. For
example, Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) said he backed the use of force
against Iraq. But he objected to language authorizing force to
"restore international peace and security in the region," because he
believed it would give Bush power to expand the conflict to other
parts of the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said Democrats would work "to keep the focus on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Other, more liberal Democrats had more far-reaching objections.
Levin said he would prefer a resolution that authorizes the use of
force in concert with the U.N. if Hussein failed to comply with a
tough new resolution ordering inspections and disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Democrats, Levin said he is prepared for military action
if the United States has international support. "It's really
important we not go it alone," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot different when Saddam Hussein is looking down the
barrel of a gun held by the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   At the left end of the political spectrum is a coalition of 19
House Democrats--including five from California--who announced
Thursday that they were mounting organized opposition to a first
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a majority of the American people want war in
Iraq," said Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich (D-Ohio), a leader of the group.
"The administration has failed to make the case that Iraq poses an
imminent or immediate threat to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The Californians echoing Kucinich were Sam Farr of Carmel, Bob
Filner of San Diego, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Diane Watson of Los
Angeles and Lynn Woolsey of Petaluma.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Team Called Bereft of Al Qaeda Plan</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Bush aide, at joint congressional hearing on 9/11,
rebuts critics who argued that advice from former officials was
ignored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Clinton administration officials advised their successors in the Bush
White House that Al Qaeda represented a major threat to the United
States but presented no plan for dealing with the terrorist network,
a senior Bush administration official testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We were never given a plan," Deputy Secretary of State Richard L.
Armitage said in testimony before the Joint Intelligence Committee.
"There were some briefings the transition got, but it was not a
plan."</LD>
<LD>   Armitage's remarks were in response to criticism, arising in
recent months, that the Bush White House ignored Clinton officials'
plan for striking Al Qaeda, and that the incoming administration
failed to produce a strategy of its own until it was too late.</LD>
<TE>   The testimony came on a day when officials from the Clinton White
House, both Bush administrations and the CIA took turns defending
their handling of the terrorist threat in the years leading up to the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger, national security advisor to President
Clinton, said that the administration repeatedly ratcheted up the
resources it aimed at Al Qaeda until catching or killing Osama bin
Laden was its overriding national security objective.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1996, he was certainly on the radar screen," Berger said. "In
1998, he was the radar screen."</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating
intelligence failures surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The joint panel issued a preliminary report Wednesday that
criticized the intelligence community for failing to heed repeated
warnings, dating back to the mid-1990s, that Al Qaeda was
contemplating strikes on the United States and the use of airplanes
as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most stinging criticism accused the CIA of devoting
embarrassingly few resources to the problem. The report asserted, for
instance, that the CIA counter-terrorism center had just three
analysts tracking Bin Laden in 1999, even though CIA Director George
J. Tenet had declared "war" on Al Qaeda in a 1998 memo.</TE>
<TE>   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow issued a statement Thursday disputing
that finding, saying the center actually had nine analysts focused
full-time on Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of analysts elsewhere in the agency were also working on Al
Qaeda, and the number of people assigned to the counter-terrorism
center doubled under Tenet's leadership before Sept. 11, Harlow said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's hearing was the second in a series of public sessions
planned over the next month. Others testifying Thursday were Paul D.
Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of Defense, who said the Sept. 11 attacks
made the case for preemptive action against Iraq; and Brent
Scowcroft, national security advisor during the first Bush
administration, who advocated a reorganization of the intelligence
community.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the testimony centered on how the Bush and Clinton White
Houses had mobilized against Al Qaeda. Officials from both
administrations sought to portray their efforts as aggressive but
acknowledged that they were mostly focused on potential attacks
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Berger said the Clinton administration focused intensely on Bin
Laden after Al Qaeda operatives detonated truck bombs at two U.S.
embassies in East Africa in 1998, killing 224 people and injuring
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the United States lobbed missiles that hit an Al Qaeda
gathering in Afghanistan just hours after Bin Laden left. The United
States waited for other opportunities, but never got intelligence
pinpointing Bin Laden's location with enough advance notice to get a
missile to the target.</TE>
<TE>   Other former Clinton administration officials have said recently
that Richard A. Clarke, Clinton's counter-terrorism chief, had
spearheaded an effort to plan covert attacks on Al Qaeda. But as the
2000 presidential election approached, the plan was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   That plan was never presented to the Bush administration, Armitage
said, adding that the White House was putting the "finishing touches"
on covert plans of its own when the Sept. 11 attacks happened.</TE>

<HD>Brother of Missing Ex-NBA Player Found</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Miles Dabord, in a coma in Chula Vista, was sought
in the disappearance of Bison Dele, two others. Boat is searched in
Tahiti.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE and DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI's ability to identify a comatose man in a Chula Vista medical
center Thursday marked an apparent breakthrough in the mysterious
disappearance of a former NBA player and two others off Tahiti.</LD>
<LD>   Miles Dabord, wanted in Phoenix on fraud charges and sought by the
FBI and law enforcement officials in Tahiti in connection with a
murder investigation, has been in a coma and listed as a John Doe
since he was brought to the hospital Sunday, the FBI said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Dabord, 35, is the brother of Bison Dele, 33, who, along with his
girlfriend, Serena Karlan, 30, and boat captain Bertrand Saldo, have
been missing since they were seen sailing the South Pacific with
Dabord in early July. Dele played for the Los Angeles Clippers, among
other teams, under the name Brian Williams.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses have identified Dabord as the man who docked Dele's
catamaran, the Hakuna Matata, in mid-July, registering it in the
Tahitian town of Taravao as the Aria Bella. Tahitian authorities said
he also used an alias.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very glad we have him, but we are still anxious to talk to
him," said Josefina Regula, a special agent in the FBI's San Diego
office.</TE>
<TE>   FBI supervisor John Steiner in San Rafael said Dabord was found
comatose near the California-Mexico border Saturday night. Police in
Chula Vista said Dabord had been found in Tijuana. Steiner said he
was alone but refused to provide other details about the
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista police were able to identify Dabord by running his
fingerprints through a database.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord has not been charged with murder, but Phoenix police had a
warrant for his arrest for allegedly signing his brother's name to a
check and skipping bail. He had also been identified as a fugitive by
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Dabord was arrested, investigators in and around Tahiti
were making what they believe was significant progress in piecing
together the details of his final days in the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Fact-finding has been difficult, investigators said, because the
boat was moving across long stretches of open water, heading from
port to port, and some witnesses have given conflicting dates and
locations.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities, who requested anonymity, said their
theory is that Dele and the others died July 6 or 7.</TE>
<TE>   In the first week of July, the Hakuna Matata--with its full
crew--was believed to be headed for the island of Raiatea, northwest
of Tahiti.</TE>
<TE>   It either reached there and turned back to Tahiti or stopped in
midcourse, sources said. Either way, the deaths are believed to have
occurred in the deep waters between the islands.</TE>
<TE>   By July 8, Dabord was back in Papeete, Tahiti, where he greeted
his girlfriend, Erica Weise, at Tahiti-Faa'a International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the couple is believed to have traveled to another
island, Moorea, where investigators Thursday were searching for
evidence of their stay.</TE>
<TE>   Weise flew out of Tahiti on July 15. At that point, Dabord either
motored or sailed the catamaran up the island's east coast.</TE>
<TE>   Near the town of Hitiaa, he struck a coral reef and radioed for
assistance, he said when he came ashore. According to workers in
nearby Taravao, Dabord brought the boat into the town's small marina
hoping to have its hull inspected.</TE>
<TE>   But the marina's crane was too small to lift the 55-footer.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, the name Hakuna Matata had been painted over,
authorities said. When Dabord checked in at the marina, he registered
the boat as the Aria Bella.</TE>
<TE>   For at least two days, Dabord remained on the boat in dock.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not come out for coffee, not to eat," said Marc Norel,
manager of the A'O Restaurant, which overlooks the marina.</TE>
<TE>   When Dabord finally went ashore, he got a ride to Papeete,
probably on one of the small buses, known as Le Trucks, that are
always circling the island, sources said. He is known to have left
Tahiti on July 19.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said today that they are awaiting test results on a
substance taken from the boat that they believe is blood. They also
found damage to one of the hulls that they suspect was caused by a
bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Tahiti prosecutors opened a homicide investigation this week
involving the disappearance of the other people on the yacht.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, Dabord attempted to purchase $152,000 in gold coins in
Phoenix by writing a check from his brother's account. He also
allegedly signed his name "Brian Williams," which is Dele's former
name.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord offered Dele's passport as identification, authorities
said. He also had three of Dele's credit cards in his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix police questioned him, but Dabord was released early the
next morning when a Maricopa County prosecutor decided there wasn't
enough evidence to warrant an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   After his release in Phoenix, law enforcement sources said, Dabord
had a conversation with his former girlfriend Weise, of Sonoma
County.</TE>
<TE>   During the discussion, a French police source said, Dabord told
Weise of a scuffle aboard the boat and said all three--Dele, Karlan
and Saldo--had been killed.</TE>
<TE>   According to this account, Dabord said Dele instigated the
altercation.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord also placed three phone calls to his mother, Patricia
Phillips of Santa Monica, after Sept. 5. She said that he was
threatening suicide.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Regula said she was unsure how Dabord got to the
medical center, or whether he had been transported from where he was
last known to have been, Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Porter, Dele's personal manager who had pressed Dabord for
details about the South Pacific voyage upon Dabord's release in
Phoenix, described finding Dabord as a critical development.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important," Porter said. "If what he told Erica is
true, he would know where to find Bison, Serena and Capt. Saldo.
Miles is where all the evidence is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy he didn't take his own life. Hopefully, when he comes
out of this, he'll come forward with information about these
disappearances. All of his actions lead me to believe he knows what
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see why he wouldn't know," he added. "The FBI needs to
question him with all the urgency there is, and ask him over and over
again: 'What has happened? Where are Bison, Serena and Saldo?' "</TE>
<TE>   Regula said the case on the high seas remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ohlgren, Karlan's stepfather, said, "We're all happy right
now, but we want to wait and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   In Tahiti today, divers searched the waters off Hitiaa for clues.</TE>
<TE>   Dele was known as Brian Williams when he played at St. Monica High
in Santa Monica and later with the Clippers and the 1996-97 NBA
champion Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   He changed his name in 1998 to honor his Native American roots and
the last known slave in his mother's family.</TE>
<TE>   A licensed pilot and scuba diver, Dele chose to retire in 1999
instead of playing out the final three years of a contract with the
Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Lebanon to run a water purification plant, then headed
to Australia, where he discovered sailing.</TE>

<HD>Case's Job Status Not Discussed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Steve Case began AOL Time Warner's board meeting Thursday as
chairman, and he still was chairman when the all-day meeting ended.</LD>
<LD>   Despite pressure from some major shareholders to oust Case and
some anti-Case sentiment on the board itself, the 44-year-old
chairman's job status was not on the agenda and was not even
discussed, company spokesman Edward Adler said Thursday evening.</LD>
<LD>   "Steve Case is chairman and is going to remain so. The board
conducted regular business today," Adler said. The company usually
doesn't say even that much about a regularly-scheduled board meeting
held at its headquarters in Manhattan, but "all the rumors and
speculation forced us to act," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Case declined to be interviewed, as did several of the other 13
board members.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares sank 56 cents, or 4%, to $12.27 on Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has plummeted 74% since the January 2001 merger of
America Online Inc., the company Case founded, and Time Warner Inc.
Some shareholders blame Case for overselling the merger and the
purported benefits that the popular Internet service would bring to
the media and entertainment giant.</TE>
<TE>   Two others held most responsible for the merger, former AOL Time
Warner Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin and former co-Chief Operating
Officer Robert W. Pittman, have been squeezed out of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Case's status "is really not the key issue in front of the board,"
said Ajay Mehra, vice president of Columbia Management, a Portland,
Ore., investment firm that considers AOL Time Warner shares
undervalued and recently began buying. Directors and managers ought
to be focusing on "stopping the bleeding" at the online unit, where
advertising revenue has plunged, subscribed growth has slowed sharply
and there is confusion and poor morale among the staff, Mehra said.</TE>

<HD>SEC Brief Opposes Arbitration Standards</HD>
<DH>Courts: The regulatory agency sides with the NYSE and the
NASD in their legal dispute with the state over new disclosure rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission sided with the New York Stock
Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers in their court
dispute with California authorities over the state's new arbitration
disclosure rules.</LD>
<LD>   "Allowing the states to dictate rules in this area will subject
the [NYSE and NASD] to a patchwork of regulation," the SEC said in a
friend-of-the-court brief filed Thursday in federal court in Oakland.
"Only the commission can decide what disclosure and disqualification
standards are appropriate for the protection of investors."</LD>
<LD>   The California rules, adopted July 1, would increase opportunities
to disqualify arbitrators and vacate arbitration awards. A proposed
arbitrator would have to disclose possible conflicts of interest or
other matters that could raise doubts about impartiality. The NYSE
and NASD sued the California Judicial Council, which makes rules for
the state's courts.</LD>
<TE>   The Judicial Council's attorney didn't respond to a request for
comment. The council has argued that California's standards are not
inconsistent with those of the NYSE and NASD.</TE>
<TE>   The California rules also require disclosure of fees and
arbitration awards paid by brokerages named in investor-broker
disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The rules could lengthen arbitrations, increase their complexity
and raise the cost for participants, the SEC's brief said. Even so,
the SEC announced this week that it would study whether California's
disclosure rules should be incorporated into national policy.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and NASD, which regulate brokers, have refused to proceed
with arbitrations involving California investors because of the
state's rules, putting several hundred cases on hold.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt asked the NYSE and NASD this month to
provide California investors a forum to dispute claims with brokers,
but state officials complained this week that nothing has been done.</TE>

<HD>Calpine, NRG Energy Agree to Sell Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. and NRG Energy Inc. reached deals Thursday to sell
assets as part of the continuing scramble by ailing energy merchants
to raise cash and strengthen their balance sheets.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose-based Calpine said it agreed to sell its oil and gas
properties in British Columbia for $248 million to Pengrove Corp. of
Calgary, Canada. Pengrove will pay $148 million in cash and will buy
$100 million of Calpine debt securities in the open market or through
a tender offer.</LD>
<LD>   Calpine retained the right to buy oil and gas from the properties,
which the independent power plant builder obtained last year in its
purchase of Encal Energy. That purchase was designed to secure fuel
supplies for Calpine's plants.</LD>
<TE>   NRG Energy, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc.,
said it agreed to sell its interest in two California cogeneration
power plants to separate buyers for a total of about $82 million in
cash.</TE>
<TE>   NRG said it would get about $72 million from the sale to an
undisclosed buyer of its 57.7% stake in the Crockett cogeneration
plant northeast of San Francisco. The sale also will reduce debt by
about $242 million. NRG will receive $10 million from the sale of its
39.5% interest in the Bakersfield-area Mt. Poso cogeneration facility
to Red Hawk Energy, which already owns a 23.5% interest.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer Asked to Consider CSFB Criminal Charges</HD>
<DH>Securities: Regulators in Massachusetts refer data from an
investigation of stock analyst conduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts securities regulators recommended Thursday that their
counterparts in New York consider filing criminal charges against
brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston and some of its stock analysts
over allegedly tainted advice given to investors.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation raises the stakes in state and federal
regulators' multiple investigations of Wall Street's conduct during
the bull market. Criminal, as opposed to civil, charges could be
devastating for CSFB's reputation and its ability to do business.</LD>
<LD>   The Massachusetts Securities Division asked New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer to consider pursuing a criminal case, citing evidence
indicating that CSFB analysts in recent years gave stocks favorable
ratings solely to curry favor with investment-banking clients.</LD>
<TE>   As part of a multi-state investigation, Massachusetts regulators
have combed through thousands of e-mails and other internal CSFB
documents.</TE>
<TE>   A number of e-mails show analysts felt internal pressure to talk
up stocks of CSFB banking clients, said William Galvin, the
Massachusetts secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   In one e-mail, for example, a CSFB analyst wrote that he publicly
kept a "buy" rating on certain stocks, but privately told some
clients he felt otherwise. He dubbed that strategy the "Agilent
Two-Step," a reference to Agilent Technologies, a company that CSFB
helped bring public in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails indicate a "pattern of deceit," Galvin said. "This is
a pattern that apparently ran throughout the company."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, CSFB said it is "dedicated to upholding the
highest standards for research independence and ethical behavior."
The firm said it believes that after Spitzer has studied the
evidence, "he will determine that a criminal proceeding is not
warranted."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Dopp, a Spitzer spokesman, said his office would review the
Massachusetts data over the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They have uncovered significant evidence of conflicts of
interest," Dopp said. "We need to take the next step and determine
what actions are appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department last year decided not to file criminal
charges against CSFB relating to an investigation of the brokerage's
new-stock offering practices. The firm eventually paid a $100-million
civil fine to settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for a regulator in one state to file a criminal
referral to a prosecutor in another. That was done, Galvin said,
because CSFB is based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   His state's investigation is continuing, and it is probable that
his office will bring civil charges against CSFB, Galvin said.</TE>
<TE>   New York state law also gives prosecutors greater leeway in
pursuing criminal charges against suspected fraud perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the referral could pose a dilemma for Spitzer. He considered
bringing criminal charges this year against Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. over
similar analyst issues, but agreed instead to allow the firm to
settle the case for $100 million and the promise to reform its
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also is conducting an investigation of analyst conduct at
Salomon Smith Barney, and may not want to divert his energies, said
Jack Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, CSFB and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Thursday supplied
documents to a congressional committee investigating their handling
of initial public stock offerings in the late 1990s, a committee
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, CSFB's parent, Credit Suisse Group, named John
Mack, CSFB's chief executive, as co-chief executive of the parent
firm.</TE>

<HD>Digital TV Switch Pushed</HD>
<DH>Congress: In draft bill, lawmakers propose steps to speed
transition. It would make most analog TVs obsolete by 2007.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hoping to speed the nation's transition to digital television, key
lawmakers are circulating a draft of a bill that would render most
TVs obsolete by 2007 and require millions of Americans to spend
hundreds of dollars on new sets or special equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which would force broadcasters to stop sending
conventional analog television signals by Dec. 31, 2006, immediately
sparked a firestorm of criticism from broadcasters and consumer
groups, who predicted such a requirement would face substantial
opposition in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The draft, circulated by Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), leaders of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, is intended to light a fire under broadcasters, cable
operators and equipment manufacturers to accelerate the roll-out of
digital TV.</LD>
<TE>   Digital TV promises to dramatically improve picture quality,
through such technologies as high-definition TV, and provide viewers
with CD-quality audio, more channels and interactivity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Congress set a 2006 target date for most TV broadcasters
to end analog broadcasts and send only digital signals. But the
switch has been slow. The Tauzin-Dingell proposal would fix a final
deadline that could not be extended.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer demand for digital TV has been weak, in part because of
the high cost of digital TVs, the incompatibility of set-top boxes
and the scarcity of innovative programming being broadcast. Only
about 3 million digital TV sets--which can cost thousands of
dollars--have been sold, and fewer than one-third of broadcast TV
stations are transmitting digitally.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, TV stations may continue using airwaves
earmarked for analog signals until 85% of households in their market
have digital TV sets. Based on the slow sales of digital TVs, few
markets were expected to meet the 85% threshold by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell also
has adopted digital TV as a pet cause. Last month, the FCC ordered TV
manufacturers to install digital tuners in most sets by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional staffers stressed that the Tauzin-Dingell draft is
only a "starting point" and said the final bill is not expected to be
introduced for several months. A hearing is scheduled for next week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is classic Tauzin and Dingell strategy," said Seth
Greenstein, an attorney representing several consumer electronics
makers. "You give some candy to all the major players, but you make
them take their medicine as well."</TE>
<TE>   Government leaders are motivated to switch to digital TV largely
by economics. The sooner broadcasters switch to digital signals, the
sooner they will be required to return billions of dollars' worth of
analog TV spectrum, which the government plans to auction off for
other uses, probably wireless services.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics say the government is pushing a technology that
consumers don't really want.</TE>
<TE>   If the draft legislation becomes law, consumers with traditional
analog TV sets in 2007 would be unable to view over-the-air digital
TV signals unless they purchase digital sets or special converter
boxes. Cable or satellite TV customers would be less affected because
most set-top boxes already are capable of converting digital signals
to analog.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also requires the FCC to settle a spat between
entertainment companies and technology firms to implement a
copy-protection technology, known as a broadcast flag, designed to
protect over-the-air digital shows from being copied and
redistributed over the Internet. The draft requires the technology to
be installed in all digital devices by Jan. 1, 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has lobbied hard for a government mandate on the
broadcast flag. But the Tauzin-Dingell proposal would be a setback
for broadcasters that must upgrade their transmission facilities with
expensive new equipment. A spokesman for the National Assn. of
Broadcasters declined to comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Some electronics firms worry that the technology mandated by the
draft will not work and predict that consumers will reject it.</TE>
<TE>   One technology group, Digitalconsumer.org, called the draft
"clumsy and dangerous" and warned that its proposals would make
millions of existing VCRs inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Tauzin said, "While we prefer marketplace
solutions, clearly it is time for us to provide leadership in this
area. By doing so, we hope to ensure that consumers benefit in a
meaningful way from this exciting transition."</TE>
<TE>   A vote is not likely until next year, but lobbying from various
industries and consumer groups has been underway since June, when
Tauzin abandoned efforts to mediate a private-sector settlement.</TE>

<HD>SEC Proposes Proxy Vote Disclosure Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regulators on Thursday proposed forcing mutual funds to reveal how
they cast their votes on behalf of investors in corporate contests
over executive pay, board makeup and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously to seek
two months of public comment on the plan, which could draw fierce
opposition from the fund industry. Fund companies, which hold about
21% of the U.S. stock market on behalf of 93 million investors, have
opposed mandatory disclosure of so-called proxy votes, citing lack of
public demand.</LD>
<LD>   Activist investors such as the AFL-CIO cheered the SEC action as
an important step in efforts to reform corporate governance. As
scandals such as Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. have rocked investor
confidence, Congress and the SEC have adopted rules calling for
quicker or more complete disclosure in several areas, including
executive stock trading and compensation.</LD>
<TE>   Although corporate proxy votes often deal with mundane issues,
they also can be a forum for such matters as the size of an
executive's retirement package or the membership of a company's
board.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue whose time has come," Steve Schueth, director of
the Washington-based Social Investment Forum, said of the proposed
proxy rules. "WorldCom, Enron and the other fiascos have called into
question the whole issue of investor trust."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, fund companies would be required to file their
proxy voting records twice a year with the SEC, which would post them
on its Web site at www.sec.gov. The funds also would be required to
send written copies to investors upon request.</TE>
<TE>   Fund companies also would be required to make their voting
guidelines public, as Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments already
have. However, only "socially conscious" fund firms such as Domini
Social Investments  post their votes, industry analysts say. Though
the mainstream fund industry says investors have shown little
interest in proxy voting, activists don't agree.</TE>
<TE>   "If regulatory improvement depended on hearing from shareholders,
we wouldn't have prospectuses. We wouldn't have fee tables," said
Mercer Bullard, founder of Fund Democracy, an Oxford, Miss.-based
shareholder advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Funds face conflicts of interest because they sometimes "serve two
masters," Bullard said. They may avoid taking a stand against company
management for fear of losing pension plan business, he said. The
fund industry disputes that contention.</TE>
<TE>   "That argument is absurd. When we vote our proxies, we only
consider our shareholders' interests," Fidelity spokesman Vin
Loporchio said.</TE>
<TE>   Loporchio also said proxy disclosure could have unintended
consequences. If, for example, it became known that Fidelity had
voted against management, it might adversely affect the stock price
and, in turn, fund shareholders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investor Adrian Nenu of St. Petersburg, Fla., said he, for
one, wants to see proxy votes revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "If a fund firm votes for an outrageous executive compensation
package, I would think that most people would want to know," Nenu
said. "If they're acting in a fiduciary duty, like they say they are,
then there's nothing to hide. If anything, they should be proud to
post the information."</TE>
<TE>   After the 60-day comment period passes, the SEC will vote on
whether to formally adopt the disclosure rule.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate disclosure battle still looming, the SEC may respond
to investor petitions seeking to force funds to reveal their
portfolio holdings more than twice a year.</TE>

<HD>Glaxo, Genentech Reach Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline said Thursday that it settled
litigation against Genentech Inc. that claimed its rival infringed
patents covering monoclonal antibodies--cells grown in large
fermentation tanks that can be programmed to attack disease.</LD>
<LD>   The companies did not disclose details of the confidential
settlement, which ends two separate legal actions.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the settlement, Glaxo dropped its appeal of a May
2001 jury verdict in favor of Genentech. A federal jury in Delaware
found that Genentech's two most successful drugs, the cancer
medications Herceptin and Rituxan, did not infringe Glaxo's patents.</LD>
<TE>   Glaxo's second suit against South San Francisco-based Genentech
was scheduled for trial in the same court in April.</TE>
<TE>   The suits dealt with the use, preparation and production of
specific kinds of antibodies to cure diseases, including cancer.
Genentech has maintained that Glaxo's technology played no role in
the development of Rituxan and Herceptin and that Genentech's
scientists as well as others in the field developed the technology
that Glaxo claimed to have invented.</TE>
<TE>   As part of Thursday's settlement, Genentech dropped an inequitable
conduct claim against Glaxo stemming from the first lawsuit, a Glaxo
representative said.</TE>
<TE>   Rituxan, a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treatment Genentech co-markets
with Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. of San Diego, had sales of $522.5
million for the first six months of 2002. Sales of breast cancer
medication Herceptin were $181.9 million for the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement with Glaxo comes less than two weeks after
Genentech prevailed over Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., in a
patent infringement case that also involved Herceptin. A federal jury
in Sacramento found that Chiron's patent on a breast cancer antibody
was not valid and therefore did not apply to Herceptin. Chiron has
said it intends to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Glaxo shares closed at $35.18, off $2.39, and Genentech fell $1.10
to $30.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when the
markets also were down.</TE>

<HD>E-Mails Confirm Ruse by Global</HD>
<DH>Telecom: In 2000 and 2001 messages, some executives
complained about 'junk' capacity swaps to boost revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executives at Global Crossing Ltd. knew the company was masking its
sales figures at least nine months before top officers such as
Chairman Gary Winnick cashed in stock for hundreds of millions of
dollars, according to company e-mails released Thursday by a
congressional committee.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mails decry the way the company rushed at the end of each
quarter to boost revenue with "junk" deals, which involved trading
capacity on fiber-optic networks with other telecommunications firms,
particularly Qwest Communications International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "When saddled with unreasonable revenue expectations, we do the
crazy deals at the end of the quarter," Robin Wright, a senior vice
president, wrote in an August 2000 e-mail to then-President David
Walsh. The capacity swaps end up being the "plug number" needed to
meet Wall Street expectations, she wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Wright complained that the "crazy deals" cause prices for its
services to drop, which "makes [it] more likely that we'll need to do
another deal at the end of the next quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Wright is cooperating with the congressional investigation,
according to the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The electronic messages mark the first time that the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce has seen top officers raise such red
flags about capacity swaps, said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the
committee.</TE>
<TE>   "These e-mails are important because they confirm our suspicion
that these deals were done to inflate revenue and meet Wall Street
expectations," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The messages released Thursday were not addressed directly to
Winnick, and it was unclear whether he ever read them.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing said in a statement that the committee released
"selected" parts of more than 60,000 pages of documents and 40,000
e-mails that the company has turned over to the committee and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it would
continue to cooperate with committee members and "provide them
context for the materials" they are reviewing.</TE>
<TE>   Wright sent her message to Walsh nine months before Winnick, Walsh
and other executives and directors cashed in on the company's
highflying stock. Winnick sold $123.5 million worth of stock, and
Walsh grossed $8.7 million in May 2001 sales. Overall, Winnick has
cleared more than $575 million on his stock sales.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing became the biggest telecom firm to seek bankruptcy
protection when it filed a Chapter 11 petition in January to
reorganize. Since then, the much-larger WorldCom Inc. has sought
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   As the industry began crashing from too much capacity and slow
demand, telecom firms came under fire for swapping capacity and
booking it as revenue, without classifying the purchases as ordinary
expenses. Such swaps also need to be based on good business rationale
to pass muster as a sale.</TE>
<TE>   But the e-mails suggest that Global Crossing was completing swaps
and then looking for good reasons to make such deals.</TE>
<TE>   A Global Crossing employee complained in a March 2001 e-mail to S.
Wallace Dawson, an executive vice president, that he could not come
up with a good business reason for a $60-million deal with Qwest, a
deal that was originally worth $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Coghill said he "in good conscience cannot pretend to
develop a business case that justifies this transaction."</TE>
<TE>   In a September 2001 message, Joey Wong, a mid-level employee in
finance, raised objections to the way the company strained to make a
case for some of the swaps.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish this company [would] just come clean with the Street
regarding our guidance," Wong wrote. "This swap crap is going to kill
us in the long run and I'm personally very fed up with this business
case garbage."</TE>
<TE>   In a series of e-mails between Wright and Qwest managers, Wright
said, "You both know the issue, we are taking capacity in order to
help with revenue recognition issues."</TE>

<LD>Knight Ridder Inc., the No. 2 U.S. newspaper publisher, said Thursday
that it expected third-quarter earnings to fall well short of
analysts' estimates as weak classified advertising has hurt revenue
in Silicon Valley and other key markets.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman and Chief Executive Tony Ridder said he expected earnings
to nearly match the 81 cents a share earned a year ago. Analysts, on
average, expected earnings of 87 cents per share, within a range of
85 cents to 91 cents, according to Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the company, which were off 68 cents when the news was
announced, dropped $4.53 to close at $57.91 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   "Hiring is still soft, and advertising for available jobs remains
thin," Ridder said. "This choppiness has persisted into September."</TE>
<TE>   Among its newspapers hardest hit by the classified ad drought is
the San Jose Mercury News in Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the
dot-com implosion.</TE>
<TE>   Its total ad revenue was down 1.2% during August, and general ad
revenue was down 4.3%. Classified ad revenue was down 6.6% for the
month.</TE>
<TE>   Knight Ridder operates 32 daily newspapers in 28 U.S. markets,
including the Philadelphia Inquirer and Miami Herald, with 8.5
million daily and 12.1 million Sunday readers. Its Internet operation
includes RealCities.com, a national network of city and regional
sites.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its quest to offer long-distance service to Californians, SBC
Pacific Bell mounted the lobbying equivalent of a full-court press.</LD>
<LD>   It lined up hundreds of business and civic groups to support its
application before the California Public Utilities Commission,
drawing on a long history of philanthropy and goodwill.</LD>
<LD>   It took critics out of the debate by providing aid to one and
silencing another through a legal settlement. And when an influential
state senator urged the PUC not to approve the company's application,
SBC PacBell rounded up a slate of legislators to take its side.</LD>
<TE>   But the San Francisco company didn't play the one angle that could
matter most: It never sought to overturn an 8-year-old state law that
may block it from carrying long-distance calls inside California.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the phone giant focused on an ill-fated bill to limit the
power of the PUC to regulate rates and profits. Eliminating the state
law governing long-distance service "would have been a smarter bill
for SBC to do this past year," a key aide in the state Senate said.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell doesn't seem concerned. On Thursday, company officials
treated the PUC's 4-1 vote as an endorsement of their plan to enter
the long-distance market.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, state regulators said their action merely moves
SBC PacBell's application to offer interstate long-distance service
on to the Federal Communications Commission. The PUC also decided
that the company had not met the conditions spelled out in state law
for offering long-distance service within California. That would
essentially make it impossible for the company to offer a competitive
long-distance service.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the potential predicament so stunning is how much
effort SBC PacBell poured into winning the battles it chose to fight.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most pressurized public position I've been in since
I joined public service in 1970," PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown
said. "I would rate it in the ultraviolet zone."</TE>
<TE>   Backed by unions and small businesses, local Bell companies such
as SBC have been among the most effective government lobbyists.
Unlike their rivals in the long-distance business, they have a strong
presence in the communities they serve and they give millions of
dollars to civic groups and charities.</TE>
<TE>   These local connections and philanthropic efforts guarantee the
Bells will have a wide array of grass-roots backers when they seek
new laws, lighter regulations or permission to enter markets.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after PacBell sought the PUC's endorsement for
long-distance service, economic-development groups, trade
associations and civic leaders voiced their support through letters
and public testimony. Among those weighing in were the Black American
Political Assn. of California, the Latino Resource Organization, the
Boys &amp; Girls Club of Santa Clarita Valley, Leadership Education for
Asian Pacifics Inc., New Economics for Women and the Senior Action
Network.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC used its influence to convey to community groups the
importance of testifying" in favor of the company's application
during hearings before the PUC, said Bob Gnaizda, general counsel for
the nonprofit Greenlining Institute in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "And many groups believed there was an implicit message. SBC did
not need to tell them explicitly."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Benavides, head of the Mexican American Political Assn., said
SBC approached him last year to testify. The approach suggested that
SBC was "calling in a favor," he said, although the company didn't
specify a quid pro quo. Benavides suffered a stroke before getting a
chance to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of PacBell's application included firms that compete
with SBC for high-speed Internet customers but rely on PacBell to
provide the copper lines. One of its most bitter critics early on was
Covad Communications Group Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., which accused
PacBell of giving SBC's services an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Oxman, assistant general counsel of Covad, said those
problems were resolved "quite to our satisfaction" after SBC bought a
5% stake in Covad two years ago. Covad hasn't opposed PacBell's
long-distance application since then, Oxman said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Internet Service Providers Assn. also had problems
with PacBell on the issue of high-speed Internet services, filing a
complaint with the PUC against PacBell and SBC. Faced with heavy
legal bills, however, CISPA struck a deal with PacBell to settle the
complaint privately. As part of that deal, CISPA agreed to withdraw
the comments it had filed on PacBell's long-distance application and
offer no further opposition.</TE>
<TE>   This deal drew protest from two state consumer groups, but PacBell
spokesman John Britton said it was appropriate. "It doesn't make
sense to settle those allegations, make concessions and then face
those same allegations" in the long-distance case, Britton said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the potential barrier in state law, PacBell officials argue
that it was superseded in 1996, when Congress laid out its own set of
requirements for the local Bells to enter the long-distance market.
That's why PacBell made no attempt to overturn the state
requirements, Britton said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Near Lows of Summer</HD>
<DH>Markets: The slump in recent weeks has wiped out almost all
the rally that followed the record selling wave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's bulls are facing a major test of their resolve as key
indexes plummeted Thursday to within striking distance of their
midsummer lows.</LD>
<LD>   A fresh barrage of bad news drove the Nasdaq composite index down
35.68 points, or 2.9%, to 1,216.45, less than 1% above its five-year
closing low of 1,206.01 reached Aug. 5.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials tumbled 230.06 points, or 2.8%, to
7,942.39, the first close below 8,000 since the index ended at a
four-year low of 7,702 on July 23.</LD>
<TE>   The market's slump in recent weeks has wiped out nearly all of the
rally that followed the record selling wave of midsummer. Many
investors had hoped that the summer plunge marked the end of the 2
1/2-year-old bear market, the longest decline since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of corporate earnings warnings, Mideast war
jitters and disappointing economic data all are taking a toll on
investor sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, shares of computer services giant Electronic Data
Systems lost more than half their value, diving $19.26 to $17.20
after the firm warned of a profit shortfall because companies
continue to rein in capital spending.</TE>
<TE>   The news deepened the pessimism about the tech sector, where many
stocks have already lost more than 90% of their value since the
market peaked in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But worries about corporate earnings have spread beyond the tech
sector. This week. fast-food titan McDonald's and banking leader J.P.
Morgan Chase  separately warned of profit shortfalls in the near
term.</TE>
<TE>   The reports have raised doubts about the economic recovery, and
thus about the market's potential to mount a sustained rally--or even
just to hold steady.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the negative earnings news and the continual drumbeat of
our march into Iraq, a lot of people are moving into cash and bonds,"
said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset
Management in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, long-term Treasury bond yields fell to new 40-year lows
Thursday as money fled stocks for perceived safer havens. The 10-year
T-note yield dropped to 3.78% from 3.84% Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for Treasury securities has been huge in recent weeks as
stocks have turned lower again. The 10-year T-note yield was 4.32% as
recently as Aug. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks' slide in recent sessions has been accompanied by rising
trading volume, suggesting that more investors are anxious to exit
the market. The quarterly expiration today of key stock index options
and futures contracts is adding to volatility, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off Thursday afternoon accelerated after President Bush
sent Congress his proposed use-of-force resolution in the U.S.-Iraq
standoff, Orlando said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some euphoria a couple days ago" as some investors saw
Saddam Hussein's overture to the United Nations as reducing the
danger of war, but "Bush brought us all back to reality" on Thursday,
Orlando said.</TE>
<TE>   Falling stocks outnumbered winners by 25 to 7 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 24 to 10 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   A report Thursday that housing construction fell in August for a
third straight month may have particularly rattled investors because
housing had been viewed as one of the pillars of the economic
recovery. Builders' stocks fell sharply. KB Home slid $3.26 to $46.98
and Centex slumped $3.56 to $44.89.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Domino, manager of the Northern Large Cap Value stock fund in
West Palm Beach, Fla., said the economic data in recent weeks have
been a "mixed bag," with some reports pointing to continued strength.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some good news out there, but it just gets ignored,"
Domino said.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts had warned in August that the market's midsummer
lows could be tested, and that is what looms. If key indexes fall
significantly below the summer lows it could signal that a new phase
of the bear market is underway. If the indexes hold above those lows
it could indicate that the bear has reached its end.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech shares plunging with EDS included IBM, down $4.75 to
$64.80; Computer Sciences, down $5.66 to $29.50; and Accenture, down
$1.79 to $14.10.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Nextel Communications fell $1.30 to $7 after the company's
chief operating officer, James Mooney, said he would leave by Oct. 1
to pursue new challenges.</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen slid $3.47 to $42.01 after drug firm Wyeth said it will be
free to start selling its 7.7% stake in the biotech firm on Oct. 15.
Wyeth got the stake after Amgen in July bought Immunex, a Wyeth
partner.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks were broadly lower. Citigroup dropped $1.46 to
$27.65 and Goldman Sachs lost $3.26 to $67.15.</TE>
<TE>   * Mexico's main share index dived 5.3% as Wall Street sank. Major
European indexes closed at five-year lows.</TE>

<HD>Influential Movie Market Researcher Quits His Post</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Joseph Farrell denies he's leaving because
of a falling-out with current owner of his company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man considered the Godfather of modern-day movie research--the
art of gauging audience interest in a movie long before it
opens--abruptly resigned Thursday from the company he founded more
than two decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Farrell, one of the most influential behind-the-scenes
players in Hollywood, said he and his partner, Catherine Paura, would
be leaving National Research Group when their contracts expire in
December.</LD>
<LD>   "After 25 years of this and at our peak of success," Farrell said
in an interview, "we just thought it was a good time to step back."</LD>
<TE>   Industry sources, however, said Farrell and Paura, NRG's
co-chairmen, had grown increasingly frustrated with what they viewed
as an erosion of their management control since their business was
sold to Dutch media conglomerate VNU in 1997. The sources said the
two had found themselves in a cultural clash with the owners and had
been planning their exit strategy for months.</TE>
<TE>   But the normally publicity-shy Farrell denied that was the case,
saying he was not leaving because of any "divisiveness within VNU....
I'm not trying to escape from any bureaucratic plague; I just wanted
to be freed up from the daily grind of the work."</TE>
<TE>   He said he and Paura, who would officially resign at VNU's
entertainment board meeting today in New York, would stay on as
consultants to NRG "for at least another year."</TE>
<TE>   Farrell, 67, and Paura, 52, founded NRG in 1978, eventually
obtaining a virtual monopoly on movie-tracking research. As
Hollywood's dominant prognosticator, NRG conducts test screenings
with recruited audiences and conducts polls to measure everything
from moviegoer interest in upcoming releases to the effectiveness of
movie trailers and TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   Studios pay NRG millions of dollars a year for handicapping how
their movies will perform on opening weekends. Often, the studios
will revamp their entire advertising campaigns based on NRG's
research.</TE>
<TE>   NRG's parent company is conducting a search to fill the post of
chief executive. In the meantime, Andrew Wing, chief executive of VNU
media and research unit Nielsen Entertainment, will move from New
York to Los Angeles to work with Farrell and Paura during the
transition. VNU also owns the Hollywood Reporter, a trade
publication.</TE>
<TE>   VNU has been very aggressive in acquiring research properties over
the last several years, including A.C. Nielsen, VideoScan and
SoundScan, and also owns Hollywood Reporter, Billboard Publications
and Adweek. Sources said the decision for Farrell and Paura to leave
was mutual. Some traced it to NRG's position within the company being
overshadowed by Nielsen's growing prominence and contribution to
VNU's overall annual revenue. NRG recently was renamed Nielsen NRG.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure at NRG, Farrell became as controversial as he
was powerful. His company sometimes erred--and badly.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, NRG misjudged the interest in 20th Century Fox's
animated feature "Ice Age" by tens of millions of dollars. Another
high-profile incident occurred in 2000 over the highly competitive
Fourth of July weekend. NRG predicted that Columbia Pictures'
Revolutionary War movie "The Patriot," starring Mel Gibson, was going
to beat out Warner Bros.' "The Perfect Storm." In fact, the opposite
happened, and "Perfect Storm," with George Clooney, out-grossed "The
Patriot" almost 2 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite the misses, Farrell has his loyal supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Laurence Mark, whose many credits include the 1996
blockbuster "Jerry Maguire," said Farrell has maintained "a corner on
the market because nobody has his vast amount of movie market
research history to call upon. He can reference 'Saturday Night Live'
[from 1977] and tell you why that may have some bearing on what
you're doing today."</TE>
<TE>   MGM Inc. Chief Operating Officer Chris McGurk said, "Beyond having
created this research methodology, which has become the industry
standard, Joe Farrell is an incredible font of information that is
very useful to us."</TE>
<TE>   Farrell says he takes being off the mark in stride: "If you're way
off [by underestimating grosses] no one really screams at you. If
you're off and the movie does less, then they have a real gripe."</TE>
<TE>   But Farrell has faced far more serious accusations over the years
that he has doctored figures and manipulated demographic information
to please clients, which he has steadfastly denied. Revolution
Studios partner Tom Sherak, who has known Farrell for more than 20
years, lamented that such allegations dog Farrell: "The accusations
that they cook the numbers is absolutely ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>OPEC Won't Boost Oil Output</HD>
<DH>Energy: Ministers say stockpiling prompted by war fears
justifies maintaining current production levels and keeping prices
up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OSAKA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
Thursday to keep production quotas at 11-year lows, indicating that
prices are likely to continue at levels that are almost 50% higher
than last year.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes as the United States debates whether to take
military action against Iraq, a move that could increase prices even
more. It also is a difficult time for high oil prices because the
added costs will make it harder for the U.S. and world economies to
recover.</LD>
<LD>   "If they don't increase production and put downward pressure on
prices, we'll have a fairly stagnant economy for some time to come,"
said James Williams, president of WRTG Economics, an Arkansas energy
consulting firm.</LD>
<TE>   "Oil is involved in everything. If you eat a sandwich, the bread
had to be transported. Somebody had to turn natural gas into
fertilizer to grow the wheat. The entire world infrastructure is
dependent on it."</TE>
<TE>   OPEC, whose members sell about one-third of the world's oil, has
been holding oil production levels down to try to engineer a market
price in the range of $22 to $28 a barrel. Crude oil for October
delivery closed up 2 cents at $29.50 in New York on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say war fears have built a premium of $2 to more than $5 a
barrel into the price. Some experts are forecasting a price of $40 a
barrel this winter if there is war and if it is a tough heating
season. Such fears have encouraged stockpiling, increasing the prices
even more.</TE>
<TE>   Such "scaremongering" was why OPEC ministers said they felt
justified in keeping the production quotas in place.</TE>
<TE>   Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah ibn Hamad al Attiyah, newly elected
OPEC president, said the price increases dictated by the market were
"political prices, not market prices."</TE>
<TE>   OPEC ministers said that in the event of a war with Iraq, supply
could easily be increased.</TE>
<TE>   "God forbid there is a disruption in supply; we have 5 million
barrels per day of excess supply to take care of any issue that might
arise," said Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, OPEC's outgoing president.
"We stand ready to supply any shortages that might arise."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's production has dwindled to less than 1 million barrels a
day, though it has capacity to produce 3.1 million barrels. It was
assessing a premium on its oil to get around U.N. sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Saddam Hassan, Iraq's delegate to the OPEC meeting, said Iraq was
pleased that the quotas were kept.</TE>
<TE>   "We want market stability," he said, but he vowed to increase
production steadily. Because of U.N. sanctions, Iraq has no quotas.</TE>
<TE>   "We will keep exporting 2.2 million barrels a day--forget the
Americans, forget the British," Hassan said.</TE>
<TE>   The organization will meet again to review its decision Dec. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The group's quota is 21.7 million barrels a day. Still, members'
production has exceeded the quota by 1.8 million barrels a day,
Lukman said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia had been quietly lobbying its OPEC colleagues to
raise production because it has plenty of excess capacity and can
make more money.</TE>
<TE>   But other nations, such as Indonesia, that already are producing
all the oil they can want to keep the output low, hence boosting
prices. Their national outputs are heavily dependent on oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   Let the price rise too high, though, and it encourages more
competition long term from non-OPEC producers, analysts say.</TE>

<HD>Wires Cross on PacBell Long-Distance Decision</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The phone company believes it has won approval
from the state Public Utilities Commission to provide the service in
California. But regulators say that's not the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Pacific Bell claimed Thursday that it won state approval to offer
long-distance phone service in California. But there's one big
caveat: State regulators disagree.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission voted 4 to 1 to approve
a petition by SBC PacBell, the state's biggest local phone company,
to add long-distance service to its offerings. That paves the way for
the company to seek the blessing of the federal government and begin
offering long-distance service by Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   But the PUC also voted to bar SBC PacBell from carrying
long-distance traffic within the state until it can show that to do
so would not hinder competition. The resulting split decision may
well preclude the company from offering a service that matches those
of its competitors.</LD>
<TE>   Although SBC PacBell could carry long-distance calls to cities in
other states, it could not offer such service between cities within
California.</TE>
<TE>   PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown said the agency would not allow
SBC PacBell to sell long-distance service within California until the
company eliminates competitive barriers and proves that its move into
long-distance is in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good, strong start for SBC PacBell, but there's things
that still have to be done," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates said that all the commission did was punt the
issue to the Federal Communications Commission, which also must
approve SBC PacBell's request. Although the PUC found that the phone
company had not met all the necessary state requirements for
long-distance entry, the agency ruled that most of the federal
requirements had been met, said Michael Shames, executive director of
the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens now is a great question," Shames said. "This sets up
another showdown in the December-January time frame when SBC PacBell
tries to offer long-distance in a state where state commissioners
have said, 'You haven't passed our test yet.' "</TE>
<TE>   But SBC PacBell executives believe the vote allows them to move
forward. The company said it would submit its application to the FCC
today.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the order they voted on, there is no finding of
fact that we are prohibited in any way from offering intrastate
long-distance service," said Lora Watts, president of SBC PacBell.</TE>
<TE>   The confusion is likely to trigger a messy showdown involving the
state's most powerful phone company, state and federal regulators and
long-distance companies AT&amp;T Corp., WorldCom Inc. and others. Even if
the PUC declines to assert its authority to stop SBC PacBell from
selling long-distance service, the company's competitors probably
would go to court to do so, given the dollars at stake.</TE>
<TE>   California is the nation's largest long-distance market, worth an
estimated $10.5 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   The market is especially important to SBC PacBell because it
expects to quickly convert many of its more than 10 million
local-service customers into long-distance customers. That strategy
has worked in other states such as Texas, where the firm has offered
customers a bundle of services.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers have expressed a desire to simplify their
communications services by consolidating them on one bill from one
provider.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates, however, decried SBC PacBell's stated victory
because they fear it will give even more power to a company that has
a near-monopoly on local phone service. SBC PacBell, a subsidiary of
San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc., has 90% of the home phone
lines in its California territory.</TE>
<TE>   "Competition can't work when one company dominates the entire
state," said Regina Costa, telecommunications director at the Utility
Reform Network, a consumer group in San Francisco. "If there are any
gains to customers in the form of reduced [long-distance] rates, they
will be temporary at best. Once PacBell has dominated the California
market, they'll have no incentive to keep bills low."</TE>
<TE>   Costa said she also fears that the company's marketing would not
be sufficiently restrained. In the last year, SBC PacBell has been
fined more than $52 million by state regulators for sales and
marketing abuses in the residential phone and high-speed Internet
access markets.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, SBC PacBell can gain entry to the long-distance
market only if the PUC decides it would be in consumers' best
interest and would not harm competitors. At Thursday's PUC meeting,
the commissioners found that the company had met just one of four
specific legal requirements. As a result, they voted not to let SBC
PacBell sell long-distance service within the state.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we're concerned, we can't authorize in-state
long-distance," said Commissioner Brown. "If the FCC were to override
the state, that's their business."</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the so-called Baby Bell
local phone companies cannot sell long-distance service in their home
territory until they have sufficiently opened their local lines to
competitors who want to sell local service.</TE>

<HD>Lockout of Dockworkers Called Off</HD>
<DH>Ports: ILWU dispatches full crews minutes before an
employer deadline. Each side said the brinkmanship could continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND and LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dispute between shipping lines and the dockworkers' union came
perilously close to paralyzing the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach today, but a shutdown was averted minutes before a 6 p.m.
employer deadline Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents West Coast shipping
lines and terminal operators, had announced Thursday afternoon that
it would lock out workers, starting with the 8 a.m. shift today, in
response to a series of alleged worker slowdowns at a Long Beach
terminal.</LD>
<LD>   The lockout was called off when the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union dispatched full work crews to the Stevedoring
Services of America terminal for the evening shift. The company had
been complaining since Monday that the union was failing to provide
key equipment operators--stranding a ship loaded with millions of
dollars worth of cargo containers from China and backing up other
scheduled vessels.</LD>
<TE>   The drama capped a week of escalating tensions between the
management group and the union, now in their fourth month of
difficult contract negotiations. Each side accused the other of
manufacturing Thursday's crisis to gain leverage in the talks, which
are focused on the introduction of labor-saving technology.</TE>
<TE>   Though frustrated by the day's developments, each side warned that
the brinkmanship could continue.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the bodies tonight, but we'll see what happens tomorrow,"
said ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone. He denied there was a slowdown,
saying the union simply did not have enough skilled equipment
operators to handle the glut of work.</TE>
<TE>   But the management group said the availability of workers Thursday
night proved the shortage had been a false one. "Suddenly the union
found enough people to do the work," said PMA spokesman Steve
Sugarman.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers said Thursday they believed the turmoil had worsened
congestion at the ports, which are already busy with record levels of
cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mess. And it's costing me money," said trucker Juan M.
Sanchez, who was stuck in a long line of big rigs Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A lockout--in which the workers are barred from entering the
terminals--would strand millions of dollars worth of merchandise in
the nation's busiest port complex. The combined ports, which handle
about 60% of the coast trade, moved a record 900,000 containers in
the months of June, July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Union and industry sources said any labor disruptions could
quickly spread to other West Coast ports if union members act in
sympathy. The contract being negotiated covers about 10,500
dockworkers from San Diego to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   A coast-wide shutdown could cost the U.S. economy $1 billion a
day, according to a UC Berkeley study. A disruption now would come
during the peak holiday shipping season.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a lockout or strike, there is an expectation that the
Bush administration would intervene to keep the ports open.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Director Peter J.
Hurten called for labor and management to "stand down" and offered
his services.</TE>
<TE>   "Before bringing this nation to a standstill through means of a
work stoppage or lockout, we encourage the parties to exhaust all
means available to them to settle this dispute," he said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Long before negotiations began in mid-May, PMA President Joseph
Miniace said he would lock out the union if he detected a slowdown.
He claimed the tactic was used to extract concessions during previous
contract talks, which the union denied. Miniace said a complete
shutdown would be more cost-effective than a slowdown, which he
described as "a strike with pay."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, the union blamed terminal operator
Stevedoring Services of America for taking a hard line during
negotiations and blocking a deal. Union demonstrations were held in
front of SSA facilities in Long Beach, Oakland and Seattle on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty at the ports has unnerved importers and exporters,
who are worried about keeping shelves stocked and assembly lines
running in a just-in-time world.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Karen Robinson-Jacobs contributed to this
report.</TE>

<LD>The NASD said banks increasingly are using loans to strong-arm
companies into hiring them for investment-banking business and warned
its members that the practice is illegal.</LD>
<LD>   The NASD, formerly the National Assn. of Securities Dealers,
oversees firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which have
complained to regulators about banks tying loans to underwriting or
advisory work because it has cost them business. The NASD also
regulates the securities arms of commercial lenders such as J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee in July said he was investigating the practice and asked
regulators to demonstrate what they were doing to prevent it.</LD>

<LD>Reports showing a slide in housing starts and a persistently high
number of workers seeking unemployment aid strengthened signals that
the economic recovery is stuck in the slow lane.</LD>
<LD>   Housing starts fell 2.2% in August, their third monthly decline in
a row, the Commerce Department reported. The housing sector, while
still at historically high levels, lost more steam than analysts were
expecting.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said first-time applications for
jobless insurance stood at 424,000 in the week ended Sept. 14. The
four-week average of initial claims, a less volatile measure of
employment conditions, rose to its highest level since May.</LD>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   HealthSouth Corp., facing criticism for cutting earnings forecasts
and shareholder accusations of insider trading by its top executive,
said it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The news sent HealthSouth's stock down $1.11, or 27%, to $3.05 on
the NYSE. The stock has lost more than $3 billion, or 70%, of its
market value since Aug. 27, when HealthSouth said changes in Medicare
reimbursement would cut its earnings by $175 million annually. The
company also withdrew its earnings forecast for the year and said it
would not provide 2003 guidance until December.</TE>
<TE>   Public and investor scrutiny has focused on Chairman Richard
Scrushy and his stock sales. Scrushy was reported to have sold more
than 2.5 million shares back to the company in July, about a month
before HealthSouth issued its earnings warning. He also sold nearly
5.3 million shares in May. Scrushy said he had no knowledge of the
Medicare changes before he sold the stock.</TE>

<LD>   EchoStar Communications Corp.'s proposed $18.3-billion purchase of

antitrust division will decide "as quickly as possible" whether to
challenge the combination or impose conditions to allow the
combination.</TE>

fell 28 cents to $8.82 and General Motors shares dropped $1.29 to

<HD>Firestone, Ford Settle Suit Over SUV Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co. settled a lawsuit with
a woman who blamed a 1999 accident on the design and manufacturing
flaws of her Explorer, which had Firestone tires, her lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Cristina Hernandez's 1997 Explorer rolled over near Bakersfield,
injuring her and killing a sorority sister. Hernandez's lawyer said
in court Thursday that his client agreed to settle the case for an
undisclosed amount.</LD>
<LD>   The companies have reached settlements in hundreds of cases after
U.S. safety officials linked Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport
utility vehicles to 271 highway deaths. Terms of those settlements
haven't been disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement "is going to teach Firestone and Ford that when
they make a defective product, they have to take it off the market,"
said John Denove, Hernandez's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez's case was one of the first to go to trial. None of the
injury cases involving Explorers with Firestone tires has gone to a
jury verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Firestone agreed to settle the case to end potentially lengthy
litigation, said spokesman Dan MacDonald. "There's been no admission
of wrongdoing. We just don't think protracted litigation is in
anyone's best interest."</TE>
<TE>   Ford did not comment on the settlement. Its shares closed down 39
cents to $9.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Toyota to Build 2nd Plant in Tijuana</HD>
<DH>Autos: Light truck factory and pickup bed facility under
construction nearby are part of a major North American expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. will announce this morning plans to build a truck
assembly plant in Tijuana, part of a major North American expansion.
Today's announcement ends months of speculation about the Japanese
auto maker's plans for enlarging its presence in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The plant will be built on a 700-acre site Toyota owns in the Baja
California border city.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota is already building a plant there for production of pickup
truck beds for its small pickup, the Tacoma. Company sources said
Thursday that the new factory will use the remainder of the property
and be dedicated to light trucks--a category that could include the
Tacoma; Toyota's other, larger pickup, the Tundra; or sport utility
vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota builds 150,000 Tundras a year at New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont in Northern California, a joint venture
of Toyota and General Motors Corp. A NUMMI spokesman said Thursday
that the new Tijuana assembly plant will not affect the California
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Sources at Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA said the new
truck facility in Baja would increase Toyota's overall production.</TE>
<TE>   It is expected that the Tijuana plant will turn out trucks for the
Mexican and U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   Rising wages and low interest rates in Mexico have spurred Toyota
sales there in the last year. The firm's U.S. sales have risen as
well, prompting Toyota to look for ways to produce more cars and
trucks closer to where they're sold.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Tijuana truck bed and truck assembly plants,
Toyota has said it will increase production capacity at its car and
truck factory in Ontario, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Economic development officials in Alabama told the Birmingham News
this week that Toyota is seeking a site in the Southern states for a
$750-million automotive assembly plant.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian expansion would add 30,000 vehicles a year at the
Ontario plant, for a total of 250,000. The increase would boost
employment there by 700 to 3,900. A new U.S. plant probably would
employ at least 1,500 at start-up.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota is the largest import brand in North America and its U.S.
market share as of August had climbed to 10.47%, up from 10.1% a year
earlier. Sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans have
been responsible for much of the gain.</TE>
<TE>   Globally, Toyota has said it intends to capture a 15% market share
over the next decade, with much of the growth coming in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   "They have disclosed their ambition, and to achieve it they will
need more manufacturing capacity," said Jim Hossack, an industry
analyst with Tustin-based market consultant AutoPacific Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota has five North American plants, all operating at or near
capacity, according to analysts at J.D. Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   A sixth facility, a $220-million V-8 engine factory, is under
construction in Huntsville, Ala. The Tijuana truck plants will bring
the total to eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in May that Toyota was considering a full-scale
assembly plant in Mexico in addition to the Tijuana truck bed
facility. Mexican government sources at the time said Japan's largest
auto maker intended to spend more than $100 million on a new plant,
which would add more than 1,000 jobs to the region's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Automotive parts makers typically follow production plants, and
Mexican authorities said they expected a dozen or so such firms to
open in the area to serve Toyota.</TE>

<HD>Judge Puts on Hold $10-Million Bail Offer for Former Tyco
Chief Executive</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors will probe whether funds from
Kozlowski's ex-wife are linked to alleged looting of firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski
headed for a prison cell on Rikers Island, his ex-wife agreed to post
the $10 million in cash to secure his bail. But a judge Thursday put
her gesture on hold.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said they need to determine whether the money is tied
to the alleged $600-million looting of the conglomerate when
Kozlowski served as chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Kozlowski will be permitted to remain free at least until Sept.
27, when state Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus holds a hearing on
the questions raised by the prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Kozlowski attorney Stephen Kaufman said his client's former wife,
Angie Kozlowski, agreed to post $10 million in cash and a statement
from a brokerage firm backing up the source of the money.</TE>
<TE>   "She is just supporting her ex-husband," he said. Kaufman added
that she would be available for the hearing next week.</TE>
<TE>   He said she was not sure whether the money came from assets that
may be part of the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz were
charged by a New York grand jury with enterprise corruption and grand
larceny for allegedly stealing $600 million from Tyco. They face up
to 25 years in prison on each of those charges if convicted. They
were accused of using Tyco as their own "personal piggy bank" to
finance a lavish lifestyle, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which filed a separate civil lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   At last week's arraignment, Obus released the two men after
setting a $100-million personal recognizance bond on Kozlowski and a
$50-million bond on Swartz. But the judge froze $600 million in
assets, hindering their ability to come up with bail, which would be
10% of the bond amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman said earlier in the week that Manhattan prosecutors
rejected Kozlowski's offer to post his ex-wife's Connecticut home,
valued at about $10 million, according to the lawyer, or municipal
bonds she holds that are worth about the same amount.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a person with knowledge of the case told Associated
Press on Thursday that Tyco is selling the Fifth Avenue apartment and
its antiques and furnishings that Kozlowski allegedly bought with
Tyco money.</TE>
<TE>   Sotheby's auction house has been in the $16.8-million home to look
it over, but it has not yet been appraised, the person said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Manhattan Dist. Atty. John Moscow on Thursday told Obus
he is concerned that the assets offered by Kozlowski's ex-wife might
be tainted.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman, however, said the money was paid to her by Kozlowski as
part of their divorce settlement in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "When the bail is posted, we will check it out," Moscow said.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz's lawyer, James Mitchell, said his client would seek to
post Tyco stock he owns valued at $6.7 million to cover his
$50-million bail. The shares Swartz is seeking to pledge were given
to him by Tyco when he joined the company in 1995, Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   "I view it as outside the time frame of the indictment," Mitchell
said of the transfer of Tyco shares to Swartz.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments of the former Tyco executives were the latest by
state and federal prosecutors pursuing allegations of corporate
misconduct. Criminal charges also have been brought against former
officials at Adelphia Communications Corp., WorldCom Inc. and ImClone
Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares fell 63 cents to close at $15.29 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers also said they may seek to challenge the order
signed last week by a New York civil court judge freezing the assets.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman said defense lawyers believe a New York state judge can
freeze only New York assets. A hearing on that issue is scheduled for
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski owns homes in Boca Raton, Fla.; Nantucket, Mass.; and
Rye, N.H., which, the indictment states, were bought with money
obtained from Tyco employee loan programs he and Swartz are accused
of raiding.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Kozlowski and Swartz, former general counsel Mark
Belnick is charged with falsifying business records to hide more than
$14 million in company loans to himself. A lawyer for Belnick told
the judge his client would post his $1-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan prosecutors also are considering criminal charges
against former Tyco director Frank Walsh because of a payment he
received for aiding the company in its purchase of CIT Group Inc.
last year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar
with the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Two other unidentified executives also are being scrutinized by
the Manhattan district attorney's office for taking millions of
dollars in compensation that wasn't disclosed to the Tyco board, the
paper said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco paid $10 million to Walsh in July 2001 and another $10
million to a charitable fund of which he is trustee, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom May Disclose More Accounting Errors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. may tell regulators as early as today that it uncovered
billions of dollars in additional accounting errors, sources familiar
with the situation said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   One source told Reuters that the latest errors could total as much
as $3 billion. The Wall Street Journal, citing "people close to the
situation," said the additional accounting snafus totaled $2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone and data services
company, had previously disclosed more than $7.2 billion of
accounting problems. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
civil fraud charges against WorldCom in June, and the Department of
Justice is conducting a probe of its own.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the Clinton, Miss.-based firm declined to comment
on reports of additional errors.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is expected to disclose the latest errors to the SEC in a
report outlining its final tally of the accounting irregularities
uncovered by the company's internal investigations, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The specific accounting errors were not immediately clear. The
Wall Street Journal said some of the latest problems are related to
the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, the parent company of MCI, filed for the world's largest
bankruptcy in July after disclosing that it had inflated its profit
by improperly booking $3.9 billion in expenses. Last month, the
company uncovered an additional $3.3 billion in accounting errors.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, WorldCom also said it may take a $50.6-billion
charge for goodwill, and other charges to write down the value of its
property and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Additional restatements won't affect its plan to emerge from
bankruptcy intact, the company's chief restructuring officer said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The earnings restatements have no real connection to our ongoing
business, our reorganization or our viability," said Greg Rayburn,
who was hired by WorldCom to help lead the company through its
Chapter 11 filing. WorldCom aims to emerge from bankruptcy by
mid-2003.</TE>

<HD>Shameless 'Banger Sisters' Tidies Everything Up, Even the
'60s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Banger Sisters" is a practiced piece of Hollywood hokum, way too
calculated and contrived, especially for a film that nominally
celebrates the chaos and creativity of the 1960s. But, of course,
it's the Geritol version of the '60s that is being presented here,
the comfy equivalent of a pair of jeans with an adjustable waistband
that obligingly offers just a skosh more room to house complacent
sensibilities.</LD>
<LD>   That is more of a pity than it sounds, not because the '60s
deserve better, but because the film's stars, Goldie Hawn and Susan
Sarandon, definitely do and because the notion that started it all
has undeniable potential.</LD>
<LD>   What would happen, writer-director Bob Dolman wondered, if a pair
of celebrated '60s rock groupies (think the Plaster Casters) who
hadn't been in touch for decades got together again and had to deal
with how their lives and philosophies had diverged.</LD>
<TE>   It's a cute idea, but the result is so shameless that even the fun
these actresses have with their roles isn't enough to compensate for
the difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "The Banger Sisters" opens at the Whisky on the Sunset Strip. Yet
another new band is playing, but the face behind the bar has been
there awhile.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Suzette (Hawn), still talking about the time Jim
Morrison passed out on top of her, and still drinking rum and Cokes
like there is no tomorrow. Which, it turns out, there isn't.</TE>
<TE>   For despite her protestations that "I'm fun, people love me, I'm
Suzette," the Whisky's manager fires her before the opening credits
are over.</TE>
<TE>   Shaken up and short on cash, Suzette decides to drive her
dilapidated auto to Phoenix to reconnect with, and possibly borrow
money from, Vinnie (Sarandon), the woman who was once her party-girl
soul mate.</TE>
<TE>   She explains all this to Harry (Geoffrey Rush), a disgruntled
screenwriter (there's a first) who, in the earliest of innumerable
coincidences, just happens to pop up headed for Phoenix at the exact
moment Suzette runs out of money for gas.</TE>
<TE>   Harry is a piece of work himself, the yin to Suzette's yang.
Fussy, phobic, a worshiper of order who hasn't had sex in 10 years,
Harry is headed to Phoenix for what sounds like some ominous
unfinished business with his father.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who's familiar with the movies' love for odd couple
dynamics knows he's headed for some kind of relationship with Suzette
as well.</TE>
<TE>   As for Vinnie, who now prefers to be known as Lavinia, she is
closer to being a female version of Harry than Suzette could have
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   A prim, buttoned-up, beige-wearing suburban type determined to be
the perfect wife and mother, Lavinia may be less than thrilled to see
Suzette, but she could clearly do with some loosening up.</TE>
<TE>   For not only do Lavinia's husband and children have no idea about
her counterculture past, her daughters, wouldn't you know it, don't
respect her.</TE>
<TE>   Older child Hannah (Erika Chistensen) is experimenting with
illegal substances without parental consent or knowledge, while
younger sibling Ginger (Eva Amurri, Sarandon's daughter) is having
tantrums all over the place.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than that, all this bourgeois luxury has made Lavinia, yes,
lose track of her true rebel spirit. For the '60s turn out to be
something like the Mafia, a secret society that, once you've been
properly initiated into it, you can't even think about leaving.</TE>
<TE>   With a setup like this and actresses so gifted, it's a given that
"The Banger Sisters" has amusing moments. Both performers, especially
Hawn, in effect taking on a 30-years-later version of the character
daughter Kate Hudson played in "Almost Famous," are suited to their
roles and enjoy being in each other's company, but it's not enough.</TE>
<TE>   For writer-director Dolman, whose writing credits including the
deeply middle-of-the-road "Willow" and "Far and Away," has come up
with the kind of scenario even the characters themselves can't seem
to believe. Like Harry, "The Banger Sisters" has a weakness for
excessive tidiness. The film's vision of the '60s is like a bland
cover version of a once-vibrant song. Even if you're tempted to sing
along, you know you're missing out on something.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, sexual content and some drug use.
Times guidelines: gleeful profanity and sexual humor.</TE>

<HD>Werner Herzog: Confounding, Distinctive</HD>
<DH>'Invincible,' stylized and operatic, is not his best but
displays the venerable filmmaker's power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Invincible" is a great title for a Werner Herzog movie. Throughout
his four-decade career, the New German Cinema pioneer has
determinedly portrayed the outer limits of human experience. In his
documentaries and fictional films, men and occasionally women are
driven to pursue the most formidable goals and to try to overcome the
most daunting challenges, whether deep in a jungle or deep in their
own crazed minds--or both.</LD>
<LD>   Herzog's first fictional theatrical release in a decade is not a
great film. The movie, in English, is too long and marred by a
certain stiffness because many of the actors aren't accustomed to the
language. This is compounded by Herzog having cast several
inexperienced actors in leading roles. At least no one is dubbed.</LD>
<LD>   Herzog is a powerful, unique visionary, and his material is
confounding and congenial to his impassioned, romantic sensibility.
It's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up
in "Invincible" and overlook its drawbacks, rooted as they are in the
perils and necessities of the international co-production that allow
such extravagantly distinctive films to be made.</LD>
<TE>   "Invincible" is not the best introduction to the director of such
challenging masterworks as "Every Man for Himself and God Against
All," "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" and "Fitzcarraldo." But perhaps
there are those who would rather embrace a flawed Herzog work for its
strengths than dismiss it for weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of Herzog's films, "Invincible" is based on a true story
so improbable that hardly anyone would dare invent it. Early in 1932
a Berlin talent agent (Ben-Tzion Hershberg) discovers in an Eastern
Poland shtetl Zishe Breitbart (Jouka Ahola), a young blacksmith of
astonishing strength. A simple, naive, inarticulate but not stupid
man, Zishe is content to stay in his idyllic village.</TE>
<TE>   But the agent is persuasive and knows what to do with Zishe when
he arrives in Berlin: Get Hanussen (Tim Roth) to feature him at his
fashionable, elegant cabaret. Hanussen is a clairvoyant and magician
who is popular with the increasingly powerful Nazi party, acclaiming
Hitler as a savior of the nation who will soon take over.</TE>
<TE>   Decked out in a silly Siegfried costume, Zishe represents strength
of body and Hanussen strength of mind. Zishe becomes alarmed by open
displays of anti-Semitism and Nazi aggression and brutality and by
Hanussen's abusive treatment of his lover, Marta (Anna Gourari), an
aspiring but stateless Czech concert pianist. What transpires is not
easy to predict, and the film's ironies compound.</TE>
<TE>   Working from a story and research compiled by Gary Bart, a
relative of Zishe (who plays Zishe's father), Herzog tells his story
with simplicity and heightened reality of a fable. Herzog's style is
operatic, his key scenes like stately tableaux of the German
Expressionist silent classics, with performances stylized
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Roth, as a fraud yet a compelling and brilliant figure of evil, is
the forceful presence we expect him to be, and his glowering manner
teeters amusingly on the edge of excess. And making a credible screen
debut is Ahola, a Finn who is twice winner of the World's Strongest
Man title. Ahola brings an innate sweetness to the courageous,
reflective Zishe and seems a natural actor.</TE>
<TE>   Gourari is striking-looking but overly self-conscious, while as
Benjamin, Zishe's beloved little brother, Jacob Wein is a tiresomely
precocious angel who delivers his lines by rote. Such familiar
stalwarts as Udo Kier and Hark Bohm lend welcome support.</TE>
<TE>   For all his exalted sense of grandeur, Herzog, in one of the
film's key achievements, is adept at evoking an intimate and complex
psychological tension between Hanussen and Zishe. It gives the film a
charge that might have been better sustained if "Invincible" had been
trimmed; even so, the film leaves a stirring impact.</TE>
<TE>   The period is evoked with care and imagination, and the film glows
with Peter Zeitlinger's cinematography. It has some bravura images
and surreal moments typical of Herzog, and composers Hans Zimmer and
Klaus Badelt have contributed a lovely score.</TE>
<TE>   Istvan Szabo's "Hanussen" (1988), which tells a different story,
is the more polished and coherent film and boasts a superb Klaus
Maria Brandauer in the title role. But "Invincible" is riskier and
covers more territory, and it is idiosyncratic. Nobody but Werner
Herzog could have made it, and that he got to do it at all is reason
to be grateful for "Invincible."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for some sexual and thematic elements. Times
guidelines: Adult themes and situations.</TE>

<HD>In a Shiny Venue, Sleater-Kinney Tears It Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The women of Sleater-Kinney are not trying to be discovered. They
seem thrilled enough with their place in the indie-rock underground,
as dependable heroes in their own punk-rock world, bringing springy
buzz tones and furious combat rock to fans ready to listen. No Gap
ads in Sleater-Kinney's future.</LD>
<LD>   "You guys are rowdy, that's good," singer-guitarist Carrie
Brownstein said from the stage at the Highlands on Wednesday, the
first of two nights at the Hollywood venue.</LD>
<LD>   The sound was a bit muddy at the club, where the show was moved
because of structural damage at the scheduled site, the El Rey
Theatre. But nothing could quite dilute the trio's 90 minutes of
furious wailing and venting and praising, in songs of sexual politics
and a world once again at war.</LD>
<TE>   When Brownstein asked if anyone in the crowd had been at this
polished nightclub before, not a single hand was raised.
Singer-guitarist Corin Tucker joked, "This is a step up for us. We're
playing parking lots in Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   Where they played hardly mattered. At its most explosive, the dual
guitars (set against the sharp, edgy beat of drummer Janet Weiss)
frequently coalesced into pure, uncompromising pop-rock-punk. Many of
the night's best moments were drawn from 2000's high-energy "All
Hands on the Bad One," an album possibly overlooked only because the
previous three had attracted such praise.</TE>
<TE>   The band's newest album, "One Beat," falls a bit short of those
heights, but only a bit, with indie-rock hooks less fanciful but
equally charged with intense harmonies and raw punk passages. By the
time Sleater-Kinney got to an astute version of the B-52's song
"Private Idaho," the music was spare and joyous, and as popular as
they want it to be.</TE>

<HD>It's Just Noisy Action, and That's Enough</HD>
<DH>The cool-looking Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas crank up the
mayhem in 'Ballistic.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Ridley Scott's "G.I. Jane," Demi Moore's character, in training
for the Navy SEALs as the first woman recruit, asks a medic why the
guys join. Explains the medic: "To blow [stuff] up." It would be hard
to find a more perfect expression of the primitive pleasure involved
with watching movies such as the new action movie "Ballistic: Ecks
Vs. Sever" than that. For years, one of my preferred ends to an
exasperating day has been to rent a Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer
movie, then settle back to watch stuff blow up. There's no defense
for movies like these, but neither do they warrant apology; they're
irresistibly watchable, like car wrecks.</LD>
<LD>   Big noisy nonsense, "Ballistic" stars Lucy Liu and Antonio
Banderas as operatives who wear their world-weariness with all the
insouciance of a couple of Milanese runway models. Directed by Thai
newcomer Kaos, who was born Wych Kaosayananda, and written by the
less flamboyantly named Alan McElroy, the film brings the two stars
together by way of all the usual rogue-agent complications and a
doozy of a plot twist: Liu's character, Sever, is a member of
something called the Orphan Class: Chinese girls who, instead of
being adopted by nice American families, have been raised to become
assassins by the Department Intelligence Agency, an outfit that
really exists and presumably did not vet the script.</LD>
<TE>   The agents are supposed to be sworn enemies but seem on friendly
enough terms to have coordinated their matching wardrobes of black on
black, with a few accents of color. As with Keanu Reeves in "The
Matrix," Liu also wears sunglasses with her overcoat, a confusing
combination when it comes to the weather, perhaps, but one that
secures her place in a long movie tradition of killers whose
appearance is as cool as their attitude. To that end, Liu and
Banderas both look great when running, shooting guns, sailing through
the air, shooting guns, riding his and her motorcycles, activities
that essentially sum up most of the action and plot, and, along with
the usual foreign-market concerns, help explain why neither actor
does much talking.</TE>
<TE>   As if to complement her minimalist dialogue, Liu brandishes
exactly two expressions as the flyweight terminator--impassive and
slightly less than impassive, the latter of which she reserves for
wielding flamethrowers and involves a soft furrowing between her
well-manicured eyebrows. When not furrowing, running or shooting, she
generally can be seen firmly standing her ground while posed against
the backlit sewer steam that wafts through every frame. She's as
ferocious as a Chihuahua (a really mean Chihuahua), which complements
Banderas, who brings his customary affability to the role of a former
FBI agent in mourning for his dead wife. Even (or maybe especially
when) throwing punches at Liu, he comes across as a nice guy.</TE>
<TE>   As with many contemporary action movie directors, Kaos, whose only
other feature was a 1998 film called "Fha," has made a study of John
Woo, James Cameron and the oeuvres of producer-auteurs Silver and
Bruckheimer (at least before the latter started on the road to
mid-cult respectability). "Ballistic" is a generic blur of metallic
blue and fireball orange set to the contrapuntal sounds of throbbing
techno and eardrum-puncturing noise. There's nothing terribly
original to any of it, outside of some impressively choreographed
stunt work, specifically a chase sequence that culminates with two
police cars pirouetting through the air with the sort of grace and
precision you associate with Russian skaters not Chevy Caprices.</TE>
<TE>   If low-end kicks were all that "Ballistic" had to offer, then
there would be nothing left to say; but watching this action movie
had an unexpected effect. Fairly early on in the film, there's a
frenetic sequence in which Sever almost single-handedly lays waste to
several downtown urban blocks while fending off fleets of heavily
armed agents and police. During the orchestrated mayhem, automobiles
crash, civilians run screaming, and in one disconcertingly lifelike
stunt, a sharpshooter falls to his death from a rooftop with the
camera chasing right after him. However simulated, the relentlessness
of Liu's blank purpose and the verisimilitude of the destruction
shaded the whole episode far darker than the filmmakers probably
imagined or wanted.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a moral judgment; it's just an observation about how
life has a way of changing even our more trivial distractions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong violence. Times guidelines: nonstop
gunfire, intensely realistic stunts but very little simulated
bloodshed.</TE>

<HD>Stations Win National Honors</HD>
<DH>Radio broadcasters' Marconi Awards recognize morning host
Big Boy, Power 106 and Christian outlet KFSH-FM.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They seem as different as can be--the hip-hop station and its
morning-show host, and the outlet for contemporary Christian
music--but they share recognition from their peers around the
country, who named them the best in the business for the past year.</LD>
<LD>   Big Boy, morning host at KPWR-FM (105.9), was named major-market
personality of the year in the National Assn. of Broadcasters Marconi
Awards last Saturday, while his station, Power 106, was named the
nation's contemporary hit radio station of the year. And Orange
County's KFSH-FM (95.9), the Fish, was named religious station of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   "Power 106 is like an industry standard. It's one of the top
stations as far as sound and air talent," said Dontay Thompson,
contemporary hit radio/rhythmic editor for the trade magazine Radio &amp;
Records. "They're like your friends who happen to be on the air.
They're all there to have fun, and they're all about the music and
the lifestyle, and they don't take themselves very seriously."</LD>
<TE>   Big Boy, whose "Big Boy's Neighborhood" airs from 5 to 10 a.m.
weekdays, said he and his cast of characters make sure they're having
a good time, because anything less would be audible to listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to laugh, I love to enjoy myself, and at the same time I
know I have responsibilities and am very serious," said Big Boy, who
has held the morning slot for five years. "My job, first, is to
entertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty much just trying to satisfy the audience. I'm not
really a guy to run after awards," he said. "But if it comes my way,
I'll take it with a smile."</TE>
<TE>   The success of Big Boy and the station as a whole relies on tenets
that seem basic but are often forgotten, said Jimmy Steal, KPWR's
program director and regional vice president for Emmis
Communications-Los Angeles, which also owns country station KZLA-FM
(93.9). He said Power 106 makes sure it knows its audience intimately
and stays consistent in offering what it wants, from music to the
types of products advertised.</TE>
<TE>   And the consistency has paid off: Power 106 was first in Los
Angeles for the spring ratings period, the most recent available,
while "Big Boy's Neighborhood" was the area's second-ranked
English-language morning show.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to ratings success, the Marconi Award voters also
consider stations' public service and innovative promotions.</TE>
<TE>   KPWR won in the same category in 1989, the first year of the
Marconis. "This really is the highest honor for broadcasters," Steal
said. "We're all pretty elated. Big Boy won because he's an
incredible natural talent.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great storyteller. The ability to weave a story without
the benefit of pictures is a great skill. I don't know if he's second
to anybody with that. And they're just slice-of-life stories," Steal
said, who added that the DJ's connection with the community is
integral to Big Boy's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Born Kurt Alexander in Chicago, Big Boy moved to Culver City at
age 2 and has lived in the area ever since. "I can talk about the
Culver City [High School] Centaurs and Palms Middle School," or
reminisce about a certain corner that used to hold a McDonald's, said
Big Boy, 33.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd take it as a blessing if it happened anywhere else," he said.
But succeeding in his hometown means "so many people who love you get
a chance to see you. They know exactly who you are and where you came
from and where you want to go."</TE>
<TE>   Big Boy, who also debuted Wednesday as a recurring character on
the new Fox television series "Fastlane," said he'll continue to ride
the success as long as he can.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been not busy before, so I don't mind being busy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The other winner in the Southland market this year was KFSH, the
contemporary Christian station that debuted only two years ago and
that won religious station of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really had a very rapid growth compared to many start-ups,"
said Dave Armstrong, vice president and general manager of Salem
Communications-Los Angeles, which operates KFSH and talk stations
KKLA (99.5 FM and 1240 AM) and KRLA-AM (870).</TE>
<TE>   He said the award is especially gratifying because industry peers
do the voting, and he credited his station's success to the same
recipe that Steal cited: knowing the audience, keeping the music
consistent and entertaining for listeners, and using innovative
promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Recently KFSH had an all-request day to benefit the WorldVision
ministry; listeners could ask for any song they wanted, as long as
they pledged to sponsor a child, a commitment of about $300 a year.
"We played 'Dancing Queen' by ABBA. Some people wanted to hear Led
Zeppelin, so we played Led Zeppelin," Armstrong said, and in so doing
garnered sponsorships for 515 children.</TE>
<TE>   He said the station also does much more audience research than
most Christian stations, to determine that they're playing exactly
what local listeners want to hear and not just following national
album charts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to connect with the people most likely to
listen to our station"--churchgoing Christians, Armstrong said. He
admitted, though, that compared with most radio stations, "our job is
a little easier. We know where they are once a week, usually."</TE>

<HD>In Buoyant 'Secretary,' Romance for Consenting Adults</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long ago, back when Mrs. Guy Ritchie was known as Madonna and
slithering about in various states of indiscretion with the likes of
Vanilla Ice, sadomasochism was all the rage. In film after film, in
one fashion magazine after another, someone in a dog collar could be
seen valiantly trying to stir the air with menace. For the most part,
this predatory chic was essentially about poses--gestures of defiance
rather than genuine subversion--as well as the timeless allure of
leather and photographer Helmut Newton. On screen or in magazines,
the only real fetishism anyone expressed was for commodities.</LD>
<LD>   In the new movie "Secretary," there's a fleeting image of two
lovers, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader, re-creating one
of Newton's most scandalous images, that of a beautiful young woman
wearing a riding saddle. In the original photograph, the sleekly
made-up model is wearing jodhpurs, boots and precious little else
underneath the saddle, along with a smile as serenely private and
mysterious as that of the Mona Lisa. In "Secretary," Gyllenhaal's Lee
Holloway is fully dressed, but instead of wrapping her mouth around a
secret, she's clamped down on a big, leafy carrot. If not for the
unwieldy vegetable she looks as if she'd be giggling (she's having
fun, not plumbing the abyss).</LD>
<TE>   Loosely based on a short story by literary naughty girl Mary
Gaitskill (from her fiction collection "Bad Behavior"), "Secretary"
is a gently bent old-fashioned romance about two people who are so
ideally suited for each other that they seemed doomed to never get it
together. When we first meet Lee she's being released from an
institution following a nervous breakdown. Now in her early 20s, she
has the baby-doll voice of a woman who can't reconcile her adult body
with the tiny person she feels herself to be; it's no wonder she's
been hacking away at her flesh since she hit adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   That's not healthy, but the best and smartest move director Steven
Shainberg makes, beyond his superb casting, is refusing to make a
huge deal out of Lee's pathology. Cutting herself is a mournful,
solitary ritual for Lee, not a psychological carnival act. It's gross
and it's disturbing, at times quietly harrowing, but what Shainberg
and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson understand is that the ritual
belongs to Lee (it's the only thing that does). Mucking about in
Lee's history and all the possible reasons she cuts herself won't do
her or the story any good. It isn't this woman's stigmata that need
tending to--it's the rest of her.</TE>
<TE>   This sounds heavier than it plays. For all the dolorous trim,
"Secretary" is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant
tone throughout, notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips
into pop Freudianism. Lee's parents fight, her dad drinks and sis is
bodacious and blond, but happily we don't spend much time with them.
The relationship that matters, that gives the film its spark, its
cheeky humor and its reason for being, is the one Lee develops with
her new boss, Mr. Grey (Spader), an obsessive-compulsive lawyer with
a fanatical loathing of typing errors and a predilection for sexual
dominance. It's a match made in dysfunctional heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Mr. Grey's strangely appointed warren of offices, amid the
sort of cross-cultural clutter that the Victorians favored--Oriental
hangings, swirling William Morris--style wall coverings, along with
the odd classical flourish--Lee discovers herself. One day, after
berating her for making typing errors (he doesn't like computers),
Mr. Grey surprises Lee with a spanking; she surprises herself still
more by not protesting. And so a love story not like every other
begins.</TE>
<TE>   In this hothouse atmosphere, Lee blossoms like one of Mr. Grey's
orchids. She begins to walk more confidently, to dress better; her
hair grows glossier, her complexion rosier. For her, love doesn't
just hurt--it stings, even through sensible A-line skirts.</TE>
<TE>   Although you wouldn't know it to judge by one of its posters,
"Secretary" is pretty tame, more sweet than salacious. You can
understand the distributor wanting to squeeze as much business out of
it as possible, but they've done the filmmakers and actors a
disservice by sleazing up the marketing. In the poster in question, a
woman is shown facing away from the camera, bent over, flaunting her
posterior, stilettos and flexibility. The image is misleading not
only because the woman is wearing a short dress and the sort of heels
they sell on Hollywood Boulevard (rather than Lee's modest attire),
but because her head is totally obscured. "Secretary" is all about
faces, particularly Gyllenhaal's, in whose face you can read a
veritable "Kama Sutra" of expressionism.</TE>
<TE>   As Mr. Grey, Spader is very fine as a spookier, more twitchy
version of the shuttered character he played in Steven Soderbergh's
"sex, lies and videotape" (he's like a junior Christopher Walken).
But it's Gyllenhaal who makes "Secretary" work, saving it from
titillation and sordidness as she turns a dormouse into a revelation.
There's relatively little nudity in the film, yet as the submissive
partner, it's Gyllenhaal who has to drop her drawers and strip
herself emotionally bare. She makes the character more complex than
it's written, including in Gaitskill's story, fiercely holding onto
Lee's dignity even when Mr. Grey's imagination (or Lee's) carries her
into some far-out places (and appliances).</TE>
<TE>   What's remarkable about the performance is how quickly Gyllenhaal
liberates Lee from the restrictive designation of "sick." Even before
she meets Mr. Grey, you can see the actor coaxing a real person from
what could have easily been a cardboard creation. Soon before Lee
applies for the position of secretary, she picks up the help-wanted
section of a newspaper. From the way her eyes melt and her features
brighten, you know that it isn't any individual job that she's
interested in as much as the possibilities inherent in the words
"help wanted." Like a lot of people who need saving, she's got
something of a Florence Nightingale complex. She may be hurting, but
warms to the idea that she could help someone else.</TE>
<TE>   In the original story, the secretary is a sullen creature who
doesn't get much out of her time with the lawyer beyond a few whacks
and paychecks. There isn't much to it in the sense that there's no
lurking metaphor--something about men and women and power and
sex--and the same is pretty much true of the film. Shainberg and
Wilson have greatly enlarged Gaitskill's story by giving the
characters richer inner lives and in doing so have expanded our sense
of why Lee and Mr. Grey do what they do. They're more sentimental
about the secretary--one of Lee's favorite cutting implements is the
sharpened ceramic foot of a ballerina figurine--but in their hands
she also seems more like a human being.</TE>
<TE>   That may not seem like a big deal but it is, especially when it
comes to movies and sex. What's so appealing about "Secretary" is
how, well, normal these people are. There may not be anything loudly
political about the film, but its makers clearly share that
old-fashioned American belief that whatever consenting adults do
behind closed doors is their business. The irony is that although
Shainberg and Wilson take their characters very seriously, they're
far less sacrosanct when it comes to the characters' kinks. That's
because unlike Madonna and Vanilla Ice, they know that the kinks, the
poses and the funny accouterments are finally beside the point. After
all, it isn't how you find each other--it's that you do.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexuality, some nudity, depiction of
behavioral disorders and language. Times guidelines: light bondage,
full-frontal female nudity and adult language. Images of the woman
cutting herself may be difficult for the squeamish.</TE>

<HD>'Four Feathers' Melts in Heat of the Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The key fact about "The Four Feathers" is not that the venerable,
100-year-old novel it's based on has already been filmed six times.
It's that three of those versions were silent, and the most famous
adaptation of all was made in 1939, likely before even the parents of
current stars Heath Ledger, Wes Bentley and Kate Hudson were born.</LD>
<LD>   There's a reason for this. This epic tale of military action and
romance is not only set in the Victorian world, it's key plot point
is so Victorian it's difficult to envision today's audiences
connecting to it. Sensing this, as well as for reasons of their own,
director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein
Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things, but
the barriers finally prove to be too great.</LD>
<LD>   Director Kapur, as witness his earlier "Elizabeth," does have a
natural gift for pageantry, and the best thing about the Robert
Richardson-photographed "The Four Feathers" is the vividness of a
look and sensibility that practically scream epic. With the Royal
Cumbrian regiment prancing around in nifty red jackets with gold
trim, this film's physical re-creation of Victorian Britain is
engaging.</LD>
<TE>   It's in Britain that we meet best friends and fellow Royal
Cumbrians Harry Feversham (Ledger), the son of a general, and Jack
Dorrance (Bentley), a brooding, dark-prince type of guy. Though no
one seems to notice, both are in love with the same girl, the
beautiful Ethne (Kate Hudson, pretty as an ivory cameo), who is in
fact engaged to marry the dashing Harry.</TE>
<TE>   Then the regiment gets the news that it is shipping out within a
week to fight Muslim fanatics in the Sudan led by a charismatic
leader called the Mahdi (played, once upon a time, by Laurence
Oliver, of all people, in "Khartoum"). Soldiers being soldiers,
almost everyone is delighted. Everyone except Harry.</TE>
<TE>   Handsome though he is, Harry had apparently never wanted to be a
soldier, and the assignment to the Sudan has crystallized these
feelings, causing him to resign his commission. Though the film can't
seem to decide whether Harry is a man of conscience or a shirker, his
friends have no such doubts. Three of them, plus Ethne, give him the
dreaded white feather, a symbol that they regard him as--gasp!--a
coward!</TE>
<TE>   It is the conceit of "The Four Feathers" that getting these flimsy
plumes so shames and mortifies Harry that he goes to the Sudan on his
own, disguises himself as an Arab and eventually moves heaven and
earth (as well as drinks camel's blood) to help out his pals.</TE>
<TE>   In today's me-first age, where public denial of guilt by the most
culpable is an everyday event and a sizable portion of the population
thinks downloading music is next door to a constitutional right, the
idea of your life being ruined by an abstract code of moral conduct
symbolized by a feather sounds like the faint echo of a bygone time.</TE>
<TE>   Once the British get to the Sudan, the film begins to depart from
its Victorian roots and gains distinctly modern touches, some of them
likely unintentional. The Mahdi sounds like a precursor of Osama bin
Laden, and seeing British soldiers chasing an elusive Islamic foe in
an inhospitable desert climate looks like an eerie prefiguration of
U.S. troops in Iraq. And in what feels like a pointed jab at 20th
century American imperialism, one character bluntly proclaims, "You
English walk too proudly on the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   If the 1939 British-made "The Four Feathers" had no trouble
justifying colonialism, the attitude of this film is less
straightforward, something that might be expected given that both
director Kapur and co-screenwriter Amini come from cultures that were
the victims of colonialism, not its perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   So the new "Four Feathers" is as intent on showing British
savagery and stupidity as in depicting traditional heroism. The film
even departs from previous versions by giving Harry a Tonto-like
sidekick, Abou Fatma ("Amistad's" Djimon Hounsou), without whose help
he could never have survived, all that camel's blood notwithstanding.
Whether this is progress or not is unclear, but it is different.</TE>
<TE>   All these intriguing good intentions, however, have largely gone
for naught because of a variety of missteps, starting with an
increasing implausible plot as well as the fact that Ledger's Harry
looks about as likely to pass for an Arab as the Mahdi is to pass for
Queen Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "The Four Feathers" gradually loses its interest in the
pageantry that is its strength, opting instead for scenes of
suffering as Harry and a pal find themselves incarcerated in a
squalid prison camp. This section overshadows all else and turns the
ending anticlimactic, not to mention making it seem as if the
filmmakers are punishing the Brits for the horrors inflicted on their
ancestors. Empire may not have been as glorious as the Victorians
imagine, but does it have to be this taxing?</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for intense battle sequences, disturbing
images, violence and some sensuality. Times guidelines: Some of the
scenes of war, imprisonment and torture are fairly graphic.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Mays dropped into town Monday night, displaying the musical
skills that have been the wellspring for a long, diverse artistic
career. The New York-based pianist, once a Southland regular, has a
resume filled with far-ranging achievements, from his time as music
director for Sarah Vaughan in the early '70s to his participation in
hundreds of television and film soundtracks during a 12-year stint in
Los Angeles recording studios, as well as writing arrangements for a
list of artists that includes Woody Herman, Shelly Manne, Bud Shank
and Phil Woods.</LD>
<LD>   Mays' performance at the Jazz Bakery with bassist Tom Warrington
and drummer Joe LaBarbera was, however, the work of a player
who--despite his many other activities--has remained firmly in
contact with the sheer pleasures of jazz improvisation.</LD>
<LD>   And the nods of approval and smiles of appreciation he frequently
tossed in the direction of his two companions underscored how much
fun he was having during an evening in which the emphasis seemed to
be upon upbeat, briskly swinging music.</LD>
<TE>   In his interpretations of standards, Mays' experience as a vocal
accompanist and a composer-arranger were ever-present in his solos.
Well-crafted, filled with intriguing melodic counter phrases, his
choruses unfolded with the logic and the connectiveness of
preconceived compositions.</TE>
<TE>   He enhanced his improvisational choices with an impressive degree
of tonal coloration and variation.</TE>
<TE>   The most entertaining number in Mays' set was a humorous but
musically engaging combination of Bach and Charlie Parker, "Bach
Meets Bird," in which he blended elements of the Bach Two Part
Invention in F and Parker's "Ah-Leu-Cha," with bits and pieces from
other bop tunes tossed in for good measure. It was a good example of
the sort of lightheartedness that serves jazz well, opening up the
music to listeners leery of improvisational journeys through more
discordant musical landscapes.</TE>

<HD>Wildly Racy 'Lysistrata' Ends Up a Silly Romp</HD>
<DH>The play's antiwar message wavers amid sexual references in
an uneven production in Hollywood.</DH>

<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lysistrata," the Aristophanes classic about women on a "no peace, no
sex" strike, is adult, earthy fare, a ribald romp with a serious
antiwar message.</LD>
<LD>   Without a deft touch, though, this racy play, with its plethora of
references to genitalia and intercourse and such bawdy sights as
wildly exaggerated phalluses, risks seeming silly and
self-conscious--and that's the case at the wildly uneven outdoor
production of the classic at Stages Theatre Center.</LD>
<LD>   Irena Stepic, who co-designed and co-produced this Germaine
Greer-Phil Willmott adaptation, directs a cast of veteran and less
polished actors. She also stars in the title role, but her heavily
accented English and such fervent utterances as "How can you fight
like the mad dogs on each others' throats" undermine her undeniably
sincere passion.</LD>
<TE>   Co-producer and cast member Ana Divac's husband, NBA star Vlade
Divac, makes a game cameo appearance on video, opening the show as a
TV news anchor. This and women-on-the-street video interviews are
modest highlights in this not-ready-for-prime-time independent
production.</TE>

<HD>Sour '8 Women' Needs a Dash of Douglas Sirk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For "8 Women," the young director Francois Ozon has congregated some
of the greatest actresses in French cinema--but having gotten his
women, like too many men, he doesn't know what to do with them.</LD>
<LD>   A summit of icons and heartbreaking beauty, the cast of "8 Women"
includes Danielle Darrieux, Catherine Deneuve, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle
Huppert, Emmanuelle Beart and Virginie Ledoyen, who have worked with
some of their country's finest directors in some of their most
memorable films. (In a particularly French twist, Deneuve and Ardant
were involved with one of those directors, Francois Truffaut, whose
romantic tragedy "The Woman Next Door" was inspired by his affair
with Deneuve and made the then-unknown Ardant a star.)</LD>
<TE>   The excuse for this confabulation of chic is a genre pastiche that
looks something like Douglas Sirk and plays out a bit like Agatha
Christie. It's the late 1950s, and eight women are stranded in an
isolated country manor with the body of a dead man. Deneuve is the
man's wife, Gaby, while Huppert plays Gaby's sister, Augustine, and
Darrieux, the pair's alcoholic nag of a mother, Mamy. The story takes
off soon after Gaby's daughter Suzon (Ledoyen) returns home from
college for Christmas break, and the tarty chambermaid, Louise
(Beart), discovers the body. (Also in residence are Gaby's youngest
daughter, Catherine, played by Ludivine Sagnier, and the housekeeper
Madame Chanel, played by Firmine Richard.)</TE>
<TE>   A raging torrent of insults, accusations and confessions follows
the discovery, and, as in any number of Agatha Christie mysteries, it
isn't long before each of the eight women has become at once an
accuser and the accused. It's the old war of all against all--though
here the combatants are dressed in couture and periodically break
into song and dance--and for the first hour or so, it isn't bad. The
women swirl about in a blur of bright color and giddy emotion like
drunk butterflies, and every so often Deneuve, Huppert or Ardant
steps forward to remind you that there are some grown-ups on the set.</TE>
<TE>   As the dead man's sister, Ardant pays red-hot homage to Rita
Hayworth. Huppert, in turn, plays the neurotic Augustine to the edge
of self-parody with a lot of eyeball popping and teeth gnashing,
while Deneuve moves through the scenery with her glacial hauteur, an
iceberg into which the rest of the women continually crash. Ozon has
said that he wanted to shoot a new version of Clare Boothe Luce's
viperous comic play "The Women," had been softened up for the screen
by director George Cukor in his 1939 adaptation. When Ozon discovered
that the remake rights to the Luce drama weren't available, he turned
to an obscure French play called "8 Women," written by the late
Robert Thomas; he and Marina De Van then shaped it into a screenplay.
Thomas' play--or at least what Ozon has fashioned from it--doesn't
offer much improvement on Luce's splenetic view toward her gender.
Although it starts off vaguely amusing, "8 Women" grows progressively
sour, curdled by the filmmakers' bad faith and lack of compassion. It
isn't just the tone that's off; it's the point. Pastiche is always
difficult to pull off, but it's close to impossible when you don't
have a feel for the original material. During the late 1950s, Sirk
made a series of lush Hollywood melodramas about pampered, privileged
women who endure crucibles of suffering in homes that resemble
mausoleums. The women shed glycerin tears while wearing mink stoles.
But although their lives were patently (and purposely) absurd, the
characters themselves never were.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if Ozon has picked up on the excesses of Sirk's style, he has
mistaken the Hollywood auteur's ironic detachment for wholesale
cynicism. Beneath their crinoline and endless chattering, Ozon's
women hide a world of misery (one is even carrying an illicit child);
they're victims as well as perpetrators of their ridiculous
circumstances. If the director doesn't notice any of this, it may be
because he seems more interested in making sport of his actresses
and, just possibly, the directors with whom their legends were made.
It may be a stretch, but it's hard not to think that when Ozon puts
Deneuve and Ardant in the same film simply to throw them into a
catfight that the real object of his rancor may be Truffaut.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for some sexual content. Times guidelines: adult
language and themes, with one fully clothed lesbian encounter.</TE>

<HD>A Wild Ride Through Fujita's Sex and Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sex and violence play such a big role in the movie industry that the
last 50 years of film would be inconceivable without them. The same
can't be said about the visual arts.</LD>
<LD>   For all kinds of reasons, painters have focused on other subjects,
leaving the spectacle of these supposedly base impulses to lowbrow
entertainments as high art strives to occupy the moral high ground.</LD>
<LD>   Gajin Fujita has no patience with such sanctimonious
shortsightedness. At L.A. Louver Gallery, his first solo show in Los
Angeles embraces sex and violence as if they were going out of style.
Marshaling the raw physical power of both subjects for his own
purposes, Fujita, 30, uses them to stake out a place for himself--and
anyone with similar sympathies--in an art world long dominated by
lifeless abstractions and bloodless Conceptualism.</LD>
<TE>   Eight eye-popping paintings fill two pristine galleries with
visual punch and graphic drama. When you enter Fujita's world you're
in for a wild ride. The centerpiece of the exhibition, "Gold State
Warriors," is a 5-foot-by-16-foot panel that depicts four sword-and
gun-wielding samurai.</TE>
<TE>   Strutting in front of a graffiti-covered wall whose brickwork
consists of alternating squares of gold and silver leaf, the fierce
warriors strike contorted poses that recall the formalized pantomime
of Kabuki and the whiplash animation of Saturday-morning cartoons.
Nearly lost in the Pop excitement is another distant ancestor: The
lavender and blue kimonos worn by Fujita's larger-than-life figures
mimic the positions of the angled vertical forms in Jackson Pollock's
"Blue Poles," whose allover energy generates a similarly dizzying
charge.</TE>
<TE>   "Dream" features an avenging angel about to decapitate a horned
demon with fire-engine-red skin. His fleeing companion looks back
with no remorse as L.A.'s skyline rises in the background like the
silhouetted gravestones in an old cemetery. The graffiti that
animates every square inch of this 8-foot-by-4-foot image consists of
R.I.P. messages to friends who have died before their time, often in
mindless street violence.</TE>
<TE>   Fujita is a lot less ambivalent about sex than he is about
violence. "La Damsel," "Libido," "Swell" and "Bangin' " combine the
erotic acrobatics of traditional Japanese woodblock prints with the
stylized forms of Edo screen painting and the lavish patterns of
ornamental needlework. The explicit positions of the figures in these
variously scaled paintings, which measure from 8 inches to 8 feet on
a side, fit right in with the bold designs and graphic flourishes
that are Fujita's forte.</TE>
<TE>   He's at his best when he turns words into quasi-architectural
supports for decorative embellishments. Delicate flowers, puffy
clouds, graceful birds and waves made of curlicues are integral to
his vibrant pictures.</TE>
<TE>   So is color, which he deploys like a pyromaniac in charge of a
fireworks display.</TE>
<TE>   When words made their way into contemporary art, they had all the
visual dynamism of typewritten messages. Fujita makes playful fun of
such image-and-text Conceptualism, turning its tactics into a form of
rowdy street theater whose pleasures are all the more potent for
being riddled with risk.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Louver Gallery, 45 N. Venice Blvd., (310) 822-4955, through
Oct. 12. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leni Riefenstahl: Grace and Beauty in Africa</TE>
<TE>   The specter of Fascism still looms over the storied career of Leni
Riefenstahl. Born in 1902, she began her professional life as a
ballet dancer in Berlin in the early 1920s and then made a name for
herself as a silent-movie actress. International renown was hers at
32, when she was commissioned to direct her most famous film,
"Triumph of the Will." So was Hitler's stamp of approval, when the
Nazi party used her groundbreaking documentary as a propaganda tool.</TE>
<TE>   Infamy followed. Unlike some Third Reich scientists, who came to
the United States after the war and started quietly working for the
government, Riefenstahl couldn't escape moral disdain. As is often
the case, art was a lightning rod. Her career came to a screeching
halt.</TE>
<TE>   She disappeared from public view, turned her attention to still
photography and took to traveling far off the beaten path, taking
pictures of people and places whose pasts were nothing like hers. At
72, she learned to scuba dive and began making underwater photographs
and videos. Today Riefenstahl, 100, lives in Germany, where she is
happy to see that her life's work is beginning to be seen in its own
right.</TE>
<TE>   At Fahey/Klein Gallery, 30 color photographs she made between 1962
and 1977 in a remote mountain valley in the Sudanese province of
Kordofan go a long way to show that there's nothing intrinsically
fascistic about Riefenstahl's art. Her stunning pictures of the Nuba
and Kau peoples reveal her to be a connoisseur of the grace, beauty
and strength of the human body--particularly when it's stripped
nearly naked, all the better to show off its physical magnificence
and sexy athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the images in Riefenstahl's second solo show in
North America are dye transfer prints whose lush colors capture the
stark sensuality and mirage-like shimmer of Saharan sunlight. All but
a few depict Kau men, women and children who live in the villages of
Nyaro and Fungor.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl doesn't mess around with the mundane. Every square
inch of every photograph is calibrated to heighten its dramatic
impact.</TE>
<TE>   When the men are not fighting ritualized battles with knives
strapped to their wrists, guarding villages with spears or attending
burial ceremonies covered in ash, they're seen in close-up.
Riefenstahl's portraits feature young men whose handsome faces are
painted in elaborate patterns with organic pigments. Feathers and
seedpods accentuate their close-cropped hair. Gold jewelry adds a
regal touch, and scarred foreheads never let you forget that power
and pain are inseparable parts of prestige. Necklaces, bracelets and
belts, as well as their hairdos and painstakingly scarred midriffs,
make the men's decorations look streamlined, like a Minimalist
version of Cubism.</TE>
<TE>   Riefenstahl's pictures of women are even more riveting. Many are
full-length portraits of lithe girls performing ecstatic dances,
their naked bodies coated with oil.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining photographs depict the more placid Mesakin Quissayr
Nuba, whose rituals are less bloody but no less fascinating.
Riefenstahl's distant shots of rocky mountainsides, dry fields and
dusty villages are equally otherworldly.</TE>
<TE>   Although these photographs document ways of life that have all but
disappeared in the 21st century, it's important to remember that
Riefenstahl is neither an anthropologist nor a tourist, but an
artist--an old-fashioned Romantic, whose quest for beauty has taken
her to the far ends of the Earth.</TE>

<TE>   Crystalline Photos Evoke Ancient Roman Opulence</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Antin's mural-scale photographs at Craig Krull Gallery are
not remarkable because of what they depict--scenes of debauchery and
decadence on the cusp of the apocalypse--but because of how they do
so: with such a queasy combination of over-the-top artifice and
too-good-to-be-true Realism that you can't be sure you're not
hallucinating.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "The Last Days of Pompeii," Antin's crystalline images
feature toga-clad folks idling away seemingly endless summer
afternoons at a fabulously manicured estate in Rancho Santa Fe. For
all its rose gardens, sweeping vistas, spacious patios and vaguely
classical colonnades, the luxurious residence might as well be a
movie set for an old-fashioned costume drama or an 18th century salon
painting of Roman opulence and lassitude.</TE>
<TE>   In one, the muscular bodies of two male wrestlers glisten in the
sunlight as eight pretty women lounge around in the grass. Some are
too bored to be bothered, but others look on intently, their
world-weary expressions alive with lasciviousness.</TE>
<TE>   In another color-saturated photograph, two brawny gladiators
barely get the attention of their reclining audience, despite
battling to the death. In a third, five inhabitants appear to have
been buried alive by a shower of gold coins.</TE>
<TE>   In a fourth, six beautiful women wrap themselves around an old
tree's serpentine branches. All stare, with mildly curious
expressions and general cluelessness, at an unconscious woman lying
on the ground. Although she appears to have fallen out of the tree,
no one above budges from her perch.</TE>
<TE>   Antin's photographs stick in the mind's eye because of their
unbelievable clarity and the sumptuous light that spills from their
surfaces. So crisp and vivid are so many of the figures' outlines
that you have to go up close to convince yourself that they're not
collaged on or added via a computer's digital tricks. Taking a cue
from the Pageant of Masters, the San Diego-based artist's pictures
tell some big truths by telling many little lies.</TE>

<TE>   Playing Color Against Expanses of Blankness</TE>
<TE>   Philip Argent's new paintings are so far ahead of the curve that
you have to be pretty sophisticated to know just how good they are.
Artists generally recognize what the Santa Barbara-based painter is
up to. As his sexy lexicon of color, shape and texture trickles into
their work, the viewing public will become more familiar with
Argent's innovations and recognize his importance.</TE>
<TE>   For now, his oddly formatted abstractions are so suave and
seductive that it's easy to disregard their formal toughness and the
vertiginous twists and turns they serve up with seemingly effortless
ease. The main room at Shoshana Wayne Gallery is a monster of a
space. More suited to sculpture than painting, its cavernous
dimensions swallow up all but the strongest of two-dimensional works.
Argent's seven acrylics on canvas command the space so gracefully
that its empty areas even feed into the brightly colored shapes and
razor-sharp lines he has laid out across the velvety smooth surfaces
of his rolled, brushed and sprayed paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Argent uses empty space better than any other painter working
today. Large expanses of cool whiteness cover more than half of each
canvas. These blank, squeaky-clean fields provide the eye with places
to rest amid the sweeping motions set up by the rest of his
compositions, which include ricocheting lines, warped windows and
sliced stripes, cartoon explosions, atmospheres choked with smoke and
blurry flourishes that look like rainbows made of Naugahyde.</TE>
<TE>   Argent's palette starts where Lari Pittman's and Howard Arkley's
leave off--in a world of weirdly beautiful tertiary colors that would
be ugly in the hands of lesser talents. A leader among fellow sci-fi
futurists Adam Ross, Stephen Herr, Dimitri Kozyrev and Bart Exposito,
Argent makes up-to-the-minute computer graphics look like yesterday's
news.</TE>

<HD>This 'Diva' Is Way Out of Control</HD>

<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cry from its maker's id--where it no doubt howled for years--Asia
Argento's "Scarlet Diva" is pure narcissism run deliriously amok. The
Italian actress, currently out-scowling Vin Diesel in "XXX," is the
daughter of horror director Dario Argento, whose resume includes
grisly 1970s shockers such as "Deep Red" and "Suspiria," but whose
legend for the outrageous has been increasingly outstripped, in more
ways than one, by his attention-grabbing offspring.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, the then-21-year-old starred in her father's grotesquerie
"The Stendahl Syndrome" as a homicide detective who in the course of
an investigation is stripped naked and raped, all under the pitiless
gaze of the camera. Watching the film then you could only feel that
either the Argentos were paragons of a certain kind of European cool
(if somewhat more outre than the Swedes) or completely out of their
minds. "Scarlet Diva" now, however, makes it plain that what runs
through this family's veins isn't ice but molten lava.</LD>
<TE>   Shot in digital video, "Scarlet Diva" is Asia Argento's first
feature--she wrote it, directed it and stars in it, from first scene
to last. Part confessional, part endurance test, the
semiautobiographical story traces la dolce vita--and often acido--of
Italy's biggest movie star, Anna Battista, through a series of erotic
encounters with an assortment of men and one ardently insistent
woman. Along the way, Anna falls in love with a singer whose idea of
romance is to leave her a pair of his used leather jeans, endures a
whopper of a drug-induced freak-out and frantically dodges a sleazy
Hollywood producer (played by cult painter Joe Coleman). And, to her
lasting credit as an artist, as a madwoman and as a diva learns ...
absolutely nothing.</TE>
<TE>   As in one of those 18th century novels about female virtue,
everyone wants some of Anna--the difference being that in contrast to
the put-upon heroines of those earlier fictions, Argento's alter ego
is mostly obliging. It isn't that she's a bad girl; rather, as with
Ado Annie in "Oklahoma!" she just can't say no. For all her
shenanigans and lapses in good sense, there is something essentially
sweet, even naive about the character, a trait shared by her
director. Argento would probably like us to see this naivete as
having to do with the eternal soul of the artist or even spiritual
immanence (she does have an angel tattooed on her belly), but her
storytelling is at once too raw and seriously overcooked to bear that
kind of weight.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most self-indulgent vanity projects in memory, "Scarlet
Diva" is extreme in every sense save for the one area that likely
matters most to Argento--as art. It's a demented kitsch mess
(although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative),
but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much
of what will open this year. If nothing else, it has the courage of
its own lunatic convictions: When Anna first sleeps with the singer,
she murmurs that she's actually shy--then quickly strips to nothing
but her stockings, shoes and tattoos, a feather boa snaking around
her throat. She may be bashful but Anna--and Argento--know exactly
how to get your attention.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Any doubts that Harold Gould would make a great Lear are eliminated
by "Fellow Traveler" at Malibu Stage Company. As Arnold Priest, the
caustic protagonist of John Herman Shaner's new play, this
treasurable artist eviscerates himself and everyone within earshot.</LD>
<LD>   Shaner introduces Arnold in 1996, torn by his memoirs, updates of
the July 2 Russian election results, and long-suffering fourth wife
Providence (Mimi Cozzens).</LD>
<LD>   Once, Arnold and writing partner David (Michael Kagan) were
aligned with Stalin's masses and each other. Then things soured,
sending David back East, with Arnold ossifying into a network veteran
barricaded in his Hollywood Hills fortress of self-deception.</LD>
<TE>   Now, David has returned with holistic bride Evening Star (Molly
Weber) in tow. Their attempts to conceive have amassed medical debts,
reducing David to asking a favor.</TE>
<TE>   Two studio whiz kids (David Barry Gray and Joshua Schulman) in
Arnold's orbit could supply this. The obstacle is contrarian Arnold
himself, leading to recriminatory admissions and spiritual
immolation.</TE>
<TE>   Director Charles Marowitz elicits compelling work from Gould and
his fellow absolute troupers. On opening night, Cozzens fainted
onstage but rebounded with exemplary grace. Kagan is excellent, Weber
outshines her device-ridden role, and Gray and Schulman offer
tickling satires of the New Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Shaner's insider's ear for hilarity and hubris proves more
skillful than illuminating. The interweaving of ideological and
personal dilemmas isn't exactly profound, with the upbeat ending a
crowd-friendly cheat. Though recommended, "Traveler" would benefit
from the courage of its players' convictions.</TE>

<HD>Prisoners and Guards, a Mindless 'Experiment'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Das Experiment" is a revved-up potboiler that suggests,
intentionally or otherwise, that all it takes for ordinary Germans to
reveal their inner Nazi is to give them power over others. Amazingly,
it has been taken seriously enough to cop some festival prizes; less
surprisingly, it has been a huge hit on home ground.</LD>
<LD>   Working from an adaptation of the Mario Giordano novel "Black
Box," director Oliver Hirschbiegel punches up every development to
the max, constantly telegraphing the plot; his energy, however, never
flags as he goes for the visceral.</LD>
<LD>   The ferociously intense Dr. Klaus Thon (Edgar Selge), made in the
Josef Mengele mold, has placed a newspaper ad: "Test Participants
Needed--for 14 Days Experiment in Mock Prison." The idea is that of
the 20 men selected, eight will be guards and 12 prisoners. The
supposed purpose is to discover how the guards will maintain order,
ostensibly without resorting to violence, and how the inmates will
respond. Naturally, Dr. Thon hopes for behavior that goes to
extremes.</LD>
<TE>   He is not disappointed. Moritz Bleibtreu's Tarek Fahd is a
headstrong taxi driver, a dropout from journalism who thinks he can
get back into the game and make money at the same time by becoming
one of the participants for an expose--shades of Sam Fuller's classic
"Shock Corridor." He will be armed with a video camera disguised as a
pair of spectacles.</TE>
<TE>   Rebellious by nature, Fahd, designated Prisoner No. 77, stirs
trouble to beef up his story. He baits the guards' natural leader,
the uptight Berus (Justus von Dohnanyi), by suggesting he's a
closeted gay. The power struggle between guards and convicts becomes
real to the participants with predictable and repellent displays of
brutality and humiliation. Dr. Thon is ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   The cat-and-mouse game proceeds along conventional lines; the plot
is full of holes. It's made even less credible by a subplot involving
a romance that Tarek began with a woman (Maren Eggert) whom he met
just before beginning the experiment. Except for her amply displayed
figure, Eggert brings nothing to her thankless role.</TE>
<TE>   Bleibtreu, who co-starred with Franke Potenta in "Run Lola Run,"
has a smoldering presence that has made him a star. When his head is
shaved, Bleibtreu comes across as Germany's answer to Vin Diesel. The
other characters are stereotypes, played with relish by a staunch
supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   The film's high-tech prison block is well designed, and Rainer
Klausmann's cinematography is dynamic. As an exploitation picture,
"Das Experiment" is mindlessly potent; subtitles are no guarantee of
sophistication and subtlety.</TE>

<HD>In Its Second Year, 'Reba' Gets Real</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 20 years of marital bliss, a woman awakens to the reality that
her dentist husband is leaving her to take up with the office
hygienist--who is pregnant with his baby.</LD>
<LD>   But the spurned wife won't have to face life alone. Her
17-year-old daughter will be there to share the family home--along
with the teen's new baby and her high-schooler hubby. Another
daughter, a snarky 13-year-old, and an 8-year-old boy fill out the
household.</LD>
<LD>   Well, if the 1960s series "Hogan's Heroes" could set a sitcom in a
WWII German prison camp, who's to say that the second season of
"Reba" won't be able to wring laughs from its domestic battlefield?
Tonight at 9 on the WB, the premiere episode, "House Rules," suggests
that singing star Reba McEntire and crew just might be able to pull
it off.</LD>
<TE>   The show received decent ratings last season, but its creators
felt that for the series to achieve long-term success, it had to veer
away from a tendency toward silliness and saddle the lead character
of Reba Hart with real-life situations that would lend heft to the
comedy. Producer Kevin Abbott ("Roseanne," "Grace Under Fire"), who
wrote tonight's episode, was brought on board to help steer it in the
new direction, with assistance from McEntire, who is now co-executive
producer.</TE>
<TE>   Conflicts between Reba and ex-husband Brock (Christopher Rich) and
his new love, Barbara Jean (Melissa Peterman), over shared custody of
the kids create some laughs tonight. And a touching yet funny scene
that has Reba learning from Brock why he strayed hits the bull's-eye
for the series' new sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   But if the teen couple keep up their whining and their baby keeps
up the crying, I'm going to find someplace else to spend Friday
nights.</TE>
