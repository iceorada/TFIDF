<HD>'Blade 2' Leads the Pack on a Busy Weekend</HD>

<LD>Oscar hoopla didn't keep audiences from going to the movies in
near-record numbers last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   For the second weekend in a row, box-office totals soared more
than 60% ahead of last year. Two films grossed more than $30 million,
led by "Blade 2," which took in $32.5 million, above New Line
Cinema's expectations. The audience for the Wesley Snipes vampire
sequel was only 30% African American, and New Line marketing head
Russell Schwartz says exit-poll satisfaction was on the high side,
auguring well for the upcoming holiday weekend and Easter recess.</LD>
<LD>   The second-weekend grosses on the animated hit "Ice Age" were down
an acceptable 35% to $30.1 million; the movie has taken in more than
$88 million in only 10 days. By next weekend the Fox film could be
the first 2002 release to cross $100 million.</LD>
<TE>   Over at Universal Pictures, whose "A Beautiful Mind" won four
Oscars, including one for best picture, distribution head Nikki Rocco
said the movie will hold steady in about 1,500 runs this weekend, and
since the film's box office last weekend was up 21% in anticipation
of the Oscars, the win is expected to keep the film in the top 10 for
the 15th consecutive weekend. In the past, Oscar winners still in
general release add about $20 million to $30 million after receiving
the best picture award.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," which won
four Oscars, will add a few theaters to the current count of 1,317,
with an added bonus this weekend, according to Schwartz: three
minutes of preview footage for the upcoming sequel "The Two Towers,"
which director Peter Jackson has integrated into the end of the
movie. It's expected to bring back fans of the movie and take "Lord"
over the $300-million mark.</TE>
<TE>   The history-making win for Halle Berry as best actress in
"Monster's Ball" could add as much as $10 million to the film's $19.6
million to date, as Lions Gate expands the movie to more than 700
screens over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of its Oscar for best foreign-language film, the
Bosnian entry "No Man's Land" will return to the top 20 markets in
which it had previously played and add to the $781,000 gross it has
accumulated so far. Further expansion will depend on the attendance
boost the film gets from the Oscars, an MGM spokeswoman said.</TE>

<DH>Television* Hopes are high for 'The George Lopez Show,' the
latest attempt to gain a wide audience for a sitcom centered on
Latino characters, and relatively complex ones at that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A golf cart drives by George Lopez's trailer on the Warner Bros.
studio lot and causes the floor to rumble, triggering a 20-year-old
flashback. Lopez had been putting together material to send to comedy
clubs when fatigue overwhelmed him and he went to his bedroom. One of
his head shots was still lying face up on the kitchen table when his
brusque grandfather walked in with a friend. The tough old guy
pointed to the photograph and remarked that his grandson was talented
and very funny.</LD>
<LD>   Lying in bed, Lopez overheard the comment.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank God for tract housing," he said. "If we had been able to
afford insulation, I never would have known."</LD>
<TE>   His dysfunctional, working-class upbringing in the San Fernando
Valley has provided Lopez reams of material for his successful comedy
and radio career. Now, it has landed him on a very exotic plane for a
Latino: prime-time network television, with his own sitcom, "The
George Lopez Show," premiering this week on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to starring, Lopez has creator, producer and writer
credits on the program. "I had a good lawyer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the half-hour comedy succeeds, ABC may be able to deflect at
least some criticism from activists who have complained for years
about the dearth of minorities in front of and behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   The network's No. 1 sitcom right now, "My Wife and Kids," stars
Damon Wayans as the patriarch of a loving, middle-class black family.
ABC has bestowed a scheduling gift upon "George Lopez" by placing it
after "My Wife and Kids," which airs at 8 p.m. If Lopez can keep
ratings up in the monthlong trial period, the series will return for
a full season in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Lopez has a built-in audience. In November 2000 he hit
L.A.'s radio airwaves with a morning drive-time show on KCMG-FM
(92.3), becoming L.A.'s first Latino morning DJ on an
English-language station, in a market dominated by Spanish-language
radio. In a few months, the show rose into the Top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The easygoing, bearlike actor also has a few movie credits under
his belt, including HBO's original movie "Real Women Have Curves,"
which drew awards at the Sundance Film Festival this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lopez, 40, noted that nothing could have prepared him for
the blunt, tough world of network television. At one point, an
executive told him to stop "bugging out" his eyes when he was
surprised.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is part of a complicated dance as the networks attempt to
diversify their programming. When launching a show like Lopez's, ABC
has to appeal to the widest possible audience, convincing viewers
that Lopez's show isn't ethnically or culturally exclusive while
making Latino viewers feel special and understood.</TE>
<TE>   It's a difficult balancing act, one ABC previously tried to
navigate in the early 1990s with "All-American Girl," a show built
around Asian American comic Margaret Cho. That program lasted a
single season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody here is really hopeful it could draw a big audience, a
big family audience," said ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne.
"He is someone who could genuinely break out."</TE>
<TE>   ABC bought promotional time for the program on the
Spanish-language television networks. In some magazines, the network
placed a full-page ad of a shirtless Lopez wearing a green dress that
hooked together only at the waist. In large type it said: "G-Lo. The
other Lopez."</TE>
<TE>   During the first episode, only one word of Spanish is spoken.</TE>
<TE>   "In [past shows], when they got mad, they broke into Spanish,"
Lopez said. "But for us, we wanted to go easy at first. We're not
afraid of Spanish, but I'd like the show to stand on its funniness
first. We want to play it in the middle of the road."</TE>
<TE>   But two characters, Lopez's on-screen mother and his best friend
Ernie, have punched up their delivery with accents.</TE>
<TE>   "My thinking was, if I'm his best friend, I need to be as close to
him as possible and as true to where I grew up as possible. Most
Latinos have an accent of some sort," said Valente Rodriguez, who
plays Ernie, and envisions his character as East L.A.-born. "It's got
to be colored with something to bring the character to life. In the
auditioning process I did it with no accent at all, but the lines
tend to slant toward an accent. I wanted to show that's how we are.
Everybody's coming from another place. He's coming from a
neighborhood where he speaks Spanish to his mom and dad. That's where
I'm bringing him from."</TE>
<TE>   One of the show's executive producers, Bruce Helford, who is known
for his success with other comic-driven sitcoms like "Roseanne" and
"The Drew Carey Show," said "The George Lopez Show" has "rhythms" to
it. In addition to Lopez, two members of the writing staff are
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds different than any other shows," Helford said, although
there seemed to be some confusion about the characters' accents.
Helford said Ernie was born in Mexico, despite Rodriguez's view of
his character. Helford also said the mother's origins are unclear,
while the actress playing her, Belita Moreno, is sure she plays an
East L.A. native who learned English as a second language.</TE>
<TE>   No, said Helford.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't gotten around to where she's from, but she has an
accent, so she's old world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There has yet to be a sitcom with central Latin characters who are
complicated and real, like the black leads in "My Wife and Kids" and
Fox's "The Bernie Mac Show." There have also been relatively few
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, ABC premiered "I Married Dora," with Elizabeth Pena as an
undocumented Central American housekeeper who avoided deportation by
convincing her boss to marry her. This plot line violated INS law,
and the network ran a full-screen caveat and disclaimer to viewers:
"You should not try this in your own house."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, meanwhile, the network featured Greg Giraldo as a Latino
lawyer in "Common Law," another short-lived comedy. And last year,
NBC ordered a comedy pilot featuring Latina comic Debi Gutierrez, but
the show fizzled in the development stage.</TE>
<TE>   PBS, meanwhile, is airing "American Family," a rare Latino drama
developed and passed on by CBS. The network remains publicly
supportive of the show, even though it has averaged less than a 1
rating (or 1% of U.S. homes) since its January premiere, a
disappointing figure for any network.</TE>
<TE>   The drama's cast underscores the small population of Latino
performers with television experience. Some "American Family" cast
members are juggling their work on the drama with roles on other
series, including Esai Morales, who co-stars on ABC's "NYPD Blue,"
and Constance Marie, who plays Lopez's wife on the new series.</TE>
<TE>   "The George Lopez Show" came to ABC by way of film star Sandra
Bullock, and the ease with which she landed a deal testifies to the
strength of connections in Hollywood. She pushed for a television
project about two years ago and sent out feelers that she was
interested in good comics. She caught his act at the Improv in Brea,
met him after the show and said she wanted to pursue a sitcom
centered on him. Bullock, Helford and two of the show's other
executive producers met with ABC executives in August, and the
network committed to 13 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the hope is that the show's humor will play not only to
Latinos but to a wider audience. In the first few minutes of the
premiere, for example, Lopez tells his teenage daughter that she
doesn't have to learn how to swim because "we're already here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The George Lopez Show" premieres Wednesday night at 8:30 on ABC.
The network has rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young
children, with an advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>A 'Flute' That's Truly Magical</HD>
<DH>L.A. Opera's presentation of Mozart's masterpiece is
visually striking, and the strong cast brings together effective
music and drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Opera's "The Magic Flute," the third time around,
delicately balances the philosophical verities and comic situations
of Mozart's masterpiece. Such balance is never easily achieved, yet
there it was, in considerable glory, Sunday night in the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion. It is, in a word, magic.</LD>
<LD>   First introduced in 1993, the Peter Hall production, conducted by
Lawrence Foster and directed by Stanley M. Garner, remains visually
striking, endlessly colorful, a paean to whimsy and fancy. The faux
animals charm, the cartoon-like slaves amuse, the clever sets change
aspects entertainingly. The master hand of Gerald Scarfe, the
designer, is everywhere to be admired. It gives delight.</LD>
<LD>   Most important, since the oppressive pomposity of many previous
"Flutes" has been avoided, the music comes to life, illuminated by
Foster, a commanding Mozartean on the podium, and a world-class,
consistently splendid cast.</LD>
<TE>   This cast is strong in every role, and its musical and dramatic
cohesion at the opening was a high point in this opera season.
Michael Schade's Tamino dominated the action with singing of beauty,
urgency and emotional depth; his effortless acting proved concise,
effective, to the point.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sunday night opera performance, Schade had substituted
for an ailing colleague in three concerts by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic on Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoon; his
solid and powerful voice showed no fatigue at all in this
performance.</TE>
<TE>   In her L.A. Opera debut, Hungarian-born Andrea Rost, an ideal
Pamina, complemented Schade's Tamino and sang handsomely. Rost
combines believable acting with an aristocratic musicality; her "Ach,
ich fuhls" proved as dramatically touching as it was musically
admirable.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Gilfry's credible and amusing Papageno--he appeared in the
1993 run, but not the 1998 revival--made no false moves; his comic
timing is as focused and tasteful as his mellow voice.</TE>
<TE>   Striking and menacing in a Black Widow costume, Sumi Jo brought
her usual expertise to the challenges of the Queen of the Night; the
role is, of course, a cameo with high F's. She etched both with
aplomb. In his local debut, Reinhard Hagen made a commanding, humane
Sarastro.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Fedderly made of Monostatos a lovable villain, an appropriate
characterization given the appropriately cartoonish nature of many of
these costumes, and of many aspects of the work.</TE>
<TE>   Strongly delineated and well-sung, the Three Ladies were Robin
Follman, Cynthia Jansen and Suzanna Guzman. Scott Wyatt sang
handsomely and exuded authority as the First Priest.</TE>
<TE>   Shana Blake Hill made the most of her opportunities as Papagena.
The Three Boys were Lauren Libow, Daniel Reardon and Aidan
Schultz-Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by William Vendice, the chorus sang with assurance,
admirable enunciation and blended tone. Foster's resourceful pit
orchestra played a transparent Overture and upheld that standard for
all three hours and 12 minutes of this delightful Mozartean revival.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When you write about the movie business, your phone rings off the
hook at Academy Awards time with calls from journalists around the
world, wanting to hear an insider's Oscar predictions. But this year
the questions were about something very different--the fusillade of
attacks against "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   Bloodied but unbowed, "A Beautiful Mind" staggered out of the ring
victorious on Sunday night, winning four Oscars, including best
picture. But it was an ugly win. The film endured 15 rounds of
below-the-belt punches in what was viewed as the seamiest Oscar
campaign in recent memory. The Oscar slugfest generated tons of media
coverage, with nearly every piece focused on how the Academy Awards
have fallen captive to the kind of nasty mudslinging you'd expect to
see from a really tawdry affair--like a Mike Tyson weigh-in or a
California gubernatorial primary.</LD>
<LD>   The other Oscar pictures barely suffered so much as a scratch. The
accusations were all focused on "A Beautiful Mind." But why was a
film about a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician's battle with
schizophrenia such a magnet for media scrutiny? And is there anything
the academy could do to clean up the Oscar race next year? Here are a
few thoughts:</LD>
<TE>   Any filmmaker who decides to make a high-profile movie about a
living person should fasten their seat belt and prepare for a bumpy
ride. Any biopic that doesn't tell the truth--the whole truth--about
its subject is likely to become a punching bag for over-eager media
sleuths and special-interest groups. Ron Howard hasn't even committed
to making "The Alamo," but the New York Times has already run a piece
speculating on who might be offended if the film is seen as tilting
toward the Texans or Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Pictures went out of its way to position "A Beautiful
Mind" as a pseudo-biography, billing the film as "inspired by events
in the life" of Nash. The studio hoped it might lessen the impact of
the film's having airbrushed out some messy events in Nash's life. No
dice: Critics treated the film as if it were a History Channel
documentary. I think "Beautiful Mind" would've been a far better film
if it had explored more of the contradictions in Nash's life instead
of airbrushing them out.</TE>
<TE>   But sugarcoating the life of an obscure academic is not the same
as re-imagining the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as Oliver Stone
did with "JFK." Nash is hardly a public figure: It's his life, not
ours. And it was Nash who established the ground rules by making the
filmmakers sign an agreement promising not to raise the uncomfortable
issue of his sex life.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if I were making movies in today's Fact Police era, I'd be
concerned. Film is a dramatic medium, and drama sometimes needs a
little mythologizing to breathe. "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bonnie and
Clyde," just to name two mesmerizing "inspired by" films, are full of
whoppers and half-truths--they could never have stood up to the
media's Sgt. Friday grilling.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful what you wish for: "13 Days," the Kevin
Costner-starring film about the Cuban missile crisis, was factual to
a T--and a gigantic snoozefest. But why did "Mind" get clobbered and
the Will Smith-starring "Ali," which opened the same day, get a free
pass? Director Michael Mann did scrupulous research, but there's
plenty of fodder for nitpicking, whether it's how the film presents
Ali's relations with the Nation of Islam or glosses over Ali's
womanizing. One key difference: "Ali" was a huge failure at the box
office, so it didn't present a tempting target.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, if you have a hit, you're fair game for backbiting
from jealous rivals and a fat target for anyone with a grievance.
"Ali" also had the vocal support of its title character, who is still
a beloved American folk hero; attacking the movie would be akin to
belittling a legend now crippled by Parkinson's disease.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much of this year's nastiness was also inspired by the blood feud
between Miramax and DreamWorks, which have been at odds ever since
Miramax out-campaigned DreamWorks in the 1999 "Shakespeare in Love"
versus "Saving Private Ryan" best picture race. The two studios have
had competing films each year since, this year's rival films being
Miramax's "In the Bedroom" and "A Beautiful Mind," which was
co-financed by DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   With relations between the two studios in need of a mediator,
every story about the Oscar race was viewed as an attack by the other
side. When the Drudge Report ran a story on Dec. 20 saying Nash's
homosexuality had been "deliberately left out of the movie!"
DreamWorks immediately fingered Miramax for planting the item. When
the New York Post ran a story in January saying Miramax had been
badmouthing "A Beautiful Mind," Miramax instantly accused DreamWorks
of planting the piece.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vociferous "Mind" bashers was Roger Friedman, an
Internet columnist with close ties to Miramax. After I wrote a column
on Feb. 5 decrying the Oscar excess, Miramax's publicists wrote a
10-point defense of their Oscar tactics. It turned out to have a
hidden message: the first letter of each point spelled out:
D-R-E-A-M-W-O-R-K-S. To make things even more uncomfortable, "Mind's"
Oscar publicity consultant was Tony Angellotti, who helped engineer
the "Shakespeare" upset for Miramax before defecting to Universal.
Angellotti is the best Oscar publicist in town, but he's also the
most aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   His presence made everyone a little trigger-happy, especially at
DreamWorks, where they were still bruised over his role in defeating
"Saving Private Ryan" and unhappy to find him also working this year
as an Oscar consultant for "Monsters, Inc.," DreamWorks' only real
competition in the new best animated feature category. The rival
studios tried putting on a good face at Miramax's Oscar party
Saturday night, when Miramax's Harvey Weinstein and DreamWorks'
Jeffrey Katzenberg performed a skit that had the two men in
anger-management therapy together. There were a few laughs, but the
jokes felt forced.</TE>
<TE>   The media has been quick to blame Oscar publicists like Angellotti
for much of the Oscar race mudslinging--and not without some
justification. Miramax Oscar publicist David Horowitz was caught
tipping off an L.A. Times reporter to the first Drudge smear against
"Mind." More recently, the press cited 20th Century Fox as having
spread damaging gossip about the film, encouraged in part by
Angellotti, who told reporters that Fox was the prime culprit.
However, no one produced any evidence of Fox's misdeeds, and
disinformation was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press told me that Fox Chairman
Tom Rothman had apologized to Katzenberg, for his studio's
rumor-mongering. But when I called Rothman, he denied making any
apology, saying that he had nothing to apologize for and hadn't
talked to Katzenberg in months.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of putting all the blame on Hollywood, we in the media
should look in the mirror. In recent years, those of us who write for
mainstream newspapers and TV news outlets have become patsies for
almost any dirty trick because of our willingness to run stories
based on Internet gossip and charges made by anonymous sources. Matt
Drudge, for example, first attacked "Mind" in December, yet waited
until March 5--just after the final academy ballots went out--before
publishing a second attack on the film, charging it with leaving out
what he luridly described as "shocking Jew-bashing passages" from the
Sylvia Nasar biography. Either Drudge is a very slow reader or
someone planted the item.</TE>
<TE>   It was old news--and non-news. Nasar's book has been out for
years, and none of the prominent reviews of her book bothered to
mention the anti-Semitic incidents, which were clearly
schizophrenic-induced hallucinations. Yet the entertainment media
treated the Drudge smear like raw meat. Worse still, outlets like
Entertainment Weekly, which normally provides stellar Oscar coverage,
aired the anti-Semitism charges without citing their origins,
allowing readers to assume they came from a credible source. Maybe we
should take more time to evaluate the newsworthiness of wild
charges--the way we're taught to do in journalism school--before
tossing them into the mix just because they add some sizzle to our
stories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've heard from enough academy board members to know how aggrieved
people feel about this year's contretemps. But the academy doesn't
have the power to limit spending or the clout to penalize studios for
charges of negative campaigning. When I floated the idea of a studio
adopting a voluntary Oscar code of honor, a movie executive on the
phone burst out laughing.</TE>
<TE>   However, here's one small suggestion: Why not move up the Oscars a
month? Oscar films are all in release by year's end, leaving plenty
of time for academy members to see them. If the various film critic
associations can pick a best picture winner by New Year's, surely
Oscar voters could do it by late February. A shorter campaign would
force studios to spend fewer ad dollars, put the squeeze on the
growing number of pseudo-award shows and maybe bring a note of sanity
to what's become an embarrassing commentary on the industry's lack of
self-restraint. With the Oscars, less could be more--much like the
Oscar show itself.</TE>

<HD>This 'Bus Stop' Is Worthy of a Visit</HD>
<DH>A Noise Within's tender and nuanced production of the Inge
play, a paean to love, excels under Sabin Epstein's direction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For about 20 minutes, William Inge's "Bus Stop" can fool you into
thinking it's a cozy little slice of down-home Americana, a Norman
Rockwell tableaux vivant with a willfully naive worldview. But
somewhere midway through Act 1, this under-performed Corn Belt
classic shifts into darker and chillier terrain, a place that's
pretty to look at but tinged with rueful humor and even outright
despair.</LD>
<LD>   Written in 1954, but spiritually closer to the Great Depression,
"Bus Stop" is the theatrical answer to Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks,"
a primal American scene raised to mythopoeic levels and transposed
from the anonymous city to the anonymous Midwestern heartland, where
no one is ever more than a degree or two of separation from
crippling, terminal loneliness. That includes the playwright, who
committed suicide in 1973.</LD>
<LD>   In the faithful and tenderly nuanced production that opened Friday
at A Noise Within, director Sabin Epstein and company draw us into
the fleeting warmth of this old-fashioned, solidly crafted work about
four motley passengers stranded by a blizzard at a Kansas crossroads
cafe.</LD>
<TE>   The characters--a cowboy, a college professor, a nightclub singer,
a young waitress and the rest--seem as familiar and inevitable as the
homey interior of Grace's Diner, perfectly realized in Thomas
Buderwitz's weathered yet picturesque set design with its leather
stools, frosted windows and battered appliances (love that copper
cake tin, by the way), and lighted with rustic naturalism by Don Guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Bus Stop," of course, is Inge's re-imagining of Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales," a pilgrimage along America's blue highways, and
its theme, like Chaucer's, is love in all its lusty, reckless, comic,
self-sacrificing and unrequited guises.</TE>
<TE>   Though Inge had a tendency to post his ideas like Burma Shave
signs, Epstein wisely keeps both hands on the wheel and his eyes
locked on character development.</TE>
<TE>   The play's motivational linchpin is the lovers' brawl between the
rowdy knight-errant Bo Decker (Ben Messmer), a brash Montana cowboy,
and his reluctant damsel in distress, Cherie (Abby Craden), who sings
at the Blue Dragon Nightclub in Kansas City, "out by the stockyards,"
and wishes real life could be more like a Hollywood movie. Determined
to drag his ambivalent "fiancee" back home to Big Sky country,
kicking and screaming if necessary, Bo quickly runs afoul of the
local sheriff, Cherie pours out her soul to the diner's captive
audience, and the play's lesser romantic subplots dutifully take
their cues from the main action.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Monroe proved her acting chops playing Cherie in the 1956
film version of "Bus Stop," in one of those little-girl-lost turns
that can steal a show. Few actresses can match Monroe's breathy
neuroticism, but Craden is every bit as funny, steely and
self-consciously pneumatic, teetering around in red pumps and
fishnets while making chanteuse rhyme with "floozy." There's a
palpably dangerous erotic current flowing between her and Messmer's
Bo, very credible as a befuddled bull-in-a-china-shop--the
vulnerable, sensitive American antihero that hadn't yet found its
champion in James Dean.</TE>
<TE>   Offsetting the central lovers' feud, A Noise Within gets lively
ensemble work from Deborah Strang as the wisecracking, world-weary
Grace; Lana Joy as her precocious kitchen helper; William Dennis Hunt
as a self-dramatizing professor with a soft spot for young folks;
Richard Soto as a bus driver with a one-track mind; and Robert
Pescovitz as Sheriff Will, a low-key pillar of prairie righteousness.
Like figures in a WPA mural, they're ordinary Americans thrown into
higher relief by the stoic humor and grace with which they bear their
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   But the production's most affecting performance is Mark Bramhall's
Virgil, a crusty old cowboy who plays spiritual guide to Bo, his
love-struck surrogate son. Looking like a cross between the Marlboro
Man and a scarecrow, Bramhall locates a sweetness and hard-earned
decency in Virgil, echoing a production in which feelings run deep,
though the sentiments never get more explicit than "damnation" and
"shucks."</TE>
<TE>   Inge's talky, three-act odyssey is always in danger of overstaying
its welcome, fooling you with more false climaxes than a Tchaikovsky
symphony.</TE>
<TE>   By the time "Bus Stop's" road warriors are set to depart, we're
ready to rejoin them in the cold, cruel world--but grateful for
having the chance to sit and warm our souls for a spell.</TE>

<HD>The Puppets Pull All the Strings on 'Greg the Bunny'</HD>
<DH>Television* In the new Fox show co-starring Eugene Levy,
humans and 'Fabricated Americans' just naturally coexist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was bound to happen sooner or later. After a plethora of sitcoms
populated by single Manhattan twenty- and thirtysomethings looking
for love in the worst of places, there had to be a series just
waiting to get on the air that didn't subscribe to that same old
guys-and-girls, sex-and-a-city formula.</LD>
<LD>   Enter "Greg the Bunny," Fox's rambunctious single-camera comedy
that hopes to give a fresh take on the buddies-in-the-big-city vibe.
In this case, the friends aren't just women and men, but humans and
puppets, or Fabricated Americans, as they are called in the show.</LD>
<LD>   In the pilot episode, Greg the Bunny (credited as "himself" in
Fox's press materials), a struggling puppet actor, has just landed
his dream job as the star of the popular children's TV show
"Sweetknuckle Junction." Greg's good fortune brings together the
show's bungling director and producer, Gil Bender (Eugene Levy of
"American Pie" and "SCTV") and his wayward son, Jimmy (Seth Green,
formerly of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), who is the hare's hapless
human roommate.</LD>
<TE>   With a "Larry Sanders Show"- esque spin, the series explores a
world where people and puppets coexist. It includes Greg's puppet
co-stars Warren "The Ape" Demontague, a self-absorbed pill popper;
and Count Blah, a roguish vampire bearing a close resemblance to that
caped character from another, real-life children's series.
(Executives at the Sesame Workshop had no comment on the
resemblance.)</TE>
<TE>   "Greg the Bunny" is the brainchild of Dan Milano and Spencer
Chinoy, alums of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. The two created the
character for a low-budget New York City public-access cable show,
"Junktape," in 1997, later moving to the Independent Film Channel,
where Greg performed comedy skits and film parodies between the indie
flicks.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-inch-tall, floppy-eared fur ball caught the attention of
producer Steven Levitan, who was "looking for something different.
And this is certainly not like any show I've ever done before," said
Levitan, whose credits include "Just Shoot Me" and "The Larry Sanders
Show."</TE>
<TE>   "The hook should be that if you read the script, you shouldn't be
able to tell the difference between the humans and the puppets,"
Milano said. "This could be a sitcom about the making of a show with
an entirely human cast. It just so happens that our show is 50%
puppets."</TE>
<TE>   While wacky gimmicks appear to be the rage in the sitcom trade
these days (including another Fox newcomer, the fantasy-laden "Andy
Richter Controls the Universe," and the talking baby on CBS' "Baby
Bob"), producers on "Greg the Bunny" contend their show is
character-driven and does not rely on high-concept devices to draw
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to be silly and flying out of cannons--and I love
that stuff," Milano said. "But in trying to do something different,
we just want to play it straight, and that becomes the joke....</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the Muppets," Milano
continued. "I knew they were worked by puppeteers. But I could
completely accept them as living and breathing. We're just trying to
support that here, to blur the reality and fantasy line."</TE>
<TE>   The show's mature subject matter, meanwhile, sets "Greg the Bunny"
apart from the likes of that family-friendly alien, "ALF" (although
producers hope he'll make a guest appearance). Parents of small
children should take heed that the show is not for kids.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure that people know that by scheduling the show
at 9:30 p.m., we have indeed considered this more of an adult
comedy," cautioned Fox Entertainment President Gail Berman. "If we
were scheduling it at 8 p.m. and saying, 'Oh no, this is adult fare,'
that would be problematic."</TE>
<TE>   "That's this comedic minefield that everybody's [walking] right
now, trying to figure out where that line is," Levy said. "We're
trying to figure out how much of an edge we can put into the show,
how much we can prod and probe into the relationships of humans to
puppets, and even humans to humans. It's very tricky."</TE>
<TE>   There are logistical concerns as well, especially for the human
performers. "Everybody's got neck trouble," Green said of working
with his miniature co-stars. "But you make concessions. You squat, or
they stand on a box. You get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with puppets is that they have very big egos for
small people. They have a bit of a Napoleon complex," Levy quipped.
"The nice thing is that if you stand right over them, they're easily
intimidated."</TE>
<TE>   Fox officials are trying to distance the show from other
Hollywood-oriented series that have proven to be ratings
disappointments, among them Fox's "Action" and ABC's "Sports Night"
and "Hiller and Diller," which also co-starred Levy.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is a relationship show that happens to take place
backstage of a puppet show," Berman noted, "so I think it's very
different from the cynical view of show-biz kinds of stories."</TE>
<TE>   While the show's characters represent a departure from the puppets
viewers are accustomed to seeing, its fate is also being monitored by
Jim Henson Television U.S., which recently signed a development deal
with Fox for a new series featuring the Muppets. "I would love
nothing more than for 'Greg the Bunny' to be a huge hit," said Henson
Television President Juliet Blake. "I think their success can only
help us."</TE>
<TE>   "Greg the Bunny" premieres Wednesday night at 9:30 on Fox. The
network has rated it TV-14-L (may be unsuitable for children under
14, with a special advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<KH>THE OSCARS</KH>
<HD>Ratings Appear to Drop Slightly</HD>
<DH>Television* Preliminary data for the Academy Awards
telecast show a marginal decline compared with 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ratings for this year's Academy Awards appear to have been slightly
lower than they were a year ago, based on preliminary viewing
estimates from ratings service Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   ABC projects that roughly 41.8 million people were watching the
telecast at any given moment, which would represent a 3% decline
versus 2001 and the lowest Oscar rating since 1997, when "The English
Patient" was named best picture.</LD>
<LD>   Final Nielsen data for Sunday's broadcast will be issued today.
ABC estimates that 77 million people watched at least a few minutes
of the telecast, also a slight decline from last year.</LD>
<TE>   The overall rating doubtless wasn't helped by the 4-hour,
15-minute running time, which ranks as the longest Oscar telecast on
record.</TE>
<TE>   ABC and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which
presents the awards, moved the Oscars from Monday to Sunday nights in
1999 and advanced the start time by a half-hour to 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time, 8:30 p.m. Eastern. Still, Sunday's ceremony nevertheless ran
until 12:45 a.m. on the East Coast, the most populous time zone.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the Oscars averaged a 35.1 rating, meaning that 35.1% of
the 5.3 million homes in the Los Angeles viewing area were watching
the awards at any given moment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the show's duration, the rating was somewhat lower in New
York, where the ceremony averaged a 33.3 rating. In both cities, more
than half of all TV sets in use were tuned to the telecast during
those hours.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles ranked fourth among major cities monitored by Nielsen
in terms of Oscar ratings, trailing Chicago, San Francisco and West
Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>

<LD>   DJ's Ashes Placed in Hall of Fame</LD>
<LD>   Alan Freed was there at the birth of rock 'n' roll, and now the
music's Hall of Fame will be his final resting place.</LD>
<TE>   The late Cleveland disc jockey is credited with coining the term
"rock 'n' roll" and staging some of the first concerts for the
nascent music, which is why he was a member of the first induction
class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. Now Freed, who died
in 1965, has been brought into the hall in a more literal fashion: A
brass urn with his ashes has been sealed up within the walls of the
Ohio museum.</TE>
<TE>   Freed's family attended a private ceremony at the Hall of Fame
this month to inter his remains.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tremendous honor to have him come to us here," said Hall
of Fame President Terry Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   This month also marks the 50th anniversary of the Moondog
Coronation Ball, the Cleveland Arena concert that ended in chaos when
20,000 fans stormed the doors of the 10,000-seat venue--an outcome
that showed the surging popularity and unpredictability of the
then-new youth music scene.</TE>
<TE>   An exhibit on Freed is planned for the hall in coming months,
family member Judith Fisher Freed said Monday.</TE>

<TE>   U2's Bono Goes to Bat for Pal Facing Charges</TE>
<TE>   When Peter Buck of R.E.M. needed someone to vouch for his
character in a British courtroom, he called in a famous friend: Bono
of U2.</TE>
<TE>   In an odd pop culture moment, the famed rock singer took the stand
on Monday to testify that guitarist Buck is a quiet family man. Buck
is facing assault and other charges after an alleged drunken rampage
aboard a transatlantic British Airways flight last April.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to stand up and be heard," Bono said of his
appearance. "It didn't add up to the person whose arm I had to twist
to go to a boxing match because he thought it was an aggressive
sport."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Buck, 45, was a "drunken lout" on the flight,
gulped down 15 glasses of wine, grappled with crew members, flipped a
food trolley and at one point seemed intent on exiting the plane
midair. Buck has testified he took a powerful sleeping pill at the
start of the Seattle-to-London flight and does not remember the
alleged behavior.</TE>
<TE>   His famous friend said the accusations don't jibe with his 17-year
friendship with Buck. "I have never ever seen him drunk," Bono said.
"I have absolutely never seen him taking drugs."</TE>

<TE>   Oliver Stone Drops in for Chat With Arafat</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Stone filmed a Monday meeting with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat for a new project that the Oscar-winning
director and screenwriter describes as a documentary about world
conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, no stranger to controversy and political fare, trekked to
Arafat's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where roiling
tensions have put the leader in a hot seat. Eighteen months of
bloodshed have turned the world's eyes to the Middle East once again,
and Stone says there are lessons to be mined from such
confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a similarity in world conflicts everywhere you
go," he told Reuters. "What is the common denominator? Maybe pride,
maybe human ego, maybe the sense of humiliation, all these factors."</TE>
<TE>   Stone said he had already interviewed "a series of Israeli
leaders" for the project and hinted that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
was among them. An Israeli government spokesman could not immediately
confirm that such meetings had taken place.</TE>
<TE>   The director declined to offer more details, but a production team
member said the documentary would focus on 72-year-old Arafat. Stone
was also in Havana last month meeting with Fidel Castro for an
apparently separate documentary that, according to Variety, is
tentatively titled "Looking for Fidel."</TE>

<TE>   'Wall Street Week' Host Booted From Show</TE>
<TE>   Louis Rukeyser's stock with his bosses has dropped off the chart.</TE>
<TE>   The host of "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser" criticized
executives of Maryland Public Television on the air Friday and will
not be returning to the popular financial show, according to the
organization's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser, a partner in the show with Maryland Public Television
for 32 years, had been upset about plans to "reinvent" the program by
reducing the camera time for the 69-year-old host, bringing in
Fortune magazine as a partner and aiming for a younger audience.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser had said before Friday that he planned to honor his
contract and remain through June, but after his on-air
characterization of MPT's moves in the matter as "dumb, deceptive and
almost unbelievable graceless behavior," the program's producers
opted to cut ties now.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser, who also publishes a monthly newsletter, told Dow Jones
Newswire on Monday that he plans to unveil a programming venture with
a new partner. "There's no question we're going to go forward,"
Rukeyser said, "the only question is with who."</TE>

<KH>THE OSCARS</KH>
<HD>For First-Time Producer, Getting Allen Was Coup</HD>
<DH>How did Laura Ziskin persuade the director to come to
Hollywood? It's one of several questions with unexpected answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inquiring beautiful minds have a few remaining questions about Sunday
night's show.</LD>
<LD>   Among the most pressing is how did first-time show producer Laura
Ziskin manage to persuade notorious Oscar-avoider Woody Allen to
attend?</LD>
<LD>   "That was just a miracle. Every Oscar show producer has wanted
Woody Allen. Early on I wanted to do a film about New York and make
it integral to the show. I asked Nora Ephron to put together the
film.</LD>
<TE>   "I ran into Jeffrey Katzenberg [co-head of DreamWorks Pictures,
through which Allen's movies are now released] at the Women in Film
luncheon and told him that more than anything I wanted Woody to
introduce Nora's film. He turned to Terry Press [DreamWorks marketing
head] and said, 'She'll make it happen.' Terry, [publicist] Leslee
Dart and Jeffrey did it.</TE>
<TE>   "But Woody wouldn't let us tell anybody. Not even the network
knew. At the rehearsal I asked Nora to introduce the film. Woody
arrived at 5 o'clock on Sunday and slipped in through the rear
entrance and sat in my office until it was time for him to go on. He
left immediately afterwards. There was no script, no TelePrompTer.
For live TV it was thrilling."</TE>
<TE>   How about that more than four-hour running time?</TE>
<TE>   "I had three honorary Oscars [Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier and
Arthur Hiller], seven standing ovations--but who's counting? And a
new Oscar category, best animated feature," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the winners who pulled out sheets of paper and read from
them, she said, "At the nominees luncheon I gave a speech asking them
not to do that. It fell on deaf ears, though some people came
prepared and had memorized their acceptance speeches."</TE>
<TE>   Will she do it again next year? "I haven't given it any thought.
Right now I'm finishing up 'Spider-Man,' my day job. But it was great
fun and [the academy] treated me very well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Will Smith?</TE>
<TE>   For Smith, real life supplanted reel life on Oscar night.
According to Smith's publicist Stan Rosenfield, at about the time of
the Sidney Poitier tribute, early in the Oscar telecast, the best
actor nominee and his wife, Jada Pinkett, received a call that their
16-month-old daughter, Willow, was running a 103-degree fever. They
immediately left and took her to the hospital, where she was
diagnosed with an ear infection. She is at home and recuperating now.
Close relation Maggie Smith, as Whoopi Goldberg referred to her
during the show, was waiting to accept the Oscar in case he won.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Connelly will next be seen in the effects-laden
big-screen version of "The Hulk," directed by Ang Lee with Australian
actor Eric Bana ("Black Hawk Down," "Chopper") in the title role.
It's scheduled for summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In a complete turnabout from her unglamorous Oscar-winning role of
Letitia Musgrove in "Monster's Ball," Halle Berry will next be seen
as the sexy Jinx in the James Bond adventure "Die Another Day," which
is due at year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Next summer she returns as Storm in the sequel to "X-Men"
currently titled "X2," again for director Brian Singer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denzel Washington's next effort re-teams him with director Carl
Franklin, who guided the actor to a previous Oscar nomination for
"Devil in a Blue Dress," on "Out of Time," which starts filming in
May for MGM. He plays a cop again, this time a police chief in a
Florida town. Washington's directing debut, the still-untitled
Antwone Fisher Story, is expected to come out this fall. It is based
on the life of a young man, born in prison to a mother who later
deserted him, who turns his life around.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Broadent will be seen on screen this summer as the corrupt
Boss Tweed in Martin Scorsese's epic "Gangs of New York," starring
Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio. He will also appear in a new
screen version of Charles Dickens' "Nicholas Nickelby" later in the
year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ron Howard is in pre-production for a full-scale remake of "The
Alamo" for Disney, due for release in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Producer Brian Grazer has several projects coming, three of which
will be released this year. This summer brings the spy spoof
"Undercover Brother" and the surfing movie "Blue Crush." In November
comes "8 Mile," the big-screen debut of rapper Eminem.</TE>

<HD>Creating Poetry From Cluttered Lives</HD>
<DH>Theater* 'The Dazzle' at SCR is based on the true story of
two brothers found dead amid tons of junk in their apartment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One night in 1996, playwright Richard Greenberg made his way uptown
from his lower Manhattan apartment to a production of "Holiday,"
Philip Barry's 1928-vintage play about a self-made man who woos two
daughters from an upper-crust family. He had no desire to revisit a
show he remembered as nothing more than "bright chat," but he went
out of a "friendship duty" to the director, David Warren.</LD>
<LD>   Expecting shallowness, Greenberg came away startled by the play's
poignancy. He raved to Warren about the performance of Reg Rogers in
a secondary role as the drunken son of a rich and controlling father.
Warren asked Greenberg to write a play for Rogers and Peter
Frechette, another actor the playwright and director had worked with
before. Let them play brothers, Warren suggested.</LD>
<LD>   That set Greenberg thinking about the Collyer brothers. And about
his parents yelling at him to clean up his room when he was a kid on
Long Island.</LD>
<TE>   The Collyer brothers, Langley and Homer, were a national sensation
in 1947. Scions of an old and respectable New York family, they were
eccentric recluses who spent years holed up inside their Harlem
brownstone. When police got a tip that somebody had died inside, they
found the brothers' corpses amid a labyrinth of junk. There was no
sign of suicide or foul play. Tons of worthless stuff was taken out
of the house, including mountains of old newspapers and 10 grand
pianos.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the story's bare bones, and a mood he took away from
"Holiday," Greenberg began to fashion "The Dazzle." It is currently
playing in New York in a production by the Roundabout Theatre
Company, directed by Warren and starring Rogers and Frechette. Now,
comes the West Coast premiere, with a different cast and director.
"The Dazzle" is the sixth play by Greenberg that South Coast
Repertory has produced since 1991. A seventh, "The Violet Hour," will
launch South Coast's new, secondary 336-seat theater in the fall--and
vault Greenberg past Harold Pinter and Alan Ayckbourn as the living
writer with the most plays produced at South Coast.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, Greenberg said, he used to keep newspapers piled in his
room. The stacks were neat, but they nevertheless drew parental heat.
"They would say, 'It looks like the Collyer brothers in here,'"
Greenberg recalled recently from New York.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg, 44, said his father helped in another way: At his son's
request, he got on the Internet and tracked down 1940s news accounts
of the Collyers. An author's note in the program advises audiences
the play is "based on the lives of the Collyer brothers, about whom I
know almost nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "Some facts are absolutely accurate and true, but I've imagined it
more than researched it," Greenberg said. His goal was not to
represent the Collyers as historical figures but to use them to pose
what the Bible tells us was the first, most primal question one
sibling asked about another: "Am I my brother's keeper?"</TE>
<TE>   In "The Dazzle," Langley is an eccentric fixated on life's
minutiae. A concert pianist, he can hear--and be thrown into a tizzy
by--the tiniest discordance between musical notes. He collects stuff
because he is consumed with the sheer sensory fascination--the
dazzle--of looking at things and reveling in their smallest detail.
He is utterly unfit to function in society or to have any semblance
of a normal, workaday life.</TE>
<TE>   Homer, the older brother, has been deputized from childhood as his
brother's keeper. "I have lived my life under a mother's curse: 'You
are for your brother.' But you see, I wanted my own life," he tells
the play's only other character, a fictitious heiress who, like one
of the characters in "Holiday," is rebelling against her wealthy
family. She falls for Langley--a prospective husband mommy and daddy
won't be able to abide.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg envisions Homer, an attorney, as a magnificent verbal
wit who levels many a barb at his brother. And yet, Homer makes his
sacrifice, loyal to his brother in a way that may, for some
playgoers, defy belief. Why does Homer stay?</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg sees his job as posing the question and supplying a
context for thought, not giving a clear, psychologically detailed
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do people stay together? They are condemned to each other or
destined to each other. If you spell it out [further], you're lying.
I get bored when everything is explained to me, and I just don't buy
it. Human nature is too variable and deep."</TE>
<TE>   One constant in Greenberg's plays is the uncommon wit and
articulateness of his characters. He is a product of a Princeton-Yale
education (with a brief stop at Harvard as well), and it is typical
for his characters to talk as if they were verbally adept graduates
of the best schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's my default setting," he said. "People are always
bringing it up to me." There are exceptions, he notes--among them the
Lower East Side Jews of "Everett Beekin," which premiered at South
Coast two years ago, and the ballplayers of his next play, "Take Me
Out," which concerns the fictitious New York Empires. "The Dazzle"
offers some prime turns of wit. There is also a touch of
poetry--especially in a long, broken and poignant speech in which
Langley talks about watching from his window at dusk as businessmen
return from a day of work--emissaries of a normal, everyday world he
can never join. "Sometimes they catch my eye--and nod to me!--as if
we were the neighbors that we are ... as if this were my 7 p.m.
too--a little nod--and I'm swung into the circle of their hour--but
then that stops--and the next hour is smashed to smithereens."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg said the only time he has written poems was a six-month
period during 1996 when 200 of them poured out. He was also working
on "The Dazzle" at the time (he put the play aside for a while and
finished it in 1998). His first crack at the Collyer brothers came in
a five-page poem; some of its lines are in the play.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg showed some of his verse to friends. Otherwise, he is
keeping the poems to himself. Greenberg, who fervently avoids reading
the articles and reviews that are written about him, said of the
poems, "I wrote them for me. Some sort of work I can never be
punished for."</TE>

<HD>Second Stage to Accept New Role When 'Dazzle' Is Gone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Dazzle" ends the 23-year run of South Coast Repertory's 161-seat
Second Stage, which opened in 1979 and will be replaced next season
by a bigger theater. The space will be remodeled and used primarily
for rehearsals and in-house play development rather than public
performances.</LD>
<LD>   But before it goes, the tight passages from backstage to the
playing area and the intimate horseshoe seating pose one last
headache for a director. Mark Rucker, a staff director who figures he
has shepherded at least nine plays onto the Second Stage, has to find
a way to clutter the space with the two pianos and the mountains of
junk called for in Richard Greenberg's script--and still make sure
everybody in the audience can see the three actors.</LD>
<LD>   Working on the Second Stage, Rucker said, has always been "a race
to keep the least amount of people unhappy for the least amount of
time." That means making sure actors turn often while they perform so
one side of the house won't be condemned to seeing only their backs.
For "The Dazzle," set designer Darcy Scanlin had to craft
sculpture-like modules of junk and stacks of newspapers that will
hold together and remain stable when carted quickly from backstage
during breaks between acts and scenes.</LD>
<TE>   "It started as kind of a bear of a project to conceive in there,"
Rucker said. "Now that the problems are being solved, I think the
intimacy of the space is going to be a real pleasure with this play
because it's so intricate and the language is so beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "you have to keep in mind that somebody is going
to have to be looking at this play over a piano."</TE>

<HD>This 'Merchant' Doesn't Press to Make Its Sales</HD>
<DH>A San Diego Repertory Theatre production just plays the
text and lets the rest fall where it may.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>San Diego</DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--A director attempting "The Merchant of Venice" starts with
a big problem: what to do with Shylock, a venal stereotype born of
the unchallenged anti-Semitism of the Elizabethan Age.</LD>
<LD>   One answer is to go over the top, making Shylock the quintessence
of evil, a Jewish Richard III, repellent but charismatic. The
alternative--made famous by Patrick Stewart's portrayal--is the King
Lear approach, with Shylock as both victim and victimizer, undone by
a cruel world and his own lack of self-awareness.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Woodhouse, artistic director of San Diego Repertory Theatre,
has gone for a middle course: Just play the text and let the art--and
the controversy--fall where it may. The result is a Shylock (Ron
Campbell) who is fascinating but never dominating and a "Merchant"
that is brisk and full of Shakespearean darkness and light but never
mannered or stressful. Done in modern dress, the production uses a
live jazz background to provide mood and movement.</LD>
<TE>   "Merchant" is often used as starter Shakespeare: The plot is
straightforward, the Bard never pushes his material, and the lines
are some of Shakespeare's most memorable. The Rep delivers on all
accounts, although occasionally the music steps on the dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   If Campbell's Shylock never attempts grandiosity, the other leads
are similarly underplayed. The aim is to provoke the audience into
thought but not push it into exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Roberts as Antonio, whose bargain with Shylock sets up the
"pound of flesh" denouement, is a melancholy sort, given to hiding
the risky nature of his business ventures. Antonio's affection for
Bassanio (Mikael Salazar) is never fully explored. Other productions
have suggested suppressed homoeroticism, but Woodhouse doesn't go
there.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar and his Portia (Karole Foreman) are appropriately young
and moonstruck, but neither would peg the sex appeal meter. The same
is true of the other lovers, Jessica (Kanani Titchen) and Lorenzo
(Francis Gercke).</TE>
<TE>   The production's comic energy and freshness come from supporting
players, particularly Mark Christopher Lawrence as a randy Gratiano,
Douglas Lay as the beady-eyed Prince of Aragon, and Walter Murray as
the hot-tempered Salerio. Baruti's comic turn as the Prince of
Morocco--one of Portia's unsuccessful suitors--is a gem. Linda Libby
brings a full-bodied lustiness as Portia's maid Nerissa. The tryst
between Gratiano and Nerissa has the earthiness of the real stuff.</TE>
<TE>   The core of "Merchant" is greed and prejudice, but a little sex
never hurt.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oyez, oyez, oh no--yet another legal drama. It's about a moderate
liberal newcomer to a divided Supreme Court. It's about intrigue and
comely law clerks. And if you've been watching CBS' "First Monday,"
you should know quite a bit about it.</LD>
<LD>   Except the show in question is ABC's "The Court." That's not to
say the two series are exactly the same, but you can't help but
wonder if there isn't some sort of double-jeopardy law against this.</LD>
<LD>   On its own merit, tonight's premiere of "The Court" has some
arguments in its favor. It features good performances, led by Sally
Field as Kate Nolan, a former Ohio governor named to the highest
court in the land. In addition, Carol Flint's script has a frequently
deft touch that lets viewers read between the lines, and the show has
a cinematic look that befits its hallowed setting.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's episode follows Nolan through her transformation from
sound-bite-ready politician to closemouthed justice, from the
congressional confirmation process to her first days on the judicial
battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Though she doesn't get Borked, Nolan does have a somewhat untidy
past that TV journalist Harlan Brandt (Craig Bierko) and his
production assistant Betsy (Christina Hendricks) are doggedly
pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these promising elements, the premiere is missing
something. Part of it is because the first show seems aimed at
setting up the rest of the series rather than reaching its own
denouement.</TE>
<TE>   Another weakness lies in its cliches. For example, there's the
walking-up-the-steps-of-the-Supreme-Court-alone-at-night moment. The
crass-TV-journalist antics. The
newcomer-making-waves-in-a-staid-environment dynamic that parallels
that of "First Monday" and, like it or not, that of another series
featuring Field in a full-length robe: "The Flying Nun."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Oscar- and Emmy-winning actress is light-years beyond
playing Sister Bertrille, "The Court" does not appear quite so
supremely evolved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Court" premieres at 10 tonight on ABC. The network has rated
it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children, with an advisory
for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Simon Revisits 'Odd Couple'</HD>
<DH>Theater* An update of the playwright's 1965 comedy will be
staged at Geffen Playhouse. He says 70% of dialogue is new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neil Simon has updated his 1965 comedy "The Odd Couple" for a June
19-July 21 production at the Geffen Playhouse, to be called "Oscar
and Felix: A New Look at 'The Odd Couple.'"</LD>
<LD>   The play's story, about a slob and a compulsive neat freak who
become roommates after their respective divorces, will be "exactly
the same," Simon said. However, 70% of the dialogue has been
rewritten, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "If it were up to me, I would rewrite 80% of my plays," he added.</LD>
<TE>   The impetus for this rewrite was an experience Simon had about six
months ago, listening to an audio version of the play. "So much of it
is still back in 1965," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This will be Simon's second rewrite of "The Odd Couple." In 1986,
he wrote "The Odd Couple (Female Version)," in which the central
characters of Oscar and Felix were changed to Olive and Florence, and
their men's poker group was changed to a women's Trivial Pursuit
group, along with other updates.</TE>
<TE>   Two neighbor characters who were originally English sisters, the
Pigeons, were changed to Spanish brothers, the Costazuelas, in the
1986 rewrite. This time, the neighbors' gender goes back to the
original, but the surname from the second rewrite will remain--the
neighbors will be sisters named Costazuela.</TE>
<TE>   Both earlier versions of the play "still do extremely well," Simon
said. "But maybe I like the idea of doing trilogies"--referring to
his trilogy of "suite" plays and his trilogy of autobiographical "BB"
plays: "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound."</TE>
<TE>   He said a group of people in their 20s, some of whom hadn't seen
either version of the play or the movie, responded well to the latest
rewrite during a recent reading in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen producing director Gilbert Cates said the rewrite is "very
funny and very current."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Geffen is being used as a Broadway tryout house for
the rewrite, Cates replied that "we're interested only in doing plays
for our audience here, within 30 miles of the theater." He noted that
Simon lives in Bel-Air, "almost within walking distance" of the
Geffen in Westwood, so he qualifies as a neighborhood playwright.</TE>
<TE>   In other Geffen news, Megan Mullally has withdrawn from her role
in the next production, "He Hunts." Cates and director David
Schweizer both cited "impossible scheduling crunches" for the
actress, who is shooting "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Schweizer said Mullally's replacement is not yet set but that her
role is understudied and that the show will open as scheduled, with a
first preview on April 9.</TE>

<HD>Oh, So Close to Being Transfigured</HD>
<DH>The Philharmonic ends its Schoenberg Prism with a sumptuous
performance of an accessible work. But Mahler upstages the event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday afternoon, a lovely L.A. early spring day, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic brought to an end its Schoenberg Prism with magical
night music. It was but a small disconnect in an Oscar-ized city that
had already begun to unveil a very different kind of magical night to
project to the wide world.</LD>
<LD>   The performance of Schoenberg's "Transfigured Night," played by
the orchestra's string section and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, was gorgeous. This is readily
accessible Schoenberg, written in the twilight of the 19th century,
drenched in Wagner's erotic harmonies and silken string textures.</LD>
<LD>   But "Transfigured Night" Sunday served merely as prelude to the
concert's big event, the Philharmonic's first performance of Mahler's
massive early cantata, "Das Klagende Lied" for huge orchestra,
offstage band, choruses and several vocal soloists. That meant that
the Schoenberg Prism, a festival tribute that revolved around the
50th anniversary of the composer's death in Los Angeles in 1951 and
which had opened in October with his Piano Concerto (1942), wound
down with an anticlimax. It ended where it might have profitably
begun--namely, seducing an audience often skeptical about Schoenberg.</LD>
<TE>   The festival, which included the participation of many other arts
organizations and educational institutions, was incomplete and often
disappointing. For all the various symposiums, there was only
occasional substance and far too little central planning. Schoenberg
the Angeleno got lip service (far more substantive explorations of
his West Coast years have recently been undertaken at Bard College in
New York and in Vienna). Indeed, surprisingly little of Schoenberg's
music from Los Angeles, where he wrote both approachable and arcane
music, was explored.</TE>
<TE>   Where, for instance, was Lou Harrison, the most important living
composer to have studied with Schoenberg and the dean of California
music? And did no one think to involve the composer and author Allen
Shawn? His excellent book "Schoenberg's Journey" has just been
published, and last month the Monterey Symphony premiered a work it
commissioned from him in honor of the John Steinbeck centenary. That
there might be a connection between populist Steinbeck and Schoenberg
(the writer was a fan) reflects a richer Schoenberg Prism than the
Philharmonic's narrow focus.</TE>
<TE>   The Schoenberg events never created a buzz equivalent to that of
the Philharmonic's Ligeti and Stravinsky festivals in previous
seasons. Instead, his music was offered as something to be confronted
gingerly. Still, there were highlights, such as Salonen's fine job of
explaining and conducting the Five Pieces for Orchestra at the end of
October. And in the final week of the festival, there was a
last-minute flurry of Schoenberg performances of great immediacy by
Peter Serkin at the Chandler, the Arditti Quartet at Caltech, and the
Leipzig String Quartet in a stunning account of the Third Quartet in
the excitingly close quarters of the Villa Aurora.</TE>
<TE>   In the context of last week's Schoenberg feast, the Philharmonic's
performance of "Transfigured Night" was dessert. Six years ago,
Salonen made a sleek, edgy, Modernist-leaning recording of the work
with the Stockholm Chamber Orchestra. Sunday, he took a slower, more
sumptuous approach. No longer sounding as if he had something to
prove, he now conducted it simply as if he loved the score, and,
perhaps, that sense of closer attachment to Schoenberg by orchestra
and conductor will prove the Prism's true legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Das Klagende Lied" (The Plaintive Song) made Mahler's name in
1880, as "Transfigured Night" made Schoenberg's some 20 years later.
Mahler wrote his own text, based upon a fairy tale of fratricide and
a magical flute, for the hourlong score, and he threw into it
everything he could possibly think of. It's so unwieldy that Mahler
later revised it, pairing down the extravagant orchestration and
cutting it by a third. But it has become the fashion to present it in
its original form, and that is what the Philharmonic did.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen corralled his large forces with spectacular control. Where
he luxuriated in Schoenberg, he went for maximum dramatic punch in
the Mahler. The Los Angeles Master Chorale made an incisive
contribution. There were six vocal soloists. Last-minute
substitutions, mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung and tenor Michael
Schade (who bravely agreed to perform even though he was appearing in
"The Magic Flute" that evening) assured an excellent adult quartet,
which also included soprano Christine Brewer and baritone Nathan
Gunn. Two boy soloists, Philip Nowotny and Peter Mair, were powerful
and intense.</TE>
<TE>   And so, with an enormous gust of sound and forceful drama,
Mahler's cantata blew Schoenberg off the scene. But it also filled in
the one missing gap in the Philharmonic's Mahler repertory.</TE>

<LD>If you're going to make a movie about escaping the nightmare of
prison, you might want to make sure there's a real nightmare to
escape.</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's made-for-television movie "Redeemer" (9 p.m., USA),
Charles Henderson (Obba Babatunde) is a Black Panther who is jailed
for being party to the inadvertent killing of an innocent man. For
the next 20 years, Henderson's yearning for parole is steadfastly
opposed in a letter-writing campaign by the victim's sister, Sharon
Davidson (Michele Greene).</LD>
<LD>   The movie makes it clear that Davidson's obsession with keeping
Henderson behind bars is an imprisoning burden for her as well. So
when Paul Freeman (Matthew Modine) signs up as a writing teacher at
Henderson's prison, it soon becomes his task to set both Henderson
and Davidson free.</LD>
<TE>   Directed by Graeme Clifford and adapted by L.A. Times columnist
James Ricci from his own experiences, "Redeemer" is easy enough to
watch. Except for the excessive use of flashbacks to show the killing
over and over again, the pacing is snappy.</TE>
<TE>   But the movie is only occasionally involving, mainly because
prison life in "Redeemer" is rather genial. Sure, freedom would be
nice, but the cells are cozy, the prisoners warmhearted, the fights
tame, and, with the confident, capable Freeman on board, there's a
first-rate creative writing program with a superb student-teacher
ratio.</TE>
<TE>   As for Davidson, she has a comfortable job and a lovely daughter
whose biggest complaint is being forbidden to watch a violent movie
on television.</TE>
<TE>   Things could be a lot worse.</TE>

<LD>WOMAN MADE OF SAND</LD>
<LD>   A Novel in Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Joann Kobin</LD>
<TE>   Delphinium</TE>
<TE>   178 pages; $22</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If we were to crowd all the characters that affect the marriage of
Harriet and Phillip, the main characters in Joann Kobin's novel told
in short stories, "Woman Made of Sand," into the archetypal nuptial
bed, characters would be falling out of the sheets, pushing others
aside and crawling over each other for space.</TE>
<TE>   To give readers a comprehensive look at this marriage and family,
the author of this first novel relies on alternating narrators, all
of whom have biased opinions about the family's happenings. There's
Harriet, the mewling wife who tells of her marriage's disintegration
and the new, if melancholy, life she builds for herself; next to her
is Phillip, Harriet's soon-to-be ex-husband, a weak man whose
greatest desire is to be needed by a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the couple's two children: Matina, a sharp-tongued
medical student who models on the side, and Eric, a budding dancer
whose primary role seems to be gathering together his disjointed
family.</TE>
<TE>   Crowding the edges of the familial tale are Harriet's
eager-to-please mother, her absent father and domineering
grandmother, as well as Phillip's parents, particularly his mother,
Belle, who survives her husband only to be lost amid her own life.
After Phillip and Harriet divorce, Phillip's new family joins in--the
youthful and independent second wife, Marianne, and the youngest
member of this disarrayed clan, baby Greg.</TE>
<TE>   "Woman Made of Sand" centers on the difficulties of living with
family--immediate and extended, those related by marriage and by
blood--and all the tricky, prone-to-misunderstanding nuances such
relations entail. If it's true that blood is thicker than water, it's
also true that blood is harder to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   This narrative offers a sad and somewhat bitter take on marital
dissatisfaction. We see the bloom of promise in a union's early days
and discover an abiding loneliness that is, in Kobin's telling, the
core of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   Kobin's stories follow a curiously jumbled chronology. The first
tale, "Rain," takes place during the funeral for Phillip's father. As
Phillip attempts to grieve, Harriet and their young children dance.
It is a dance of recklessness and freedom as Harriet suddenly
realizes she can no longer stay married to Phillip.</TE>
<TE>   The next story jumps back in time to Harriet's childhood,
providing the copious back story of her upbringing, while a few tales
later we're catapulted into a future with Harriet, now a divorcee,
interacting with her grown children and Phillip's new wife. This
unfolding requires readers to calculate how much time has passed
since the previous story, or how far back in time the next story is
taking us, a distraction that interrupts the novel's flow.</TE>
<TE>   The dancing of Harriet and her children in the first story is a
theme Kobin uses often. Phillip doesn't like to dance with Harriet.
When other men do, she tumbles into bed with them. "Dancing triggers
some biochemical change in my brain," she explains. Dancing, in
Kobin's world, is a metaphor for the sexual, dynamic energy we look
for in a mate. It also represents the deep aspirations we hold for
our parents and children.</TE>
<TE>   When dancing is juxtaposed against the mundane realities of family
life, the discrepancies between what we want and what we have seem
insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   In "His Mother, His Daughter," for example, Phillip watches his
widowed mother perform in a senior citizens pageant and is enthralled
by an older woman whose dancing is hypnotic. How different would his
life have been, he wonders wistfully, if his uptight mother could
have danced like this sultry older woman?</TE>
<TE>   In "Discipline and Will," dance pulls the torn-apart family
together to watch Eric in a college ballet. Eric, though, performs
solely to please his family; the joy of dance has long ago left him.
"We were splintered again," Harriet reflects post-performance,
"separate, united only by the table, and the glasses and silverware,
and the half-eaten desserts. We loved Eric's dancing, but the dance
was over. And no one could say it was okay."</TE>
<TE>   Kobin's characters find in dance and in their imaginations the
only consolations for a life rife with disappointment and loneliness.
The title story features Phillip on vacation with his second wife and
the grown children from his first marriage. Phillip is unable to see
in a genuine way the flesh-and-blood family gathered around him, so
completely taken is he by the sand sculpture of a naked woman he
creates on the beach. "He was in the center of his own world, in
possession of his perfect woman." With his sand woman, he feels
complete. Real family life, however, holds none of that satisfaction.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Governors Ball had barely begun and Sissy Spacek, looking elegant
in a Maggie Norris couture ivory jacket and black floor-length skirt,
was on her way out. But the best actress nominee wasn't leaving
because she didn't win an Oscar. She was "on the prowl for food" with
her daughters, Schuyler, 19, and Madison, 13.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, there weren't enough seats at her assigned table,
which had plenty of room for a centerpiece of goldfish, koi and other
fancy fish swimming in elevated tanks. So the trio was off "to the
next party" she said, wondering on the way out if the goldfish were
party favors.</LD>
<LD>   They weren't. They were part of the feng shui motif at the
official Academy Awards post-show party in the Grand Ballroom above
the Kodak Theatre. Decorations included beaded chandeliers with
lighted candles--yes, the fire marshal said they were OK--10,000
orchids and a massive water wall.</LD>
<TE>   The show's mistress of ceremonies, Whoopi Goldberg, was a popular
guest, with the likes of Kate Winslet and Nathan Lane queuing to chat
her up.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've ever gone to the Governors Ball and
it is quite beautiful and classy. But I just had to get back into my
normal clothes," Goldberg said, referring to her baggy nonglam look
as she dined on salmon and steak.</TE>
<TE>   A well-heeled crowd of 1,650 noshed on 14,000 hors d'oeuvres, 60
pounds of caviar, 480 bottles of Laurent Perrier champagne and 2,000
bottles of wine. They later danced to the sounds of the 30-piece
Gregg Field Orchestra conducted by Patrick Williams. Gov. Gray Davis,
LAPD Chief Bernard Parks and Ted Turner mingled with Sting, Judi
Dench, Ron Howard, Ian McKellen, Peter Jackson, Randy Newman, Kathy
Bates, John Goodman, Ben Kingsley, Sidney Poitier and Enya.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Close congratulated Russell Crowe, who discreetly held court
on a terrace overlooking Hollywood Boulevard. Close, who changed from
her red-carpet Vera Wang gown into a embroidered coat over a top and
trousers, said she was especially moved by speeches from Poitier and
Robert Redford.</TE>
<TE>   Some who went home without the gold still managed to distinguish
themselves. Dody Dorn, a film editing nominee for "Memento"--a movie
about a man who writes notes on himself because he has no short-term
memory--was temporarily tattooed with messages that paid homage to
the film.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a fear of speaking in public and so I thought that
physical comedy would help me," said Dorn, wearing a strapless red
gown.</TE>
<TE>   If only best supporting actress winner Jennifer Connelly had
thought of something like that. Seated with her entourage, Connelly
had her publicist shoo away reporters because the actress "just
wanted to eat and be left alone."</TE>
<TE>   Just before midnight, Oscar's favorite princess walked in. Glowing
with gratitude, Halle Berry sat with her husband, Eric Benet, and
mother, Judy, as Wolfgang Puck popped open Dom Perignon and served a
warm meal. Berry, in an Elie Saab gown, had been granting nonstop
interviews for three hours, but was gracious enough to speak to the
press. She only asked if she could be allowed to eat first.</TE>
<TE>   The best actress winner was still a bit in shock, she said, adding
that "the first 30 seconds after hearing my name is gone from my
memory." She regretted excluding two important people from her long
list of thank-yous onstage: "I didn't thank [leading man] Billy Bob
Thornton and Jeff Wolman, my business manager," Berry said as the
band started a brassy J. Lo tune. With that, the actress put her
hands on her mother's hips and, along with Benet, formed a conga line
out of the ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judy, Judi, Judy</TE>
<TE>   If you didn't know any better, you'd think that Judi Dench and
Halle Berry were hanging out all night because Halle's mom--as many
noticed--bears a remarkable resemblance to the "Iris" actress. Making
matters more coincidental, her name is also Judy--with a "y." And,
apparently, Judy and Judi favor designer Escada, which they wore
Sunday. The only difference was that Berry helped her mom select her
outfit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The $2.5-Million Woman</TE>
<TE>   In theory, it started out as a $5-million dress covered with 5,000
quarter-carat diamonds valued at $1,000 each from the Boston-based
Hearts on Fire company. Jules Asner, host of E! TV's "Revealed"
program, was picked as the lucky lady to don the gown.</TE>
<TE>   Well, she soon learned the dress had been devalued. Only half the
diamonds made it onto the dress, making it a $2.5-million creation by
New York couture designer Anne Bowen.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that's plenty of loot to consider when the dress is either
put up for auction or each diamond is sold, with half of the proceeds
donated to charity, according to Glenn Rothman, Hearts on Fire boss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Security Alert</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to Sally Kirkland to set off every metal detector she
walked through on her way to the Kodak Theatre. She was even told,
jokingly, that she might have to remove her gown for a thorough
inspection after setting off several alarms twice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made of silk metal alloy," Kirkland said about Los Angeles
designer Julia Gerard's creation. Like a performance artist, Kirkland
then stepped back and demonstrated how several ruched panels in the
front of the gown could be pulled up like mini-blinds for a short or
long look. Kirkland then admitted that her deceased mother, also
named Sally, and a former fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazines
"channeled" her to wear the gown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Charms</TE>
<TE>   Bad boy Russell Crowe stopped on the red carpet not only to show
off his Armani vested tuxedo but to reveal what was in his
pockets--several miniature lucky charms that included a rubber ducky
the size of a thimble and a pewter wizard. "My underpants are even on
a particular way" for good luck, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jackson, too, showed off a lucky green leafy pin on his
lapel and songwriter Enya revealed her lucky piece of jewelry was her
grandmother's wedding ring "that I wear all the time." The three went
home empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parody Party</TE>
<TE>   Miramax decided to celebrate the Academy Awards with a pre-Oscar
party Saturday at the Mondrian Hotel. The mood among 800 guests
packed into the SkyBar was pure summer camp. There were skits, songs
and short films, including a "Behind the Music"-type bio of Oscar
himself, and a parody of "Project Greenlight" in which Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon select Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" script
for the show's second season.</TE>
<TE>   Studio heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein presented the Max awards,
where everyone was a winner--at least those from Oscar-nominated
Miramax films--and got chocolate statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   Diminished seating at the Kodak Theatre was a hot topic. "I don't
see any reason to go to the awards unless you're up for one," author
Salman Rushdie said to a female guest. "Now that would be a small
theater," she retorted.</TE>
<TE>   The good-natured fun culminated in a mock summit between rivals
Harvey Weinstein and DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg in
gladiator garb. Weinstein tore the head off a teddy bear and
Katzenberg hurled fat jokes before the two admitted they love each
other.</TE>

<HD>At Public Stations' Pledge Drives, Love Is On the Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were on the same wavelength, but Alison and Richard Gerber,
devoted listeners of KCRW, didn't know it until they met. Alison
answered the phones. Richard supervised the volunteers. At the end of
the station's pledge drive, they spoke at a volunteer party, and
Richard asked for her phone number. They married within a year.</LD>
<LD>   Public radio and television pledge drives--the seemingly endless
pleas for donations that drive listeners and viewers to
distraction--have sparked so many local romances that some stations
encourage listeners to volunteer and perhaps pick up more than the
phones.</LD>
<LD>   Could it be that public broadcasting, that bastion of good taste
and thoughtful conversation, is also a highbrow meat market?</LD>
<TE>   Two KPCC radio hosts married station volunteers. At least one
person proposed in another local pledge room. And a man answering
phones during one drive is said to have asked out a woman who called
in to make a contribution. Though these affairs may be attributed to
providence as much as public radio, station officials say that the
commonalities of most listeners bring them together once they finally
meet in person.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all so good-looking," Sarah Spitz, producer and publicity
director for KCRW, said of the listeners she's seen at the Santa
Monica station. "They all dress so nice. They all look like savvy,
sophisticated, cultured people." And in radio, where the audience
members rarely interact, the pledge drive is one of the few ways to
meet them.</TE>
<TE>   Involvement in clubs or organizations of any kind generally
improves one's chances of interacting with people of similar
interests. But volunteering can add a deeper meaning to the
involvement--and the relationships that are formed through it.
"People tend to connect with others around their values," said Nina
Atwood, therapist and author of "Be Your Own Dating Service."</TE>
<TE>   Station officials describe public radio and television audiences
as educated, cosmopolitan and curious about the world at large.
Public radio attracts listeners with such a particular sensibility
that personal ads sometimes use it as a point of reference for
potential soul mates, as in "SWM 32, 5'10" blue eyes, short dark
hair....Loves: contemporary art, modern design, fashion photograph,
visionaire, KCRW ....Cool SF, 21-31, into same?"</TE>
<TE>   At KPCC's pledge drive earlier this month, about two dozen
volunteers crammed into a room at Pasadena Community College one
Saturday morning. In between phone calls, the volunteers chatted
about favorite recipes, books and movies. More than one person noted
that it was one of the few places in town to find an "intellectual
crowd."</TE>
<TE>   "You're in a room doing a good deed," Spitz said. "It's a safe
environment. You don't feel like you're being hit on."</TE>
<TE>   Even though sometimes you are.</TE>
<TE>   During a radio break at one drive, KPCC "Morning Edition" host
Steve Julian popped into the pledge room where M.J. Miller was
answering phones. He "flirted shamelessly," Miller noted, until he
had to return to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was off the air, though, Miller had left. Desperate
to see her again, Julian searched through the station's pledge forms
for her e-mail address. He sent her a note and asked her out on a
date. They celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary last month.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing else, it is a great opportunity to meet people like
you," Miller, 34, said. "You may not find the love of your life, but
you can meet some pretty nifty people." Julian, 43, has since told
the story on air, encouraging listeners to volunteer and find their
own mate, but his story is not unique to the station.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Mantle, host of KPCC's "Airtalk," met his wife, Kristen,
during a party for the station's pledge drive volunteers. (When
Mantle approached her at the Arcadia bowling alley, Kristen, 33, said
she "just figured he was schmoozing." Then he asked her to have a
drink, and she realized, "That's something he's not doing with
everybody." They have been married eight years and have a 9-month-old
son.)</TE>
<TE>   Other stations have seen similar relationships form. In her 20
years as director of volunteers at KCET, Dorothy Kemps said, at least
four couples married after meeting at the television station's pledge
drives. But at Long Beach's KLON, membership manager Sean Heitkemper
said most of the volunteers are simply looking for other jazz fans
with whom to attend local concerts. Others told of long-term
friendships, book clubs and vacation groups that formed from pledge
drive volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Events that relate to an individual's interests really are the
best place to meet like-minded people, dating-book author Atwood
says, but she warns against attending them with the sole intention of
finding that someone special. She recommends that singles looking for
partners widen their social circle to meet as many people as
possible, and in so doing, increase their opportunities to meet
potential mates. "Go there because you want to be there anyway,"
Atwood said. "Most couples meet just living life and being involved
in life with other people."</TE>
<TE>   As Richard Gerber knows well. He had volunteered at KCRW for
nearly a decade before he met Alison, 43. When the Manhattan Beach
couple married nine years ago, KCRW published an announcement in its
newsletter. The station did the same when the Gerbers had sons Adam,
8, and Ben, 5. Now, the entire family listens to public radio
together.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio is a community, but you don't meet people who listen to
it," Richard, 56, said. "As a listener, [the pledge drive] happens
too frequently, but as a volunteer, it doesn't happen enough."</TE>

<HD>A Vanity Fair Exclusive</HD>
<DH>It might not have been the most intimate or lavish, but it
was the bash that Hollywood's A-list was dying to get into.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO and LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one corner of the room, Hugh Grant whispers in Nicole Kidman's
ear. She giggles. Nearby, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke greet Gwyneth
Paltrow. Salman Rushdie huddles with his girlfriend, model Padma
Lakshmi. A grinning Ron Perelman has his arm around Ellen Barkin, who
is decked out in diamonds. Rupert Murdoch weighs an Oscar in his
hand. Oprah Winfrey receives endless well-wishers.</LD>
<LD>   But the center of the room belongs to Vanity Fair editor Graydon
Carter, host of this mystique-laden Oscar night gathering.</LD>
<LD>   With a guest list of 1,000 it's not the most intimate party in
Hollywood. And in the land of the $20,000 gift basket, its estimated
$1-million cost may not make it the priciest. But its ability to
manufacture desire and a sense of exclusivity is unrivaled. Everybody
wants into the Vanity Fair Oscar party at Morton's.</LD>
<TE>   "Now that 'Swifty' [Lazar, who died in 1993] doesn't do his
parties at Spago anymore, everyone comes here," says Tom Hanks as
Grant comes up to shake his hand. "Vanity Fair has become sort of a
show business bible."</TE>
<TE>   The party, says Carter, is all about the mix--of celebrity and
power, friendship and obligation, decorum and scandal. In
constructing the guest list, "you like movie stars," he says. "Even
more, you like movie stars bearing golden statuettes. Moguls, studio
heads. You mix it up ... Barbara Walters. Legendary columnists like
Liz Smith. Sports figures, like Tom Brady of the Patriots. European
aristocrats. New York socialites. Somehow, you put it all together."</TE>
<TE>   What members of this select group see when they look around the
room on Oscar night is a collection of faces straight from the
perfumed pages of Vanity Fair's fat April issue on Hollywood, their
fame undiluted by entourages.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems everybody is here," says Rushdie. Nearby, Elvis Costello
talks with friends as Mickey Rourke approaches Chloe Sevigny. Model
Sophie Dahl, in a sparkly dress, smokes a cigarette as Hanks breezes
through.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the stars get excited looking at the stars," says Vanity
Fair contributor Dominick Dunne, a party regular.</TE>
<TE>   In such rarefied company, the room feels safe, says Suzanne
Somers. "You get to feel normal, everybody is so famous."</TE>
<TE>   The party's universe is Carter-centric. "You take your friends
first," he says. "Spreading out, you [invite] people who other people
might like to meet. It's like the ... Ed Sullivan show: the two
Canadian skaters"--silver-turned-gold medalists Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier were on this year's guest list--"certain agents, industry
people. I feel obliged to help them out."</TE>
<TE>   But appeals to Carter's sense of obligation--and appeals in
general--rarely succeed. "I remember Graydon telling me one year,
'It's not who you say yes to, it's who you say no to,'" says Toby
Young, a former Vanity Fair contributor, whose "How to Lose Friends &amp;
Alienate People" (to be published in the U.S. by Da Capo Press in
July) chronicles his years (and parties) with the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The very need to request an invitation signals the ultimate
futility of the effort. But that doesn't stop people from trying. One
famous anecdote has it that Carter was offered $300,000 for entree to
the party. "It's true," Carter confirms, and the amount was only
slightly less than reported. "If it had been $300,000, of course I
would have taken it," he jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The cajoling is ceaseless at Vanity Fair's offices during Oscar
season. "You overhear the following conversations over and over,"
says Young: '"Who? Oh my God! How the hell are you? I haven't heard
from you in, like, 10 years.' Beat. 'Gee, I'd love to help but
there's really nothing I can do. I have no control over that. That's
Graydon's decision. Sorry.' Click. Dial tone."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before a reporter talked by phone with Dunne in New York,
he had received a call from someone in Paris "asking, 'Can you get me
into the party?' No! No!" Dunne exclaimed, adding, "I get a lot of
calls, but they are very short ones."</TE>
<TE>   Dunne, a guest since the beginning, says he would never try to get
friends and acquaintances onto the list. Consequently, "you make a
lot of enemies."</TE>
<TE>   A brush with scandal can boost one's chances for an invitation.
The impeachment chronicles pushed Monica Lewinsky onto the list
twice, and skater Nancy Kerrigan came in 1994, after her run-in with
Tonya Harding. Scandalous behavior at the party, on the other hand,
is a sure-fire way to have visiting privileges revoked. Elizabeth
Hurley and Pamela Anderson weren't in the crowd this year, after some
found their attentions to one another at 2001's party unseemly.
("They can go to a Maxim party," says Carter.)</TE>
<TE>   To ensure an abundance of award-bearing winners, the calligraphed
invitations aren't hand-delivered until after Oscar nominees are
announced in February. Most prized are those sent to 150 or so of
Carter's closest friends and business associates, who are asked to a
5 p.m. dinner and Oscar-watching party. An additional 1,000
invitations go out for the cocktail party afterward. The higher one's
status, the earlier the specified arrival time.</TE>
<TE>   On this year's awards night, Morton's vine-covered stucco exterior
disappears behind a 20-foot-tall scrim of backlit muslin. The words
"Vanity Fair," projected on the material in blues and reds swirled
and looped on the fabric, transform the structure into a giant ad.</TE>
<TE>   Limousines line the block, which is closed to all but party
traffic and crowded with deputies, security guards, and members of
the county's bomb squad, who pace the sidewalk with their German
shepherds. Hordes of fans who've been cordoned off across the street
roar as guests arrive. Inside, the restaurant is shrouded in calm.
The dining room's usual wicker and palms have been cleared to create
an open, airy space. A few booths line the walls. Against an opposite
wall, a bartender stocks his stylish bar, which is backlit in warm
tones.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this room is a large retreat swathed in white. This is the
dining room where the dinner crowd has gathered around 17 tables for
10 to view the Oscar telecast beamed live onto several large
television screens hung around the room.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, as he does every year, dines with Kelly Lynch and her
husband, screenwriter Mitch Glazer, Barry Diller, Diane Von
Furstenberg and Fran Lebowitz. Warren Beatty and Annette Bening
joined the party last year. This year, Perelman and Barkin did too.
David Geffen, who usually sits at Carter's table, was missing.</TE>
<TE>   "People move to us," says Lynch. "A lot come over to speak to
Graydon, telling him who they love, who they hate at their table."
But, she adds, "Billy Wilder, wherever he sits, may be the place to
sit. "Royalty," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey, with whom everyone wants a photo taken, chats with Donna
Karan and Julian Schnabel.</TE>
<TE>   At the commercial break, Diane Sawyer hovers at Carter's table to
talk with him and Barkin. Across from them, gossip columnist Liz
Smith leans over to whisper in Beatty's ear. Most people remain
seated and the noise level in the room rarely rises. For all its
hype, the party is fairly subdued.</TE>
<TE>   But as an overcome Halle Berry appears on screen, the mood shifts.
Winfrey, whom Berry cites as a mentor and supporter, rises to her
feet, and stands for the whole of the speech. Beatty stands as well
when Berry thanks him. Guests wipe away tears. "It actually felt as
if something in society shifted," says John Cleese later in the
evening. Every evening has its story. People still talk about looking
on as Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche met at this party and shared a
first kiss. But on this night the same three names drift through the
crowd all evening: Halle and Denzel and Sidney.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 p.m., the party shifts into high gear. Dinner guests are
leaving and the late-night crowd arrives. Joan Collins stops on her
way out to show off her $3-million borrowed diamonds. Jay Leno tests
new material. His reasons for coming to Vanity Fair's fete? "You get
a free meal at this one," he said. "The other ones, you just get hors
d'oeuvres."</TE>
<TE>   The party comes together over months and overnight. "It's the
turbine behind the scenes that makes the party work smoothly on the
night," says Carter. "The trick is to make it look easy."</TE>
<TE>   The turbine starts spinning in early fall, when the first planning
meetings take place. By November, the party's core planners--its
producer, architect, lighting designer and on-site supervisor--have
begun to fly between offices in London and New York, exchanging
ideas, hatching plans and drawing up the designs that turn a
4,000-square-foot restaurant that usually seats 190 into an
11,000-square-foot  fantasy backdrop lighted by Patrick Woodrooffe,
who also does work for the Rolling Stones and Queen Elizabeth II.</TE>
<TE>   By late February, the details have been agreed upon: Glass bricks
imported from London. Dutch tulips flown in from the Netherlands.
Lighters and ashtrays embossed with the Vanity Fair logo,
commemorating Oscar night.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks before the party, the group sets up a "war room"
at the Beverly Hills Hotel to coordinate the work of a team that, at
its height, swells to several hundred people: construction and video
companies, florists, on-site seamstresses, the restaurant staff,
security and the city of West Hollywood. There is even a "field
office"--a construction trailer parked at Morton's.</TE>
<TE>   Carter himself comes out to supervise the final week of
preparations.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Marks, the 43-year-old Brit who holds the "party producer"
title, manages an 8-foot-long schedule that's posted on the war room
wall. "It's an army maneuver," says Marks, who also heads up Vanity
Fair events in Cannes and London. "It's all about organization."</TE>
<TE>   "Every activity is allocated a certain number of minutes," says
Basil Walter, the team's architect, who creates the look of the party
each year. "It's a fascinating sight."</TE>
<TE>   Time is a fixation because work on the Morton's space doesn't
begin until the Friday before the Sunday night party, when the last
diners leave the restaurant just before midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Workers take sledgehammers to the back wall to create a 20-foot
square entrance to the 7,000-square-foot tent that rises over the
parking lot behind the building. Woodroffe's intricate lighting
systems for the interior and facade are erected. Curtains are sewn on
site. Undulating 20- and 30-foot white couches are arranged.</TE>
<TE>   Two party planners who asked to remain anonymous went category by
category through the costs of producing an event like Vanity Fair's
in L.A. and put the tab at $800,000. That estimate didn't include the
salaries of the core staff over the months of planning, nor the cost
of flying in additional support staffers from New York the week
before the party. There's also the cost of relocating a number of the
restaurant's neighbors to hotels for the night. Add an estimated
$33,500 to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for overtime
paid to 39 officers for crowd and traffic control, and $9,100 to the
city of West Hollywood for permits and the use of scores of parking
meters, and the total would seem to surpass $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Is it $2 million? When asked, Carter deflects. "Nowhere near that.
It's less.... Half. Less than half."</TE>
<TE>   For Carter, the party is a bargain. It "is a huge source of
favor-giving," says Young, the former Vanity Fair contributor. "When
negotiating with advertisers or other associates, it can be brought
up, as in 'and I can get you in to the Vanity Fair party.' That's
case closed, done deal." (The magazine includes 50 advertisers among
its guests.)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most significant, the magazine has tapped the party buzz
with its now-fat Hollywood issue and, says Carter, "between the party
and the issue, April becomes a blockbuster month."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Carter has also used his time in L.A. to promote a
documentary on legendary producer Robert Evans, of which he is the
executive producer. Yet, he maintains, "I'm independent of Hollywood.
I've got nothing to sell," he adds. "We're not of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   How did an "outsider" become the social arbiter of Hollywood's
biggest night? He appointed himself inheritor of "Swifty" Lazar's
legendary Oscar night party.</TE>
<TE>   Lazar's gatherings "provided the dazzle of what old Hollywood must
have been," says Dunne. When the fetes began in the early '60s at the
Lazars' home, they drew stars such as Audrey Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart,
George Burns and Shirley MacLaine, and it didn't take long for an
invitation to become the ultimate status symbol.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, the expanding bash moved to Spago, Wolfgang Puck's new
spot above Sunset Boulevard. Fans lined the steep slopes of Horn
Avenue to cheer the arriving limos driving up to the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Lazar ruled the room and kept a tight rein on his guest list. "It
was like 200 people tops," says Joan Rivers. "I once asked him [if I
could] bring Wallace Annenberg and he said 'No room.'"</TE>
<TE>   Lazar's death at the close of 1993 left a vacuum that both Carter
and producer Steve Tisch rushed to fill. On New Year's Eve, the day
after Lazar died, Tisch called his friend Peter Morton to reserve his
restaurant for Oscar night. "I said, 'Look, Swifty Lazar has died and
along with his death goes his legendary Academy Awards party,'" Tisch
recalls. "'Why don't we do one for our generation?'"</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, Tisch heard from Carter, who wanted to co-host
the event. As the two worked together, Vanity Fair's guest list
quickly surpassed Tisch's, he says. "I was very aware of the
800-pound gorilla in the room."</TE>
<TE>   By year three, the party was all Carter's. "I remember what I
thought was going to be a lot of fun ... turning into a nightmare,"
Tisch said. "People were coming out of the woodwork ... with subtle
and not so subtle threats. They were saying: 'If I don't get invited,
it's going to affect your ability to do business.'"</TE>
<TE>   Under Carter, the guest list grew, reaching 1,500 last year,
before fears that it would lose its exclusivity led planners to pare
this year's cocktail party by 500.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:45, the party is gathering momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The tables have been removed, and the only pieces of furniture
inside are 20- and 30-foot-long curving sofas lining the wall, small
plexiglass coffee tables, and a couple of tall tables with flower
decorations. A DJ on a topiary-covered elevated platform gets to
work, though his music will be background, not the main event.</TE>
<TE>   As some dinner guests are leaving (producer Robert Evans sneaked
out, closely followed by Vogue's Anna Wintour,) others went party
hopping ("We'll be back," Joan Collins to the assembled paparazzi
with a wave of her hand,) and the crush of after-dinner guests began
arriving.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great people-watching," says Bening.</TE>
<TE>   "You do tend to have too much champagne and you do tend to leave
barefoot," Sally Kirkland says. "I don't think I've ever left
Morton's with my shoes on."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood being Hollywood, eyes are caught, lunches are scheduled,
the seeds of deals are planted. The most famous? "Ellen Barkin and
Ron Perelman," jokes Carter. New York-based Trey Laird, a Vanity Fair
advertiser who handles the Gap and Donna Karan accounts, hatched at
least one high-profile idea: Jeremy Irons modeling Donna Karan
clothes, for a campaign that ran in Vanity Fair, among other places.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked in, and I thought, I've got to work with Jeremy Irons,"
said Laird.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening wears on, "moments flash by, almost like a silent
film," says Lynch. "I see dresses, faces, bits of conversation,
dramas."</TE>
<TE>   Ringmaster Carter winds through it all, central and apart. One
year, he recalls, he stood outside around 10:30 p.m., smoking a
cigarette and watching as three Oscar winners, clutching their
statuettes, waited with 20 other people before being waved in. It was
the moment, he says, that epitomized his party.</TE>

<HD>Oscar's Glow Offers No Warmth for Those Chillin' in the
Limo Line</HD>
<DH>The famous and ordinary alike get left in the cold waiting
for their cars to arrive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the mind-altering experiences of Oscar night--the walk through
the red-carpet canyon of screaming fans and flashing paparazzi, the
realization that you are expected to go six hours fueled only by one
tiny puff pastry--nothing compares with the wait at limousine pickup.</LD>
<LD>   With a midnight March wind whipping down Highland Avenue, you
stand shivering in a strapless evening gown, eyeing all the men in
tuxedos and swearing you will never go to the Oscars again without a
male companion, preferably your husband, because he is required by
marital law to surrender the jacket.</LD>
<LD>   Then, backing under a heat lamp, you realize that those waiting
for cars with you are not other hapless non-nominees. There is Dame
Judi Dench, who knew better than to go strapless in March, and Ben
Kingsley chatting amiably. Just behind you are Nathan Lane and Ian
McKellen, Peter Jackson and several people clutching Oscars.</LD>
<TE>   As a slow-moving river of limousines, an unrolling satin bolt of
limousines passes by--none of them yours--you notice that Oscar
statuettes are everywhere. They are propped up like drunks on
newspaper boxes while their owners shout into cell phones that
they've been waiting for their car for 45 minutes now and it's
freaking cold out here; they are tucked into armpits as the winners
rub their hands together for warmth. A few are even waved wildly like
a wizard's staff over the relentless rush of black steel, as if Oscar
had the power to summon limo No. 639 from the depths of Highland.
Which, it turns out, he does not.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, names are being called out with the
numbers--extraordinary names like Maggie Smith and John Nash--and
there they were, these famous people, scurrying between limos,
disappearing into the dark warmth of their cars as other equally
celebrated people gazed longingly. Jackson, writer and director of
"The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring," reserved his car
with the name Underhill, which made this Tolkien fan laugh out loud
even as she wondered whom you had to sleep with to get in a car, any
car.</TE>
<TE>   For fans of democracy, there was something encouraging about the
fact that Hollywood traffic showed no favoritism, that Dame and dame,
winners and non-nominees huddled under the same heat lamps, sipping
the same complimentary espresso, warmed mostly by the same rising
frustration at the wait. In the end, we're all just people, and none
of us can fly. But it is a bittersweet epiphany because if, after all
this, all the flowers and gowns and gilt and street closures, the
coverage, the campaigns and the sheer brutal size of the thing, if
after all this, winning an Oscar doesn't get you your limo the moment
you want it, then, really, what the heck is it good for?</TE>

<LD>Did you have a school picture taken this year? If so, what did you
wear? Did you have on your favorite clothes?</LD>
<LD>   A portrait is a record of the way someone looks at a particular
moment in time, like your first-grade school photo. There are often
clues in portraits that tell the viewer about the life of the person
in the portrait. For example, you could provide a clue about your
favorite color by wearing a shirt of that color in your school
picture.</LD>
<LD>   Take a close look at this portrait. What clues do you see? Can you
see the hammer and the wagon wheel? Can you find the horseshoes? What
is the man wearing? From these clues, can you guess what type of work
he does?</LD>
<TE>   This portrait is called "Red Moore: The Blacksmith." Moore was a
farmer and a blacksmith. A blacksmith is someone who heats iron and
uses a hammer to shape it into everyday objects like horseshoes and
tools. Blacksmiths wear leather aprons and heavy work boots so they
will not burn themselves on the hot metal.</TE>
<TE>   A man named Eugene Speicher painted this portrait. He and other
American artists who painted during the 1930s were called
Regionalists. They focused on patriotic subjects and celebrated the
lives of American workers in their paintings. You can see Speicher's
portrait and many others at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For

<LD>* America has given us a beautiful place to live. It has given us
freedom. We can do anything and be anything. What this nation really
is about is different cultures and religions. I know that the
president really cares about America because he got upset when he
found out about Sept. 11. Since the terrorist attack, I think
everyone realized how much America has done for us. I think everyone
should be proud of being an American.</LD>

<TE>   The thing I love most about America is that it has changed many
times over the years. It has changed to let girls like me go to
school and get a good education. It has changed to let people of all
colors do the same things. And last but not least, it has changed to
become a country where everybody has a say in what's going on. I love
America!</TE>

<HD>Sarah's Easter Basket</HD>
<DH>Part 2 / The story so far: Sarah is telling her parents
about what happened on her egg hunt before breakfast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOBETTE NEWCOMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"While I was hunting for my Easter eggs," Sarah said, "I ran around
to Mommy's flower garden, and guess what? My pet chicken, Brownie,
was there with her brand new family of 12 baby chicks! I called for
her to follow me out of the garden, but she wouldn't come. She was
too busy finding something special, like tiny little flower seeds,
for her chicks' Easter breakfast."</LD>
<LD>   Sarah's mother laughed. "Well, what could be more perfect than a
mother hen and her 12 baby chicks in my flower garden on Easter?"</LD>
<LD>   Sarah's father just said thoughtfully, "Brownie must have found
the garden gate open."</LD>
<TE>   When breakfast was over, Sarah's father went out to the barn to
finish his morning work. Sarah and her mother cleared away the
dishes, leaving just Sarah's basket of eggs on the table.</TE>
<TE>   As they cleaned up the kitchen, they noticed that it was getting
darker and darker outside. Big gray clouds were gathering in the sky.
A strange stillness was settling over the farm. The animals had
stopped making their usual noises, and even the birds in the trees
seemed to be listening and waiting for something to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Then, all at once, it did! The wind started to blow, lightning
zigzagged in the sky, thunder crashed loudly and big drops of rain
came pounding down on the farmhouse roof.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, dear!" said Sarah's mother. "I had a feeling we were going to
have an early spring thunderstorm before this day was over."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah sighed, "I love when it rains, but I'll have to think of
something to do in the house all day if it keeps coming down and
coming down."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah opened the kitchen door and looked outside. Now the rain was
falling in a real torrent. Suddenly, she thought of something!</TE>

<HD>Andersen Asks Judge to Block Questioning</HD>
<DH>Courts: The accounting firm contends federal prosecutors
are abusing the grand jury process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for accounting firm Andersen Monday asked a federal judge to
bar prosecutors from questioning witnesses in front of a grand jury
about the evidence underlying the government's indictment against the
company.</LD>
<LD>   A motion filed in federal court in Houston contends prosecutors
are attempting to call at least four Andersen partners and employees
to testify before the panel under oath.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen said prosecutors are abusing the grand jury process by
using it to question witnesses about the evidence relating to a
charge that had already been filed. On March 7 the grand jury handed
up an indictment against Andersen for obstruction of justice.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesperson for the Justice Department could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was fired as auditor by more companies Monday as the
company tries to settle lawsuits related to the collapse of former
client Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine Corp., a U.S. power-plant builder, and Centex Corp., the
fourth-largest U.S. homebuilder, dropped Andersen. San Jose-based
Calpine hired Deloitte &amp; Touche and Dallas-based Centex named Ernst &amp;
Young.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Northeast Utilities said it would fire Andersen and
hire Deloitte, as did oil products maker Pennzoil-Quaker State Co.
and drug maker ILEX Oncology Inc., the companies said in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost more than 60 U.S. clients, including 23
companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, as well as affiliates
in Russia, Spain, China, Hong Kong and New Zealand to rivals this
year. Andersen is trying to survive lawsuits filed by Enron
shareholders and a U.S. criminal charge of obstructing an
investigation into the collapse of the energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   "If this client exodus continues, and if the foreign affiliates
continue to leave and partners continue to leave, it'll be very
difficult for them to survive," said Charles Drott, a former partner
at Touche Ross, Deloitte &amp; Touche's predecessor, and an expert on
accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway Golf Co., First Financial Bankshares Inc. and Action
Performance Cos. also fired Andersen on Monday. Many of Chicago-based
Andersen's remaining clients may wait for the result of the criminal
trial, which will start May 6, said Joseph Carcello, an accounting
professor at the University of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has called the criminal charge a "death penalty" and is
rallying its 28,000 U.S. employees to protest the Justice
Department's indictment of the firm. The company says the charge is
unfair because only a few employees destroyed Enron documents.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if President Bush believes the indictment is unjust, White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, "The president has faith in the
people he has appointed at the Department of Justice. Those are not
issues that the White House micromanages."</TE>
<TE>   In a rescue bid, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
proposed Friday to take over and reshape Andersen if the Justice
Department agrees to drop the criminal charge and Enron shareholders
and creditors settle lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Affiliates outside the U.S., which contributed more than half of
Andersen's $9.3 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31,
are leaving on concern Andersen may not survive.</TE>
<TE>   The New Zealand affiliate joined Ernst &amp; Young International,
which picked up Andersen's Russian unit. Andersen's Chinese and Hong
Kong affiliates plan to join PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has been in talks to sell the overseas operations to
rival KPMG International, a plan threatened by the splintering
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen will try to keep affiliates from leaving by enforcing
contracts that require them to pay Andersen for dropping out of the
company's network.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen wants a single deal to get the best price, collect the
most in penalty fees from defectors and ensure as many employees as
possible find jobs, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Enron shareholders and employees have named Andersen as a
co-defendant in suits that claim Enron stock dropped $68 billion in
value on news that Enron hid debt and inflated income on books
Andersen audited.</TE>

<HD>AOL to Take a $54-Billion Write-Down</HD>
<DH>Media: The first-quarter charge is the largest in corporate
history and reflects a drop in the value of assets acquired in the
firm's merger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. will take a record $54-billion write-down in the
first quarter to reflect a steep decline in the value of assets
acquired last year when the leading Internet service provider bought
the world's largest entertainment company.</LD>
<LD>   The company, whose stock has declined nearly 50% in the last year,
warned Wall Street in January that it would take a noncash charge
against earnings of $40 billion to $60 billion because of new
accounting rules governing merger deals.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner's write-off, disclosed in a filing Monday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, is the largest in corporate
history, surpassing telecom equipment firm JDS Uniphase Corp.'s
record $50.1-billion charge in fiscal 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts weren't surprised that AOL Time Warner's charge was at
the high end of the range the company had given, in light of the
firm's lower-than-expected earnings over the last year. Earnings
suffered amid an advertising slump and a slowdown at the America
Online Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   AOL shares closed Monday at $24.21, down 29 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock is down 25% since Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The write-off is a reflection of the reversal in sentiment toward
the Internet sector and the dramatic downturn in its value over the
last two years. When America Online announced the merger with Time
Warner in January 2000, the companies were worth $290 billion
combined, compared with $126 billion when the acquisition was
completed a year later and $111 billion today.</TE>
<TE>   New U.S. accounting rules require companies to quickly account for
the "impairment" of assets acquired in mergers.</TE>
<TE>   In a takeover, the price a company pays above the market value of
the target's assets is carried as "goodwill" on the balance sheet.
Under the new rules, that goodwill must be adjusted if the company
believes the asset values are worth substantially less.</TE>
<TE>   The adjustment is taken in the form of a one-time write-off that
amounts to a balance-sheet change, but doesn't affect the company's
basic operations.</TE>
<TE>   A number of technology companies have recorded or are expected to
record large goodwill write-offs as a result of the change in
accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing Monday, AOL Time Warner also said discussions with
its cable partner, Advance/Newhouse, could lead to a restructuring of
the joint venture at the end of the month. Advance/Newhouse
contributed about 7 million of the joint venture's 12.8 million cable
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Advance/Newhouse has the ability to pull its assets out of the
partnership at the end of the month, which would reduce AOL from the
nation's second-largest cable operator to the sixth-ranked.</TE>
<TE>   The possible cable restructuring is just the latest in a series of
setbacks since the AOL Time Warner merger was initiated in January
2000. Among the biggest challenges is the poor performance of America
Online, which was pitched to investors as the growth engine of the
new company.</TE>
<TE>   But the Internet service provider is instead the poorest performer
in the company, with growth in operating income expected to drop to
10% this year, down from 76% in 2000, according to a Merrill Lynch
research report.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros., which expects growth to slow even more, reports the
AOL division is being hurt by a combination of factors, including
management turnover, a slump in advertising and the difficulty of
keeping customers paying full rates for its service. Many investors
say AOL is heavily discounting its service or giving it away for free
to keep subscribers from terminating.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner is expected to earn 15 cents a share, excluding
certain expenses, in the first quarter, according to the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. In the
year-earlier period, the company earned 23 cents a share before
expenses such as amortization.</TE>
<TE>   According to the company's filing Monday, AOL repurchased about
20.4 million shares of its common stock for about $733 million during
the fourth quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The purchases fall under a buyback program authorized in January
that calls for the company to repurchase common shares from time to
time for up to $5 billion over a two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   As of Dec. 31, 2001, AOL Time Warner had repurchased 75.8 million
shares for $3.03 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to maintain financial flexibility and investment
capacity, the pace of share repurchases under this program may
decrease in 2002, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The company paid an average of $39.99 a share for the stock.</TE>
<TE>   As of Feb. 28, the company had about 4.3 billion common shares
outstanding.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Expected to Reject Bank Plan</HD>
<DH>Development: City officials say the proposal for the
community institution does not fix the shortage of jobs or a funding
shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials are calling for the rejection of the Los
Angeles Community Development Bank's new business plan, throwing the
future of the beleaguered institution into question.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council is expected to act on the recommendation today.</LD>
<LD>   The business plan lays out the budget for the quasi-private bank,
which cannot operate without city approval. The bank was created in
the wake of the 1992 riots to revitalize business in the city's
poorest pockets. But it has fallen short of its mandate to create
jobs for local residents.</LD>
<TE>   In making their recommendation, city officials said the bank plan
didn't do enough to correct the job problem. The report also said the
plan did not address a funding shortfall that has crippled the bank's
ability to lend.</TE>
<TE>   The bank--funded with $430million from the Department of Housing
and Urban Development--still sits on almost $200 million in potential
loan funds. But it has nearly run out of the federal grant dollars
needed to administer those funds.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members, increasingly impatient with the bank's
performance, questioned the annual business plan in December, giving
the institution three months to come up with an improved strategy to
solve its problems.</TE>
<TE>   But the bank's efforts fell short, said Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us have grown weary," he said Monday. "The bank's
problems and challenges are not small ones. The city has to proceed
in a way that protects the public's interest and taxpayers' dollars."</TE>
<TE>   The city controls the bank's purse strings and guarantees hundreds
of millions of dollars in federal loans to the bank. That means that
if the bank fails, the city stands to lose future grants critical to
community development programs.</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting the business plan--which would be unprecedented--would
continue bank funding for 90 days and trigger a new round of
negotiations between the city staff and bank executives.</TE>
<TE>   If the issues are not resolved, the city has the option of
shutting down or taking over the bank, hailed as a community
development milestone by the Clinton administration when it was
launched in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Still, bank officials who have worked hard to save the institution
were optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity ... to sit down over the next 90 days and
determine what this bank should be," said Robert Sausedo, the
recently appointed chairman of the bank's board.</TE>
<TE>   Sausedo said he is working on several restructuring efforts.
Although he declined to discuss them yet, he said he is confident
that a plan will be negotiated "that the city will be willing to live
with, that brings continued expertise to this kind of lending and
meets the objectives of the public good."</TE>
<TE>   But one source familiar with the city negotiations say the bank's
continued survival is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The action comes as HUD's Office of Inspector General is preparing
to release an audit of the bank begun more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The report submitted by staff to the council for today's vote
acknowledges the "many recent accomplishments" outlined by the bank
in its revised business plan.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the bank has loaned $130 million to businesses in
poor neighborhoods since its inception and provided a bridge loan to
Chesterfield Square, the largest commercial development in
South-Central Los Angeles in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001 alone, it closed $6 million in transactions, stepped up
its job creation efforts and resolved several lawsuits, the business
plan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank officials say most of the problems stem from early missteps
that predate current Chief Executive William Chu, who has worked hard
to rebuild the institution. Many of the bank's early loans soured,
including one that ballooned to $24 million. And the bank is
appealing a $10-million judgment on behalf of one early borrower.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern to council members is a $35-million program
to channel venture capital into small technology companies in the
hopes of a fast payoff in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   The start-ups--many of which faltered as the economy soured--were
not located in the core neighborhoods the bank aims to serve and have
created almost no jobs for residents there.</TE>
<TE>   That program pushed the bank far afield of its mission. According
to the most recent reports available, by last summer the bank had
channeled only 11% of the total jobs it created to the people it was
designed to serve, rather than the 51% required by HUD.</TE>

<HD>Worries About Sub-Prime Market Drag Down Lenders, Card
Issuers</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Some analysts fear that rising interest
rates could lead to higher default rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of credit card companies and lenders to consumers with spotty
payment histories tumbled Monday after a Metris Cos. financial report
raised concerns about the so-called sub-prime market.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Minneapolis-based Metris, the nation's 10th-largest
issuer of credit cards, tumbled $5.67 to $19.03 in New York Stock
Exchange trading, a 23% decline.</LD>
<LD>   Larger credit card issuers also declined, with Capital One
Financial Corp. down $2.83 at $60.54 and MBNA Corp. off $1.32 at
$37.43. Household International Inc., the giant lender to borrowers
with tarnished credit, fell $1.84 to $56.30, while AmeriCredit Corp.,
whose customers can't qualify for traditional auto loans, was down
$2.08 at $36.29. All trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Metris issues credit cards through its Direct Merchants Bank
subsidiary and for Banco Popular and Western Union.</TE>
<TE>   Metris specializes in lending to customers with limited credit
histories, part of a decade-old trend that includes making unsecured
loans to consumers with poor credit histories or none at all.</TE>
<TE>   The borrowers' ability to stay current on credit card debt has
never been tested by recession. Some analysts worry they'll be
pinched by rising interest rates, which could translate into a rising
default rate for Metris and similar lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Metris describes its customers as moderate income, avoiding the
term sub-prime, but Wachovia Securities analyst Meredith A. Whitney
said Monday that most of them had credit blemishes. In its annual
report Friday, Metris disclosed rising loan losses, higher average
account balances and the fact that Direct Merchants Bank was
undercapitalized briefly last year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is suggestive of a cash-strapped/strained sub-prime consumer
that has been hardest hit by the recession," Whitney wrote. "The
company's plans to raise rates on its credit cards later this year
should put more pressure on its customers."</TE>
<TE>   She cut her estimate of Metris' 2002 earnings from $3.05 to $2.40
a share and for 2003 from $3.45 to $2.70.</TE>
<TE>   Because consumers default sooner on credit card debt than on
mortgages or auto loans, the business is sensitive to economic
downturns. Last fall, regulators ordered Providian Financial Corp. to
stop extending credit to sub-prime borrowers, and in February
regulators closed the bank operated by NextCard Inc., the largest
marketer of cards over the Internet. Greater than anticipated loan
losses were cited in both cases.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such actions, many analysts remain bullish on credit card
and sub-prime lenders. Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Todd A.
Pitsinger, who rates Metris a "buy," said Metris, MBNA and Capital
One shares had risen sharply in the last three weeks, so the sell-off
was unsurprising Monday, when a wide range of stocks sharply declined
on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Calling rising loan problems "old news" for consumer finance
companies, Pitsinger said he was encouraged by last week's government
reports that inflation remained tame while first-time claims for
unemployment benefits fell, suggesting the economy was getting
stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are employed, they'll pay their bills," Pitsinger said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders of Rodamco North America, the fourth-largest U.S.
shopping mall owner, accepted a $5.3-billion takeover offer,
dismissing complaints that the bid was too low and that the company's
executives had mismanaged events leading up to the offer.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders representing 88% of the votes supported the offer.
The real estate investment company needed approval from two-thirds of
the votes represented.</LD>
<LD>   Rodamco agreed in January to a three-way takeover by Westfield
America Trust, Rouse Co. and Simon Property Group Inc. A battle for
control of the Dutch company started in August when Australia's
Westfield bought 24% of Rodamco and tried to oust its management.</LD>

<HD>Judge OKs Altered Global Deal</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal Bankruptcy Court ruling Monday set the stage for what could
be a highly contested auction for telecommunications company Global
Crossing Ltd. and its worldwide network of high-speed, fiber-optic
cable.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in
Manhattan gave Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia until May 21 to top their $750-million bid for
Global Crossing. Other potential buyers have until June 20 to respond
with rival offers.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert Gerber said he was troubled by the bidding procedure
in its original form but that a modified proposal addressed his
concerns.</LD>
<TE>   "The process must be fair and it must be a level playing field,"
Gerber told a packed courtroom as he approved a modified letter of
intent for Hutchison--owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's
richest man--and ST Telemedia to acquire Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, which also faces probes by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FBI, has said more than 40 other
companies are considering offers.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   Representing debt of about $12.4 billion, the filing was the
fourth-largest U.S. bankruptcy petition.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber also ruled that Hutchison and ST Telemedia would be
eligible for a breakup fee of $30million--down from the original
$40million--but only if the firms increase their offer for Global
Crossing; the offer is approved by the company, banks and creditors'
committees; and the bid is ultimately topped by another bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Under the original deal, the two companies would have received $40
million if the court turned down their current buyout proposal, a
near-certain scenario because the offer has been widely criticized as
inadequate and politically troublesome because of their ties to the
Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   The judge approved the new breakup fee despite an objection from
FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s Fleet National that the reduced figure
was negotiated in secret. An attorney for Fleet, one of 91 banks
trying to recover roughly $2.2 billion owed to them by Global
Crossing, asked for another hearing on the matter, but the judge
denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   Others were pleased with the modified deal, which includes "very
important changes," according to Joe Ryan, an attorney representing
unsecured creditors. "We wanted to be sure that there was a procedure
that would allow enough time for other bidders to come forward, and
also one that didn't have so many bidder protections that others
would be discouraged from bidding."</TE>
<TE>   The new bidding procedures are more flexible and allow Global
Crossing to pursue bids simultaneously for the entire company and for
non-core parts of the business, such as the company's Global Marine
cable installation and maintenance unit. In addition, Global Crossing
can pursue talks with investors who may want to buy a piece of the
reorganized company.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber also approved a $5-million payment to the Hutchison group
to cover costs for assembling the takeover proposal. The original
motion had called for a $10-million fee. The judge rejected a request
from a shareholder group for $2.5million to cover the cost of
formulating a bid on behalf of stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber scheduled the auction for July 8, with results to be
confirmed July 11.</TE>

<LD>Counting on Southern California's economy to rebound over the long
term, four experienced Southern California real estate developers
have formed a venture that plans to invest as much as $75 million a
year in each of the next two years to turn around under-performing
office and industrial properties.</LD>
<LD>   The Aliso Viejo-based venture, called Parker Hansen, is led by
John Parker of Parker Properties and Erik Hansen, formerly managing
partner of the Southern California region of Legacy Partners
Commercial. The two other partners are Russell Parker and Lee
Redmond, both executives at Parker Properties.</LD>
<LD>   The new venture will focus on deals ranging from $5 million to $50
million, according to Hansen, who said the partners have lined up
institutions and individuals as capital sources for their projects.</LD>
<TE>   The partners initially will focus on "value-added" projects, they
said, meaning properties that can be turned around or made more
profitable through renovation, remodeling and marketing programs
designed either to fill empty space or boost rents or both.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen acknowledged that Southern California business now is in
"the down part of the cycle," making it harder for the venture to
execute its strategy if the economy does not pick up.</TE>
<TE>   "But we believe the Southern California economy will improve and
will bring stronger demand," he said, adding that the new partnership
initially will concentrate on office projects.</TE>

<DH>Courts: Lawyer hired to defend Andersen is known for
withering cross-examinations, not cutting deals in his high-profile
cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his North Carolina drawl, attorney Russell "Rusty" Hardin explains
how he drew out former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith's nasty side
on the witness stand during a recent trial.</LD>
<LD>   "I had seen her limited and unremarkable movies," Hardin said. "On
the stand one day, in one of her soliloquies, she's crying, doing
much better than in her movies. I asked her if she had taken new
acting lessons."</LD>
<LD>   Smith responded with an expletive. Hardin won the case, denying
Smith the $2 billion she sought from her late husband's estate. But
the 60-year-old lawyer now faces a much tougher matchup: defending
the Andersen accounting firm against a criminal indictment by the
Justice Department.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen has vowed to fight the obstruction-of-justice charge.
Hammering out a settlement is technically possible, but Hardin isn't
known as a deal maker. He's a litigator.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the case probably will shape the structure of the
accounting industry, decide whether Andersen lives or dies and
determine how much money the firm might have to pay Enron Corp.
shareholders and creditors.</TE>
<TE>   A former Texas prosecutor known for his withering
cross-examinations, Hardin has represented all manner of high-profile
clients since entering private practice, including former Houston
Oilers quarterback Warren Moon and baseball star Wade Boggs.</TE>
<TE>   After less than 30 minutes of jury deliberations, Moon was
acquitted of charges that he assaulted his wife. Boggs was cleared of
sexual harassment charges. But most of Hardin's Houston-based
practice is devoted to civil cases.</TE>
<TE>   There are some lines Hardin won't cross.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do rapes, robberies or delivery of drugs unless I believe
the client didn't do it," he said. "I'm just not comfortable with
those. I was a prosecutor too long to be doing those cases with
people that I secretly believe did it. Everybody's entitled to an
adequate defense; they're just not entitled to my defense."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen hired him last year to defend it against a class-action
lawsuit filed by Enron shareholders, who allege that the accounting
firm played a role in the energy giant's financial meltdown. But two
weeks ago, the Justice Department added a federal indictment to his
caseload.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said he was looking forward to the chance to express his
beliefs about his client--an experience that he said was central to
his zest for his profession.</TE>
<TE>   "I like trying to persuade people to the point of view that I
have. There are a lot of lawyers that are outstanding no matter what
the issue is. If it's dark outside, I'm not very good at arguing it's
daylight. I'm only effective if I believe in what I'm doing.</TE>
<TE>   "If Andersen was really the sort of organization that deserved to
be demonized by the federal government, I wouldn't represent them
because I wouldn't like them."</TE>
<TE>   Bulldog Litigator, Savvy Public-Relations Expert</TE>
<TE>   Hardin grew up in a small North Carolina town and said he always
wanted to be a lawyer. He said he flunked out of Wesleyan University
("You were 20 years old and you were in Connecticut in springtime,"
he explained), served in Vietnam and afterward entered the law school
at Dallas' Southern Methodist University.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating, he spent 15 years as an assistant district
attorney in Houston. He said he never lost a felony case.</TE>
<TE>   He left the prosecutor's office to start a political action
committee, Texas People Against Crime, aimed at mobilizing voters to
remove soft-on-crime judges from the bench. In 1991, he set up his
private law practice, focusing on litigating civil cases for crime
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, he won a $65-million judgment for the estate of
an elderly woman who had been molested in a nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin also was tapped to aid independent counsel Robert Fiske,
the prosecutor appointed to probe the Whitewater case. He stayed on
as chief trial counsel for the team after Fiske was replaced with
Kenneth Starr, but left to return to his practice when it appeared
key figures in the case would be pleading guilty without a trial.
Fiske is an attorney with Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, another law firm
retained by Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm, in severe need of a bulldog litigator and a
savvy public-relations expert, may have found both in Hardin,
colleagues say.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to get public opinion going his way," said Gerald
Treece, associate dean of the South Texas College of Law and a
veteran of the Houston legal scene. "Every other case, he's gotten in
front of the story in terms of public opinion. I just don't know if
you can in a case like this. But he's got his dander up, and he's
ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin's sense of how stories play out has helped him win over
juries in major cases. In the Smith trial, Hardin represented the son
of late oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall, who married Smith in 1994 at
age 89 despite a 63-year age gap and then died 14 months later.</TE>
<TE>   When the opportunity arose, Hardin made light of Smith's assertion
that her late husband referred to her as "the light of my life." In
his closing arguments, Hardin played the chorus of the Debby Boone
pop hit "You Light Up My Life" from a recording his son had
downloaded from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdict, jurors sang him the song. (A federal judge in
California later granted Smith an $89-million award in a related
case.)</TE>
<TE>   Believing in the Justice System</TE>
<TE>   The Andersen case probably will prove a more sober affair. But
Hardin said he had no regrets about the cases he had taken to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones I'm sorry I took, I fired the clients. I've had a couple
of cases where I fired clients because they lied to me. But
representing people or corporations who have a problem is a trip that
I adore.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest regret is that corporations feel the need to settle
cases that shouldn't be settled. They think it is economically
cheaper to settle than it is to try it. I think that's an abuse of
the system. What the heck was the system created for?"</TE>

<HD>Home Sales Fall Slightly From Record-High Rate</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of existing U.S. homes fell slightly in February but still
posted the second-best annual rate ever, showing the housing sector
remains on firm footing, a national real estate trade association
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of previously owned homes, the largest category of home
sales, declined 2.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 5.88 million, the National Assn. of Realtors said.</LD>
<LD>   The January rate was revised upward to a record 6.05 million.</LD>
<TE>   February's pace exceeded the forecasts of analysts, who on average
had expected an annual sales rate of 5.52 million. Housing activity
has remained vigorous throughout the U.S. economic slump that started
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Median home prices were down a statistically insignificant amount
last month, to $150,000 from $150,300 in January, but were up 8.2%
from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the California Assn. of Realtors said the
number of previously owned homes sold in the state jumped 25.5% in
February from a year earlier, lifting prices by a robust 19.8% and
pushing many first-time homeowner dreams out the window.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about rising interest rates and ongoing tight supply drove
the median price on an existing single-family home up to $289,550
during February, from $241,690 last year, CAR reported.</TE>
<TE>   Regionally, sales climbed by 1.4% in the Northeast but fell 4.2%
in the South, 3.7% in the West, and 0.8% in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Inventories remained lean at an unchanged 4.2 months' supply of
homes available at the current sales pace.</TE>

<HD>Small Firms Eager to Buy Buildings</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Demand for industrial space exceeds supply as
low interest rates make owning attractive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small businesses are buying industrial buildings in Los Angeles and
Orange counties faster than developers can finish them, creating a
hot spot in an otherwise tepid market for industrial space.</LD>
<LD>   The buying binge is primarily the result of low interest rates,
prompting scores of small businesses that rented their industrial
space to buy buildings in the 5,000-to-30,000-square-foot range.
There can be tax benefits for owners as well.</LD>
<LD>   Developers have built and sold nearly 150 such small industrial
buildings in Orange County and 100 in Los Angeles County in the last
two years, selling most of them before or soon after construction was
completed. Businesses buy the small industrial buildings for a
variety of warehouse, service and light assembly operations, but
relatively few of the buildings are being used as factories.</LD>
<TE>   Whether to rent or to buy is always a question for firms that
occupy small industrial spaces, but low interest rates tilt the
scales so heavily in favor of buying that the decision is a snap for
many small-business owners, brokers say.</TE>
<TE>   "For a 10% down payment, an owner can have a monthly mortgage
payment that is less than the rent would be for the same amount of
space," said broker John Carver of Colliers Seeley International, the
listing agent for Carson Town Center, a new project of small and
mid-size industrial buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "Four of the 11 buildings are in escrow and they don't even have
roofs on them yet," Carver said, "and two more are close to escrow."
The project is scheduled for completion in about four months.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings sell quickly because demand exceeds supply, Carver
said. Few small industrial buildings are put up for sale because
those who own such properties tend to keep them.</TE>
<TE>   That means most of the action is in new buildings, and developers
can count on a ready list of buyers from a broad spectrum of
industries, said Jon Marchiorlatti, a broker with CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   At a Lake Forest complex called Crescent Bay Business Center, for
example, building owners include a residential construction
contractor, a glass installation company, a distributor of industrial
cleaning goods and a computer service firm.</TE>
<TE>   Among the owners at Crescent Bay is Adam Etemadi of U.S. Glass, a
13-year-old company that installs glass in commercial buildings.
Etemadi moved his company into a 4,500-square-foot building at
Crescent Bay in January, expanding from a 2,500-square-foot rented
space in Laguna Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Owning the building is a safer investment than having money in the
stock market, Etemadi believes, and offers advantages over leasing.</TE>
<TE>   "My rent was going up every year," he said. "My fate was in my
landlord's hands. Now I have more control."</TE>
<TE>   Financial considerations were less of a factor for Kris Elftmann
of Noelle Corporate Communications, a printing and graphic design
firm in Santa Ana, who paid about $1million for the 7,000-square-foot
building that his company moved into three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we really considered leasing," Elftmann said.
"We didn't do as much financial evaluation as some small-business
owners because it is part of our family culture that owning is more
important."</TE>
<TE>   The Elftmanns spent about $450,000 to customize and furnish the
building. "There's no way we could have put that much money into
developing this space if we were leasing, even if we signed a
long-term lease," Elftmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Creating the kind of building they wanted was important, he
explained, because "As entrepreneurs, we spend a lot of time in our
building, so this becomes our home away from home."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers such as Elftmann and Etemadi are the reason that small
industrial buildings "are more successful right now than any other
kind of industrial or office development," said broker Mike Hartel of
Colliers Seeley, the listing agent for MK Business Center in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the 14 buildings under construction at MK have been sold,
Hartel said, and the rest are expected to be sold by the end of
April.</TE>
<TE>   All six buildings at Crescent Bay in Lake Forest were sold before
or soon after construction was finished, said Don Schisler of Newport
Beach-based Coastal Investment Properties, which developed the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal has built and sold 32 small industrial buildings in three
projects during the last four years, Schisler said, and all 32 went
into escrow by the time construction was completed or soon
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Besides low interest rates, Colliers Seeley's Hartel said, the
small-building market has been helped by the conservative outlook of
many small-business owners over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them have been hoarding their cash for the past two or
three years," Hartel said, "so they're sitting on a couple of hundred
thousand dollars that they can use as a down payment."</TE>
<TE>   Marchiorlatti of CB Richard Elllis said the strong demand for
small buildings today contrasts with the slack demand for larger
industrial buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger buildings are still sitting," Marchiorlatti said. Two
years ago, buildings of 100,000 square feet and larger were being
filled as quickly as they were built, he said, but demand for the
larger spaces has cooled with the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to ask any developer today what he would build if he
had a two- or three-acre piece of dirt," Marchiorlatti said, "he'd
tell you small buildings for sale. In the 4,000-to-12,000-square-foot
range, we can't build enough buildings."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sues Union Firm Over Funds</HD>
<DH>Courts: Department of Labor seeks recovery of pension money
lost in a Union Labor Life real estate investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor Department has sued a major union-backed financial services
company, alleging it broke pension laws by making a $10-million
investment of retirement funds in a shaky Las Vegas real estate
venture.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that the Union Labor Life Insurance Co., through
its investment subsidiary Trust Fund Advisors Inc., used Laborers'
International Union pension funds to buy 120 acres of land that was
to be developed into residential building sites. No work was done and
the project was abandoned.</LD>
<LD>   The land was sold in 1999 to Newport Beach-based developer Capital
Pacific Holdings Inc. at a loss of nearly $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   Labor Department spokeswoman Gloria Della said Monday that because
the $10 million could have generated substantial earnings during the
booming mid- 1990s, the actual loss is far higher than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "They started a project and abandoned the project," she said. "The
plan's money was not put to work. What happened? That is not the
action of a prudent plan official."</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed Friday in federal court in Washington and made
public Monday. Citing violations of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, it asks the defendants to reimburse the union's funds
for all losses and interest.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ian D. Lanoff, representing Union Labor Life and Trust
Fund Advisors, said both "acted appropriately and prudently as
fiduciaries to the investment in this case, and ... they will be
completely vindicated at the end of the process."</TE>
<TE>   Union Labor Life, which was created in 1925 to provide health
insurance for union families, offers insurance, investment and
banking services to all businesses with a focus on unions and their
members.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the company handled $6billion in third-party assets, much
of it in union pension funds. Union Labor Life Chief Executive Bob
Georgine was the former top official in the Building Trades
Department of the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the laborers union declined to comment about the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   A union source said the organization and its pension plans were
not involved in the investment decision and had tried to recover
damages from Union Labor Life before the suit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Della, of the Labor Department, said no trustees of the pension
fund were involved in the purchase or sale of the property.</TE>

<HD>Dow Skid Persists on Rate Concerns</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors also are anxious about upcoming
earnings reports. Volume is light ahead of the holidays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks skidded in light volume Monday, knocking the blue-chip Dow to
its fourth-straight loss as the threat of struggling corporate
profits and rising interest rates blurred the brightening economic
picture.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of the positives of the recovery have apparently already
been factored into the market," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity
trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co. "The market is looking ahead to interest
rate hikes and how that will affect business going forward."</LD>
<LD>   Growing hopes that the U.S. economy is emerging from its year-long
slump helped bolster stocks earlier this month. But investors now are
worried about first-quarter corporate earnings. "Confession" season,
when companies warn that profits could land short of analysts'
estimates, heats up this week.</LD>
<TE>   Signs of a firming economy have triggered concerns over higher
borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve last week abandoned its
15-month-old warning of economic weakness and set the groundwork for
possible interest rate hikes this year.</TE>
<TE>   The market finished near its session lows as selling accelerated
in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average sank
146 points, or 1.4%, to 10,281.67, suffering its longest losing
streak in six weeks. Only two Dow members--Coca-Cola, up 50 cents to
$51.75, and SBC Communications, up 8cents to $38--eked out gains.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index fell 38.90 points, or 2.1%, to
1,812.49. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 16.83 points, or
1.5%, to 1,131.87.</TE>
<TE>   The market lost a bit of steam after a report showed that sales of
existing homes fell 2.8% in February but still posted their
second-best annual rate, according to a national real estate trade
association.</TE>
<TE>   Investors will have many economic reports to sort through this
week, including data on U.S. durable goods, a report on consumer
confidence and the government's final revision to fourth-quarter
gross domestic product data.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
3 to 2 on Nasdaq, but trading volume slowed sharply. Market activity
is expected to remain relatively quiet this week with trading floors
thinly staffed ahead of the Easter and Passover holidays. Financial
markets will be closed Friday for Good Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * EMC, the world's largest maker of data storage systems, fell 56
cents to $11.04. Salomon Smith Barney said the company could miss
first-quarter revenue estimates. Storage networking company Brocade
Communications Systems fell $1.51 to $24.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Philip Morris fell $1.53 to $51.96, pressuring the Dow. An
Oregon jury ordered the tobacco giant to pay $150 million to the
estate of a woman who died of lung cancer. It was the latest in a
series of large jury awards against tobacco firms and the first award
involving low-tar brands. RJ Reynolds Tobacco lost $1.54 to $64.40.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold shares climbed, propelling many to fresh 52-week highs.
Newmont Mining gained 78 cents to $27.15 and Goldcorp rose 96 cents
to $17.96. Gold futures prices are up 7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks fell after America West Airlines cut fares as
much as 70%. Delta Air Lines slumped $2.15 to $30.99; AMR, parent of
American Airlines, fell $1.39 to $25.15; and America West Holdings
slipped 26 cents to $5.21.</TE>
<TE>   * Countrywide Credit rose 67 cents to $43.95 on a Barron's
magazine report that the Calabasas-based mortgage lender may be a
good acquisition candidate for a major bank.</TE>

<HD>Linux Accused of Poor Development</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The alternative PC operating system Linux has struggled in the
marketplace not because of bullying from Microsoft Corp. but because
of haphazard development by Linux backers, lawyers for Microsoft said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Under questioning from Microsoft trial attorney Stephanie Wheeler,
Michael Tiemann, chief technology officer of Linux distributor Red
Hat Inc., acknowledged in U.S. District Court that his company had
spent less money than rivals on research and development.</LD>
<LD>   He also conceded that Red Hat assigned few of its employees to
creating new programs for Linux or working with outside developers to
write such applications.</LD>
<TE>   During his second day of cross-examination in the landmark
Microsoft antitrust case before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, Tiemann
said he could not identify a single Red Hat employee who worked full
time on trying to "port," or translate, applications popular on other
PC platforms, such as Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet program, to the
Linux operating system.</TE>
<TE>   He also acknowledged that Red Hat's research and development
spending paled in comparison to rivals such as Microsoft, IBM Corp.
and Sun Microsystems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The admission came after Wheeler displayed Red Hat financial
reports in the courtroom. The reports showed that the Raleigh,
N.C.-based company spent $18.8million on research in fiscal year
2001--a pittance compared with the billions spent by Microsoft, Sun
and IBM.</TE>
<TE>   However, Red Hat markets only PC operating system software and,
unlike its bigger rivals, does not have to spend money researching
such products as keyboards, monitors, game consoles and specialized
software products. What's more, Linux is known as an "open source
software," which is intended to be largely created by unpaid
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Tiemann was the fifth witness called by California and eight other
states seeking stiffer penalties against Microsoft for violating
federal antitrust laws by leveraging its Windows software monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   The holdout states have rejected a proposed antitrust settlement
reached in November by Microsoft, the Justice Department and nine
other states.</TE>
<TE>   Later Monday, a second state witness, Gateway Inc. executive
Anthony Fama, said his company hesitated over signing a new licensing
agreement with Microsoft for Windows in January because the company
felt the contract was more restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Fama said in his written testimony that under
the new contract, Microsoft has more leeway to terminate the Windows
license agreement than under Gateway's previous license deals.</TE>

<HD>Morningstar to Change Ratings System</HD>
<DH>Investing: The firm will add criteria in judging stocks,
which will shift some mutual funds into new 'style boxes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund rating firm Morningstar Inc. said Monday that it will
overhaul its "style box" rating methodology, which will change how
the company classifies some stock mutual funds.</LD>
<LD>   By midyear, the Chicago-based firm will sharply expand the
criteria it applies to fund portfolio holdings to gauge where a fund
fits in the rating system's style box grid.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to do a better job of accurately capturing fund
managers' investing strategies, said Don Phillips, Morningstar's
managing director. He created the style box grid in 1992 as a tool to
help investors and financial advisors build diversified portfolios of
funds without relying solely on how fund companies label or describe
their portfolios.</LD>
<TE>   On the nine-square Morningstar grid, well-known to many mutual
fund investors, the vertical axis distinguishes among funds that own
small-, mid- and large-capitalization stocks, while the horizontal
axis classifies funds as either growth-oriented, value-oriented or a
blend of the two disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   Every rated fund still will fall into one of the nine squares on
the grid. But a fund's square could change depending on how its stock
holdings, overall, are classified under Morningstar's new criteria.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, after sorting by size, Morningstar categorizes stocks
based solely on two yardsticks: price-to-earnings ratio and
price-to-book-value ratio (a measure of a company's assets).</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, stocks will be evaluated based on those
ratios and eight other yardsticks: price-to-sales,
price-to-cash-flow, dividend yield, long-term projected earnings
growth, historical earnings growth, sales growth, cash-flow growth
and book value growth.</TE>
<TE>   With the new criteria, Morningstar's system for the first time
will incorporate estimates of future performance, as opposed to
simply looking at stocks relative to recent earnings and asset
values.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks will be labeled value, growth or "core" (i.e., a blend of
value and growth) based on their aggregate score across the 10
criteria.</TE>
<TE>   Because individual stocks will be labeled differently under the
new Morningstar system, so too will some funds, depending on what's
in their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Janus, Janus 20 and Janus Olympus funds now are
categorized as large-cap blend. But the new system will shift them to
large-cap growth, Morningstar said, because the additional yardsticks
used to evaluate their holdings indicate a tilt toward growth.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, "while the stocks in Putnam Small Value occasionally
look pricey using trailing price-to-earnings ratios, the fund's
value-oriented strategy of buying battered growth stocks becomes more
apparent when the categorization criteria widens to include
price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow," Morningstar said.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, the firm expects to reclassify Putnam Small Value as a
small-cap value fund. It's now designated small-cap blend.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings-system overhaul doesn't address one shortcoming beyond
Morningstar's control, however: Fund companies are required to report
their portfolio holdings just twice a year. So Morningstar's
style-box classifications can become dated if a fund's holdings
change significantly in a short period.</TE>

<HD>Napster Ruling Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Music: In a decision that could affect other online
systems, appeals court backs the order that shut down the free
service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals panel Monday gave record and film companies another
piece of ammunition in their fight against online piracy, upholding a
lower court order that shut down Napster Inc.'s free song-sharing
service.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling has little impact on Redwood City-based Napster, which
has abandoned its free service in favor of one that pays labels and
songwriters for each song copied.</LD>
<LD>   But lawyers for the music industry say it could rein in other
online systems, including Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster.</LD>
<TE>   The implication of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling
is that all file-sharing services "have a continuing obligation to
adapt to the technology that may be available" for protecting
copyrighted material against illegal copying, said Cary Ramos, an
attorney for the National Music Publishers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was how far Napster had to go to stop users from making
unauthorized copies of songs. U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel
in San Francisco had issued a pretrial injunction against Napster in
March 2001, but lawyers for the company and the music industry
continued to fight over how strict that injunction should be.</TE>
<TE>   Napster argued that Patel went too far, requiring the company to
adopt new filtering technology that identified and blocked
copyrighted songs from being shared.</TE>
<TE>   That technology wasn't consistent with Napster's file-sharing
system, and, according to Napster's lawyers, the Court of Appeals had
previously ruled that the company didn't have to redesign its system
to stop infringements.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit disagreed, saying that
"it was a proper exercise of the District Court's supervisory
authority to require the new filtering mechanism."</TE>
<TE>   The panel also endorsed Patel's "zero tolerance" approach,
requiring Napster to shut down its free service until it had made the
new filters as effective as they could be.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Morpheus, Kazaa and Grokster said the ruling
didn't apply to them because their systems aren't like Napster's.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
which has joined Morpheus' defense, said, "We are not actually liable
for copyright infringement."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Page, an attorney for Grokster, said, "I think our case is
going to be on broader issues than on the minutiae of what sort of
filtering technology should be used."</TE>
<TE>   But Russell Frackman, an attorney for the major record labels,
said the new ruling made clear that every file-sharing system has to
filter out items they've been told are copyrighted.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that the court's language in terms of the
requirement for filtering ... would apply to any [file-sharing]
system equally," Frackman said.</TE>

<HD>Northrop to Move Joint Strike Fighter Unit to El Segundo</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The building, home to software company Candle, is
being considered for a larger JSF facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. will soon move its Joint Strike Fighter
engineering group into an 85,000-square-foot floor of an El Segundo
office building that also serves as headquarters for software
specialist Candle Corp. in one of the largest leases in that city for
several months.</LD>
<LD>   Century City-based Northrop's integrated systems division plans to
continue to expand and is searching for more office space to serve
the group working on a new fighter plane, the F-35.</LD>
<LD>   The Candle building is one of the options being considered for a
larger JSF facility, which ultimately could house 1,000-plus
employees in 300,000 square feet or more of offices, said Northrop
spokesman Jim Hart. Northrop has been using a small office in the
Candle building as an employment center, and engineering personnel
will begin taking over the four-story building's third floor in early
April.</LD>
<TE>   Candle spokeswoman Jessica Boelter confirmed that Candle and
Northrop officials are discussing potential transactions under which
Northrop would lease most or all of the Candle building or even
purchase the property. Such an agreement would require Candle to
relocate its headquarters from 201 N. Douglas St., where 400
employees are housed.</TE>
<TE>   Candle is unlikely to move its headquarters more than a few miles
from the current home office, Boelter said, and would require about
125,000 square feet of space--less than half of the Douglas Street
building's roughly 335,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The computer connectivity specialist founded by software pioneer
Aubrey Chernick moved from Santa Monica to El Segundo two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A Chernick group known as Douglas Property Holding Co. purchased
the property.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate consultancy CB Richard Ellis has been advising Candle
and the Chernick group. Both Insignia/ESG and CB Richard Ellis have
been working with Northrop Grumman on the JSF office search.
Representatives of those firms declined to discuss the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman's integrated systems division is on the Lockheed
Martin-led team (along with BAE Systems) that the Pentagon awarded a
$19-billion JSF-related system development and demonstration contract
in October.</TE>
<TE>   The JSF is the next-generation fighter for the three primary U.S.
military branches as well as the British Royal Navy.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is a large one for El Segundo, which has seen substantial
office development in recent months but not a lot of leasing. Hart
declined to disclose the rate Northrop will pay, but average rent at
the Candle building is $2.35 per square foot per month, according to
real estate data provider CoStar Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for El Segundo office space peaked amid the dot-com boom in
2000, but has since softened even as several new development projects
got underway.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo is seeing a surge in its traditional aerospace and
defense sector now that Internet-related activity has diminished,
said Jerry Porter, vice chairman of Cresa Partners, a real estate
brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Douglas Street building housed Rockwell International
engineers working on the B-1 bomber back in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Shell Group to Purchase Pennzoil for $1.8 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL GRACZYK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Royal Dutch/Shell Group will pay $1.8 billion to buy Pennzoil-Quaker
State Co., the nation's largest motor oil maker and parent company of
more than 2,000 Jiffy Lube oil change service stations across the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Pennzoil and Quaker State brand names will survive
the deal, a spokeswoman for Royal Dutch's Shell division said the
acquisition could mean job losses of about 15%--or about 1,230
people--as the firms combine their operations.</LD>
<LD>   Pennzoil-Quaker State, based in Houston, has about 7,400 workers
worldwide. It will be merged with Shell's lubricants unit, which
employs about 800 people.</LD>
<TE>   Pennzoil-Quaker's headquarters will be combined with the Shell
division, which is based in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the deal is the latest in a wave of mergers and
acquisitions in the energy industry that started last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like one more step in the consolidation business," said
Bill Gilmer, a Houston economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, shareholders of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum
Co. overwhelmingly approved a proposed $15.6-billion merger, moving
the companies one step closer to creating the nation's third-largest
oil corporation. The new company will be based in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Dutch, which announced the purchase after the stock markets
closed Monday, said it will pay $22 for each share of Pennzoil-Quaker
State and assume $1.1 billion of its debt.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has been approved by Pennzoil-Quaker's board and is
expected to be completed during the second half of 2002 but is
subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, both companies said.</TE>
<TE>   The per-share price represents a 42% premium over the $15.49 close
of Pennzoil-Quaker shares Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of Royal Dutch closed down $1 at $52.80, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Routs, president and chief executive of Royal Dutch's Shell
Oil said the deal will generate annual cost savings of about $140
million by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Pennzoil-Quaker State CEO Jim Postl called the deal an effective
way to leverage his company's name recognition with a larger
operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Pennzoil-Quaker State will benefit significantly from being part
of an enterprise with the geographic scope, operational scale,
breadth of products and services, and financial resources necessary
to compete in a consolidating industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Dutch/Shell Group managing director Paul Skinner, who also
is chief executive of the company's oil products business, said the
deal will make Shell a leader in the U.S. and global lubricants
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Shell recognizes the incredible value of the No. 1 and
No. 2 brands," Pennzoil-Quaker State spokesman Ray Scippa said.
"Clearly we think it's a great opportunity for both companies."</TE>
<TE>   Shell Oil produces and markets oil, natural gas and chemicals. It
has reserves of 1.2 billion barrels of oil and 1.9 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   It owns Shell Oil Products U.S., which was formerly Equilon, and
operates a refining and marketing venture called Motiva with Exxon
Mobil and Saudi Aramco.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Dutch/Shell Group is the third-largest petroleum company in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil and BP are the largest and second-largest,
respectively.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>A team of librarians challenging the constitutionality of a federal
law requiring them to filter online pornography testified Monday that
the government is trying to turn them into "thought police."</LD>
<LD>   The trial consolidates two lawsuits filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that claim that the
Children's Internet Protection Act violates the 1st Amendment by
requiring software that also can block legitimate information.</LD>
<LD>   As the trial began Monday, the government contended that filtering
software has improved since the law was enacted. The government also
said printed pornographic materials are not in many library
collections, so there is no reason online obscenity should be
available.</LD>
<TE>   In court, librarians said parents and children should be the ones
who determine what content they find unacceptable. "There are some
5-year-olds whose parents do not want them to know where babies come
from and there are some that do," testified Ginnie Cooper, director
of the Multnomah County library in Portland, Ore. "We don't try to
presume the values of parents."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>America West Airlines effectively slashed business fares as much as
60% by simplifying its fare structure even as the airline industry
tries to bolster revenues by attracting more corporate clients.</LD>
<LD>   America West, the No. 8 U.S. airline and a unit of America West
Holdings Corp., said it removed Saturday-night-stay restrictions and
trimmed the advance purchase days required to buy its cheaper fares.</LD>
<LD>   Aviation experts said rival carriers could try to match the cuts
in competitive markets, further eroding fragile industry revenues.
Several airlines immediately undercut their business fares in
specific markets, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of America West Holdings fell 26 cents to close at $5.21 on

<LD>T. Boone Pickens acquired an 8.4% stake in Vintage Petroleum Inc.,
reviving his role as a well-known corporate raider in the oil and gas
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Pickens, the 73-year-old founder and former chairman of Mesa Inc.,
said in a regulatory filing that Vintage is undervalued and that he
may seek to take over the Tulsa, Okla.-based energy company. He also
said Vintage "may or should be" for sale or a candidate for a
leveraged buyout.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have provided about $125 million in capital to a pair of
Dallas-based BP Capital Energy Equity partnerships that Pickens is
using to make money through his expertise in oil and takeovers.</LD>
<TE>   At Vintage, the BP partnerships spent more than $75 million to
acquire 5.3 million common shares, according to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, for an average price of $14.19 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Vintage shares fell 10 cents to $14 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>U.S. economists feel confident that a sustainable economic recovery
is underway, a poll showed.</LD>
<LD>   More than three-quarters of the members of a panel surveyed by the
National Assn. for Business Economics said it was unlikely the United
States would suffer a "double dip" recession--in which economic
growth would resume, only to falter again later.</LD>
<LD>   Seventy-six percent of the panelists rated the odds of a
double-dip recession as less than 50%. Only 9% put the odds at
greater than 50%.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Money-losing U.S. airlines including the two largest, UAL Corp. and
AMR Corp., said they were each getting several hundred million
dollars in tax refunds because of a recent tax law change.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush signed an economic stimulus package March 6 that
allows companies to "carry back" net operating losses incurred during
2001 and 2002 over the last five years. Tax laws previously allowed a
carry-back period of only two years.</LD>
<LD>   United Airlines spokeswoman Susana Leyva said the carrier has
received a $464-million tax refund as a result of the change.</LD>
<TE>   The airline also got $644 million in direct cash aid from the
landmark bailout act passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks,
bringing its total financial aid from the government to more than $1
billion.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union will slap tariffs as high as 26% on some steel
imports after President Bush imposed duties on steel sales to the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to protect steelmakers such as Arcelor, the world's
largest, the EU will impose the taxes on 15 products, from sheets for
car doors to wires used in construction. The taxes will apply once
imports surpass last year's level, which totaled 27 million metric
tons.</LD>
<LD>   The step will hurt steelmakers in Asia and Latin America,
broadening a trade dispute that began when Bush announced tariffs as
high as 30% after companies such as Bethlehem Steel Corp. sought
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   The European tariffs, ranging from 14.9% to 26%, will begin April
3 for an initial period of as long as 200 days.</TE>

<HD>AmEx to Disclose Offshore Accounts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Express Co. agreed Monday to turn over to U.S. tax
authorities information on offshore accounts held by Americans
suspected of evading taxes, the second major card company to do so
after MasterCard International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a widening investigation of tax evasion, the Justice
Department asked a federal court in San Francisco to have Visa
International Inc., the biggest international card brand, disclose
offshore credit card accounts.</LD>
<LD>   "Simply put, the guarantee of secrecy associated with offshore
banking is evaporating," Internal Revenue Service Commissioner
Charles Rossotti said.</LD>
<TE>   The IRS, in trying to detect unreported income and prosecute
people who are failing to file tax returns, is pursuing a form of tax
evasion that uses credit cards issued by offshore banks.</TE>
<TE>   Former IRS Commissioner Don Alexander, a tax lawyer with Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld in Washington, said the American Express
agreement may lead to dozens of criminal probes, probably resulting
in fines, other penalties and jail time.</TE>
<TE>   "Some good criminal cases will scare the daylights out of people,"
Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   MasterCard, the second-biggest card brand, has produced more than
1.7 million records involving more than 230,000 accounts in response
to the government's request, the Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   IRS officials have estimated they'll find 1 million to 2 million
Americans who have offshore credit card and bank accounts. The agency
is beginning to audit cases involving MasterCard customers. Some of
those will be referred for criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement agreement between the government and American
Express, filed in federal court in Miami, allows the tax agency to
collect identifying information, such as passport and driver's
license numbers, of customers with accounts in Antigua, Barbuda,
Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. The IRS is looking for records
showing charges greater than $2,500 for purchases of cars, boats,
hotels or travel services in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   American Express spokeswoman Susan Korchak said the fourth-largest
U.S. card issuer will notify affected cardholders in writing and will
provide the information within 30 days of the order.</TE>
<TE>   The agreements with American Express and MasterCard may help deter
the use of offshore accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, IRS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Visa spokeswoman Cheryl Heinonen said the company hadn't received
any information requests from the IRS.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc. said four states are inquiring whether the company's
Billpoint payment processing unit should be regulated under laws
governing the transmission of money.</LD>
<LD>   California, Illinois, Louisiana and Oregon have asked the world's
largest Internet auctioneer to explain why they shouldn't apply
regulations to Billpoint, also known as EBay Payments. An EBay
spokesman said the company plans to "cooperate fully."</LD>
<LD>   Billpoint allows sellers on EBay's Web site to accept credit cards
and electronic checks as payments. EBay shares fell $1.81 to $57.40
on Nasdaq. EBay also said the Justice Department closed an antitrust
investigation of the company without taking action.</LD>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett estimated the company
spent $150 million to override the opposition he led to the proposed
$20-billion acquisition of Compaq Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett disclosed the estimate at a meeting of the Council of
Institutional Investors, a group of large pension fund managers,
drawing gasps from many in the audience.</LD>
<LD>   An HP spokeswoman disputed Hewlett's estimate, but declined to say
how much was spent in the unusual battle that featured dueling
newspaper ads and intensive lobbying of both individual and
institutional shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   A source close to Walter Hewlett said he had spent about $32
million to persuade shareholders to vote against the deal. Walter
Hewlett also said he will throw his support behind the merger if
shareholders approve the deal.</TE>

<HD>Fujitsu Expects Profit in Next Fiscal Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of business computers, said it
expects a return to profit in its fiscal year starting April 1 on a
rise in software services sales and cost savings achieved through job
cuts. The Tokyo electronics maker needs to post operating profit of
$750 million to $1.25 billion in its coming fiscal year "to proclaim
recovery in earnings," a Fujitsu executive said. The profit would
contrast with a $562-million operating loss projected for Fujitsu's
current business year.</LD>
<LD>   Fujitsu expects to achieve $1.05billion in cost savings through
21,900 job cuts and other expense reductions. Fujitsu's shares fell
3.8% in Tokyo trading.</LD>

<HD>Verizon Unit Raises $1.5 Billion in Bond Sale</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A unit of Verizon Communications Inc. raised $1.5 billion from a sale
of bonds in a bid to satisfy credit rating agencies that want it to
cut back on short-term debt. Verizon New York will use the proceeds
of the 10-year notes and 30-year bonds to pay down shorter-term
corporate debt.</LD>
<LD>   The sale by Verizon New York came three days after Moody's
Investors Service said New York-based Verizon faces "refunding risk"
because its credit lines back up only two-thirds of its $12.8 billion
in short-term debt known as commercial paper.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day, Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook for the No.
1 U.S. local telephone company to "negative" from "stable," saying
Verizon could restore the "stable" outlook if it cut its debt load
and improved cash flow.</LD>

<HD>McAfee.com Rejects Network Associates Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McAfee.com Corp. rejected Network Associates Inc.'s buyout offer,
saying it was "financially inadequate" and that it "significantly
undervalues" the Sunnyvale, Calif., company. Officials at Network
Associates, a Santa Clara, Calif., Internet security software
company, said their offer stands.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, Network Associates said it planned to buy back
the 25% of McAfee.com's shares it doesn't already own and offered
0.68 share of Network Associates for each share of McAfee.com.</LD>
<LD>   The bid currently values McAfee.com, which Network Associates spun
off in 1999, at about $17.11 a share. But investors have been betting
Network Associates will sweeten its offer. McAfee.com's shares fell
74 cents, to $18.51 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<DH>Theaters: ArcLight Hollywood is the latest to bet that
pampering guests will lift profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can watch the same movies for almost half the price elsewhere,
but the owners of the sleek new ArcLight Hollywood theater are
counting on pampering moviegoers to pump up profit.</LD>
<LD>   With last week's opening of the 14-screen cinema, which wraps
around the landmark Cinerama Dome on Sunset Boulevard near Vine
Street, owner Pacific Theatres Corp. joins a growing list of theater
operators exploring ways to win over serious and affluent moviegoers
who are willing to pay a premium for plush surroundings and service.</LD>
<LD>   The ArcLight Hollywood features extra-wide seats, high-tech sound
systems, full-service cafes and bars. Moviegoers are able to select
reserved seats and will be invited to attend special screenings as
well as film and speaker series. The regular ticket price: $14.</LD>
<TE>   "People are seeking a safe escape," said Christopher Foreman,
chief executive of Pacific Theatres, which also operates the Cinerama
Dome. "If you love movies, this is the place for you."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, a small group of theaters has opened in the Los
Angeles area that seeks to offer a more exclusive environment than
the typical large and noisy multiplex. In Westchester, the Bridge
Cinema de Lux, a joint venture of National Amusements Inc. and
CineBridge Ventures, offers leather-upholstered seats in some of its
17 auditoriums as well as a restaurant, bar and live performance
venue. In Hollywood, the new Mann theaters in the Hollywood &amp;
Highland shopping center include a VIP lounge and seating area where
the ticket price, $20, is perhaps one of the highest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   VIP cinemas are popping up around the country as theater operators
recover from a disastrous bout of overbuilding that led to some
high-profile bankruptcy filings and the closure of hundreds of movie
houses.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, for example, one portion of a multiplex is devoted to
a 21-and-over bistro, bar and auditorium with rocking seats
upholstered in leather.</TE>
<TE>   In Boca Raton, Fla., a $16 ticket at the Premiere Theatres Bistro
&amp; Bar gets moviegoers complimentary valet parking, unlimited popcorn,
special balcony seating and access to a full-service restaurant and
bar.</TE>
<TE>   However, the results of these high-end theaters are mixed as
theater owners test the depth of patrons' interest.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the theaters located outside affluent and major urban
centers have been closed or converted to traditional formats.</TE>
<TE>   At the ArcLight Hollywood, part of a $100-million retail and
entertainment complex, the target customer is not necessarily
affluent but one who is regarded as a serious moviegoer, Foreman
said. "They love the big blockbuster and the art house film," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The property reflects research showing that although moviegoers
enjoyed such new megaplex features as stadium seating, "they didn't
like the hassles and impersonal atmosphere," Foreman said.</TE>
<TE>   The $14 ticket price will limit the audience size but is needed in
part to offset the higher operating, staff and construction costs,
Foreman said.</TE>
<TE>   The ArcLight will not screen commercials, forgoing a significant
source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The ArcLight Hollywood's cafe, bars and gift shop are designed to
capture more of the customer's time and money before and after the
show. "We want to enhance and extend the moviegoing experience,"
Foreman said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Pacific Theatres plans to open only one other ArcLight
theater, in Bellevue, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the ArcLight Hollywood will tell whether Los
Angeles can support more expensive and exclusive theaters.</TE>

<LD>Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone/Firestone Americas Holding Inc. must
defend themselves in U.S. courts against as many as 140 suits brought
on behalf of foreign victims of rollover accidents, a federal judge
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker's ruling in Indianapolis
means Ford and Bridgestone face potentially millions of dollars in
damages if they settle or lose the foreign cases, plaintiffs' lawyers
said.</LD>
<LD>   The suits stem from the 2000 recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires
made for the Ford Explorer. The tires are linked to 271 deaths by
federal officials.</LD>

<HD>TRW Urges Proposal Rejection</HD>
<DH>Defense: In opposing Northrop's offer, the auto-parts maker
may be pushing for a raised bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc., trying to fend off an $11.4-billion hostile takeover bid by
Northrop Grumman Corp., urged shareholders to reject the defense
contractor's proposals to create an independent directors committee
and increase the disclosure of financial information.</LD>
<LD>   The resolutions by Los Angeles-based Northrop, the fourth-largest
U.S. maker of military equipment, are a "self-serving attempt" to
force a sale, TRW said in a statement. TRW's annual meeting is April
24, two days after the company will hold a special shareholder
meeting about the $47-a-share buyout proposal.</LD>
<LD>   TRW said providing confidential information doesn't make sense in
light of its board's earlier rejection of the offer. Northrop has
said it's willing to consider a higher price if the auto-parts maker
and defense contractor provides more details. TRW's recommendation
may put pressure on Northrop to raise the amount, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "Northrop absolutely has to raise the bid," said Richard Turgeon,
an analyst with Victory Capital Management, which holds about 395,000
shares of TRW. "If they don't, TRW will move ahead with the auction
of the company."</TE>
<TE>   TRW Interim Chairman Phil Odeen plans to spin off or sell the
company's auto-parts unit to become a stand-alone defense contractor.
Northrop plans to separate the automotive unit and keep the missile
defense and satellite units.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Moore, a spokesman for Northrop, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   TRW shares fell 20 cents to $51.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Northrop fell $1.12 to $108, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>FCC Won't Act on Televised Lingerie Parade</HD>
<DH>Media: Victoria's Secret show on ABC drew millions of
viewers and hundreds of complaints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission dismissed complaints about a
November broadcast on Walt Disney Co.'s ABC television network with
models strutting on a runway dressed in Victoria's Secret lingerie.</LD>
<LD>   The commission received hundreds of complaints from viewers who
described the fashion show, which aired from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., and
advertisements promoting the broadcast as indecent and inappropriate
for network television. Most complaints said the broadcast, featuring
clothes from the unit of Limited Inc., showed too much skin, an FCC
official said.</LD>
<LD>   Parent groups and some lawmakers have urged the FCC to step up
enforcement against TV and radio stations that broadcast programming
with strong sexual content or material considered to be indecent.
Free-speech advocates say the government should be wary of censoring
broadcasters.</LD>
<TE>   "While we understand that you are offended by the programming
described, it does not appear that we have any basis for action at
this time," FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Charles Kelley said in a
letter last week.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which featured Tyra Banks, Gisele Bundchen, Heidi Klum
and other fashion models, drew about 12.4 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares fell 25 cents to $23.20 and Limited fell 27 cents to
$17.70, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>GE to Hold Investor Conference Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co., seeking to address concerns that it fails to
provide enough details on its finances, said it would hold an
investor conference call the week of April 8 to discuss first-quarter
results.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, GE has been among a relative handful of major companies
that have declined to use conference calls to discuss earnings.</LD>
<LD>   GE's stock has been hammered in recent days after Bill Gross of
bond fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co. criticized the
company for its debt levels and disclosure practices.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, GE has spread information more widely than
before, starting with broadcasting analyst meetings on its Web site.
Still, in the aftermath of the financial collapse of Enron Corp.,
many analysts and investors have been pressuring companies to
disclose even more and to allow for direct questioning of executives
when data are reported.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares fell 83 cents to $37.04 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser Gets Booted</TE>
<TE>   Louis Rukeyser's long run as host of public TV's "Wall Street
Week" apparently has come to an end. He was fired by Maryland Public
Television after blasting the producers on Friday's broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   The 69-year-old host was incensed last week after the producers
asked him to agree to a lesser role on the show, which Maryland
Public Television wants to revamp to attract a younger audience.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser, the host for 32 years, said Thursday that he would leave
when his contract ends in June and that he was entertaining offers
for new shows. On Friday, he told viewers he was "ambushed" by his
producers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were disappointed he chose to use Friday's show to air his
contract dispute and promote his new venture," said Jeff Hankin, an
officer at Maryland Public Television.</TE>
<TE>   The producers said "Wall Street Week" will go on, though the
revamped show--to be co-produced with Fortune magazine--won't make
its debut until later this year.</TE>

<LD>With the start of the 2002 World Cup less than 10 weeks away, all but
two of the teams that will be in Japan and South Korea for the May
31-June 30 world championship will play warmup games this week.</LD>
<LD>   China and Mexico are idle, but the 30 other World Cup hopefuls
will be playing today and Wednesday as their coaches move closer to
selecting which players to take to the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   A quick look at the week's more significant matches and
developments:</LD>
<TE>   * The United States will play three-time world champion Germany at
the Ostseestadion in Rostock, Germany, on Wednesday, and for U.S.
Coach Bruce Arena the match will be the next-to-last opportunity to
evaluate his European-based players.</TE>
<TE>   Arena named only eight Major League Soccer players to the roster,
among them the Galaxy's Cobi Jones and the San Jose Earthquakes'
Landon Donovan, and picked 12 players from European clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, Tony Meola will make the trip as the backup to
starter Kasey Keller, an indication Meola might be Arena's choice as
the No.3 goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   England-based midfielder Claudio Reyna is coming off yet another
injury and is not on the roster. Neither is former Galaxy defender
Greg Vanney, now playing in France.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-man U.S. World Cup team will be named after a game against
Ireland April 17 in Dublin, Arena said. That team will open a 10-day
camp in Raleigh, N.C., on May 1 in preparation for its final three
warmup games--against Uruguay on May 12, Jamaica on May 16 and the
Netherlands on May 19.</TE>
<TE>   * Japan, which will play one of the American team's World Cup
opponents, Poland, on Wednesday in Lodz, Poland, defeated Ukraine,
1-0, in front of 45,000 fans at Nagai Stadium in Osaka last
Wednesday. Kazuyuki Toda scored the goal, but Alessandro Santos, the
Brazilian-born midfielder who took Japanese citizenship in November
specifically to play in the World Cup, impressed most in his debut.</TE>
<TE>   Poland Coach Jerzy Engel is using the Japan game to gauge Asian
opposition. The Poles' opening World Cup match is against South Korea
on June 4. The U.S. plays Poland in the teams' final first-round game
on June 14.</TE>
<TE>   * South Korea, which plays the U.S. on June 10, earned a 2-0
victory over Finland in Cartagena, Spain, last Wednesday with
substitute Hwang Sun-hong scoring twice in the last four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have the whole team together, it's obvious that we're
growing," South Korea Coach Guus Hiddink said. "You could see that
today. This was a very good win for us. The opposition was
outclassed, I think.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to improve, of course, but it's satisfying that we're on
the road, and with a chance of making the second phase [of the World
Cup], which is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea plays World Cup-bound Turkey in Bochum, Germany,
today, the same day two other World Cup teams, Nigeria and Paraguay,
play in London.</TE>
<TE>   * Portugal, the first hurdle in the U.S. path at the World Cup,
will play Finland at home in Porto on Wednesday, and Coach Antonio
Oliveira is using the game to assess a new goalkeeper, Nelson
Pereira.</TE>
<TE>   Pereira, 26, gets his debut because veteran keeper Vitor Baia
continues to battle injuries and Portugal's usual starter, Joaquim
Silva, has been banned after failing a drug test.</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese have two more warmup games before facing the United
States in Suwon, South Korea, on June 5. They are at home against
four-time world champion Brazil on April 17 and play China, under
former U.S. coach Bora Milutinovic, in Macau on May 25.</TE>
<TE>   * Brazil will play Yugoslavia in Fortaleza, Brazil, on Wednesday,
but influential midfielder Rivaldo will sit out the game because of
an ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Luis Felipe Scolari told the Spanish newspaper Sport that
the player could be out of the World Cup altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very worried about the injury problems Rivaldo has had this
season," he said. "If he hasn't fully recovered by the beginning of
May, I will have to look for someone else to cover his place because
the World Cup is going to be very tough."</TE>
<TE>   * Argentina, which plays Olympic gold medalist Cameroon in Geneva
on Wednesday, also was hit by injuries that could affect its status
as one of the World Cup favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Roberto Ayala, Argentina's 28-year-old captain, will be
sidelined for a month after tearing a thigh muscle while playing for
his Spanish club, Valencia, in a UEFA Cup quarterfinal game against
Italy's Inter Milan on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, striker Hernan Crespo injured ligaments in his ankle
while training with his Italian club, Lazio. He too will be out for
at least four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   * France, the reigning European and world champion, will play
Scotland at Stade de France outside Paris on Wednesday in a game that
marks Berti Vogts' debut as Scotland's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "McVogts" now that he has switched countries, Vogts won
the World Cup while playing for Germany in 1974 and coached the
Germans to the quarterfinals in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, France's coach, Roger Lemerre, said he is a long way
from naming the squad that will try to retain the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to make up my mind yet," said. "I still have some
time."</TE>
<TE>   Not too much time, though. France opens the World Cup against
Senegal in Seoul 68 days from today.</TE>
<TE>   * England is at home against Italy on Wednesday in Leeds in a game
matching former World Cup winners.</TE>
<TE>   Three other games that day pit World Cup-bound teams against each
other: Ireland and Denmark meet in Dublin, Croatia and Slovenia
square off in Zagreb, and Saudi Arabia plays host to Uruguay in
Riyadh.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Season Opener Takes Backseat to Basketball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>When major league officials asked the Angels to open the season on
Easter Sunday, the team happily agreed. Although the holiday date
would jeopardize the chances of selling out the opener, the Angels
were excited about playing in the first game of the season and
expected the game to be nationally televised on ESPN.</LD>
<LD>   But if you turn on ESPN on Sunday night, you will not see the
Angels playing the Cleveland Indians. Instead, you will see the NCAA
women's basketball championship game.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a signature event for ESPN," spokesman Dave Nagle said
Monday. "And, outside the NFL, it's one of our highest-rated events
each year."</LD>
<TE>   The Angel game starts at 5 p.m. Nagle said major league officials
passed up ESPN's offer to show the game if played earlier in the day.
The game will be on ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trumpeted the ESPN broadcast in publicizing the game
and listed it on ESPN in pocket schedules widely distributed in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   However disappointed the team might be, Angel spokesman Tim Mead
noted ESPN will send its first-string baseball broadcast team to
Anaheim for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still on national television," Mead said. "We're excited
about the opportunity to put on a great show to start the major
league season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the most unlikely story of the spring, Larry Barnes could start
at first base for the Angels on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be weird," Barnes said, "from where I was coming into
spring training."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes had no chance to make the team until the Angels lost Shawn
Wooten to injury for four months and Scott Spiezio to suspension for
six games, pending appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are far from finalizing their roster, but someone has
to play first base against Cleveland right-hander Bartolo Colon, and
Barnes is the only left-handed hitter among candidates that include
Jamie Burke, Clay Bellinger and Benji Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, cast aside in the first-base search after hitting .100 in
40 at-bats last season, is hitting .286 this spring, with 12 runs
batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had a pretty decent spring last year too," he said,
"but I have to show what I can do during the regular season. That was
my downfall last year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis gave up one run in six innings in the Angels'
9-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Monday. Schoeneweis is 3-0
with a 2.81 earned-run average this spring.... Jeff Moorad, the agent
for outfielder Darin Erstad, said the two had agreed not to initiate
negotiations on a long-term contract until the season ends. But
Erstad said he would not say no if the Angels wanted to talk before
then. "If they come to me in July, I'm open to that," he said. "I
would love to play for Mike Scioscia the rest of my career." Erstad
is eligible for free agency after the season.... Ramon Ortiz's
contract includes a $500,000 signing bonus and pays him $450,000 this
season. If he is not eligible for salary arbitration after the
season, he will earn $700,000 next year, $2.15 million in 2004 and
$3.45 million in 2005. If he is, he will earn $2.1 million next year
and $3.1 million in 2004, with a club option of $5.5 million in 2005,
for a maximum payout of $11.65 million.... The Angels optioned
pitcher Mickey Callaway to triple-A Salt Lake, where he will work as
a starter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>St. Louis Cardinal starting pitcher Rick Ankiel has a strained left
elbow that will sideline him indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   Tests found damage to his elbow that was more extensive than the
tendinitis that started bothering the left-hander after two innings
of work March 3.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Tony La Russa said there is no timetable for his return.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota House approved a stadium plan that could influence
whether the Twins survive beyond this season. The Senate passed a
stadium bill two weeks ago and the two chambers will now try to work
out a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Ranger closer Jeff Zimmerman is expected to start the season
on the disabled list after tests confirmed that he has tendinitis in
his right elbow. John Rocker, will be the Ranger closer in the
meantime.... New York Yankee third baseman Robin Ventura sprained his
left ankle, making him questionable for next week's season opener....
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays released outfielder Troy O'Leary.... The New
York Mets purchased the contract of infielder John Valentin and added
him to their 40-man roster.... The Houston Astros released journeyman
pitcher C.J. Nitkowski, meaning the club probably will start the
season without a left-handed long reliever.... The Detroit Tigers
acquired right-handed setup man Jose Paniagua from the Colorado
Rockies for pitcher Victor Santos and minor league infielder Ronnie
Merrill.</TE>

<LD>Wayne Coffey of the New York Daily News has written a book, "Winning
Sounds Like This," an account of the season he spent with the women's
basketball team at Gallaudet in Washington, D.C., the world's only
university for the deaf.</LD>
<LD>   He had perhaps his most memorable experience on the first night he
spent in a Gallaudet dormitory. He was warned that some students
liked to crank their stereo bass settings to the max, the better to
feel vibrations.</LD>
<LD>   He paid no heed until he was jolted awake at 4 a.m. by music so
loud the handle of his toilet was rattling. The concert went on for
three hours and by the end Coffey was more amused than annoyed.</LD>

<TE>   Cosmic awareness: In a commercial for the Seattle Mariners,
Manager Lou Piniella motions for center fielder Mike Cameron to move
a few steps, just before a meteorite plummets to the exact spot where
he'd been standing.</TE>
<TE>   A coach asks Piniella, "How'd you see that one coming?"</TE>
<TE>   Says Piniella, "Just a hunch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quit pouting: Derek Bell says that if the Pittsburgh Pirates don't
give him the starting right-field job, instead of making him compete
for it, he'll perform "Operation Shutdown" and won't risk injuring
himself in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Bell,
who hit .172 in an injury-plagued 2001 season, might be better served
by moving immediately to 'Operation Shutup.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Add up all the NCAA basketball tournament pools and there is
$2.5 billion at stake, according to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   One little problem, says Bankrate.com: Only $80 million of it is
gambled legally through sports books in Nevada.</TE>

<LD>With an eye toward branching out into yet another area of sports, the
Anschutz Entertainment Group has begun negotiations to bring the
national headquarters and showcase events of several Olympic-oriented
sports to its new $120-million national training center being
constructed in Carson.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Leiweke, president of AEG and the NHL's Kings, said Monday AEG
has talked with top executives of soccer, tennis, cycling, track and
field and volleyball with a goal of bringing those sports' operations
to the complex on the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus.</LD>
<LD>   He also said AEG, which is financing the project, is negotiating
to build the only outdoor velodrome in North America on the
site--"not only as a world-class training facility, but as a place
people would come to for amateur cycling and racing," Leiweke said.</LD>
<TE>   The national training center will include soccer and tennis
stadiums and will be the training base for the U.S. men's and women's
national soccer teams. The U.S. Soccer Federation, however, is not
expected to move its offices there.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said he hopes other sports will move their operations to
Carson or nearby. He has already helped bring the Women's Tennis
Assn. championships to Staples Center--another Philip Anschutz-owned
venue--in November, and the WTA has talked about moving to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see a shift," Leiweke predicted. "The U.S.
Olympic Committee is probably going to be less focused on bricks and
mortar and more focused on athletes and development. That's going to
be an opportunity for us to step in and provide not only a place for
athletes to train, but for these sports to bring their coaches,
personnel and maybe their offices to this campus."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke has also talked to the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals
about making the training center a "festival site" for beach
volleyball events--sand would be trucked in.</TE>
<TE>   Even for AEG, which encompasses more than 30 divisions and
companies that develop, produce, market and manage sports and
entertainment events, the training center is an ambitious project.
But Leiweke said it fits into the company's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "We also see an opportunity to reestablish L.A. as one of the top
cities in the country for the Olympic movement," he said.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Not Bad, but Spurs Have the Goods</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: San Antonio controls final quarter to
overcome L.A.'s game effort and win 13th in row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So this is how it ends, with the Clippers running in place, huffing
and puffing and gaining no ground in their frantic playoff chase?</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it was asking too much of them Monday against the San
Antonio Spurs, winners of 13 consecutive and looking (finally?) as if
they mean business in the West. The Clippers were good, but the Spurs
were better. Michael Olowokandi was superb, but Tim Duncan was
sensational.</LD>
<LD>   Final score: Spurs 91, Clippers 85.</LD>
<TE>   Time is running out on the Clippers, who remained 21/2 games out
of a Western Conference playoff spot. They simply had no time to
dwell over their second consecutive loss. They boarded a chartered
airplane that took them to Sacramento, where they face the Kings
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   No rest for the weary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a must-win game, but we need a win," power forward Elton
Brand said of facing the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center crackled with energy Monday, a sellout of 20,128
anticipating a Clipper victory and the end of the Spurs' 12-game
winning streak. The Clippers did their part, taking a 13-point lead
in the third quarter and playing with the requisite sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Down the stretch, San Antonio surged and the Clippers weakened.
Why it happened was open to debate. The Clippers believed it had
something to do with 27 fouls called against them and only 14
whistled against the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we deserved to win," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"I thought we played hard enough to win. I thought we did everything
we needed to do to win. I'll leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also had a great deal to do with the Clippers' loss, making
13 of 25 shots and seven of 10 free throws en route to 33 points. He
also had 13 rebounds. Olowokandi countered with 26 points (on
11-for-26 shooting) and 17 rebounds. Brand had 15 points and 10
rebounds for his 50th double-double, but got into foul trouble and
wasn't of much help late.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to keep it together better," Eric Piatkowski said of
letting a double-digit lead get away. "Tim Duncan stepped up and had
a huge game. San Antonio is playing better than anyone else in the
league right now. We've just got to stay close to Utah because we've
still got two games against them."</TE>
<TE>   Utah lost at Seattle on Monday, so a Clipper victory could have
brought them to within 11/2 games with 11 to play, including
head-to-head games against the Jazz on Saturday at Staples Center and
April 3 at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the ninth-place Clippers stayed 21/2 games behind the
eighth-place Jazz and fell four behind the seventh-place SuperSonics.
Eight teams will advance to the playoffs and the Clippers are the odd
team out at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not upset that we lost," Gentry said. "I have no complaints
with the way we played. We did a good job defensively. I told my
players I'm proud of them because they did what they were asked to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. All that the Clippers were missing in Saturday's loss to
the Phoenix Suns was on display Monday against the Spurs. The
Clippers' passion and efficiency were evident right from the start.
Unlike Saturday, there was very little wasted effort. Every step they
took was meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Clippers were not flawless. But they were good
enough to lead, 49-45, at halftime and by 72-67 after three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Miles delivered an early highlight-reel move when he
dribbled past San Antonio's Danny Ferry, swept beneath the basket and
dropped in a reverse layup that gave the Clippers a 43-38 lead late
in the first half, helping to ignite a 10-2 run.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 49-40, before San Antonio rallied in the final
moments of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers kept rolling into the third quarter, scoring from the
inside and out and building a 62-49 lead after Jeff McInnis' jumper
and free throw after Tony Parker hacked him with 8:17 left in the
period.</TE>
<TE>   Their double-digit lead didn't survive the quarter. The Spurs took
command early in the fourth, seizing the lead for good, 84-82, on
David Robinson's dunk and free throw after he was fouled with 3:21
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers got only a three-pointer from Piatkowski the rest of
the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough loss for us, but what can we do?" McInnis asked. "
... We just have to keep playing. We can't let things like that get
us down, but it does hurt because we work hard."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette was ready to play Monday against the San Antonio
Spurs, according to Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry. Heck, he was ready to
play last week. But it was decided the team would wait a few more
days until allowing him to play.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette has been on the injured list since Feb. 22 because of two
dislocated bones in his right hand, suffered when he pounded the
scorer's table in anger during a loss the night before to the Orlando
Magic. He also underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee while
rehabilitating his hand injury.</LD>
<LD>   He pronounced himself fit after Sunday's practice, his first with
teammates.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to let him practice for a few more days," Gentry
said. "I think he's pretty healthy, really, but we want him to do
some basketball stuff on the court before we stick him back into a
competitive situation."</TE>
<TE>   Playing the Spurs on a Monday and then facing the Kings in
Sacramento on a Tuesday is nobody's idea of a good time. But that was
the Clippers' lot as they began the stretch drive with the first of
six sets of games on consecutive nights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the toughest back-to-back that anybody in the NBA could
face," Gentry said. "We're playing against the team that, arguably,
is the best team in the NBA right now with the way they have been
playing [during the Spurs' 12-game winning streak] and we're playing
the very best team in the league at home [the Kings].</TE>
<TE>   "But that's the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was under the weather Monday, having caught a bug from his
young sons.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't care if they breathe and cough on you," he said. "But
there's no injured list for coaches."</TE>

Sunday against to the Lakers.</TE>

<TE>   Price: $19.95 (DVD), $14.95 (video)</TE>
<TE>   The New England Patriots had an amazing season on their way to the
Super Bowl championship and you don't have to be a Patriot fan to
take the ride again.</TE>
<TE>   NFL Films tells the story of the Patriots' season and Super Bowl
victory in 65 minutes. The DVD contains 30 minutes of bonus footage.</TE>
<TE>   The season got off to a tragic start when quarterbacks coach Dick
Rehbein, 45, died of heart failure during training camp. When the
regular season started, the Patriots lost to Cincinnati, 23-17, on
Sept. 9. After the terrorist attacks Sept. 11 and the one-week
postponement of games, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets, 10-3.
They also lost starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who sheared a blood
vessel in his chest when he was hit by linebacker Mo Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   After a victory over Indianapolis with untested Tom Brady at
quarterback, the Patriots fell to 1-3 by losing to Miami, 30-10. Who
could have guessed then that the Patriots would beat the St. Louis
Rams in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   It's an unlikely story, one that NFL Films tells with clarity and
artistry.</TE>
<TE>   The bonus footage in the DVD includes an emotional NFL salute to
America, the Super Bowl halftime show featuring U2, a segment on the
1976 Patriots and features on receiver-kicker Gino Cappelletti and
quarterback Steve Grogan.</TE>

<HD>In the Short Run, Izturis Is Tracy's First Choice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy named Cesar Izturis his opening-day
shortstop Monday. No shock there--the 22-year-old has impressed
coaches, teammates and front-office executives with his speed, sure
hands, strong arm and instincts since the first day of camp.</LD>
<LD>   But in a bit of a surprise, Tracy said the reason Izturis, the
Dodgers' sixth opening-day shortstop in six years, won the job over
incumbent Alex Cora is he believes Izturis can "bring some energy,
some speed and the potential to create more run-scoring opportunities
to the top of the lineup."</LD>
<LD>   Once reluctant to use a youngster with 46 games of big-league
experience in the highly demanding leadoff spot, Tracy said Monday he
is "tinkering with the idea" of batting Izturis first. And if Tracy
bats Izturis second--a more likely scenario--Mark Grudzielanek won't
be happy.</LD>
<TE>   Grudzielanek is batting .100 (two for 20) this spring and has been
slowed by a sore right hamstring, but he hit .271 with 13 homers and
55 runs batted in as the Dodgers' No. 2 hitter last season and
believes he should retain that role.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my spot," Grudzielanek said. "If [Izturis] is going to bat
leadoff, that's different. But what I've done in the past, what I'm
capable of doing ... to [lose] that spot in spring training would be
kind of tough. I have no clue what's going to happen. No one has said
a word to me."</TE>
<TE>   Where Izturis bats will depend on who plays center field. Tracy
wouldn't name a starter Monday, but he will probably go with a
platoon of left-handed Dave Roberts and right-handed Marquis Grissom.
Roberts would bat leadoff when he starts, but when Grissom plays, the
switch-hitting Izturis presumably would lead off.</TE>
<TE>   Izturis, acquired from Toronto in a winter trade, has a .294
on-base percentage in five minor league seasons. He's hitting .293
with a .317 on-base percentage in 18 spring games and has a tendency
to hit too many lazy fly balls, but many Dodgers, including
Grudzielanek, think he can handle a top-of-the-order role.</TE>
<TE>   "You're probably asking too much [for a first-year player to lead
off], but he seems to handle pressure well," Grudzielanek said. "You
don't want to put any young guy in a situation where he could flutter
a bit, but I don't see that with this kid."</TE>
<TE>   If Izturis struggles, Tracy won't hesitate to replace him with
Cora, who will make the team, along with Jeff Reboulet, as utility
infielders. Cora had two hits in the Dodgers' 7-2 exhibition loss to
Baltimore Monday and is batting .308 (12 for 39) with five RBIs this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Alex Cora will be an integral part of this team," Tracy said. "He
had a great spring and hasn't lost his job, but we feel we're better
served to start out with Cesar.... But if we have to make an
adjustment to be competitive, we will."</TE>
<TE>   Cora handled his demotion with class.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been in this situation; I'll have to adjust to it,
take it one day at a time and be ready when they call my name," Cora
said. "The only thing I can do is what I've done all spring, hit the
ball on the ground, play good defense, be aggressive. I've got to
accept this role and deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii started for the first time in nine days
Monday, giving up one run and five hits, striking out three and
walking three in four innings of a triple-A game against the New York
Mets. He threw 69 pitches, 40 for strikes, and labored during a
32-pitch fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii suffered a second-inning lapse, giving up a home run and two
singles in the span of four pitches, but he did strike out two with
the bases loaded to end the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to concentrate more during the season," Ishii said, adding
that a recent chat with fellow Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo helped.
"Nomo said when I'm throwing the ball well, I have a tendency to
relax, take my time. When my pitches are out of the strike zone, I
tend to rush things."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's next start will be Sunday against Seattle in Safeco Field,
the Dodgers' final tuneup before the April 2 season opener. Ishii has
had trouble controlling his nerves this spring, and the Dodgers hope
an exhibition game in a major league stadium will help get him
acclimated to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "That will be a tremendous experience, to pitch in a big league
situation with a big crowd," Ishii said. "I don't want to let my
teammates down."</TE>
<TE>   There has been some concern that if Ishii is nervous during
Grapefruit League games, he might not respond well to the pressure of
Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have anxiety during the season, I won't be able to win,"
Ishii said. "I have to push that out of my mind so I can win. I have
to concentrate on baseball only and not worry about other things."</TE>
<TE>   As Ishii spoke Monday, he had ice packs wrapped around his back,
left shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle. But he said there is no cause
for concern.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all regular, there is no pain," Ishii said. "Do not
worry, because I was born in a cold place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Probable opening-day starter Kevin Brown will start a split-squad
game in Florida on Thursday. Nomo will start a split-squad game in
Las Vegas on Thursday night against Arizona. The season-opening
rotation will probably be Brown, Nomo, Odalis Perez, Andy Ashby and
Ishii.... Converted starter Eric Gagne prepped for his probable
closing role by striking out two in an inning of hitless relief
Monday. He'll throw another inning tonight against the Mets.</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck forward Dan Bylsma has been nominated for the Bill
Masterton Memorial Trophy by the Anaheim chapter of the Professional
Hockey Writers Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The award goes to the NHL player who best exemplifies the
qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.
Adam Graves of the New York Rangers won the award last season.</LD>
<LD>   Bylsma's skills as a penalty killer and his leadership have been
invaluable to the Ducks. Off the ice, he runs the Dan Bylsma
Charitable Foundation, which helps youths with the cost of playing
sports, particularly ice hockey, and aids hockey programs for
children in need.</LD>
<TE>   Bylsma was recently named a Sports Ethics Fellow by the Institute
for International Sports for his contributions to promote the ideals
of ethics and fair play.</TE>
<TE>   High hopes that Duck officials had for forward Maxim Balmochnykh
have not been realized, and may never be, since his decision to
return to Russia for personal reasons, according to Duck officials.</TE>
<TE>   Balmochnykh, a 1997 second-round draft pick, has been practicing
with HK Lipetsk, a second-division team with which he began his
career in 1994-95. He has struggled during three seasons with minor
league Cincinnati. He did appear in six games with the Ducks with one
assist in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   He had six goals and 10 points in 23 games with Cincinnati this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Balmochnykh's future will be re-evaluated during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jason York left Sunday's game against Dallas in the
second period after being hit by the Stars' Manny Malhotra. York may
skate today at practice. He has been bothered all season by a sore
right shoulder that will require arthroscopic surgery at the end of
the season.... Mike Leclerc, Matt Cullen and Bylsma each have reached
personal bests in goals. Leclerc has 19, Cullen 18 and Bylsma eight.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Alana Beard wasn't about to let Duke fall short of the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   Beard scored 24 points on nine-for-12 shooting and Monique Currie
added 15 points as the top-seeded Blue Devils beat South Carolina,
77-68, Monday night in the East Regional championship game to earn
their second trip to the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Devils (31-3), who have won a school-record 22
consecutive games, advance to San Antonio to face Oklahoma, a 94-60
winner over Colorado in the West Regional final. Duke is returning to
the Final Four for the first time since 1999, when it lost to Purdue
in the championship game.</LD>
<TE>   Beard also had seven rebounds, five assists, five steals and two
blocks to earn the regional's most outstanding player award.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an incredible basketball player," teammate Sheana Mosch
said. "She can take over a game when she wants.... She's awesome, but
I wouldn't be surprised if she could play even better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded South Carolina (25-7) scored the game's first eight
points and rallied from a 13-point halftime deficit to take a
one-point lead midway through the second half. But the Blue Devils
never lost their poise and answered every run.</TE>
<TE>   "I know every last one of these girls here want to win," Beard
said. "Our chemistry is just so strong right now.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'Good teams make runs, but better teams make runs
back.'"</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 35-22, at halftime, the Gamecocks used several zone and
trapping defenses to slow Duke's offense. They scored nine unanswered
points to tie the score at 42 and eventually took a 46-45 lead on a
layup by Jocelyn Penn with 9:54 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Beard answered Penn's layup with a three-point play and two free
throws for a 50-46 lead with 9:03 left. After a hanging jumper by
Currie, Beard found reserve Krista Gingrich on the wing for a
three-pointer and a 55-49 lead.</TE>
<TE>   She later found Michelle Matyasovsky rolling to the basket for a
layup, then hit two free throws and a short jumper in the lane for a
68-59 lead with 3:16 left. South Carolina didn't get closer than five
the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Duke, which avenged a November home loss to the Gamecocks, scored
on 10 of 11 possessions after South Carolina took the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "That's experience and toughness on their part," South Carolina
Coach Susan Walvius said. "They were fantastic today. They had an
answer to everything we threw at them."</TE>
<TE>   Duke also found success by driving into the paint and getting to
the free-throw line. Duke hit 15 of 19 free throws in the second half
compared to the Gamecocks' four-for-six effort for the game.</TE>

<HD>Designated for the Right Assignment</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Fullmer actually wants to be Angel DH, and he has
a system in place to make the most of it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>He hits off a tee. He shakes his head. He hits in the batting cage.
He rides the exercise bike. He hits some more. He runs. He watches
video. He twitches.</LD>
<LD>   This is how Brad Fullmer prepares to hit. This is intensity
personified.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a warmup routine, a drill or two completed hours
before the game starts. This is a menu of routines, from which
Fullmer selects several options before each at-bat:</LD>
<TE>   Hit before his first at-bat, watch video and ride the bike before
his second at-bat, hit some more before his third.</TE>
<TE>   He cannot sit still. He cannot even stand still. When the Angels
are in the field, the one place you won't find their new designated
hitter is on the bench, relaxing and cheering on his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels ask Fullmer to worry about one thing, and one thing
only. He is here to hit. In that role, the Angels believe, he is
perfectly cast.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obsessed with hitting," Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all he thinks about. That's all he dreams about. The guy
loves hitting."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman spent a painful amount of time this winter picking up the
phone and hearing one agent after another say something along the
lines of, "Hi, I represent [insert name of fading veteran slugger
here] and we'd love to sign with the Angels."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder. The Angels might as well have let their pitchers bat
for themselves last season.</TE>
<TE>   Their intended designated hitter, Glenallen Hill, hit .136 with
one home run in 66 at-bats before they dumped him. By the end of the
season, 16 players had started at least one game at DH, sometimes
batting ninth. The DH line: a .212 batting average, eight home runs
and 56 runs batted in, totals all exceeded by such non-sluggers as
Oakland second baseman Frank Menechino and White Sox shortstop Royce
Clayton.</TE>
<TE>   So, when agents representing the likes of Dante Bichette, Ron
Coomer and Andres Galarraga called, Stoneman kept the names on file,
but without much enthusiasm. He would have to do something to add a
bat, he knew, but couldn't he do better?</TE>
<TE>   With Fullmer, 27, he could. And, with the Toronto Blue Jays
cutting costs, the Angels could add a hitter just beginning the prime
of his career for a modest price. To complete the trade, the Angels
simply agreed to give up pitcher Brian Cooper, also 27, who would not
have made their team, and pick up Fullmer's $3.75-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer hit .274 with 18 homers and 83 RBIs last season, a
relatively disappointing one. In 2000, he hit .295 with 32 homers and
104 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since Chili Davis in 1996, the Angel lineup
includes a legitimate designated hitter, and a willing one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a specialized spot," said third-year Manager Mike Scioscia,
"and it takes a special mentality to fill it.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, we have somebody who wants to do it and who
is very productive in that role."</TE>
<TE>   If a player is good enough to play every day, chances are he
detests the DH role. Mo Vaughn, a defensive liability at first base,
insisted he would not be the DH. Tim Salmon, forced into DH duty by a
foot injury in 1998, all but drove himself nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's a complete feeling after the game when you're
exhausted because you've played defense and offense," Salmon said.
"When you're just a hitter, there's a tendency to have all this extra
energy at the end of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon's words ring true to Fullmer. Even after two years as a DH,
Fullmer struggles not to drive himself to the brink of mental
exhaustion. Without the chance to redeem himself on defense, a DH can
go one for three every day and spend sleepless nights dwelling on
failing two-thirds of the time.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason Fullmer is thrilled to play in Anaheim, why he
told his friends at the gym this winter he hoped for a trade to the
Angels. He grew up in Chatsworth. His family still lives in Southern
California. So does his girlfriend of three years.</TE>
<TE>   When he fails, he will not fail alone, and he will not stay up all
night worrying about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of guy that takes it too seriously at times," he
said. "I take it home. I take it away from the ballpark. When you're
away from your family and your friends, you've got a lot of empty
time. You've got a lot of time on your hands to sit there and think.
I'm always one to take it home and analyze and over-analyze.</TE>
<TE>   "I think being home will give me a good outlet to leave it at the
ballpark--whatever happens, good or bad, let it go. I've never had
that before."</TE>
<TE>   When the Expos traded him to Toronto two years ago, Blue Jay
Manager Jim Fregosi said Fullmer was "probably meant to be an
American League player," another way of saying, "probably meant to be
a DH."</TE>
<TE>   Not always. The Expos selected him in the second round of the 1993
draft, from Van Nuys Montclair Prep. In 1998, Baseball America ranked
him as the Expos' top prospect, ahead of budding stars Javier Vazquez
and Orlando Cabrera.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer wore a glove--several, in fact--as he made his way to the
majors. He signed as a third baseman, sat out an entire year after
surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff, tried the outfield, and did
not play a full year at first base until his rookie season in
Montreal. He worked extensively with Expo coach, Perry Hill, trying
to learn the position on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer played two years at first base for Montreal. He played two
games there in two years with Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lot better now, when I don't play in the field, than I was
when I did," he said. "The first two years, I got labeled as being
[terrible] at first, but I had never really played there full-time.</TE>
<TE>   "I continued to work a lot at it in 2000. Last year, I didn't do
as much because I wasn't playing there. Sometimes, you've got to say
you're wasting your time and direct your energy in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, athletically, I can certainly play in the field. But
whatever they need me to do here--I've DH'd the last two years, I'm
pretty good at it, I've had my two best years. So that's fine.
Whatever."</TE>
<TE>   If intensity and dedication determined defensive prowess, Fullmer
would win a Gold Glove. Those are the traits that enabled him to
appear as a featured weightlifter in the pages of Muscle and Fitness
magazine, after he'd decided in 10th grade to start lifting because
he believed he was too thin.</TE>
<TE>   "If we asked him to play the outfield or play shortstop, I'm sure
he'd do it," Stoneman said. "But, by far, his best tool is his bat.
He's happy to contribute that way."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer works out with the other first basemen in training camp.
He'll play a few games there this season, mostly in National League
ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   But, the more he reflects on Fregosi's remark, the less it stings.</TE>
<TE>   "I do like the American League," Fullmer said. "I do think I'm an
American League player, because I do like to DH and I want to do it."</TE>

<HD>Williams Towers Above the Crowd</HD>
<DH>Wrestling: Calvary Chapel athlete is The Times' wrestler of
the year after a 38-1 season and several titles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Williams thought long and hard about what he wanted to accomplish
in the wrestling season and figured he should aim high.</LD>
<LD>   He decided he would go for an undefeated season. A lofty goal for
the 171-pound junior from Santa Ana Calvary Chapel High, but not high
enough for his coaches.</LD>
<LD>   "They said I need to set my goals a bit higher," Williams said. "I
was like 'What do you mean higher? I want to win all my matches.'"</LD>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel Coaches Joey Coughran and Jake Harman told Williams
he should try to make it through the season without getting taken
down.</TE>
<TE>   "It hit me pretty hard at first," Williams said. "But my sophomore
year I didn't really give up too many takedowns and same with my
freshman year. I went into the season thinking maybe I can."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't last long. In his eighth match of the year, in the third
round of the Reno Tournament of Champions, Williams was taken down.
In the finals of the same tournament, he was taken down again and
lost the match.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Williams went undefeated in his final 28 matches to
finish 38-1. Along the way he won the state title, the Southern
Section Masters tournament, the Southern Section Northern Division
tournament and the Five Counties tournament--all without getting
taken down.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is The Times' wrestler of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "After Reno, I had to adjust my goals a little bit," Williams
said. "At Reno, it was in the back of my head, but it's dumb for
people to worry about not getting taken down. After that my mentality
kind of changed. I wasn't worried about people scoring on me, I was
just worried about what I could do on them."</TE>
<TE>   And he could do plenty.</TE>
<TE>   At the Five Counties Invitational, among the more prestigious
tournaments in the country, Williams had four consecutive pins. At
the Masters meet, he pinned three opponents in less than three
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   At the state championships, he pinned his first opponent in 1
minute 10 seconds, then won his next four matches by a combined score
of 26-2, giving up only two escape points.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relative ease with which Williams cruised through his
weight class, the season had its share of low points. Williams
suffered a small muscle tear in his shoulder during the Reno
tournament and missed two weeks of action.</TE>
<TE>   At the state tournament, he was poked in the eye, dislocated a
finger and felt a pop in his knee.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, his team, the two-time defending state champion
entering the season, was thumped by 50 points in a dual meet with
Bakersfield and lost two key wrestlers to injuries. It began the
Masters without a tournament victory for the season.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams persevered, as did Calvary Chapel, which finished
fifth, highest among Southern Section schools at the state meet.</TE>
<TE>   "When bad stuff was happening, I was sad for my teammates, but the
worst thing to do is mourn over your losses," Williams said. "You've
just got to keep on plugging forward. I just stayed focused on what I
needed to do to help my team and help myself. That's how you get
through a season."</TE>

<KH>NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT FINAL FOUR</KH>
<HD>The Edge of Knight</HD>
<DH>Indiana's in the Final Four Again, but Not All Will Credit
Coach Davis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Ind.</DL>
<LD>The church doors opened Sunday morning, and there among the dark
suits were splashes of red--children in Indiana sweatshirts, women in
red coats, men in IU jackets.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been 10 years since we were in the Final Four, 15 since
we've had a national championship," parishioner Ed Dolan said as the
congregation spilled out of St. Charles Church. "Everybody's real
excited."</LD>
<LD>   There is joy in Bloomington, but don't believe it if anyone tries
to tell you Bob Knight's ghost has been exorcised just because Mike
Davis has the Hoosiers in the Final Four.</LD>
<TE>   "The first part of the year, I was sitting on the sidelines
yelling, 'Get a new coach!'" admitted Dolan, who arrived in
Bloomington as a student 32 years ago and never left.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Knight is a great coach, and he left under real bad
circumstances. Myself, I hated to see him go. We're used to the
motion offense. Davis runs a lot of pre-set plays. At first it was
like they'd go to an 'X' on the floor. But as the season went on,
they got better."</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Southern Uniform Shop at College Mall, the brand new
"I Like Mike" T-shirts are selling briskly.</TE>
<TE>   A large section of Texas Tech merchandise suddenly goes untouched,
stacked below a red shirt that says "It's a Knight Thing," and on the
back, "You Wouldn't Understand."</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I sell a couple hundred Texas Tech items a week, but it's
dead," owner Carol Brinegar said as she surveyed a display that
included Texas Tech coffee cups, Texas Tech license plate frames,
Texas Tech key chains and Texas Tech ball caps in three colors.</TE>
<TE>   "People keep saying, 'Put it half-price,'" Brinegar said. "They're
fickle.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody asks me, 'How can you sell both?' I'm a fan of Knight
and a fan of Indiana. I don't have to make a political statement. I'm
here to make money."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the delirium after Saturday night's victory over Kent State
in the NCAA South Regional final--and there was delirium on
Bloomington's Kirkwood Avenue, where thousands crowded into the
street and a few climbed light poles--it has been suggested that
Knight's shadow has been eclipsed.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll never happen. Not in Indiana," said Rose Bastin, owner of
Rosie's Diner in Hendricksville, a restaurant Knight used to visit
every week during the season for some of Rose's home-style cooking,
usually chili or pies.</TE>
<TE>   "Knight was our hero," said Bastin, who proudly displays the Texas
Tech pennant Knight sent her after becoming the Red Raider coach last
year. "He still is, to a great extent. The way he was fired was so
dishonest, almost like a scheme invented in elementary school, not by
a university administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obvious to anyone, they just wanted him out of there."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Bastin isn't rooting for the Hoosiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew this team would do well," she said. "It was clear
from the time they started as freshmen. I think everything's going
OK.... But some people believe we're not really seeing Davis' team
yet. After all, Knight did bring in these players.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's still going to wait and see."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody will be seeing a lot of Knight in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, Indiana has reached the Final Four for the first
time since 1992 just as Knight--fired in September 2000 for what
university President Myles Brand called a "persistent and troubling
pattern of behavior"--releases his memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "KNIGHT: My Story," written with Bob Hammel, appears in stores
today, a little more than two weeks after the heavily promoted ESPN
movie "A Season on the Brink," was followed by Texas Tech's
first-round NCAA tournament loss.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's promotional tour will include a previously scheduled
book-signing in Bloomington after the Final Four, as well as a
scheduled appearance Thursday on Bob Costas' HBO show "On the Record"
and an upcoming guest spot on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno."</TE>
<TE>   The book is heavy on accounts of Knight's friendships with men he
admires and such outings as a fishing expedition to Russia with Ted
Williams and a hunting trip to Spain with former President George
Bush, but also offers his version of every major controversy of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   From the 1984 chair toss to the videotape that allegedly shows
Knight with his hand on the neck of former player Neil Reed to the
final straw--an encounter with a student Knight decided needed an
etiquette lesson for referring to him only by his last name--Knight
gives his side. It is sometimes revealing, rarely conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case with such books, the fun is in the index.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the baseball Hall of Famer, is mentioned on 18 pages.
Even Chip Hilton, the fictional character created by Hall of Fame
basketball coach Clair Bee in a series of books Knight admired as a
youngster, is cited on three pages.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, Mike is in the index only once, a reference to Davis
witnessing Knight's encounter with a student who said "Hey, Knight,"
to the coach.</TE>
<TE>   As for Davis, the relationship between Knight and his former
assistant dissolved when Davis took the interim job after Knight's
firing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is now relishing his sudden popularity, telling how Jesse
Jackson called after Indiana's victory, and describing his full
answering machine at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It took my wife and I an hour to check our messages," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Did Coach Knight call?</TE>
<TE>   A smirk played across Davis' face.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, it may still be on my voice mail."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, analyzing Knight vs. Davis has become a more
popular pastime than breaking down Indiana's match-ups against
Oklahoma, the Hoosiers' semifinal opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I think Coach Knight was nicer than Coach Davis in
practice," said Dane Fife, the hotheaded but humorous senior guard.
"Coach Knight only asked me to go to the locker room once, and Coach
Davis told me to hit the showers several times. He's thrown me out of
practice more than Coach Knight."</TE>
<TE>   Fife is a key figure in Indiana's resurgence, partly because he is
the player most loyal to Knight. After the firing, Fife angrily said
he'd transfer.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Davis and considering Indiana's prospects of
doing something special some day, he changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I may look like an idiot, but I'm going to come back,'"
Fife said.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Jeffries stayed too. The sophomore center from Bloomington
North High was preparing for his freshman season when he found out
he'd never play for Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Now he admires Davis for his work ethic, and like Fife,
acknowledges that Davis' inside-outside offense might work better for
this particular group of Hoosiers than Knight's classic motion
offense.</TE>
<TE>   As a native son of Bloomington, however, Jeffries knows this
week's love-fest could be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said this all long," Jeffries said. "The people who liked
Coach Davis before are going to like him a little bit more. Those who
hated him are still going to hate him."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's legend will never die in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   It might not even fade much.</TE>
<TE>   On the walls of Nick's English Hut, a traditional watering hole
for more than 70 years, a rare photograph of Knight throwing the
famous chair still adorns the walls.</TE>
<TE>   "Bobby Knight Offering a Little Old Lady His Chair," the caption
reads.</TE>
<TE>   At Walter's barber shop at College Mall, a signed photo of Davis
sits on a shelf, separated from Knight's photo by one of fired
football coach Cam Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   At least Davis is beginning to be treated like someone special.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night I took my family out to eat.... as we walked out, the
whole place cheered for us," he said. How long will the cheering
last?</TE>
<TE>   Already, the whispering is that these are still Knight's players.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is quick to give credit to Knight, but adds one small
retort.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was saying that when we were losing."</TE>

<HD>Davis Shares His Wealth</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Indiana coach donates his salary bonus
for making Final Four to his church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Indiana Coach Mike Davis has earned $50,000 in bonuses for guiding
the Hoosiers to a share of the Big Ten title and their first Final
Four in 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   That money, he said, will be donated to the Eastern Star Church,
the congregation of 12,000 his family belongs to in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been blessed," Davis said. "I'm going to give it to my
church so they can help some kids."</LD>
<TE>   Pastor Jeffrey A. Johnson Sr. said the church operates an
elementary school called the Jewel Christian Academy for 400
children, and the donation will be used to defray the cost of tuition
for parents who otherwise couldn't afford to send their children to a
private church school.</TE>
<TE>   Should Indiana win the national championship, Davis will earn an
additional bonus of $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   He says he would give a portion of that to the church as well.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a guy making $100 a week and it was easy to tithe. He
got a job making $1,000 a week, and he told the preacher, 'When I was
making $100 a week, I paid my church a tithe.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's really hard for me to pay so much.'</TE>
<TE>   "The preacher said, 'Let's pray,' and he said, 'God, please give
him back his $100-a-week job.'"</TE>
<TE>   Davis "tithes," or donates 10%, of a four-year contract that will
pay him $600,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Ram quarterback Kurt Warner is another sports figure who
said he tithes after signing a seven-year contract worth more than
$46 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has credited Johnson, pastor of a church 50 miles away in
Indianapolis, for helping him through difficult times since taking
over after Bob Knight was fired before last season.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to deal with the pressure of the job itself," said
Johnson, a Purdue fan until he met Davis. "Then the kids talking
about leaving, dealing with the president of the school, the media
and all of that.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the racial aspect of it, in Bloomington, Ind., first
African-American coach--actually at any Division I school in Indiana,
not just at IU.</TE>
<TE>   "All that pressure was just coming on him and they were losing a
few games he thought they should have won. Basically, when he says I
helped him through that, that was when he was in worship, listening
to sermons, hearing the word of God.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just grateful for a man who's not ashamed of his faith, a man
who loves God, talks about the blessings God has given. Every time he
gets to the 'mic,' the first thing he talks about is the word of God.</TE>
<TE>   "He's somebody who loves God, loves his wife, supports his
children. We need to see that in our society."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, the day after winning the NCAA South Regional
title, Davis was in the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "The church gave him a standing ovation," Johnson said.</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Leading the league in power-play conversion and penalty-killing
percentage with 10 games to play, the Kings could become the first
team since the 1984-85 New York Islanders to top the NHL in both
categories.</LD>
<LD>   It would be a nice feather in their cap, Coach Andy Murray said
Monday, but it won't mean a thing if they don't make the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "Those individual stats are nice to have," he said, "but it's the
same as individual statistics for players. If the team success isn't
there, it doesn't matter. I think it's gratifying, and it's a credit
to our players and our assistant coaches, but it doesn't matter....</LD>
<TE>   "But if we're near the top in those two categories at the end of
the season, you'd have to think we should be in the playoffs because
[special-teams play] is going to be so crucial in the next 10 games."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have twice led the league in penalty killing, the last
time in the 1974-75 season, and once had the league's top power-play
unit, in 1976-77.</TE>
<TE>   When Felix Potvin was pulled after the first period of the Kings'
4-0 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes on Sunday, it was the first time
since Dec. 29 that he had not completed a start. He'll be back in
goal tonight against the Vancouver Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought our team played so poorly in the first period that it
was a way of trying to wake our team up," Murray said of his decision
to insert Jamie Storr after the Coyotes opened a 2-0 lead. "It was
saying, 'Hey, Jamie's practiced hard, let's give him a chance; we've
got to play hard.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was no reflection on Felix at all. It was all about trying to
get our team going."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have not lost consecutive games since mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's out of fear," Murray said. "I think it's recognizing
that we can't let up at all. We've got to bounce back."</TE>

<LD>The Lakers made a statement with their 97-96 victory over the
Sacramento Kings at Arco Arena on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But will it translate into a dominating finish to the regular
season that brings the two-time defending NBA champions home-court
advantage in the playoffs?</LD>
<LD>   "It can change the momentum of the season," Kobe Bryant said at
practice Monday in El Segundo.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson took the cautious approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it springboards success for us for the remainder of the
season, but I don't want to read too much into it," he said. "Because
last year we went [to Sacramento] and had a great game in March and
followed it with two losses to Phoenix and Sacramento at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It took another two games before we really broke out and played
the kind of ball we anticipated we can play."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers trail the Kings by half a game with 13 to play in the
race for the Pacific Division title and home-court advantage should
the teams meet in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he likes the Lakers' position. "Obviously our schedule
is a lot tougher than [Sacramento's] coming down the stretch," he
said. "It's a huge challenge for us, but we're up to it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Shaquille O'Neal: "I think we're supposed to shift into high
gear now, and we will."</TE>
<TE>   Considering that the Lakers are 5-1 at Arco Arena over the last
two seasons (including playoffs), Bryant said it doesn't matter if
they secure the home court for a possible playoff series with the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really not too concerned about it, whether it's at home or
on the road," Bryant said. "All it boils down to is execution anyway.
But I think it does send them a message that we're not intimidated by
Arco Arena at all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who fouled out Sunday for only the second time this
season, criticized the Kings for their defensive tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were intent on flopping, and the referees keep
falling for it," he said. "But the only way to beat us is to beat us,
not cheat us."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said O'Neal needs to be aware that teams will do whatever
they can to get the Laker center into foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're the visiting team, it's real hard," Jackson said.
"[O'Neal] has to be very careful. He has to understand that some
nights there are experienced referees who understand that [flopping
is] the ploy that teams are using, and other nights he just has to
back off and wait his turn and not play that physical game that might
create [a foul] situation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been [the Kings'] ploy all along, and they do a good job
of it. It's such a close call between a block and charge. It [varies]
from night to night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he is still bothered by the arthritic toe on his right
foot that has caused him to sit out 10 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not 100%, but I'm good enough to do what I do," he said. "As
long as everybody else does their job, we're going to be fine down
the stretch."</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>It's almost not fair.</LD>
<LD>   The Connecticut women's basketball team has the most talent, a
great coach, a large and loyal fan base, an average margin of victory
of about 37 points a game and an undefeated season going.</LD>
<LD>   So when the top-ranked Huskies didn't miss a field-goal attempt or
a free throw for the first 10 minutes 19 seconds of the NCAA Mideast
Regional final against Old Dominion, when they made 13 consecutive
field goals and five consecutive free throws, when they were running
fastbreaks and not having the ball touch the floor, when Chino's
Diana Taurasi was sinking 24-foot three-point shots and grinning,
when Connecticut was leading, 34-14, and had recorded assists on 12
of their 13 baskets, there was a grim resignation on the faces of the
Old Dominion players on the bench.</LD>
<TE>   The game was over.</TE>
<TE>   While top-seeded Connecticut (37-0) didn't play to the same level
in the second half, the Huskies moved to the Final Four with an 85-64
victory over No. 7-seeded Old Dominion on Monday night at the U.S.
Cellular Arena.</TE>
<TE>   It is the third Final Four in a row for the Huskies and their
sixth trip overall. They will be aiming for a third national title
(second in three years) and will play Tennessee on Friday in San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Bird, the national player of the year and Connecticut's point
guard, provided the Huskies' first missed shot, a 15-footer. Since
she had already scored nine points, her bobble was forgiven.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime the Huskies led, 55-33, and though perfection-seeking
Coach Geno Auriemma may not have forgiven his team's second-half
sloppiness, the enthusiastic crowd of 6,997 did. Bird, a senior,
finished with a career-high 26 points and missed tying her career
high of 12 assists by one. Taurasi, a sophomore, finished with 22
points, seven assists and five steals. "We felt awfully good,"
Taurasi said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady Monarchs (28-6), who had come here disappointed in what
they perceived was an inexplicably low seeding, and carrying
confidence after upsetting No. 2-seeded Purdue at West Lafayette,
Ind., in the second round, got within 14 points, at 72-58, in the
second half. But that was as much a function of Connecticut's natural
letdown as it was of Old Dominion's improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Lucienne Berthieu, Old Dominion's leading scorer, was limited to
six points and four rebounds. And the Lady Monarchs left knowing
they'd seen something special.</TE>
<TE>   "University of Connecticut, in the first 20 minutes, played some
of the best basketball I have ever witnessed," Old Dominion Coach
Wendy Larry said. "I've not seen a finer performance by a No. 1 team
in the nation than what I saw in the first half."</TE>

<DL>AMES, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Tennessee earned this Final Four trip the old-fashioned way-- with
defense.</LD>
<LD>   The Lady Vols disrupted Vanderbilt's normally efficient offense
for much of the game and beat the top-seeded Commodores, 68-63, in
the Midwest Regional final Monday night, sending Tennessee to the
Final Four for the 13th time.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought through the course of the game we really guarded
people," Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt said. "We just tried to take
them somewhat out of their rhythm."</LD>
<TE>   Tennessee (29-4) succeeded and got contributions on the offensive
end from several players. Gwen Jackson led the way with 18 points and
12 rebounds, and Michelle Snow made three key shots down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Lady Vols played off their defense in building a
15-point lead early in the second half against their Southeastern
Conference rival, then survived a rally that got the Commodores
(30-7) within two points.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of different people made plays for us tonight, and that's
what team basketball is all about," Summitt said. "This basketball
team, I felt they deserved to get there and they earned it. They
earned some respect and earned an opportunity to go to the Final
Four."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Tennessee, a six-time national champion, gets another crack
at unbeaten and top-ranked Connecticut, the Mideast Regional
champion. They'll meet in the national semifinals Friday night at San
Antonio. Connecticut beat Tennessee, 86-72, at Knoxville, Tenn., on
Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Chantelle Anderson's 35 points and 12 rebounds weren't enough to
get Vanderbilt to the Final Four for the second time.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, a first-half scoring drought left the Commodores
in an early 10-point hole and forced them to play catch-up the rest
of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We picked up our dribble a lot, and when you pick up your
dribble, their pressure gets in your face," Anderson said. "You have
to keep your dribble to keep the pressure off you, and we didn't do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's layup left Vanderbilt trailing, 63-60, with 1:14 to
play, but Snow came through again, making a turnaround jump shot for
a 65-60 lead with 48.3 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow made some big shots," Vanderbilt Coach Jim Foster said. "We
were behind her. We shouldn't have been behind her. We should have
been in front of her. She's got a nice touch, a nice turnaround. She
was in a rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was No. 788 for Summitt, tying her with Jody Conradt
of Texas for first place among women's coaches.</TE>

<HD>Lewis to Fight Tyson in Memphis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson will meet June 8 in Memphis, Tenn., for
the heavyweight championship, under a deal wrapped up Monday night
after weeks of on-again off-again negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis will defend his World Boxing Council and International
Boxing Federation heavyweight titles against Tyson in one of the most
anticipated fights in recent years, although one that might have lost
some of its appeal as the two camps argued for years over whether
they would actually fight.</LD>
<LD>   The scheduled 12-round bout will be held at the Pyramid arena,
which will seat about 20,000 and where ringside seats will go for
$2,500. It could be one of the richest fights, with revenues
approaching $100 million and each fighter due at least $17.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We now have close to 11 weeks before the fight and I believe
everything is fine," Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said. "Mike is ready
to fight."</TE>
<TE>   The fight that was rejected by Nevada boxing officials after Tyson
misbehaved at a January news conference ended up in Memphis after a
road show in which it was shopped to various cities around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In some cities--including Washington and Detroit--it was welcomed.
In others, politicians gave Tyson a chilly reception and suggested
promoters look elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis landed it with promises of a $12.5-million site fee--not
to mention a willingness to overlook Tyson's antics that have
included a brawl and outburst at the January news conference first
announcing the fight.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the city hopes to gain a reputation as a major player
in big-time sports.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Raider defensive tackle Darrell Russell pleaded innocent
to sexual assault charges.</TE>
<TE>   Russell and two friends were arrested early last month after a
27-year-old woman claimed she was drugged and raped in an Alameda
home on Jan. 31. Russell was charged with 25 felonies as an
accomplice. He has been free since posting bail on Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies arrested former NFL star Dexter Manley at a
Houston hospital, where he had checked in after missing a
court-ordered meeting in the wake of his conviction for evidence
tampering.</TE>
<TE>   Manley was found guilty Wednesday after a jury determined he tried
to swallow less than a gram of cocaine during a 2001 drug bust at a
Houston motel.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing is set for April 5, but Manley did not show up for a
required meeting with a probation officer. His attorney, Jonathan
Munier, said Manley checked into Riverside General Hospital last
weekend for depression.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Willie Roaf is headed from the New Orleans
Saints to the Kansas City Chiefs, pending NFL approval of the trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints would not release any details on the trade, but
ESPN.com reported the Saints would get a conditional fourth-round
draft choice in 2003 that could become a third-rounder, depending on
Roaf's performance with the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed free-agent running backs Michael
Pittman and Byron Hanspard. Pittman, who played the last four seasons
for the Arizona Cardinals, agreed to a five-year contract. Hanspard,
a former second-round draft pick who hasn't played in the NFL since
1999, received a one-year deal.... The Carolina Panthers brought back
former special teams standout Michael Bates, signing him to a
one-year deal worth $750,000.... Free-agent kicker Kris Brown joined
the Houston Texans after the Pittsburgh Steelers didn't match a
four-year, $4.7 million offer sheet. The Steelers, who will receive a
seventh-round draft pick, signed kicker Todd Peterson, who had been
with the Chiefs, to a three-year, $2.5 million contract. In turn, the
Chiefs signed 41-year-old Morten Andersen to a one-year contract.</TE>

<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kevin Harvick and Robby Gordon were fined a
total of $30,000 by NASCAR for their postrace antics at Bristol Motor
Speedway in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick was fined $15,000 and put on probation until Aug. 28 for
grabbing Greg Biffle after Saturday's Busch series race.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon loses $10,000 and also goes on probation until the same
date for spinning out Earnhardt on pit road after Sunday's Winston
Cup race. Earnhardt Jr. was fined $5,000, but was not put on
probation, for banging into Gordon's car on the cool-down lap.</TE>
<TE>   Radio talk-show host Dave Smith, who has been at KXTA (1150) since
it went all sports on March 10, 1997, was released by the station,
along with Steve Carbone, who did updates and served as host of the
UCLA basketball post-game shows.</TE>
<TE>   Station manager Greg Ashlock and Smith declined to comment, but
sources said the dismissals were the result of profanity used by
Carbone in a column he wrote for a Web site controlled by Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was heard weekdays 3-7 p.m. with Arnie Spanier, who will
continue alone in that time slot. Carbone came to KXTA about three
years ago after working as a phone screener for Jim Rome.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia captain Keith Primeau says that the Flyers are ready for
their playoff run.</LD>
<LD>   Primeau celebrated his return to the lineup with two goals as the
Atlantic Division leaders extended their unbeaten streak to four
games with a 4-1 victory Monday night over the Toronto Maple Leafs at
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought we did a much better job tonight," said Primeau, who
missed two games because of strained ribs. "We've done some good
things the last week or two, but as far as a 60-minute effort goes,
tonight was our best."</LD>
<TE>   Simon Gagne scored a short-handed goal for the Flyers, who moved
within two points of Eastern Conference leader Boston with two games
in hand. Dan McGillis had an empty-net goal with six seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 4, New York Rangers 2--Oleg Kvasha scored the
tying and game-winning goals in a 4:57 span late in the third period
to lift the Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Theo Fleury and Roman Lyashenko scored for the Rangers, who lost
for the sixth time in seven games and remained three points behind
eighth-place Montreal, with eight games to play.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Florida 1--Joe Nieuwendyk set up goals by linemates
Patrik Elias and Jamie Langenbrunner to lead the Devils at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   John Madden had a breakaway goal in the final minute, and the
Devils limited Florida to 15 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Detroit 3--Scott Hartnell had a goal and an assist as
the Predators tied the Red Wings at Nashville. Nashville is the only
team in the NHL not to lose in overtime this season.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 6, Columbus 1--Craig Conroy scored twice and had two
assists, and Jarome Iginla scored his league-leading 44th goal as the
Flames won at Calgary, Canada, to end an eight-game winless streak.
Iginla, who also had two assists, leads the NHL with 83 points.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Coyote defenseman Danny Markov is expected to miss the
rest of the regular season because of a broken left foot. The Coyotes
said that tests performed at a Scottsdale, Ariz., hospital found a
broken bone.... New Jersey Devil forward Bobby Holik was suspended
for one game, missing Monday's game against Florida, for hitting
Carolina's Rod Brind'Amour in the face with his stick.... St. Louis
Blues forward Keith Tkachuk was suspended for one game by the league

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Now Coyotes Have Game, Not Names</HD>

<LD>Before this season began, NHL fans around Phoenix laughed out loud
when Cliff Fletcher, the Coyotes' senior vice president of hockey
operations, said his team would make the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the Coyotes had conducted a major overhaul, getting rid
of top-salary stars such as Jeremy Roenick, Keith Tkachuk and Nikolai
Khabibulin.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the playoffs less than three weeks away, Fletcher is
looking like a prophet. The Coyotes are in the thick of the playoff
race, in seventh place in the Western Conference with a 34-24-9-5
record.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel much better about the franchise now," said Stephen Weeks,
a Coyote season-ticket holder since the team moved from Winnipeg to
Phoenix in 1996. "We used to have people like Roenick and other
big-name players and that was good when the franchise originally
started because we needed name players to get fans into the arena.</TE>
<TE>   "But the people who have stayed with this team are real fans, and
they understand hockey. They want to see wins and see the Coyotes go
deep into the playoffs. We've never gotten past the first round."</TE>
<TE>   True. The Roenick-Tkachuk era did produce three 90-point seasons,
but no playoff advancement. When new ownership brought in Wayne
Gretzky as managing partner last year, the Coyotes were hurting. The
team had a payroll of $38 million and was upside down in debt. Thus,
the facelift.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Coach Bobby Francis and goaltender Sean Burke, the new-look
Coyotes have not only proved critics wrong but have become one of the
league's hottest teams, going 9-2-1-1 since the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   It's really hard not to like the blue-collar Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in the year, it was slow and we were having some small
crowds," said Burke, a journeyman goalie who has found a home in
Phoenix. "But things are different now.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans get excited about good hockey. Obviously, winning is
what they come to see, but they appreciate the effort more than
anything. The best thing about our team is that we give good effort
every night."</TE>
<TE>   One person who's not surprised is Roenick.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a workhorse mentality," said Roenick, who signed as a
free agent last summer with Philadelphia but still owns a home in the
Phoenix area. "They go out and absolutely bust their [butts] every
night and get in your face. They finish their checks, and they play a
good system. [Francis] is a great coach, and he's doing a lot to keep
them motivated."</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes, who will play the Mighty Ducks in a back-to-back set
starting Wednesday, may not have lots of big-name players but they do
have talent. Daymond Langkow, who left Philadelphia the same day the
Flyers signed Roenick, leads the team in scoring; and Daniel Briere
is one of the league's up-and-coming players. Captain Teppo Numminen
spearheads the Coyotes' defense, which is on pace to give up fewer
than 200 goals for only the second time in the franchise's 23-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to stay," Francis said after his team completed a
2-0-3 season series against the Kings with a 4-0 victory on Sunday.
"We've proven that all season."</TE>
<TE>   Which hasn't gone unnoticed by Coyote fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne Gretzky has put together a good foundation for a team,
[rather than] a team of individuals," Weeks said. "We have a team
now.... Phoenix likes a winner, just like anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   With the Coyotes scheduled to move into a new arena in suburban
Glendale before the 2003-04 season, things are looking up for a
franchise that was on shaky ground 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Phoenix may never be a true hockey city, in the sense that guys
are recognized everywhere they go because people live and die with
the sport," Burke said. "But there is a core group of people here who
really support hockey. They are knowledgeable about the game, and the
situation is only going to get healthier and healthier."</TE>
<TE>   Damage Control</TE>
<TE>   The NHL has been in damage-control mode since spectator Brittanie
Cecil died last week, two days before her 14th birthday, after being
struck by a puck at a game.</TE>
<TE>   The league, formed in 1917, had not previously had a a
puck-related fatality. Cecil was hit in the head by a deflected shot
by Columbus center Espen Knutsen in a game between the Blue Jackets
and Calgary at Nationwide Arena on March 16.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, coaches and players agreed that something had to be
done to prevent another such death. They talked about how, in Europe,
there's a protective netting from the top of the glass to a
reasonable height toward the rafters.</TE>
<TE>   But when Philadelphia's Bobby Clarke and the Kings' Andy Murray
basically said that they were shocked that it took 85 years before
someone died of a puck-related injury, the NHL hardly came off as a
league on the cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping the league is working on plans to copy international
hockey's protective netting. It can't happen fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * Who could blame Colorado forward Peter Forsberg for wanting to
get back on the ice after watching the Avalanche get handled by
Washington, Detroit and the Kings last week.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg plans to skate for about 10 minutes on Thursday, his
first ice time since surgery for a torn tendon in his left foot on
Jan. 10. Forsberg was initially expected to be sidelined until at
least May 10, which will be the middle of the playoffs if the
Avalanche advances that far.</TE>
<TE>   After picking up defenseman Darius Kasparaitis from Pittsburgh in
the final hour before the league's trade deadline, Colorado appeared
ready to mount a staunch defense of its Stanley Cup championship. But
the Avalanche didn't look so tough being outscored by the Capitals,
Red Wings and Kings, 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   The Willie O'Ree All-Star youth weekend, in honor of the player
who broke the NHL's color barrier in 1958, is growing in attendance
in the seventh year of the event. More than 4,200 watched the
all-star game, which matched 10- to 12-year-olds picked from O'Ree's
Diversity Task Force programs across the country. The previous best
attendance was less than 1,000 for the event, which raises funds for
the diversity task force.</TE>

<HD>Connecticut Women Make the Game Fun</HD>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>There is symmetrical beauty about a basketball fastbreak. There are
angles to be negotiated, a choreography of five players, 10 feet, 10
hands, one basketball, all needing to travel 94 feet while moving
past five other players and their 10 feet and 10 hands. And the goal
is to put the basketball into the basket.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Connecticut women run the fastbreak better than
any college team right now. They ran one Monday night against Old
Dominion and the ball touched all five Huskies but never touched the
floor. The final pass came from point guard Sue Bird and was sent to
senior forward Asjha Jones and dropped, by Jones, sweetly off the
backboard and into the basket.</LD>
<LD>   It was as if Old Dominion had no defenders on the court. The
Huskies ran so smoothly you couldn't hear their feet touch the
ground. It was a single play in a first half of near perfection.</LD>
<TE>   The Connecticut women have made it to the Final Four. The Huskies
beat Old Dominion, 85-64, in the Mideast Regional final. This was
their 37th victory. They have not lost. There is pressure on these
women and so much hype.</TE>
<TE>   Since they lost in the NCAA semifinals a year ago, they have
universally been expected to win the national title. And yet, the
Huskies are having fun. They accept the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we play for," Bird said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Jones: "That's why you come to UConn."</TE>
<TE>   All five of their starters have been named first-, second- or
third-team All-American. Bird, a senior, was called by Old Dominion
Coach Wendy Larry, perhaps the best college female point guard ever.
"I thank God," Larry said Monday night after Bird had scored a
career-high 26 points and added 11 assists, "that there is a WNBA,
and I can watch her play at the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Domination can be numbingly boring in sports. Some have complained
that these Connecticut women have made the sport no fun. They are
winning games by an average of 37 points. Only one victory, 59-50,
over Virginia Tech, was not by a double-figure margin. Most games are
well over by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it's worth spending time watching Connecticut. Just as it
was fascinating to watch Pete Sampras when he was playing his best
tennis and winning Wimbledons, one after another, with hardly a
challenge, because it was beautiful to watch a superb athlete and
master of his sport who hit shots and played points as no others had
done, it is exhilarating to watch these Connecticut women play
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "That was so fun," guard Diana Taurasi said. "You know how cool it
feels to have things working exactly like you do them in practice?"</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies made 13 consecutive field goals to start the game, and
there were assists on 12 of them. The ball was barely touching the
floor. "The best thing," forward Tamika Williams said, "was that we
didn't have to hear coach's voice once." Auriemma is a screamer, a
jumper, a foot-stomper. For the first 20 minutes Monday night,
Auriemma didn't leave his seat. He sat back and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   A halftime lead of 55-33 will make a coach smile. The Huskies had
shot 75% from the field (21 of 28) and 62.5% from three-point range
(five for eight). "That first 20 minutes," Auriemma said, "was as
good as I hope to see a team play. I couldn't be prouder."</TE>
<TE>   The five starters were all high school stars. They came from
California (Chino's Taurasi) and New York (Bird), New Jersey (Jones)
and points in between (Swin Cash from Pennsylvania and Williams from
Ohio). They came to Connecticut and put aside their egos and put
forward their talents.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to pass first," Auriemma said. "That's really
special."</TE>
<TE>   The unselfishness is unusual in a group of stars. When high school
All-Americans gather, there are almost always petty jealousies. There
are friends and family who might want to know why Taurasi is taking
all those three-point shots or why Bird didn't get the ball to Cash
instead of Jones. That's how it is so often in men's college
basketball. There are too often AAU coaches and street agents,
fathers and brothers all whispering to the former high school star
that the star isn't getting enough.</TE>
<TE>   These women, though, have come to Connecticut to become better
players and to win basketball games and to get degrees. Auriemma has
to yell at Bird because she doesn't shoot enough.</TE>
<TE>   He will say, on a night when the opposing coach said his team was
"perfect" for 20 minutes, "that my team must be the only team in the
country that can't run the pick and roll. And why can't we get any
dribble penetration?"</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma was making a joke, right?</TE>
<TE>   No, he wasn't, and you knew immediately what the Huskies will be
working on in practice. And none of them will complain.</TE>
<TE>   It is that respect for the coach, and for the game, for learning
and improving, that has made the Connecticut's women's team more fun
to watch than any in college basketball right now.</TE>
<TE>   To see Taurasi throw a pass from her hip and imagine the strength
that takes and then to see her spot up and shoot a 24-foot
three-pointer and make it seem as easy as a layup; to see Bird
back-tip a missed shot, just softly, into the hands of Williams for a
layup, to understand what court sense Bird must have and what body
control Williams must have, watching these performances makes the
Huskies' opponents seem irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Connecticut in San Antonio will be Duke, Oklahoma and
Tennessee. Connecticut will play Pat Summitt's Lady Vols. It will be
a fine matchup, and if the Vols can stay within 10 points of the
Huskies, it will be impressive for Tennessee. It is hard to imagine
Connecticut losing.</TE>
<TE>   But it won't matter and will be good for the game if everyone else
watches and learns. Just as the Huskies did.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Angel reliever Minervino "Minnie" Rojas, whose 27 saves in
1967 led the American League and set a franchise record that stood
for 18 years, has died of complications of pneumonia. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Rojas, a Cuban, pitched for the Angels from 1966 to '68, saving 43
games. His career ended when he was paralyzed in an automobile
accident after the 1968 season. The accident killed his two
daughters, but his wife and son survived.</LD>
<LD>   Rojas' 43 saves rank seventh on the franchise list. His 1967 total
of 27 saves was not exceeded until Donnie Moore saved 31 games in
1985.</LD>

<LD>I go away on vacation for a week and come back to find Tim Leiweke
playing a shell game with the media about where the Anschutz Empire
is going to build a new football stadium.</LD>
<LD>   It seems pretty obvious to me. I'd put it in the parking lot that
has already been set aside for the USC sports arena--that's never
going to be built.</LD>
<LD>   Leiweke wants secrecy, and you can imagine how far reporters would
get trying to call USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett or President
Steven Sample for comment.</LD>
<TE>   No one seems to be getting much use out of the Belmont Learning
Complex, and it makes a lot more sense to have football fans exposed
to the methane gas and hydrogen sulfide for three hours once a week,
than students six hours every day.</TE>
<TE>   In fact I'm sure there are studies that will show this might
improve the quality of life for some football fans.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I would be pushing for Catalina and the wonderful fact
that there would be 26 miles of water separating the site of a
football stadium from Raider fans.</TE>
<TE>   Just consider the tailgating tradition that could be unique to
L.A., riding in a boat to the game alongside swimming Raider fans,
maybe stocking the local waters with a couple of great white sharks
to make it more interesting, or breeding Raider fan-loving piranha.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious place for a new stadium is Malibu, because those
people will be the only ones who can afford the tickets to the Taj
Mahal stadium that the architectural firm NBBJ is presently dreaming
up for Leiweke.</TE>
<TE>   Someone mentioned that the San Fernando Valley has lots of space
for a new football stadium and since NFL owners want to get as far
away from the Coliseum as possible, that might be a good idea. But
with secession looming we'd just lose another football team.</TE>
<TE>   A friend suggested The Playboy Mansion, figuring that would
guarantee sellouts. As a reporter, I figured I better go there and
study the layout. In fact I spent a lot of time there to make sure I
had the measurements correct.</TE>
<TE>   "We've also had the experience of hosting a number of sporting
events here like the Playmate Playoffs," said a spokesman, who wanted
to know if I was going to be there on behalf of the Anschutz Empire
to interview potential cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   Well, if Leiweke doesn't have to tell the truth all the time, why
should I?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I KNOW it is supposed to be some kind of big mystery what team we
will be getting (San Diego Chargers) and where this downtown stadium
will be located (I would think South Park, in the area of the
TransAmerica Center).</TE>
<TE>   And I guess I can understand why Staples Center-price gouger
Philip Anschutz would want to keep the location of his new stadium
secret until he ties up all the land at a cheap price because he's a
billionaire and he doesn't want to become just a millionaire.</TE>
<TE>   In fact I gave this some thought before guessing the stadium will
be built in South Park because I'm not sure I could sleep knowing I
might have contributed somehow to making Anschutz just a millionaire.</TE>
<TE>   But then I remembered what I paid for that last Diet Pepsi at
Staples Center, and I'd like to see this guy take care of his monthly
bills after a night out in his arena.</TE>
<TE>   And frankly I'm not sure it's really that big of a deal who knows
where the stadium is going to be built, because it was no secret when
we were going to get a new Coliseum, or a new stadium at Hollywood
Park, or a new stadium in Carson, and I don't recall any rush to buy
the surrounding land and get rich off a sports bar or restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   However, it has become some sort of game among local media,
politicians and businessmen--everyone trying to nail down what site
Leiweke has in mind.</TE>
<TE>   One reporter even took the novel approach of asking Leiweke
directly, and when Leiweke was asked what site he had in mind, he
mentioned two: "An area surrounding Dodger Stadium and an area around
the rail yards near Union Station in downtown."</TE>
<TE>   This is what I came back to Monday morning, Leiweke talking as if
no one was going to take notice that he was going out of his way to
provide misleading information. He mentions two sites, and yet he has
eight teams of experts analyzing and studying just one site, and I
know for a fact that site is not "an area surrounding Dodger
Stadium," and "an area around the rail yards near Union Station in
downtown."</TE>
<TE>   If Leiweke is going to try to steer people away from South Park, I
suggest he start spelling his name LIE-weke, and tell the truth.</TE>
<TE>   No one will believe it.</TE>
<TE>   A JUDGE last week ordered former baseball player Ken Caminiti to
speak to students about drugs as part of his sentence for cocaine
possession. Wouldn't it have made more sense if the judge had ordered
the guy with the drug problem to stay away from kids?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHIL MICKELSON five-putted in the Players Championship. I can only
remember taking four putts on any one green before picking up the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Jbeaubrummell:</TE>
<TE>   "I notice every time there is some big sporting event (i.e. NCAA
tournament) they send you on vacation. I guess it's sort of like
hiding the family embarrassment in the closet until the guests have
gone home."</TE>
<TE>   How do you explain them letting me out to cover the figure skating
championships?</TE>

<LD>Right-hander Jeff Gilmore is so consumed by pitching that he's almost
antisocial during games. He sits by himself in the dugout, building
intensity and determination with each inning.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander David Huff is so relaxed and laid back that he can
take a nap before a big game, wake up and be instantly focused. He's
an iceman who's never rattled.</LD>
<LD>   Together, they pitched Huntington Beach Edison High to the
Southern Section Division II championship last season. No high school
baseball team in Southern California has a better right-hander and
left-hander starting rotation.</LD>
<TE>   "They're pretty darn good," Coach Matt Mosiello said. "We all get
the feeling when either is on the mound, we're going to win. They
both compete their butts off."</TE>
<TE>   Huff, a 6-foot-2, 180-pound junior, is a control pitcher with a
devastating changeup. He walked 10 in 782/3 innings, finishing 9-2
with a 1.42 earned-run average last year.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore, a 6-2, 200-pound senior who has signed with Stanford, is
a power pitcher. He struck out 73 in 572/3 innings, finishing 8-2
with a 1.34 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Both should be equally dominant this season. The Chargers (7-2)
have given up 15 runs in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to know when I'm pitching, there's going to be a
team that has to battle," Gilmore said. "And when I'm sitting on the
bench, there's going to be a team that has to battle again because
they're facing David."</TE>
<TE>   They grew up playing in the same Huntington Beach Little League.
Gilmore suffered his only pitching loss as a 12-year-old--to Huff.</TE>
<TE>   Huff learned as an 11-year-old about the virtue of mixing up his
pitches after Gilmore hit one of his fastballs to the fence.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to overpower him," Huff said. "Pretty much ever
since, I've tried to spot my pitches inside and outside."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore is a walking, talking encyclopedia on the Titanic. He
started studying the ship's sinking when he was 6.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the number of survivors, the identity of the richest
passenger, the name of the captain, how many rivets it took to build
the ship.</TE>
<TE>   "It portrays a weakness of human nature, mostly arrogance," he
said of the ship. "It brought out the worst in human nature in that
people were so confident in themselves that they could build a ship
without enough lifeboats for everyone, and knew it."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore is more than a history buff. He studies to learn from the
past and prepare for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "What traits do the best men and women have and did they use their
talents to make a difference?" he said. "And how did the worst men
and women do that?</TE>
<TE>   "There's things you can do to start or stop the good or bad things
of human nature. There's great men who have done great things in
history and great men who were powerless to stop bad things, like the
chief architect for the Titanic, Thomas Andrews.</TE>
<TE>   "He was brilliant. He wanted a lifeboat for every person on board.
He didn't get it."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore is an A student who scored 1280 on his SAT. He's intense
in just about everything he does.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes a lot deeper than baseball," he said. "I think I'm going
to be president of the United States some day."</TE>
<TE>   And you want to believe him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's super smart," Mosiello said.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at Gilmore's reasoning for becoming a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a pretty ordinary kid going through Little League," he
said. "I was good at chess and liked to read a lot. Then one day I
realized God has given me a body of a pitcher and huge hands, so I'm
not going to sit around and play chess and read all day. I want to
use those things, so I started playing piano and pitching, and I've
loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Huff has a 3.3 grade-point average but has no obsessions other
than playing Ping-Pong.</TE>
<TE>   He throws a changeup that's patterned after that of Pedro Martinez
of the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "When I throw it, it tails away and down to right-handed batters,"
he said. "The arm action is the same, so it looks like a fastball."</TE>
<TE>   Huff and Gilmore are aided by senior catcher Cory Vanderhook, a
three-year starter who knows as much about handling pitchers as any
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He calls a great game," Gilmore said. "It's a game inside a game,
pitch by pitch, batter by batter, inning by inning. You have another
brain on the exact same wavelength as you, 60 feet 6 inches away."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore and Huff have refused to participate in the comparison
game.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never a sense of who's better," Gilmore said. "It was,
'We've got Gilmore on the mound, we have Huff on the mound, we have a
shot to win today.' It's a respect we have. When I'm in the dugout, I
know he's going to perform. When I'm on the mound, I know he's behind
me."</TE>
<TE>   Huff was the lucky one to pitch at Dodger Stadium in the Division
II final last season. It was his turn in the rotation. He shut out
Riverside Poly on two hits.</TE>
<TE>   "I did my usual thing, like it was a normal game," Huff said.</TE>
<TE>   Huff took home some dirt from Dodger Stadium. He put it in a water
bottle, which sits on a chest in his bedroom. He could get another
chance to pitch at Dodger Stadium this season. Or it could be
Gilmore.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care who's playing," Mosiello said. "We pitch whoever's
turn it is."</TE>

<HD>Mandatory Rule Is No Easy Answer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The easiest thing for the WTA Tour would be to make big-money
tournaments such as Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, S.C., and the
German Open in Berlin mandatory for players ranked in the top 20.</LD>
<LD>   Would it be the right thing?</LD>
<LD>   Not necessarily.</LD>
<TE>   After Venus and Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati and Amelie
Mauresmo declined to play the Indian Wells event earlier this month,
tournament director Charlie Pasarell and his business partner, Ray
Moore, were vocal in their criticism of the WTA.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest rule change needed in the game is the women,
the top women, maybe the top 25, whatever number, should be required
to play the top events," Moore said. "They're asking us to put up a
whole bunch of prize money, which we do.</TE>
<TE>   "We put up the second-highest prize money [$2.1 million] on the
ladies' tour. To have the top players playing in Dubai for $580,000
total prize money or $580,000 prize money in Scottsdale down the road
is, frankly, a slap in the face for us. But I hope it's going to be
corrected."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pasarell: "Ultimately, it's going to hurt them financially.
It's going to hurt the whole tour." Moore said then he thought the
issue would soon be on the agenda of the WTA's board. The board met
last week in Miami, but mandatory participation in certain events did
not come up.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was discussed about that at the board meeting," Kevin
Wulff, WTA chief executive officer, said. "Obviously, player
operations and commitments, we review on an on-going basis."</TE>
<TE>   One WTA official thought that a mandatory rule was not imminent
but added that by the end of the season there could be subtle changes
"to encourage participation."</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of the ATP may not be the answer. Monte Carlo,
on clay, is one of the nine required events but Pete Sampras, Andre
Agassi and Patrick Rafter bypassed it last season. Sampras and Agassi
skipped Paris, another of the mandatory nine, last year as well.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the other side of the "mandatory" coin. An injured
Marat Safin showed at Indian Wells and Miami last season, looking
like a pale imitation of himself, and failed to win a match.</TE>
<TE>   The WTA could find itself caught in a box if it started making
tournaments mandatory. Should Venus and Serena Williams be required
to play an event where they have previously felt uncomfortable? They
did not play Indian Wells after the family was booed last year during
Serena's final against Kim Clijsters. Earlier, Venus had withdrawn
about five minutes before a scheduled semifinal against Serena.</TE>
<TE>   And what would the WTA do with Monica Seles if one of the
tournaments in Germany became required? She has refused to play in
that country since being stabbed in Hamburg in 1993 and missed the
season-ending championships last fall in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   What if the Family Circle Cup event in Charleston became
mandatory? Should a player uncomfortable with the Confederate flag
issue be penalized for not playing?</TE>
<TE>   Which is why the WTA is not going to act prematurely. An official
said not getting the mandatory commitments remains a concern but that
the organization will study what the ATP has done. If a top ATP
player misses one of the required events he gets zero points for the
tournament and forfeits one-third of the bonus pool money he is
eligible for at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In Miami this week, the Williams sisters and Capriati are back on
the court. Lindsay Davenport, who had knee surgery in January, is out
for a few more months.</TE>
<TE>   Mauresmo, who has escaped most of the scrutiny on this issue, is
not playing, again. She has made only one appearance at Indian Wells
in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to Capriati believe she will play at Indian Wells next
year. Bob Kain, president of IMG, the management company, was asked
last week about Venus and Serena returning to Indian Wells and said,
"I don't know. It might take some time."</TE>
<TE>   IMG, a partner at Indian Wells, also represents Venus and Serena,
as well as Capriati and Davenport. Moore and Pasarell said that IMG
can't require their clients to play anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The end result is, the players in the women's game, they make
their own schedule," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   WTA Championships</TE>
<TE>   Details of the season-ending championship tournament at Staples
Center in November are still being worked out. The final could be
Nov. 11, but that depends on ESPN's programming and NBA schedule.</TE>
<TE>   One of the tasks Wulff had at the WTA board meeting last
Friday--before taking the vote to move the championships from Munich,
Germany, to Los Angeles--was trying to explain the operations of
Denver billionaire Phil Anschutz and one of his companies, Anschutz
Entertainment Group (AEG). Though deeply involved in many other
sports, Anschutz is relatively new to tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those pluses that's very difficult to explain to the
board," Wulff said. "Their reputation is spreading. Everyone knows
AEG brings a lot of value to the new relationship. We should be
unbelievably appreciative they've selected women's tennis to get
involved in. There's so many opportunities out there in sports and it
says a lot that AEG wants to get involved."</TE>

<LD>Pete Sampras' two-year slide reached another low Monday, when he lost
to Chilean qualifier Fernando Gonzalez, 7-6 (1), 6-1, in the third
round of the Nasdaq-100 Open at Key Biscayne, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The upset made it 24 tournaments in a row without a title for
Sampras since he won a record seventh Wimbledon championship in July
2000.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez, perhaps the hardest hitter on the men's tour, dominated
after falling behind, 4-1, in the first set. Sampras, often late
reaching volleys, won only 22 of 48 points at the net and struggled
with his service returns.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't a good day. I got outplayed," Sampras said. "I just
have to get back to work and not panic, and look at the big picture
and the rest of the year."</TE>
<TE>   In women's play, the Williams sisters moved within one round of a
semifinal showdown, which would be their first meeting since Venus
beat Serena in last year's U.S. Open final.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2-seeded Venus hit 26 winners to two for Amanda Coetzer and
won, 6-2, 6-0, in 44 minutes. No. 8 Serena swept Marissa Irvin, 6-1,
6-4.</TE>

<DL>BOISE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>Five years ago, Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale could offer recruits
little beyond a down-and-out program and a sparkling vision that was
more sunshine than substance.</LD>
<LD>   Stacey Dales and LaNeishea Caufield bought into it, and now
they're all going to the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   Caufield scored 25 points and Dales had 20 points and nine assists
as top-seeded Oklahoma rolled past No. 3 Colorado, 94-60, Monday
night in the West Regional final, sending the Sooners to San Antonio.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys bought into a vision. They bought what I was selling,"
said Coale, who went 5-22 in her first season as coach in 1996-97.
"And we're not finished. We've got a lot more work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Caufield shot five for five from three-point range in the second
half and scored 14 points during a 32-6 burst that guaranteed
Oklahoma (31-3) of becoming the first Big 12 team to reach the
women's Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Talbert and Rosalind Ross each scored 12 for Oklahoma, which
lost in the NCAA tournament's third round the previous two years.
Coale has won three straight Big 12 titles and now has the Final Four
she always believed she'd get.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm speechless," said Coale, in her sixth season. "I have thought
about this for six years, and I knew what I was going to say. Now, I
have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   In the final minute, Oklahoma fans chanted, "Final Four, Final
Four." Players put on their championship T-shirts and hats as
Colorado's Virginie Delepine shot free throws at the other end of the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to be going to the Final Four," Dales said. "I'm
savoring tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma will play Duke in Friday's national semifinals. The Blue
Devils advanced by winning the East Regional, 77-68 over South
Carolina.</TE>

<AU>PATRICK MOORE</AU>
<BD>Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, is president
of Greenspirit, an environmental consultant to government and
industry.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has become a principle of the environmental movement to insist
that wood and paper products be certified as originating from
sustained, managed forests. Movement members even created their own
organization, the Forest Stewardship Council, to make the rules and
hand out the certificates.</LD>
<LD>   Lord help those who don't fall in line, as big-box retailers and
builders discovered when Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network
became their judge and jury--hanging corporate reputations from the
rafters with the TV cameras rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Many corporations felt compelled to accept restrictive buying
policies for wood and paper products to demonstrate loyalty to the
cause. This appears politically correct on the surface. Yet, as with
so many environmental issues, it's not that simple, and the result
may damage the environment rather than improve it.</LD>
<TE>   The environmental movement's campaign to force industry into
accepting it as the only judge of sustainable forestry is pushing
consumers away from renewable forest products and toward
nonrenewable, energy-intensive materials such as steel, concrete and
plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-forestry groups such as the Sierra Club and Greenpeace make
endless and unreasonable demands restricting forestry practices. This
is mainly why the Forest Stewardship Council has certified less than
2% of the wood and paper produced in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the same environmental groups won't acknowledge that
some regions--such as California--already comply with government
regulations that meet or exceed guidelines imposed by the Forest
Stewardship Council.</TE>
<TE>   Wood is the most renewable and sustainable of the major building
materials. On all measures comparing the environmental effects of
common building materials, wood has the least impact on total energy
use, greenhouse gases, air and water pollution and solid waste.</TE>
<TE>   So why isn't the environmental movement demanding that the steel
and concrete industries submit to an audit for "sustainability"?
Where's the green steel, concrete and plastic? These materials are
nonrenewable, require vast amounts of energy to manufacture and
recycle and are contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't steel and concrete manufacturers be required to
reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions or face
boycotts, demonstrations and restrictions? Why does the environmental
movement stand silent in the face of promotional campaigns by steel
and concrete interests that leverage mythical environmental claims
against wood for their own commercial benefit?</TE>
<TE>   Because emotive images of forests sell memberships.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental movement has unfortunately led the public into
believing that when people use wood, they cause the loss of forests.
This widespread guilt is misplaced. North America's forests are not
disappearing. In fact, there is about the same amount of forest cover
today as there was 100 years ago, even though we consume more wood
per capita than any other region in the world. Isn't this proof
positive that forests are renewable and sustainable?</TE>
<TE>   When we buy wood, we are sending a signal to plant more trees to
satisfy demand. If there were no demand for wood, landowners would
clear away the forest and grow something else instead.</TE>
<TE>   We have powerful tools at our disposal to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions and the threat of climate change. Grow more trees, and then
use more wood as a substitute for materials like steel and concrete
that are responsible for excessive emissions in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   If the environmental movement would recognize this one fact, it
would turn its anti-forestry policy on its head and redirect
membership dollars to where they are most needed--promoting sound
environmental choices.</TE>

<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of the problem with priestly pedophilia, says Vatican spokesman
Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, is the current "environment of
pansexuality."</LD>
<LD>   Now there's a word to look up. According to Merriam-Webster, it
means "exhibiting or implying many forms of sexual expression." That
sounds like a pretty good description of today's culture. Of course,
"society made me do it" is not an excuse for having sex with
children.</LD>
<LD>   But if even the Catholic Church--which normally prides itself on
fidelity to time-honored values--is searching for new explanations
for its sexual problems, then maybe it's time to look to an old
solution.</LD>
<TE>   Pansexuality, of course, is not new.</TE>
<TE>   In ancient Babylon, it was the religion. Herodotus, the first
historian, wrote that in 5th century BC Mesopotamia, "every woman
born in the country must once in her life go and sit down in the
temple of love, and there consort with a stranger." According to
ritual, the woman "goes with the first man who throws her money, and
rejects no one. When she has gone with him, and so satisfied the
goddess, she returns home."</TE>
<TE>   Herodotus adds that "a custom very much like this is found also in
certain parts of the island of Cyprus."</TE>
<TE>   Such customs no doubt have their appeal to some, but it's
difficult to imagine a stable society being built around
institutionalized debauchery.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Christianity represented a backlash against pagan
pansexuality. Jesus lived a celibate life, and he was born of a
virgin mother. As he preaches in Luke, there is no marriage in
heaven. And since the early Christians, notably St. Paul, believed
that the second coming of Christ was nigh, celibacy was much praised
all through the New Testament.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as Christianity matured, an older biblical injunction--"be
fruitful and multiply"--reasserted itself.</TE>
<TE>   One of the problems the medieval church faced was that the fruit
of priestly loins was multiplying too much. Clerical children were
secularizing church lands through inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   That concern helped push the 11th century church back toward
celibacy.</TE>
<TE>   At about that time, the Eastern Orthodox church broke off,
developing a two-tier system, allowing priests to marry while
reserving celibacy for bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that higher orders of people would be celibate is a
consistent theme through most philosophies. As Aristotle said, we
most admire that which is hard to do.</TE>
<TE>   Yet to be admirable, celibacy must be sustainable. And yet if
pansexuality is so rampant that even Catholic priests are led into
temptation, then something has to change.</TE>
<TE>   So here's a modest proposal. Bring back the one tried-and-true
guarantee of celibacy: castration.</TE>
<TE>   The practice was once common--and not just for harem-keepers and
choirboys--because it reliably helped men focus on their mission,
whatever that might be.</TE>
<TE>   Today, modern medicine offers castration through chemistry, and
that condition, unlike surgery, is reversible.</TE>
<TE>   While the modern mind might find even voluntary, temporary
castration to be repulsive, surely pedophilia is more repulsive. And
if, as Cardinal Castrillon said, we live in a pansexual world in
which the erotic is expressed in everything, then perhaps those
wondering how to safeguard children might look to the wisdom of the
ages for an answer.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is for sure: Given the immensity of this scandal, mere
assurances that the old "honor system" of celibacy can be made to
work again will not be acceptable. If the church wishes to regain its
position of trust, it might consider what it is willing to give up.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a long time now, we secular humanists and other skeptics have
been denigrated as the apostles of decadence and social decay. A
rowdy parade of right-wing pundits has used those of us who refuse to
wear our religion on our sleeves as scapegoats for all that ails the
United States and the world.</LD>
<LD>   What apparently defines us "nonbelievers" in the minds of
right-wing talk show hosts, the Christian right, pompous czars of
virtue such as Bill Bennett and the arts censors of the Catholic
Church is that we have abandoned religious certainty--the rights and
wrongs that ensure passage to heaven or hell--for a grayer area of
moral relativism in which we have to decide for ourselves what is
proper behavior. The assumption is that our decisions, as opposed to
those of true believers, inevitably will be hedonistic and most
likely perverse.</LD>
<LD>   Let me confess that I do not conduct my life with a constant eye
on the literal truths of Scripture because they seem often
contradictory and at times downright immoral.</LD>
<TE>   For example, the proper procedure for branding one's slaves
discussed in the Old Testament and the equally forceful condemnation
of eating crustaceans and lying with the same sex all seem provincial
when not primitively cruel.</TE>
<TE>   And the notion related each year at Passover of God's killing the
firstborn of Egyptians smacks of primitive animal revenge. Sorry, but
the Talmudic explanations and harsh rules of the rabbis in my
mother's family tree work only as interesting tribal lore.</TE>
<TE>   As to my father's Lutheran relatives, most of whom still live in
Germany, they would be the first to tell you that during World War II
their fascist pastor appearing in his Nazi uniform was hardly a
stalwart in the battle against genocide. As the child of European
immigrants, I spent the first 10 years of my life confronting the
horror that my father's relatives were drafted to massacre my
mother's people because of their religion.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in such moral ambiguity, I came to be attracted to the
sermons on a New York radio station broadcast by something called the
Society for Ethical Culture. The message, similar to that of
Unitarians, deists and some of the "New Age" and Eastern religions,
was that life's creation remains a mystery and therefore morality, in
any mechanically simple way, cannot be derived from ancient texts or
assumptions about the rewards and fears associated with an afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we are left--as in the writings of such deists as Thomas
Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine--to sort out decent
moral principles from the welter of human experience, including that
of all religions.</TE>
<TE>   Never a fully satisfying exercise, I know, compared with the moral
certainties expounded by those who claim a direct link with an
almighty power.</TE>
<TE>   In my section of the Bronx, the Catholic Church, with its
magnificent structures and frightening crypts, expressed that
authority in its most intimidating form. There were many times when I
envied the moral clarity of those priests as they tended their flocks
of young believers, incessantly preaching the demands of sexual
purity.</TE>
<TE>   Even nonbelievers in my crowd would shun sex, autoerotic or
otherwise, before taking a major academic test for fear of weakening
the brain, such was the ancillary influence of the church in matters
sexual.</TE>
<TE>   How then to explain that for a significant number of priests, the
fear not merely of failing a college midterm but rather of spending
an eternity in hell did not still their sexual impulses?</TE>
<TE>   What we have learned from recent headlines and from the exposure
of similar transgressions by fundamentalist Protestant and Jewish
leaders is that "traditional values" are not necessarily best upheld
by traditional institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Repetition of divine commandments is an insufficient guarantee of
exemplary behavior, and blind allegiance to the leadership cadre and
moral cant of any church can be quite dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The imperative to question the words and actions of religious
figures of authority should, of course, be applied to all
associations-- whether political, academic, social or
cultural--including those populated by secular humanists. The record
of the Catholic Church is likely no more hypocritical than that of
other institutions claiming to inspire behavior that rises far above
that demanded by the animalist dictates of survival of the fittest.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it is up to us as individuals to figure out what makes
us human and then to act accordingly.</TE>

<AU>MOHAMMAD A. TARBUSH</AU>
<BD>Mohammad A. Tarbush, a Palestinian, is a banker and
writer on current affairs based in Geneva.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The so-called Prince Abdullah plan--which would offer Israel
normalization of relations with the Arab world in return for
withdrawal from all the lands Israel seized during the 1967 Middle
East War--contains a number of positive proposals for solving the
Israeli-Palestinian problem. But it is far from being comprehensive.
And it omits any reference to those who should be held responsible
for this tragic conflict.</LD>
<LD>   What has befallen the Holy Land and its people for more than 50
years now is not a natural disaster. It was man-made. Governments and
individuals who caused it should be made to pay the price. Any plan
that does not designate responsibility is like a judge trying to
determine an appropriate sentence without knowing who is on trial.</LD>
<LD>   In the West, the history of the Palestinian debacle has been
grossly and maliciously distorted. Impartial analysis would show wide
responsibility for the Palestinian dispossession, including:</LD>
<TE>   * Britain, which, through the Balfour Declaration of 1917 pledged
the establishment of a Jewish homeland to Jews on the land of a third
party, the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   * Germany, whose criminal persecution of Jews created a suitable
environment for Zionism to flourish and indirectly gave life to the
anachronistic Zionist idea that Judaism is a nationality as well as a
religion.</TE>
<TE>   After the state of Israel was created, Germany became one of its
principal suppliers of financial and military aid.</TE>
<TE>   * Russia, where notorious pogroms of the Jews were another cause
for the emergence of Zionism.</TE>
<TE>   * France, which in the 1940s promoted illegal Jewish immigration
into Palestine and later Israel and provided Israel with a nuclear
capability.</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S., which granted unconditional military, political and
economic support to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   * European and American liberal intellectuals, who confused their
sympathy for the plight of Jews with support of Zionism, when Jews
constituted only 5% of the population and owned 7% of the land.</TE>
<TE>   A typical popular reference on the Palestinian problem was
"Exodus," a novel that portrays Palestine as a "stinking and
sun-baked ... worthless desert in the south end and eroded in the
middle and swamp up north" sparsely populated with bands of Bedouin
thieves and listless men who "sat or lay around on the ground as
their wives tilled the fields."</TE>
<TE>   * Israel, which through international manipulation and violence on
the ground deleted a whole country, confiscated the assets of its
population--houses, farms, cattle, furniture--and rendered its
inhabitants refugees or under military occupation.</TE>
<TE>   * The Arab countries, whose potential force gave credence to
Israeli propaganda that portrayed Israel as a weak nation surrounded
by a sea of powerful and hostile Arabs, when Arab support to the
Palestinian people in most cases was little more than rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The new order that the U.S. promised in the early 1990s still
could work. It needs to be reinvigorated with a heavy dose of equity
and oblige Israel to respect international legality and withdraw from
the occupied territories.</TE>
<TE>   It also would uphold the right of refugees to return to their
homes, and it would reject a violation of that basic principle on
flimsy grounds, such as the impact of their return on the Jewish
character of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In a fairer world, it would be reasonable to expect those
responsible for the Palestinian tragedy to pool together a serious
financial package to help the Palestinian people rebuild their
shattered country and institutions and write their history.</TE>
<TE>   Then, out of the ashes of lies and distortions, the truth might
finally rise showing that the crime the Palestinian people committed
over the past century was the one of existing on a land that was
coveted by others.</TE>

<LD>Things must be really tough in the men's magazine circulation
business these days. Scantily clad females have been a perennial
sales tool, starting with ancient Greek sculptors and moving down
through even modern sports magazines. But today with advertising off
and society more R-rated in general, the circulation-boosting ability
of partially dressed starlets who profess a passion for snorkeling,
for watching football while eating snack foods and for strong men
who'll never relinquish the TV remote is no guarantee anymore of
moving expensive glossy men's mags off the rack. There are only so
many clothes one person can remove, no matter how desperately she
seeks fame. So how can fully dressed magazine editors eager to keep
their jobs boost single- copy sales and maybe reap some new
subscribers?</LD>
<LD>   Well, Americans love lists. They're an evergreen attention-getter:
8 Creative Things to Do With Once-Hidden Easter Eggs. Any listing of
the Top 10 Movies, 15 Handsomest Hunks, 15 Sexiest Women, 20 Best
Retirement Communities, 30 Richest Americans, Top 40 Songs, 50 Most
Powerful Hollywood Honchos, 60 Best Places to Live and 101 Ways to
Drive Your Man Wild would make quite a list itself.</LD>
<TE>   Such a list gives its creators a brief flash of self-serving
national publicity, even if it's the 10 Dirtiest Rivers or 12
Deadliest Intersections. The important thing in compiling such lists
is ensuring that the criteria be sufficiently vague to prevent
verification or credible dispute.</TE>
<TE>   So for its April edition this one men's magazine named the
Greatest City on Earth. So far, so good, as long as the winner be in
the North American circulation area, not be Keokuk and contain the
young male demographics that advertisers desire. Which, surprise of
surprises, is what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the clever marketing twist that got the magazine's editors
maximum publicity: They named 13 different cities as THE Greatest
City. They wrote totally fatuous articles about how great are New
York and Detroit, Philadelphia and Toronto etc. as if each was the
winner and shipped those versions to the respective cities. Then to
ensure their promotional duplicity was discovered, they "mistakenly"
shipped the New York copies to Philadelphia, which regards itself as
a rival of the Big Apple. Surely, this is a finalist on any list of
Shamelessly Cynical Journalism Ploys.</TE>
<TE>   So to honor this achievement we've decided to pick that monthly
men's publication as the Worst Single Magazine of the Week. But
because the magazine editors are no doubt really, really embarrassed
by their Greatest City "mistake," we're not going to mention their
publication's name. It's the least we can do for such an important
contribution to American journalism. Oh, and the copies of this
editorial in New York will say the same things as the copies in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>North Korea's Last Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>North Korea has one last chance to talk seriously with a South Korean
government that is offering generous assistance in exchange for
reduced tensions along the heavily militarized border. If the talks
set for next week in Pyongyang do not make progress, elections in
South Korea later this year could bring to power politicians who
would rather let the economically ravaged North collapse. It looks
like a simple choice, but North Korea has proven adept at making
irrational decisions.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea's domestic policy has been consistent for decades: all
repression, all the time. But its foreign policy is more erratic.
From its 1950 invasion that launched the Korean War until the late
1990s, it was an implacable enemy of South Korea and its allies,
including the United States. When it had to confront the collapse of
communism around the globe and starvation at home, it opened the door
a bit. South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung journeyed to Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, in June 2000 and was followed months later
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Then things slid
backward.</LD>
<TE>   North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has not made the promised
reciprocal trip south, reunions of war-divided families have not been
held for more than a year and the International Atomic Energy Agency
has not been able to visit all the sites suspected of being used for
nuclear weapons production in the North. President Bush included the
North in his "axis of evil" in the State of the Union speech.</TE>
<TE>   However, in his visit last month to South Korea, where 37,000
troops are stationed, Bush said the U.S. goal on the Korean peninsula
was peace. That is also the goal of Kim Dae Jung, who won the 2000
Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end tensions. But term limits
will push him out of office this year, and North Korean recalcitrance
has angered South Koreans, who may well elect a president far less
sympathetic to Pyongyang. It is in North Korea's own interest to
encourage income-producing tourism from the South. It is in U.S. and
South Korean interests for the North to pull its soldiers back from
the border.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, Japan and South Korea have given North Korea
billions of dollars in food aid and fuel oil. Reciprocity by
Pyongyang in halting rocket development, allowing weapons inspectors
into the country, resuming family reunions and arranging a
presidential visit south is long overdue. If Kim Jong Il rejects the
chance offered by next week's talks, he and his suffering nation may
not get another for a long time.</TE>

<LD>Ranchers, home builders and others in favor of pell-mell development
are blasting away at the federal Endangered Species Act like hunters
on a rampage through a zoo. And the people whom President Bush
appointed to defend the act are either cowering or cheering them on.</LD>
<LD>   The act is supposed to protect the sort of "critical habitat" that
gives species at risk of extinction a place to recover. The Clinton
administration, during its last six years, protected scores of such
places covering millions of acres, largely to comply with legal
rulings from lawsuits that environmental groups brought to compel the
government to act. The Bush administration, conversely, is
negotiating settlements--most of which give developers whatever they
want.</LD>
<LD>   Their ability to do this stems from a dubious ruling by the 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals in a New Mexico case involving 600 miles of
river and stream habitat. Environmentalists wanted it set aside so
that a bird called the willow flycatcher might have a chance to
survive. The court's explanation for scrapping the plan was that the
government had not adequately considered the impact on local economic
interests, mostly farmers and cattle growers. Now the Bush
administration is using that dubious decision as a basis for undoing
habitat designations in other areas, even though the ruling has no
legal sway outside the six-state circuit.</LD>
<TE>   The designation of critical habitat requires a more rigorous
review of projects, but does not, as developers would lead us to
believe, make it impossible to build. The act does require the
government to consider economics. But environmental groups' legal
experts argue that the 10th Circuit Court carried that provision too
far. They have a point. After all, the law also states that economic
impact cannot be considered at all in decisions to put species on the
endangered list.</TE>
<TE>   There may be areas where the economic studies were inadequate. If
so, the courts can and should order new ones, as they do with
environmental impact studies. Fortunately it's still illegal to
disturb endangered species. But it would be reckless and contrary to
the spirit of the act to simply chuck a habitat designation and fling
endangered animals' homes open to development while a revised study
is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   That's just what happened to 19 species of salmon and steelhead in
California and the Northwest. The agreement between home builders and
the National Marine Fisheries Service simply dissolved the critical
habitat established to protect these fish--which are economically
significant themselves, the Bush administration might note.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the government's fishy action still must be approved
by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in the District of
Columbia. We urge her to give these creatures the protection that
Congress intended by rejecting the agreement and keeping the habitat
in place until a new impact study can be conducted.</TE>

<LD>Re " 'Beautiful' Historic Night," March 25: It was the best historic
annual Academy Awards that I have ever witnessed in 40 years, in that
the event was both educational and inspirational. It was a joy to
know that the color barrier was broken as two African Americans won
top acting honors. Hopefully, this will have a very strong impact on
the rest of the world. It is wonderful to observe that so many
African American actors have kept the faith and persevered, even
though they did not receive these types of awards in the past.</LD>

<TE>   It was ironic that Whoopi Goldberg was the emcee on the night that
the color barrier was broken for African American actresses. Anyone
who remembers her performance in "The Color Purple" would agree that
she should have had that distinction.</TE>

<TE>   Am I the only one who finds it ironic that the only one who didn't
win for "A Beautiful Mind" was Russell Crowe? Silly me; I thought the
only criterion was that you had to be the best actor in a movie. What
do I know?</TE>

<TE>   The Academy Awards hit a high point in awarding Sidney Poitier a
lifetime achievement award, and in his eloquent thanking of numerous
white people for making it possible for him to reach his goals.</TE>
<TE>   The low point came as a result of no mention being made about the
nation's turning to God for solace. Equally disappointing was Robert
Redford's failure, in discussing his Sundance Institute, to call for
healthier movies of uplifting, hopeful themes, instead of more crime,
violence, sex and drugs. Yea, verily, Hollywood, in spite of 9/11, is
still Tinsel Town.</TE>

<TE>   Leave it to Michael Ramirez to fire his typically uninformed cheap
shots, this time at the Academy Awards (March 24). His lame swipe at
the Oscars as misdirected hero worship arrived in time to reveal him
thumbing his nose at Sidney Poitier, Halle Berry and Denzel
Washington--all three of whom have made significant and positive
strides for African Americans working in the film industry.</TE>
<TE>   Whoopi Goldberg paid tribute to the heroes of 9/11 in her
inimitable fashion (so much for Ramirez's assertion that the heroes
would be forgotten). Arthur Hiller and Robert Redford were saluted
for humanitarianism and championing new and independent artists,
respectively. Ramirez saw fit to fling mud at all of this in one of
his tedious, self-righteous snits.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Team Drops Privacy Rule for Patients' Records," March 22:
Campaign finance reform arrived too late to prevent the
administration's frontal assault on patients' rights. As head of an
organization that has worked hard and long to secure the privacy of
patients' medical records it is disconcerting to see the health-care
industry able to work behind the scenes to effect this monumental
intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship--the foundation of all
health care. The rationalizations being offered to justify this
affront declare, in essence, that it was necessary to destroy
patients' privacy in order to save it.</LD>

<LD>"States' Rights at Heart of Oregon Suicide Lawsuit" (March 23) seems
to be a no-brainer. The U.S. Constitution specifically states in its
10th Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
states, respectively, or to the people." There is nothing in the
Constitution delegating the U.S. government the power to regulate
medical practices, nor are there any restrictions upon the states
from doing so. Thus, that power is "reserved to the states . . . or
to the people." Case closed!</LD>

<LD>Re "Chavez-Columbus Debate No Holiday for Council," March 21: As an
Italian American I am offended and incensed by the Los Angeles City
Council's vote to allow thousands of city employees to legally
observe Cesar Chavez Day as a paid holiday and, in exchange,
eliminate the observance of Columbus Day in October.</LD>
<LD>   City Administrative Officer William Fujioka negotiated with the
employee unions to bring this unfair and insulting issue before the
City Council without any consideration for the feelings of all
Italians in Los Angeles. Like it or not, we are an integral part of
the Los Angeles culture.</LD>
<LD>   Fujioka said he tried to convince the unions to agree to use their
floating holiday for the Chavez day, which they rejected. I guess
this proves that it really is the unions that run City Hall and not
the people we elected to office.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If L.A. City Council members think we have too many holidays, why
not combine Veterans Day with Memorial Day into one holiday
celebrated in May? These two holidays are both to honor war veterans,
so they could be combined without snubbing anyone. And since November
already has the two-day Thanksgiving holiday, the decommissioning of
Veterans Day would not be too sorely missed.</TE>
<TE>   All we need now are holidays in April, June and August and we'll
have a holiday each month!</TE>

<LD>The OPEC countries make a decision to cut production or raise the
price of crude and it is almost instantly reflected in the price for
gasoline we pay at the pump. Why? The gas we are pumping was
purchased weeks ago at the much lower price. The higher-priced
gasoline won't actually arrive at the local retailers for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that every time a refinery is shut down for repairs or
OPEC raises the price of crude or cuts production it is a windfall
profit for the gasoline retailers, who immediately raise their
prices. It is outrageous profiteering at the expense of people who
can't do without their automobiles, at best, and antitrust price
fixing at worst.</LD>

<TE>   There is a public service announcement on TV that asks the
question, "Where do terrorists get the money to fund their
activities?" And answers, "Your drug purchases." Following the money
trail of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, et al., we know that answer is
wrong. The correct answer: "Your oil and gasoline purchases." This
reality makes it hard to stomach all those wasteful, gas-guzzling
SUVs out there displaying American flags and patriotic bumper
stickers.</TE>

Peres and Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, the bombers and the assassins went
on because they do not want peace. What they want is only for Israel
to be destroyed.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Hope Amid the Wreckage,'' editorial, March 21: Your editorial
on the "hope" that the frightful toll of death and destruction on
both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict makes a negotiated
peace a possibility is most welcome. It will be possible if Saudi
Arabia, the United States and the United Nations remain committed to
a truce that time and new leadership from today's younger generation
can bring about.</TE>
<TE>   For Israel, security rests in keeping the Judean Hills within the
"land for peace" transfers necessary to make the Palestinian Arabs'
dream of independence a reality.</TE>
<TE>   New leadership must educate the young in the benefits of people
living in harmony--and the fact that such a hope can be found in the
holy writings of both peoples.</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs must also shut down the refugee hovels from the past 50
years and build fresh-start homes in the land they will hold in the
West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Together, religious ideals must encompass the democratic ideals of
self-government and relationships between governments if peace is to
hold, and the economy for both peoples must rise to a level where
hungry stomachs are fed and hate cannot fester.</TE>
<TE>   Hyman H. Haves</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So once again the Israelis ceased and the Palestinians continue to
fire; terrorists have murdered a dozen Israeli civilians in the past
two days and wounded over a hundred others.</TE>
<TE>   When will the world community finally realize that maybe a "peace
process" can't begin until all the terrorists are dead or in jail,
the Palestinians stop teaching hatred of Jews and a new leadership
has replaced Arafat's terrorist dictatorship?</TE>
<TE>   David Schechter</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After 35 years of Israeli "occupation" and the combined denial by
both the United States and Israel of human rights violations against
Palestinian Arabs, the conditions for "terrorism" remain intact and
are the primary elements impeding the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Until the conditions that Palestinians are forced to live under
are changed and Israel is forced to comply with the fourth Geneva
Convention--under international law Israel cannot "annex" Gaza, the
West Bank and Jerusalem--there will be no peace.</TE>
<TE>   When the ancient God claims of old Israel are advanced for land
ownership and are used to supersede international law and United
Nations intervention, then the Palestinians have every right to seek
whatever military protections are available to resist being forced
under "Jewish" law.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has not remained impartial and continues to fund
a diplomatic position that stands in the way of peace and has become
impotent.</TE>
<TE>   When policy considerations change that reflect an acknowledgment
of Israeli bias, only then will a true peace be obtainable that the
Palestinians can adhere to.</TE>

<HD>Jim Benson, 75; Ran Major Ad Campaigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Benson, a retired Los Angeles advertising agency creative
director who led numerous national accounts including Pennzoil motor
oil, Giorgio fragrances and Cooper tires during a 42-year career, has
died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Benson died of a heart attack March 15 at his Valencia home.</LD>
<LD>   Benson retired as executive vice president and creative director
of the former Eisaman, Johns and Laws advertising agency in 1992
after 34 years.</LD>
<TE>   The agency, which was founded in 1948 and sold to George Lois Inc.
of New York City in 1996, was one of the few advertising agencies
headquartered in Los Angeles that had successfully grown from west to
east.</TE>
<TE>   Benson led teams that turned Kahlua into the No. 1 selling liqueur
and Pennzoil into the No. 1 selling motor oil. Pennzoil's tag lines
were "the asked for motor oil" and "Pennzoil--since America learned
to drive." He established the spokesman relationship with golfer
Arnold Palmer that Pennzoil continues today.</TE>
<TE>   Benson also headed the Cooper tires account ("The tire with two
names. Cooper. And the name of the man who built it.") And his
creative team initiated the first ad campaign on behalf of the
Southern California Chevrolet Dealers Advertising Assn., coining the
tag line, "Look out for No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   In a volatile industry where clients come and go, former agency
Chairman Joe Eisaman said Benson helped the agency set standards for
holding accounts: Pennzoil for 37 years and Cooper tires, Kahlua and
the Chevrolet dealer ad groups for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was remarkable in the way he was able to communicate with
people, to help people, to educate people, to get the best work from
people and get the best work done for the clients," Eisaman said.
"That's a remarkable and admirable quality in any person, at any
level, in any business. That, I think, was a very great contribution
of Jim Benson."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good, solid conceptualist and his work maintained
longevity," said Sharon Benoit, former managing editor of Adweek. "He
was able to keep his clients creatively happy for years and years."</TE>
<TE>   Benson was a founding member of the Los Angeles Creative Club, an
advertising industry organization.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in North Branch, Minn., and moved to California in
1937. He served in the Navy during World War II and graduated from
UCLA with a bachelor's degree in applied arts in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Elaine, daughters Julie Benson
Krumrine and Robin Benson, two grandsons, a sister, and two brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial contributions may be made to the Jim Benson Memorial
Building Fund at Christ Lutheran Church, 25816 N. Tournament Road,
Valencia, CA 91355.</TE>

<HD>James Blake, 89; Driver Had Rosa Parks Arrested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James F. Blake, the Montgomery, Ala., bus driver who had Rosa Parks
arrested in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat to a white
passenger, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Blake died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in Montgomery.
He had been in failing health for some time.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of Parks for violating Montgomery's segregation laws
was a galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement.</LD>
<TE>   It thrust a young Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. into the national
spotlight and fueled his 381-day Montgomery bus boycott. The U.S.
Supreme Court later declared that Alabama's bus segregation law was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's encounter with history came in the late afternoon on the
first day of December. Parks, a seamstress, boarded his bus for her
ride home from work.</TE>
<TE>   According to Taylor Branch's account of the incident in his
authoritative history of the civil rights era, "Parting the Waters:
America in the King Years, 1954-63," the bus was crowded.</TE>
<TE>   After the bus filled up, Blake noticed a white passenger standing
just inside the entrance. He called back to Parks and three other
black passengers sitting just behind the white section, ordering them
to give up their seats and move to the back.</TE>
<TE>   Although only one white needed a seat, all four blacks were
required to move because the segregation statutes also stated that it
was illegal for any black to sit in the same row as a white on a city
bus.</TE>
<TE>   When none of the four blacks moved, Blake walked back and again
asked them to move.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd better make it light on yourselves and let me have those
seats," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the passengers moved, but Parks refused, saying she was
not seated in the white section of the bus and didn't think she
should have to move. She remained seated even when Blake, invoking
Montgomery's Jim Crow laws, threatened to have her arrested. Blake
got off the bus to call his supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "I called the company first, just like I was supposed to do,"
Blake recalled in a later interview with the Washington Post. "I got
my supervisor on the line. He said, 'Did you warn her, Jim?' I said,
'I warned her.' And he said, and I remember it just like I'm standing
here, 'Well then, Jim, you do it, you got to exercise your powers and
put her off, hear?' And that's just what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, Montgomery police officers arrived to take Parks
to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Blake maintained that he was merely a city
employee doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to do anything to that Parks woman except do my
job," Blake told the Post. "She was in violation of the city codes.
What was I supposed to do? That damn bus was full and she wouldn't
move back. I had my orders. I had police powers--any driver for the
city did. So the bus filled up and a white man got on, and she had
his seat and I told her to move back, and she wouldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Parks was taken to jail and released after friends posted a $100
bail. She was ultimately fined $14--$10 for the offense and $4 for
court costs.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting between Parks and Blake on that historic day was not
their first encounter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, Parks was made to get off a city bus after she put in her
fare and was told to re-board through the rear door. Before she could
do so, the bus roared off, leaving her at the curb. It was driven by
Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Blake retired from the Montgomery City Lines in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   An obituary Saturday in the Montgomery Advertiser noted that Blake
had joined the Morningview Baptist Church in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Blake was a kind and gracious man, always had a smile on his
face and always loved everybody," said Kem Holley, the children's
pastor at Morningview.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that a lot of people make a big deal out of [Parks'
arrest], but Mr. Blake grew with the times, and he loved everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The obituary also noted that Parks had offered her condolences to
the Blake family through the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for
Self-Development in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "[I'm] sure his family will miss him," Parks was reported to have
said in the message.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified District Receives Slight Credit Downgrade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major Wall Street rating service slightly downgraded the credit
worthiness of the Los Angeles city schools Monday, citing several
factors, including budget slashing and salary negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch Ratings retained the school district's high AA rating, but
changed its outlook from stable to negative.</LD>
<LD>   The negative assessment was meant as a warning to Los Angeles
Unified and its investors, said Jeffrey Burger, of Fitch's public
finance department.</LD>
<TE>   Fitch could issue another warning, or downgrade the L.A. Unified's
bond rating, if the district's financial outlook does not improve, he
said. That could happen as early as this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Chief financial officer Joe Zeronian said a downgrading could cost
the district .05% on the money it borrows. But because the rate did
not change, there should be no effect on the $850,000 in new bonds
the district is floating this week.</TE>
<TE>   Fitch said it did not lower the district's high rating because it
has a diversified economic base and moderate debt. However, it said
the district still must secure financing for a large portion of its
school building program and is also facing its second year of budget
cutting because of salary increases in excess of cost-of-living
adjustments and reduced state aid.</TE>
<TE>   Burger said the rating agency will continue to monitor the
district's finances, paying special attention to the outcome of labor
negotiations with the teachers union and of two new school
construction bonds that will be presented to voters--one locally and
another for campuses statewide--in November.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana, Hoping to Change Its Image, Is Promoting New
Slogan</HD>
<DH>Marketing: City will use the tagline 'The Spirit of Change'
in an effort to attract more visitors and businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana, the most populous city in Orange County, has an identity
problem, and the Chamber of Commerce wants to do something about it.</LD>
<LD>   It is one of the safest cities of its size in the country, but
chamber officials say it is stereotyped as plagued by gangs and
crime. And with a population that is 76% Latino, Santa Ana is viewed
as a place where English is a foreign language and assimilation is
discouraged, the chamber said.</LD>
<LD>   To counter those perceptions, the city and chamber hired the Santa
Ana-based DGWB marketing group to "brand" the city with a new image.
Its "Education First" slogan will give way to a new tagline in 2003:
"Santa Ana. The Spirit of Change."</LD>
<TE>   The idea is to attract more visitors to Santa Ana and to encourage
professional firms from throughout Southern California to relocate
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Chamber officials acknowledged that many in Orange County view
Santa Ana as a Latino city with, perhaps, good Mexican restaurants
but little else to offer non-Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown 4th Street, also known as Fiesta Village, is lined with
businesses that cater to Latino shoppers. As part of "The Spirit of
Change," the chamber plans to bring stores to the area that will
appeal to a more diverse group of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the marketing of the new and changing Santa Ana is more
than a year away, people are already taking issue with the concept.
And the song used in a video promotion might perpetuate the
stereotype of Santa Ana as a violent city rather than quell it.</TE>
<TE>   DGWB has promoted the branding with a brief-but-hip video. The
hitch: The background music might send a subliminal message that
Santa Ana is a place of unrest, alienation, paranoia and distrust of
police.</TE>
<TE>   DGWB partners Jon Gothold and Mike Weisman chose the 1967 protest
song "For What It's Worth" by Buffalo Springfield as the score for
the video. As Santa Ana's best attributes begin appearing on the
screen, the protest anthem's lyrics call different images to mind:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There's something happening here,</TE>
<TE>   What it is ain't exactly clear.</TE>
<TE>   There's a man with a gun over there,</TE>
<TE>   Tellin' me I gotta beware.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's time we stop,</TE>
<TE>   Hey, what's that sound,</TE>
<TE>   Everybody, look what's going down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It's used to say that there's something going on. Stop. There was
change in the air in Santa Ana," Gothold said. "None of the focus
groups we showed it to picked up on the other message" of
uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   The input from focus groups of people who live outside Santa Ana
showed there are barriers that must be overcome to market the city to
companies and professionals, Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Ana, in their minds, was out of sync with the rest of the
county. There's a picture floating around in their heads that's years
old. The issue of gangs came up. That people who live here 'don't
even speak my language.' That's from a lack of information. But
perception is reality, and we have to deal with that," Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Metzler, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce president, said "the
image of the town impacts its prosperity."</TE>
<TE>   Residents feel good about their city, which is the county seat and
home to Bowers Museum, Discovery Science Center, St. Joseph's Ballet
and a downtown Artists' Village, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the outsiders who come here only when forced for jury duty
or to tend to other government issues that we have to convince,"
Metzler said.</TE>
<TE>   It is an image of community, where crime has plummeted 58% in the
past decade, that the chamber and DGWB want to promote. The sterility
of some of the South County's cities is absent in Santa Ana, Gothold
said.</TE>
<TE>   But while DGWB and the chamber firmly believe that the tagline,
"Santa Ana. The Spirit of Change," is right for the city, others are
not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Goodgold, CEO of the brand consulting company the Nuancing
Group, called the new slogan a "throwaway line."</TE>
<TE>   Smart cities differentiate themselves by having something to offer
a wide audience, she said. "Anaheim equals Disneyland, great shopping
and sports. When I think of Santa Ana, I think of a remote city in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with 'The Spirit of Change' is that it has no
tangible benefit," Goodgold said.</TE>

[4th Street] a bit. Celebrate [4th Street] but improve it at the same
time," DGWB partner Mike Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the marketing of the new and changing Santa Ana is more
than a year away, people are already taking issue with the concept.
And the song used in a video promotion might perpetuate the
stereotype of Santa Ana as a violent city rather than quell it.</TE>
<TE>   DGWB has promoted the branding with a brief-but-hip video. The
hitch: The background music might send a subliminal message that
Santa Ana is a place of unrest, alienation, paranoia and distrust of
police.</TE>
<TE>   DGWB partners Jon Gothold and Weisman chose the 1967 protest song
"For What It's Worth" by Buffalo Springfield as the score for the
video. As Santa Ana's best attributes begin appearing on the screen,
the protest anthem's lyrics call different images to mind:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There's something happening here,</TE>
<TE>   What it is ain't exactly clear.</TE>
<TE>   There's a man with a gun over there,</TE>
<TE>   Tellin' me I gotta beware.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's time we stop,</TE>
<TE>   Hey, what's that sound,</TE>
<TE>   Everybody, look what's going down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It's used to say that there's something going on. Stop. There was
change in the air in Santa Ana," Gothold said. "None of the focus
groups we showed it to picked up on the other message" of
uncertainty. The input from focus groups of people who live outside
Santa Ana showed there are barriers that must be overcome to market
the city to companies and professionals, Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Ana, in their minds, was out of sync with the rest of the
county. There's a picture floating around in their heads that's years
old. The issue of gangs came up. That people who live here 'don't
even speak my language.' That's from a lack of information. But
perception is reality, and we have to deal with that," Weisman said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to promoting the city is to convince the doubters that
Santa Ana's large Latino community is a positive asset, Weisman and
Gothold said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hispanics are a jewel for the city. From [the critics'] mind,
we're coming from a position of behind [because of the Latino
population]. We're going to need a strategy to get these people to
cheer us on," Weisman said. "Hispanics own businesses and homes here.
They have our values. They have the American dream."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Metzler, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce president, said "the
image of the town impacts its prosperity."</TE>
<TE>   Residents feel good about their city, which is the county seat and
home to the Bowers Museum, Discovery Science Center, St. Joseph's
Ballet and a downtown Artists' Village, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the outsiders who come here only when forced for jury duty
or to tend to other government issues that we have to convince," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Metzler and Gothold, who live in Santa Ana, say there is much
about the city that can appeal to professionals, whom the chamber is
trying to woo to the downtown area. Gothold and Weisman moved their
office from Irvine and settled in the old City Hall building, which
they purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Most city neighborhoods are made up of older homes, and the
downtown area's old buildings also have been preserved. It is an
image of community, where crime has plummeted in the past decade,
that the chamber and DGWB want to promote. The sterility of some of
South County's cities is absent in Santa Ana, Gothold said.</TE>
<TE>   But while DGWB and the chamber firmly believe that the tagline,
"Santa Ana. The Spirit of Change," is right for the city, others are
not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Goodgold, CEO of the brand consulting company the Nuancing
Group, called the new slogan a "throwaway line."</TE>
<TE>   "Smart cities differentiate themselves by having something to
offer a wide audience," she said. "Anaheim equals Disneyland, great
shopping and sports. When I think of Santa Ana, I think of a remote
city in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with 'The Spirit of Change' is that it has no
tangible benefit," Goodgold said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she added, it doesn't exactly exude confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, we don't like change. We like the way things are.
Change broadcasts fear and uncertainty," Goodgold said.</TE>
<TE>   But Weisman said the new tagline shows that Santa Ana "is
continuing to evolve into new opportunities." The world is full of
change, he said, and "we are trying to portray the immense positives
that come with change."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jose Solorio admits he is not completely sold on
the new tagline. "There may be other slogans that can achieve the
same outcome and be embraced by a larger group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The slogan was chosen by a committee of chamber officials and
DGWB. The other finalists were "The City Is Back," "An Urban Oasis,"
"The Soul of Orange County" and "Something Greater."</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to work with the community to make sure
it's a slogan that people embrace. They have to explain what the
changes are about and why they're good," Solorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Ramirez, chairman of the Santa Ana-based Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce, said the new tagline "doesn't ring true for me."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not what I think of when I think of Santa Ana. I think of
the spirit of diversity and other things. I was born and raised here.
What's the marketing change they're talking about?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He will give the new tagline a chance to catch on, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gothold said the marketing strategy is still being developed and
that the branding campaign will be launched in late 2003, but only
regionally.</TE>

<HD>Board to Fight Kline's Pullout</HD>
<DH>Elections: Supervisors say they'll oppose the attempt by
the judge facing child porn charges to withdraw from ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors Tuesday pledged to fight an attempt by a
Superior Court judge accused of molestation and possession of child
pornography to have his name removed from the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ronald C. Kline remains confined to his home since his
December arrest on the pornography charge--two days after filing
unopposed candidacy papers for reelection. He was the second-highest
vote-getter for the office on the March 5 ballot, trailing attorney
John Adams, one of 11 write-in candidates who campaigned against him.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Kline filed suit to remove his name from the
November ballot, challenging a state law that allows names to be
removed only if the candidate is elected to higher office or dies.
Kline has insisted that he is innocent of the charges, but said
pulling out of the race is the honorable thing to do.</LD>
<TE>   A status conference on the lawsuit is scheduled for April 2 in Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer said Tuesday that he wanted to make sure
county attorneys would vigorously defend the law after they indicated
in court papers that "they could live with" whatever the court
decided.</TE>
<TE>   "As a judge, Kline's trying to bend the law in his favor, and
that's offensive," said Spitzer, who endorsed Adams. "The public
deserves the right to throw him out of office if they choose."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion came as supervisors certified the results of the
March 5 election. If Kline's name is removed from the November
ballot, it's unclear whether only Adams' name would remain or whether
Adams would face the third-highest vote-getter, attorney Gay
Sandoval.</TE>
<TE>   Adams was the only write-in candidate to challenge Kline's motion
to remove his name, leading to speculation that he would rather face
Kline in November than Sandoval. Spitzer said there was no doubt that
Adams would have an easier time challenging Kline, but added that
removing Kline's name would create a precedent, allowing candidates
to drop out of races at will.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Collision Reopens Debate on Police Pursuits</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Father of Oxnard 18-year-old who died in
crash with CHP car pleads for more caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crash that killed an Oxnard teen over the weekend has again
prompted debate about how police should conduct high-speed pursuits
through urban areas.</LD>
<LD>   It could be weeks before investigators know crucial details about
the incident, in which a California Highway Patrol cruiser that was
pursuing a speeder broadsided another car carrying 18-year-old
Jessica Mohorko on Saturday just after midnight. It has not been
determined whether the cruiser had its flashing lights or siren on at
the time.</LD>
<LD>   The victim's father on Monday implored the CHP to use more caution
on the busy stretch of Oxnard Boulevard where the crash occurred and
to reevaluate its policy on high-speed pursuits.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not going to tolerate them speeding through my community,"
said Edgar Mohorko, senior pastor at Messiah Foursquare Church in
Oxnard and a chaplain for the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't go out there to kill my daughter; they were doing
their job," Mohorko said of the husband-wife team of officers
involved. "But the problem is, they are also supposed to be out there
protecting my daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Mohorko died instantly. Her boyfriend, Chris Haynes, who
was driving them to a local restaurant after a school dance, suffered
a broken arm.</TE>
<TE>   Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick on Monday offered
his condolences to the young woman's family and promised a thorough
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he defended policies that allow officers to
drive at high rates of speed to catch suspects, whether they're
traffic violators or armed felons.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times, unfortunately, when you've got to stop an
individual to ensure they don't continue down the road and do more
damage," Helmick said. "That's a thing you struggle with all the
time. If you simply went the speed limit all the time, they'd keep
going fast and someone else would get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials say Officers Jack and Christina Raughton were trying
to catch up to a speeder on Oxnard Boulevard, a commercial strip with
late-night gas stations and restaurants that connects the Ventura
Freeway to Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how long they had been following the alleged
speeder, but Lt. Steve Munday said the suspect's car had run a red
light at Vineyard Avenue, about half a mile north of the collision.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the CHP said, the Raughtons were not involved in a
chase, because they had not yet notified dispatch that one had begun.</TE>
<TE>   "When they have an actual pursuit, the officer will get on the
radio and say that to the dispatcher," CHP spokesman Tom Marshall
said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that was activated. They were just about to make a stop,
they thought. The driver, to the best of our knowledge, never knew
they were trying to stop him."</TE>

<HD>Not Involved in Officer's Attack, Man Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: In an interview, one of two held in the shooting
says he and his brother were in Riverside when the sheriff's sergeant
was wounded in Lake Forest.</DH>

<LD>One of two men suspected of shooting an Orange County sheriff's
sergeant in the face said in a jailhouse interview Monday that police
are holding the wrong people. Miguel Valdivinos, 21, said he and his
brother, a 10th-grader, were walking in a relative's neighborhood in
Riverside when the shooting occurred Saturday at a Lake Forest
shopping center.</LD>
<LD>   "How can we be at two places at the same time?" asked Valdivinos,
who is being held at Santa Ana Jail. "I'm not like that. I'm not a
bad person." His brother, who is 16, also was arrested after going to
a Riverside hospital with a gunshot wound.</LD>
<LD>   Valdivinos said he and his brother were walking to a relative's
home in Riverside when about four men fired at them from a moving
car. He said he dragged his brother into a car parked nearby and
drove him to the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Police dispute that account, saying the brothers are reputed to be
gang members--which Valdivinos denied--and have extensive criminal
records.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to respond to such nonsense," sheriff's spokesman
Jim Amormino said of Valdivinos' account.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the brothers may have been at the shopping
center to rob one of the businesses. Two-way radios were found in the
stolen car, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured officer, Sgt. Kurt Vasentine, 45, was in good
condition Monday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in
Mission Viejo after surgery to remove a .380-caliber bullet from his
collarbone, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Vasentine, a 23-year veteran, was shot in the
face at point-blank range about 8 a.m. Saturday while checking out a
suspicious car in an alley at Lake Forest Market Place. When the
sergeant approached, a man in the vehicle tried to run, but the
officer wrestled him to the ground. The man then pulled a gun from
his pocket and fired at the officer, who returned fire, hitting the
man in the leg, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded man waved to the driver of a second car, a black
Toyota Avalon, and the two fled in it, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Crime Rise Is Steeper in O.C.'s Biggest Cities Than Rest of
State</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: The county's nine largest police agencies
average an 8.1% increase from 2000. Officials say the slower economy
has an effect.</DH>

<LD>Crime rose last year in Orange County's largest cities at higher
rates than in the rest of the state, with some communities seeing
double-digit jumps in offenses such as robbery and auto theft.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, Orange County had been largely immune to the increases
in crime that other urban areas--notably Los Angeles--have seen in
the past two years. But this year, the county's nine largest police
agencies averaged an 8.1% increase in total crime, compared with 5.8%
for the rest of the state, according to data released Monday by the
state attorney general's office.</LD>
<LD>   The state's report found little to explain the trend. Santa Ana,
for example, saw a 20% jump in property crimes, while violent crime
remained steady. Nearly 500 more cars were stolen in the city last
year than in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   In Costa Mesa, violent crime jumped 41.8%, led by a doubling in
robberies, which police said was largely the work of one group.</TE>
<TE>   "That inconsistency is consistent with what we found throughout
the state," said Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the attorney
general's office. "There is no single pattern when you compare
jurisdictions."</TE>
<TE>   Barankin said the slowing economy probably played some role in the
overall increase--especially with property crimes such as auto theft.
"When people lose their jobs, it can have that effect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Costa Mesa and Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton
recorded double-digit crime jumps--13% and 11.2%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Orange and Irvine showed smaller increases, while crime in Garden
Grove and Huntington Beach remained relatively flat. The Sheriff's
Department saw a 22% decline in some of the unincorporated area it
covers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the latest findings, crime in Orange County is
significantly lower than in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The county had nearly 200 homicides in 1993. In 2000, it recorded
less than 60 homicides.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still low compared to [the early 1990s], when it was sky
high," said Anaheim Sgt. Mike Hidalgo. "It's like the real estate
market, when it reaches a peak and [has] to come down."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of rising crime, Santa Ana last year began several new
crackdowns. The city created a special task force to deal with auto
thefts and another unit to take on repeat criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been preparing in the event that this would occur," said
Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva. "We just don't know whether this is
something temporary or a long-term problem."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials said the numbers can be misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Robberies in Costa Mesa more than doubled last year from 72 to
155. But Police Chief David L. Snowden said most of the additional
robberies were committed by one group whose members have since been
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "We geared up and solved the problem. Those people are in jail
now. I'm not worried about that anymore," he said. "It doesn't take
much to set off a crime wave."</TE>
<TE>   Police departments said they are analyzing the data, but officials
said they already have some ideas about the root causes of the
increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy tanked in 2001. Every time that happens, we have
problems with crime. That's a national issue," said Garden Grove
Police Chief Joe Polisar. "We also had an enormous [number] of people
incarcerated during the 1990s, and a significant [number] of them are
being released now."</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of plummeting crime, Polisar said, a reversal was
bound to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only go down [so much]. At some point, it's got to come
up," he said. "It looks like we may have hit bottom."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Crime Climbs, but Less Than State's Overall Rise</HD>
<DH>Surveys: The city posts a 5.2% increase, while Daly City
and San Diego County report more than a 20% jump.</DH>

<LD>Crime in Los Angeles rose 5.2% in 2001, slightly less than the 5.8%
rate for California cities as a whole, according to preliminary state
figures released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.5% rise in the city's murder rate was also lower than the
overall state rate of 9.2%, according to the report released by Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, crime in unincorporated Los Angeles County fell by
5.4%, and violent crime dropped by 14.9%. Statewide, despite the
increase in homicides, violent crime overall inched up 1.7%.</LD>
<TE>   The report lists the number of major crimes in 75 cities and
unincorporated areas with populations of 100,000 or more. These areas
account for about 65% of the crime committed in California. The
report is not adjusted for increases in population.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Lockyer said that although crime has fallen
sharply in California over the last few years, "It is never good news
when there is a year-to-year increase."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general called for more crime prevention programs,
including expanded after-school programs, using DNA evidence to find
and convict criminals, and continued support for law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, the most dramatic rises came in the Bay Area's
Daly City, with 22.6%, and in San Diego County, at 21.1%. The cities
of Berkeley, Downey, Fresno and Sacramento also posted increases
greater than 15%.</TE>
<TE>   Violent crime in the Orange County city of Costa Mesa rose 41.8%,
largely because the number of robberies more than doubled.
Unincorporated areas of Orange County, on the other hand, saw crime
drop by 15.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southern California areas that saw crime drop by more than
5% were the cities of Glendale, Pasadena and Thousand Oaks, and
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside County Sheriff's Department saw a 12.1% increase in
crime and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department saw a rise
of 4.9%</TE>

<DH>Academics: Moorpark High's state decathlon winners enjoy a
brief celebration before turning to nationals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through most of her senior year at Moorpark High School, Academic
Decathlon team member Julie Bristol has turned down countless movie
invitations and skipped many a shopping excursion. She spent most
days off hunched over books in a classroom, and her 18th birthday
celebration last week consisted of little more than a study break.</LD>
<LD>   But such sacrifices paid off Sunday, when Bristol and her eight
teammates took first place at the California Academic Decathlon in
Modesto. With a score of 48,603, the team edged out last year's
champion, El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "I had never, ever came in first for anything in my life," Bristol
said. "It was the weirdest thing in the entire world. I just went,
'You have to be kidding me.'"</LD>
<TE>   The nine beaming teenagers got to bask in the glow of their
victory at school Monday, giving each other high fives, entertaining
news crews and posing behind a desk loaded with medals and trophies.
But today, it's back to the grindstone as the team prepares for the
national competition next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tired, elated, and we have lots to do," said their coach,
Larry Jones, a world history teacher at the school. "They proved they
were the best in the state; now we have to take on the nation."</TE>
<TE>   This year's Academic Decathlon, themed "Understanding Others,"
tests some of America's brightest high school students in seven
subjects, requiring them to become experts on subjects from
Shakespeare's sonnets to country music to the effect of the Internet
on society. Fifty-five teams from 38 states will compete April 10-13
in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark High Principal Anna Merriman, sporting her "acadeca"
T-shirt and gushing with pride, said the school will hold a send-off
party for the team in two weeks but will put off big celebrations
until after the national contest.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, Moorpark's team--led by Jones--has placed
either first or second in the state championships. In 1999, the team
went on to win the national title.</TE>
<TE>   The students know they will face tough competition from teams in
Texas, Illinois and Wisconsin, which also have earned high scores at
the state level this year. But Jones said that in the nine years he
has coached a team at Moorpark, he has never seen one more dedicated.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is going to be the national champions," he said, with
an arm around his 16-year-old son, Nathaniel, a team member. "I know
I'm putting more pressure on them now, but I know the caliber of what
I have, and this is just an incredible group of people."</TE>
<TE>   One of the qualities that stands out about this year's team is how
close-knit it is, Jones said. A few of the students have been friends
since childhood, and they say all of their personalities seem to just
click. In addition to classroom study time, team members made a
tradition of going to Starbucks before school and in the evenings,
downing shots of espresso and quizzing each other nonstop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how any team could be as close as we are," said
senior Dean Reich. "I know we can win."</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that the team might capture another national title
also renewed rumors that Jones might give up coaching for good after
this year. He has tried to leave before, but the decision never
stuck.</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he has not yet made up his mind, Jones admitted
he is tiring of the work that goes into preparing the teens for
competition. His last day off was Jan. 1. He averages 15 hours in his
classroom daily.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of a better way for him to go out," Merriman said.
"But I also know Larry, and I don't know what he would do without
this."</TE>

<HD>Military's Training in Desert Raises Worry Over Impact
Environmentalists, Military Clash Over Training in Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bureau of Land Management on Monday announced the approval of the
Marine Corps' bid to use a swath of desert stretching from Twentynine
Palms to Yuma, Ariz., for a two-week exercise, but environmentalists
are worried about potential destruction of tortoises and plants.</LD>
<LD>   The exercise, dubbed Desert Scimitar '02, will test the Marine
Corps' ability to move large numbers of troops and vehicles over
terrain similar to the Middle East while maintaining necessary
communications. An estimated 600 vehicles and 2,700 Marines will be
involved in a trek of about 175 miles.</LD>
<LD>   "The BLM is proud to provide the public lands for use in these
efforts [toward] maintaining our nation's security," said Jim Kenna,
Palm Springs-South Coast field officer manager.</LD>
<TE>   Under restrictions imposed by the federal land bureau and the U.S.
Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, the Marine Corps must ensure that desert
tortoises and other vulnerable reptiles and plants are not run over
by Humvees, armored personnel carriers, 5-ton trucks and other
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Marines will not be allowed to do any nighttime
maneuvers, engage in live or simulated firing, or venture off
established roads and paths during the exercise, set for April 22 to
May 3.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the Marines staged a similar but smaller exercise
in the desert, enlisted personnel were trained as tortoise watchers
and stickers were applied to vehicles: "Notify Monitors if You Find a
Tortoise."</TE>
<TE>   But Daniel Patterson, a desert biologist with the Tucson-based
Center for Biological Diversity, is concerned that dust from 600
vehicles may prove detrimental to plants and animals in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Desert tortoises are known to have a delicate respiratory system.
Also, new research suggests that desert plants are more vulnerable
than previously thought to dust, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't enough to say, 'Hey, no tortoises will be run over,'"
Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term degradation to habitat from 600 vehicles could be
enormous."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute between environmentalists and the military over the
latter's impact on the desert tortoise is one of the most contentious
in the California desert.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, a team of researchers from the University of
Redlands announced the receipt of a $4-million grant from the
Department of Defense to study the desert tortoise in the Mojave
Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The Army has proposed expanding its Fort Irwin National Training
Center in the high desert, but environmentalists have disagreed with
the Pentagon over what impact the expansion would have on the
tortoise.</TE>
<TE>   "Our role is to provide good science," said Jill S. Heaton, desert
tortoise project manager at the university. "We're an outside player,
a third party with no stake in which way it goes."</TE>

<HD>Dust Levels Could Choke Coachella Valley Growth</HD>
<DH>Development: Builders and officials seek to contain
pollution in arid Palm Springs area. If federal standards are not
met, EPA could curb construction.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Builders and government leaders in the Coachella Valley, the area
surrounding Palm Springs, said Monday they are scurrying to contain a
dust problem before federal officials take matters into their own
hands--a step that could devastate plans for development.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three years, the arid region has violated federal
standards for airborne dust pollution--a chronic problem that the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attributes in large part to the
rapid pace of construction in the area.</LD>
<LD>   After three years, if a region exceeds the federal standard for
dust--50 micrograms per cubic meter of air, according to the Clean
Air Act--the EPA can impose strict limits on operations that stir up
dust.</LD>
<TE>   First, the agency can force the region to reduce dust in the air
by 5%, said Eleanor Kaplan, an EPA environmental protection
specialist based in San Francisco. Ultimately, the EPA can limit
development and other construction operations that tend to choke the
air with dust.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect, though the Coachella Valley is not yet in danger of
facing such sanctions, Kaplan said, causes shudders in a region that
favors development as an engine of economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned about this because there could be some very
drastic repercussions," said Ed Kibbey, executive director of the
desert chapter of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California.
"The EPA has the power to do just about any damn thing they want to
do."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the EPA "was just really tough" to other areas,
Kibbey said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want that to happen here. This is a growing, vibrant
area and we want to keep it that way. To close it all down would be
disastrous."</TE>
<TE>   By June 30, a coalition of builders and government leaders will
come up with a new dust "attainment" plan in an attempt to stave off
the EPA, several officials said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The program, local officials hope, would give the Coachella Valley
until 2006 to reduce its dust pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a very proactive approach by involving the EPA at
this time rather than waiting for them to drop the guillotine," said
Aurora Kerr, director of human and community resources for the
Coachella Valley Assn. of Governments, a coalition of nine cities,
including the Palm Springs region.</TE>
<TE>   The region's attempt to self-police its dust could result in a
number of changes, officials said. For example, government agencies
and builders might be required to add gravel to some dirt roads or
treat the roads with chemicals that help contain dust.</TE>
<TE>   One primary solution, however, could only raise new problems,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Builders might be required to spread more water on construction
sites--but water is a precious resource throughout Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Still, drastic measures are needed, Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to do something, and fast," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One group of local business and government leaders is working to
figure out how much the new steps will cost, Kerr said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the costs might be shouldered by cities and Riverside
County, officials said, such as the cost of paving dusty roads. But
the bulk of the program will likely be paid for by builders.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan will cost money. There is no question about that,"
Kibbey said. "But we feel it is much better to spend a little extra
money and be able to continue to build. We will bring this area back
into compliance. That is a fact simply because it has to be a fact."</TE>

<HD>Tom Economus, 46; Critic of Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Tom Economus, a former altar boy who was sexually abused by
a priest and became a fierce critic of the Roman Catholic Church and
an advocate for other victims, died of cancer at his Chicago home
Saturday. He was 46.</LD>
<LD>   Economus founded the Chicago-based Survivors of Clergy Abuse
Linkup 12 years ago to help victims confront the facts of their abuse
and find counseling as well as legal help if desired.</LD>
<LD>   The group has campaigned nationally to force the Roman Catholic
Church and other denominations to develop responsible policies for
identifying and removing clerical abusers from their positions.</LD>
<TE>   He was outspoken in his criticism of the Vatican and the Roman
Catholic hierarchy, which has been besieged by child sexual abuse
allegations in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a perpetual lifeline for so many people who were
victimized," said David Clohessy, national director of Survivors
Network of Those Abused by Priests, who said Economus was one of the
earliest crusaders for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of what he achieved you can see in the last three months,"
Clohessy added. "He kept the issue of abusive priests in the
limelight even when it was the least politically popular."</TE>
<TE>   Economus was raised as a Roman Catholic. He said he was sexually
abused as a teenager when he was enrolled at Sky Ranch for Boys, a
private school in South Dakota run by the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   He later entered a Catholic seminary, where officials knew of his
earlier abuse experience but told him to keep silent.</TE>
<TE>   "That was how I was supposed to rectify and reconcile what
happened to me as a child with the Roman Catholic Church," he told
talk-show host Larry King a few years ago. "That is why I left" the
church, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the trauma he endured, he said he still found himself
drawn to the priesthood as a vocation and joined the breakaway
Independent Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Although many victims of clergy abuse give up their faith, "he
showed by his own example that you can separate the trauma of your
own abuse from religious faith," Clohessy said. "In that sense, he
was a real inspiration to a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Economus' group claimed more than 7,500 members. It monitored
abuse cases nationwide and maintained a database of molestation
charges and of priests who allegedly molested church members. The
group also assisted in lawsuits, including one filed against the
Dallas diocese that ended in a record judgment five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A jury ordered the Dallas diocese to pay $119 million to 10 men
and the family of a suicide victim who were molested as altar boys by
Father Rudolph Kos.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Demarest, one of the lawyers in that case, told the
Associated Press that Economus "helped victims find a voice ... and
each other."</TE>
<TE>   "He was just unconventional enough to make the bishops worry about
what he would do next," she said. "They had to pay attention to him."</TE>
<TE>   Economus once printed 25,000 bogus $1 bills bearing drawings of
three bishops in "see no evil, speak no evil" poses and distributed
them to church members across the country. The bills also bore the
slogan "In God we only trust."</TE>
<TE>   Members were asked to deposit the phony bills in collection plates
to send a message to church officials.</TE>
<TE>   "One priest called me and said 'I really don't appreciate this but
I guess you have to do what you have to do,'" Economus told the
Houston Chronicle in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Economus is survived by his mother, Shirley; grandmother, Dorothy
Spradlin; two sisters; and a brother.</TE>

<HD>Regional Forest Service Jobs, Research May Get Budget Ax</HD>
<DH>Environment: The station serving California and Hawaii may
lose 40 positions, two labs and scientific studies of birds, weather
and land management.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next year's proposed federal budget would cut U.S. Forest Service
research in California in a number of controversial areas, force the
closing of two labs in the state and eliminate 40 positions in the
Pacific Southwest Research Station.</LD>
<LD>   "These changes will have significant impacts," station Director
Hilda-Diaz Soltero said in a newsletter outlining the budget
proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The reductions reflect a national shift in Forest Service research
that calls for cuts in some ongoing programs to fund a handful of new
initiatives favored by the Bush Administration.</LD>
<TE>   Forest Service research on wildlife, aquatic species, fire-weather
forecasting and forest growth would be eliminated or reduced in
California. In their place, the research station would embark on
projects involving computer modeling, the use of woody materials to
produce energy, and research on Sudden Oak Death, a lethal tree
disease. Soltero could not be reached for comment, and Matt Mathes, a
U.S. Forest Service spokesman in California, emphasized that the
proposal was "the first step in an always lengthy budget process."
What is being discussed now "may not hold true later," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists who follow federal forest policy in California
decried the changes, contending the Forest Service was abandoning
sensitive work.</TE>
<TE>   "They're gutting key programs," said Craig Thomas of the Sierra
Nevada Forest Protection Campaign. "[It's] a dramatic reduction in
doing real science in terms of important things like tracking what is
happening to species over time."</TE>
<TE>   A February assessment of the budget changes by the Pacific
Southwest Station outlines a number of impacts.</TE>
<TE>   * Research labs in Fresno and Redding would close, cutting
wildlife research involving the California spotted owl and aquatic
wildlife in the Sierra Nevada, and studies on tree growth and yield.</TE>
<TE>   * Research on the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet, a
seabird that nests in coastal forests, would end. Concern over the
two threatened species has slashed timber harvests in many West Coast
national forests.</TE>
<TE>   * Long-term weather forecasts used in planning controlled burns
would be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   * Research on the effect of land-management techniques on wildlife
and riverbank ecosystems would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by Congress, the budget proposal would take effect
next fall at the start of the federal government's fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   It comes at a time of continuing debate over the management of
national forests, particularly in the West, where logging levels
declined drastically under the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   A recently adopted plan for the Sierra Nevada calls for further
reductions in timbering.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service documents raise the possibility, under a worst-case
scenario, of closing the Pacific station next year if the station is
forced to absorb all the costs associated with staff reductions and
moves under Civil Service requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The station, which covers California and Hawaii, has 250
employees, plus an additional 50 seasonal workers.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $3.3 million in research projects would be dropped, out of
a Pacific station budget of about $19 million.</TE>
<TE>   That would be partially offset by $2.5 million in funding for new
initiatives. But 40 positions, including those for 12 scientists,
could be cut because those workers are conducting research destined
for the cutting block. Mathes said he could not say if other slots
would be added to staff the new projects.</TE>
<TE>   The new initiatives would cost $37.8 million nationally. The bulk
of that, $20 million, would be spent on forest inventory--collecting
data on what is growing in forests.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $5 million would fund the development of software
for computer modeling of forest appearance under various managements
schemes. Research on using wood fiber to produce energy would get $5
million.</TE>

<HD>Decision Favors Gun Makers</HD>
<DH>Court: A federal judge rules that manufacturers cannot be
held responsible for Buford Furrow's shooting rampage in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gun manufacturers were not responsible for the actions of a white
supremacist who killed a Filipino American postal worker after
wounding five people at a Jewish community center in 1999, a Los
Angeles federal judge ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Audrey B. Collins dismissed a damage suit
brought by the mother of slain letter carrier Joseph S. Ileto and the
parents of three children wounded when Buford O. Furrow Jr. sprayed
the center with automatic weapons fire on Aug. 10, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   While expressing sympathy for the victims, Collins said their
lawsuit failed to demonstrate a link between the gun makers and
Furrow's shooting rampage.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Nordberg, a Philadelphia lawyer who represents the victims,
said he would confer with his clients and other lawyers in the case
before deciding whether to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Furrow, a convicted felon with a history of mental instability,
had an arsenal of assault-style weapons in his possession when he
shot up the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills and
later killed Ileto, who was delivering mail in Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons included an Austrian-made Glock 9-millimeter handgun;
a 9-millimeter rifle with an illegally shortened barrel made by
Norinco, an arm of the Chinese military; a .223-caliber rifle from
Bushmaster of Maine; two .308-caliber rifles made by Imbel of Brazil;
an Egyptian Maadi rifle and a .22-caliber handgun manufactured by
Davis Industries, a California corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly one year ago today,  Furrow was sentenced to multiple life
terms in prison after negotiating a plea agreement that spared him
from having to face a possible death sentence for Ileto's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit against the gun manufacturers was filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court but was transferred to federal court because Norinco
is owned by the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the victims leveled a broad attack on the gun makers'
marketing practices. They accused Glock and the other defendants of
producing and distributing substantially more firearms than could
possibly be bought by law-abiding customers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those weapons are sold at gun shows and through
"kitchen-table" dealers who may be licensed but are loosely
regulated, the lawsuit charged.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contended that the manufacturers often advertise their
products with the illicit market in mind. It singled out Glock's
promotion of its 9-millimeter "pocket rocket" concealable handgun,
the one Furrow is believed to have used when he killed Ileto.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the suit argued, the gun manufacturers were guilty of
negligence and being a dangerous public nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   But in a 37-page draft opinion, Collins said the plaintiffs had
failed to show a link between the manufacturers' marketing policies
and Furrow's crime.</TE>
<TE>   "While it may be foreseeable that some criminals might obtain
Glock firearms and use them to harm others," she wrote, "there was no
way of foreseeing that this particular individual [Furrow] would
obtain a Glock firearm and use it to injure these plaintiffs."</TE>
<TE>   Collins said she was influenced by California's product liability
law, which "evidences an intent to hold shooters, not manufacturers,
responsible for gun violence."</TE>
<TE>   Collins also dismissed the claim that the gun manufacturers'
distribution methods created a public nuisance under California law.</TE>
<TE>   She said the nuisance law does not apply to the lawful manufacture
and sale of non-defective products.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday were plaintiffs Loren Lieb and Alan Stepakoff,
whose son, Joshua, then 6, was shot in the leg and hip. They declined
to comment on the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Koji Fukumura, an attorney for Norinco, praised Collins' ruling,
saying she "came to the only conclusion possible under California
law--that these defendants owed no duty to prevent Buford Furrow from
committing his heinous acts."</TE>

<LD>On an unseasonably cold and windy night in Hollywood, no one seemed
to take much notice as about a dozen college students emerged from a
white and blue van and unloaded a tarp, cots, tables, chairs and
plastic file boxes. There, on a desolate city street corner, they
opened up shop for the night.</LD>
<LD>   A few feet away, their prospective clients, a large group of
homeless people, stood in line waiting for a free meal and some
medical help.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Riley, 27, a UCLA doctoral student, walked up and down the
line with a pen and clipboard.</LD>
<TE>   "Does anyone need to see the doctor tonight?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors that night were UCLA medical students, public health
students and undergraduates who volunteer three or four times a month
to provide basic medical care to the city's homeless. Officially
known as the UCLA/Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition Mobile Clinic
Project, the group has been caring for the homeless at the
intersection of Sycamore Avenue and Romaine Street in Hollywood since
October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As Riley worked his way along the line, one by one, people told
him what bothered them.</TE>
<TE>   Most, like Jonathan Morales, 32, were suffering from cold
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need some medicine for my throat and cough," said Morales,
a former janitor who makes his home on nearby Santa Monica Boulevard
with his girlfriend, Cecilia.</TE>
<TE>   Some wanted hygiene products and blankets. The rest just looked
forward to talking to a friendly, nonjudgmental person.</TE>
<TE>   Like a receptionist at your primary care physician's office, Riley
wrote down their names and complaints, and told them the doctor would
see them soon. The mobile clinic is a few feet from where the Greater
West Hollywood Food Coalition has provided food every night for more
than a decade. The group, like the people it serves, has had its
share of unfortunate times.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the group was driven out of its first gathering spot in
Plummer Park, and in 1999, was evicted from its kitchen behind the
historic Farmers Market. It is currently cooking meals in a donated
space on nearby La Brea Avenue. Now the volunteers are joined every
Wednesday by the UCLA students, who usually see clients after they
have finished eating.</TE>
<TE>   It's a perfect place for a mobile medical facility, said Ted
Landreth, a Food Coalition volunteer. About two years ago, the
organization approached UCLA's school of public health looking for
young, energetic volunteers. The students served the food but
suggested that maybe there was more they could do.</TE>
<TE>   "We discovered there was a tremendous need for medical services,"
said Koy Parada, 31, a doctoral student and one of the mobile
clinic's founders.</TE>
<TE>   They formed a steering committee and recruited medical students,
undergraduates and faculty advisors. With some modest funding from
the school, they were able to lease their van and buy basic medical
supplies, such as plastic gloves and anti-fungal medication.</TE>
<TE>   Most nights, the volunteers see 10 to 15 patients.</TE>
<TE>   The students have provided medical services to about 200 people in
the last year and a half, Parada said. More than 400 homeless have
received referrals, hygiene items or clothing from the students.</TE>
<TE>   Their clients suffer from respiratory problems and colds and flu.
The students treat a lot of cuts and bruises, foot fungus and general
foot problems. The clients also ask for condoms and contraception and
for information on how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. The
majority of the volunteers' time is spent referring patients to
social service agencies and free clinics and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   On this cold night, the students saw all types of cases.</TE>
<TE>   There was the HIV-positive woman, known as Ms. Candy, who was
suffering from diarrhea and a swollen middle finger. They gave her
some pills for the diarrhea, which they think might be a symptom of
withdrawal from drugs, and told her that her finger needs to be
examined in a medical office.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anything else we can do for you?" asked medical student
Janine Roach, 24.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish you had some naked men for me," the woman joked. With
that, she and her shopping cart made their way down Romaine.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from another examining room was Paul Knobbe, 38, who
needed Tylenol to ease pain in his knees caused when he was hit by a
car two weeks ago. He's been on the streets only five months, but you
learn pretty quickly where to go for help, he said, shivering in the
night's unrelenting wind.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for this, there really wouldn't be a place where I
could or want to go," Knobbe said. "Some places are hard to find or
they treat you differently because you're homeless. These guys don't
care if you're homeless or not, because they know that underneath it
all you're still a human being."</TE>
<TE>   With no running water or electricity, the students can provide only
limited services.  But most days, all their clients ask for is time and
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything we offer an ear," said medical student Walter
Coppenrath, 25. "Being out there is especially lonely. Sometimes we
might not be able to give them anything more than vitamins and
shampoo, but we're able to provide them company without judgment."</TE>
<TE>   It's one of the reasons Jeffrey Castillo, 35, keeps coming back.
He's been to the mobile clinic 13 times. In one of two examining
rooms, volunteer Jo Marie Janco, a UCLA undergrad, listened patiently
as Castillo chatted about nothing in particular. As if at an old
friend's home, he kicked off his shoes and socks and ate his dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too ... hard to be without stuff, you know?" Castillo said.
The conversation turned to his feet, which had been overrun by fungus
when he came to the clinic a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "So have you been doing a lot of walking?" Janco asked. "Your feet
look a lot better than they did two weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   "I got new shoes."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, as the heavy winds threatened to send
the tarp flying, Janco rubbed Castillo's feet with anti-fungal powder
as he ate his dinner of pasta and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "I love these guys," he said.</TE>

<HD>Panel Backs Conditions on Cityhood for Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cityhood movement in Hollywood got another boost Monday when a
key government group endorsed a set of terms and conditions if
Hollywood breaks away from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The action by a subcommittee of the Local Agency Formation
Commission now goes to the full agency board, which regulates the
incorporation of new cities.</LD>
<LD>   The commission previously issued a financial analysis that
suggested that Hollywood would be viable if it became its own city.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's action endorses a plan that would allow the new city to
keep many Los Angeles assets, including parks, police and fire
stations, and libraries. It would also prohibit Los Angeles from
charging Hollywood residents higher utility rates than those paid by
Los Angeles customers.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee left the proposed city's boundaries undetermined.
Homeowners groups in several areas west of La Brea Avenue have asked
to be excluded from a new city. As a result, some landmarks, such as
Farmers Market, the Beverly Center and most of the Fairfax district,
are not in the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the boundaries
will be set June 5 when the full agency board considers placing the
Hollywood secession issue on the November ballot.</TE>

<HD>Magic Johnson Says He Could Be Player in 2005 L.A. Mayor's
Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson said Monday that he will run
for mayor of Los Angeles if he decides the city needs a new voice to
replace Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson supported Hahn's campaign last year, but said the mayor
had made "a big, big mistake" by opposing Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks' bid for reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not just going to run because Mayor Hahn is not doing a good
job," Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to run because the city needs a new voice, a new
vision, and I think that I could do the job. That's why I would run.</TE>
<TE>   "And I would run for the people, not for me. It would be for the
people of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The former Lakers player made his remarks at the Magic Johnson
Theatres at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza after announcing his
endorsement of Gov. Gray Davis for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who backed Hahn's rival, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the
mayoral race, was standing at Johnson's side.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Hahn--he would probably admit himself--has made some
mistakes," Johnson said. "It hasn't been a good road for him right at
this time, but we've still got 31/2 years to go."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's term expires in June 2005. His overwhelming support last
year among black voters was a key to his election. But his opposition
to the reappointment of Parks, who is black, has angered many of his
most prominent African American supporters, including Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to do a better job not just in our community, but in the
Valley too," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn political strategist Bill Carrick defended the mayor's
decision to oppose Parks' reappointment. "Instead of coming up with
some behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Jim Hahn was honest," he said.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill on Olympic Bid Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed into law Monday legislation that would provide
up to $250 million in public money to help finance San Francisco's
2012 Olympic bid.</LD>
<LD>   The group pushing to bring the Summer Games to the Bay Area has
touted its effort as relying entirely on private backing. At the same
time, however, it quietly began pushing a measure in Sacramento to
provide up to $250 million in backup public financing to cover
unforeseen debts. The money would be used only if private financing
for the Games came up short.</LD>
<LD>   The Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee, the group leading the
push for the San Francisco bid, maintains it still plans to
orchestrate the Games without a cent of taxpayer money. But it said
it was advised by the U.S. Olympic Committee that it needed some
government backing as part of its bid.</LD>
<TE>   In November, the USOC will choose the American host nominee from
four finalists--Houston, New York, San Francisco and Washington. The
International Olympic Committee will choose the host city in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The state financing measure by Senate President Pro Tempore John
Burton (D-San Francisco) passed both houses of the Legislature on
Thursday, and was signed by Davis a day before the Bay Area group
must submit details on its financial guarantees to the national body.</TE>
<TE>   The group hailed the signing as a major boost to its candidacy.
The urgency measure, which was approved by special majorities in both
houses, took effect immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Gray Davis has given an enormous boost to the San Francisco
Bay Area's bid and demonstrated his economic vision and leadership
for the state of California," Anne Cribbs, a 1960 Olympic swimmer who
serves as president of the Bay Area group, said in a statement. "This
law provides tangible government support as a last resort, but does
nothing to change our absolute commitment to hosting a privately
financed, privately insured Olympic Games."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Assessor Webster J. Guillory said Monday he will wait for further
court action before deciding whether to appeal a ruling against
Orange County's property-tax assessment method.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge in December said higher assessments on some
properties violated Proposition 13, which limits such increases to 2%
a year. Attorney Robert Pool brought the case after the assessment on
his Seal Beach home rose 4% in one year. Pool is asking that the
ruling be applied to every Orange County property owner whose
assessments rose more than 2% a year since 1996. Judge John M. Watson
will decide April 29 whether to expand the ruling.</LD>

<HD>Bishop Moves to Reassure Catholics</HD>
<DH>Religion: Orange County prelate, speaking to parishioners
and clergy, says the church is acting to prevent sexual abuse of
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bishop Tod D. Brown assured parishioners and clergy in Orange County
on Monday that the Roman Catholic Church is "taking every possible
step" to prevent sexual abuse of children by priests in scandals like
those revealed in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "The church has become, for some, a place where [children] were
hurt, not healed," Brown told hundreds of worshipers--including about
200 Orange County priests--gathered at St. Columban Church in Garden
Grove for the annual Chrism Mass. "The church must be the safest
place for all."</LD>
<LD>   The annual event, during which the bishop blesses the oil used by
priests in sacraments, is part of Holy Week, which culminates in
Easter Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second time in as many days Brown had spoken publicly
on the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In a Palm Sunday sermon, he urged the church to take
responsibility for the "terrible, terrible crimes" committed by
priests against children and to seek forgiveness for wayward
clergymen. On Monday, Brown expanded considerably on those remarks,
this time speaking to the priests themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen that attacks on the innocent and vulnerable do not
just happen in distant places," he said, "but here in our own church.
This is a painful reality.... We've been doing a great deal of
soul-searching of late. We have had to ask, in tears and anger, who
are we that these things have happened among us, these dark things
among men we thought we knew?"</TE>
<TE>   He drew a standing ovation and extended applause for the priests
in attendance after appealing to parishioners for their support and
understanding. "The scars of these trespasses are not easily healed,"
Brown said. "They break our hearts. The recent events have affected
our priests very deeply--I appreciate the honesty with which they
have [responded.] I am proud of them and I hope that you are too."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview later, the bishop said that he felt it imperative
to respond. "It was on everyone's mind," he said of the reported
sexual misconduct by priests, including some in Orange County. "It
needed to be addressed. I wanted to assure people that we are aware
of the problem and doing everything we can to address it."</TE>
<TE>   Some priests at Monday's service echoed Brown's sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was good that he said something about it," said Father
Bruce Lavery, pastor at St. Timothy Church in Laguna Niguel. "Most
people know that it's a small percentage of the clergy ... but he was
personally hurt by it, and he can feel that we are hurt by it too."</TE>
<TE>   Father John McAndrew of St. Angela Merici Church in Brea also
applauded the bishop's openness. "He handled it forthrightly,"
McAndrew said. "It had to be done--putting the victims first is the
way we need to go."</TE>

<LD>On the perils of driving in L.A., Eileen Gelon of Beverly Hills
recalled a joke told by actor Paul Reiser at the Grammys a few years
ago. Sheryl Crow had just finished singing, "All I wanna do is have
some fun/Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard...." And
Reiser commented: "All I wanna do on Santa Monica Boulevard is make a
left turn."</LD>
<LD>   Awards yawner: Despite what some critics said, there was
absolutely no drama surrounding the actor-actress voting at
Hollywood's most colorful awards show.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Green ("Freddy Got Fingered") and Mariah Carey ("Glitter")
overwhelmingly won worst performance honors in the Golden Raspberry
Foundation show in Santa Monica. That's Razzies, for short.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about prestige: I had tickets to the Razzies but couldn't
attend despite the unprecedented offer to us privileged guests--two
hours of free parking in a Santa Monica lot! Yes, Santa Monica. Wow,
the city must have wanted the show bad.</TE>
<TE>   A crow/Crowe connection? As for the Oscars competition, Times
Calendar writer Bob Welkos confided to me Friday that he saw an omen
spelling doom for best-actor nominee Russell Crowe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in line at a Starbucks when all of a sudden a crow swooped
down and crashed into the window of the store," Welkos said. "The
crow fell and stood dazed in front of me." I kept the news of Crowe's
fallen hopes a secret, because I didn't want to spoil the suspense
for readers.</TE>
<TE>   Squirmy time: Since the Oscars lasted more than four hours, many
viewers who failed to make it through the whole thing must have felt
as though they'd had the spa treatment that reader Christine W.
spotted (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Fowl alarm clock: And Oscar revelers who got in late Monday could
be thankful they didn't live in the neighborhood of one early riser
who was cited in the police log of the Huntington Beach Independent
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   That bird must be on Midwestern time, by the way. Daybreak is
currently about 5:50. (Or was the rooster crowing about something
else?)</TE>
<TE>   Dining Adventurously Dept.: Cheryl Abel of Manhattan Beach found a
dish that was either grimy or a misspelling of Dungeness (see

<HD>Police Seek Paint-Ball Shooters</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are searching for three boys they say shot several paint-ball
pellets at a Newport Beach in-line skater Sunday, causing him to fall
and crack his head on the concrete.</LD>
<LD>   The skater, Gary Holdren, 54, remains in critical condition at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. He was
shot with the pellets while skating around the Upper Newport Bay
Ecological Preserve about 1:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Police are trying to locate three boys whom witnesses saw shooting
a paint-ball gun in the area where Holdren was struck. "This appears
to be a random incident," said Lt. Richard Long of the Newport Beach
Police Department. "This man was out roller-blading, and he was the
victim of a random attack.</LD>
<TE>   "We are hoping one or all three of [the boys] break down and tell
their parents what they did, and their parents bring them in."</TE>
<TE>   Police in Newport Beach and elsewhere said there have been few
problems associated with paint-ball guns in Orange County. Using a
paint-ball gun outside a licensed facility is illegal in Newport
Beach and other cities, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   The guns shoot paint pellets at up to 280 feet per second and look
like pistols, rifles, even machine guns. They can cost as much as
$1,500. The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that
paint-gun injuries account for 1,800 emergency-room visits a year
nationwide.</TE>

<HD>GOP Infighting May Trouble Simon Campaign</HD>
<DH>Politics: Discord centers on Bush's top operative in state,
who has angered some conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as Bill Simon Jr. is struggling to unite the fractious
California Republican Party behind his campaign for governor, a new
round of infighting has erupted among state GOP leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The clash threatens to disrupt Simon's effort to build momentum
among fellow conservatives and broaden his appeal to moderates for
his bid to unseat Gov. Gray Davis in November.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the fight is Gerald L. Parsky, President Bush's
top political operative in California. By normal political
calculations, Parsky would be one of Simon's most important allies--a
bridge to the popular president and the vast campaign resources of
the White House. Parsky, a wealthy investment banker, is also the
most powerful player in raising--and deciding how to spend--millions
of dollars for the state Republican Party.</LD>
<TE>   But Simon's come-from-behind victory in the March 5 primary set up
multiple tensions among Parsky, the new GOP nominee and conservatives
who were loyal to Simon before he defeated former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan and California Secretary of State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Simon and Parsky were on opposite sides of a fierce
business dispute in the early 1990s--although they have vowed to put
it behind them as they work to oust the Democratic governor.</TE>
<TE>   There is also political friction: The White House supported
Riordan in the primary. Now, some key Simon supporters are blaming
that on Parsky, the president's most visible West Coast operative.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky also is under fire for the ongoing, Bush-ordered reforms of
the state GOP leadership, which has weakened the conservatives' hold
on the party apparatus. "Gerry Parsky should do the honorable thing
and step aside so that he doesn't become a further embarrassment to
the White House or to the state party," said former state GOP
Chairman Michael Schroeder, echoing the comments of several other
conservative leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, even Riordan campaign insiders say Parsky was steadfastly
neutral during the primary. It was not Parsky, but Riordan's former
business partner Brad Freeman--a close friend of the president who
works largely behind the scenes--who was most influential in winning
White House support for Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's remarks came as an unwelcome jolt to the Simon
campaign. With Parsky planning a Bush trip to California next month
to raise money for Simon, the candidate's team is scrambling to
stifle criticism of the president's California point-man.</TE>
<TE>   The awkwardly timed jab at Parsky, in a Times interview, prompted
Simon advisors to turn their backs on Schroeder--an Orange County
activist whose support they proudly showcased just last month when
they dispatched him to a news conference to trash Riordan as a
disloyal Republican.</TE>
<TE>   "Schroeder is not authorized to make those statements on behalf of
the campaign, and they do not reflect the views of the senior
management of the campaign," Simon's campaign chairman, John
Herrington, said when informed of the anti-Parsky remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "The election of Bill Simon is dependent on a close working
relationship with the president and his designated representative in
California. So far, that relationship has been very close, and Parsky
has been very helpful since the primary was over."</TE>
<TE>   Wounds Won't Easily Heal</TE>
<TE>   The wounds are not easily salved, however, for they reflect both
long-standing and recent disputes between the Simon camp and Parsky.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the primary, Simon's inner circle was dismayed by
Parsky's seeming criticism of the new nominee. The New York Times
quoted Parsky as saying that an "extreme conservative" could not win
in California, and suggesting that Simon's hopes in November depended
on his agreeing to "adopt the formula I describe" to broaden the
party to moderates. Parsky told the San Francisco Chronicle that the
state GOP had to shed its image as a party "dominated by extremists."</TE>
<TE>   Coming just days after Riordan had dismissed Simon as an
"extremist," Parsky's comments were widely seen as an attack on the
nominee. They also revived speculation about lingering bitterness
from the Simon-Parsky business feud.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Mountjoy, president of the conservative California Republican
Assembly, described Parsky as "arrogant" and "out of step with the
rank-and-file Republican in California."</TE>
<TE>   "He believes the party can be run from a country club; all it
takes is money, and forget the grass roots, and change the party
principles so we don't believe in anything," Mountjoy said.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky, who commutes daily in his private jet between his ranch
north of San Diego and his office in Westwood, said he was
misunderstood. He said he does not consider Simon an extremist and
believes he can win if he continues to stress school reforms and the
state fiscal crisis. "I can say very strongly that I will support his
candidacy," Parsky said.</TE>
<TE>   As for his business dispute with the candidate and his late
father, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, Parsky
denied there was lasting friction.</TE>
<TE>   "Any differences were with his father," Parsky said.</TE>
<TE>   When the breach occurred, though, Parsky cast Bill Simon Jr. as a
key source of the conflict. Parsky, now 59, had been a top aide to
Simon's father during the Nixon and Ford administrations, when the
elder Simon was Treasury secretary. In the late 1980s, Parsky and the
elder Simon became partners in a wide array of savings-and-loan and
other investments. They abruptly broke ties in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "I totally lost trust and confidence in Gerald L. Parsky and no
longer wished to be associated with him either professionally or
personally," William E. Simon said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky Says Simon Cut Ties</TE>
<TE>   Parsky gave a different account to Forbes magazine in 1992, saying
Simon had cut their business ties because Parsky had refused to make
Bill Simon Jr. a full partner.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr. declined to discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It really had to do with things between Dad and Gerry, and that's
really about as far as I want to take it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Simon and Parsky are working together. Parsky was in
Sacramento last week at a Simon appearance with Republican leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, Bush's chief political strategist at the White House,
said Simon and Parsky have been "very positive" about each other.
Since the primary, Parsky has helped to rally Riordan supporters and
others behind Simon, and he remains "the leader of our political team
out there," Rove said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's there to help facilitate whatever the Simon campaign wants
within reason from the White House and from the Bush people," Rove
said.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky's ties to the Bush family date to 1976. At the time, former
President George Bush was director of the CIA. He met from time to
time with Parsky, whose frequent travels abroad for the Treasury
Department required him to keep in close touch with the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky cultivated a friendship with the elder Bush. The former
president once described Parsky in a videotaped testimonial as "not
afraid to roll up his sleeves and get involved in the political arena
when a lot of people are running for cover." During Bush's 1992
campaign, First Lady Barbara Bush stayed at Parsky's ranch.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Parsky spent time with their son, George W. Bush, then
governor of Texas, at the Republican National Convention in San
Diego; Parsky was a leader of the city's convention host committee.
Two years later, they met again when Bush was raising money in
California, and Parsky eventually signed on to lead Bush's California
presidential effort.</TE>
<TE>   Bush lost the state by 1.3 million votes, but maintained
confidence in Parsky. The president has put Parsky in charge of his
selection process for the state's federal judges, U.S. attorneys and
marshals. It's a role normally filled by a U.S. senator or governor
from the president's political party, but in California all three are
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 2000 election, Parsky's main political task has been to
"professionalize" state Republican Party operations, giving big
donors a greater say in how their money is spent. Parsky's reforms
have stripped party Chairman Shawn Steel of most of his powers, a
move that provoked sharp dissent from Steel, Schroeder and other
party insiders. Under the new system, party spending is controlled by
a five-member operations committee dominated by Parsky and his ally,
state Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   That party overhaul continues to divide state Republicans. During
an operations committee meeting last week, Parsky and Brulte scolded
Steel for sending e-mails casting Parsky in an unfavorable light to
scores of party activists.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, perhaps, Ron Rogers, Simon's new representative
on the committee, joined in taking Steel to task. But Simon
strategist Sal Russo said GOP leaders were "all on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   "Our basic attitude is that we want a unified Republican Party,"
he said. "And I know we have it."</TE>

<LD>Tommy Hill, 72, who wrote the country music classics "Slowly" and
"Teddy Bear" and played a key role in the success of independent
Starday Records, died Thursday in Nashville. He had suffered from
heart and liver problems.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Falls City, Texas, Hill was a respected fiddler and
guitarist who recorded for Decca and other labels but never scored a
hit of his own. As a songwriter, his greatest success was as
co-writer of "Slowly," which stayed atop the Billboard country chart
for 17 weeks in 1954. He also wrote "Teddy Bear," a No. 1 hit for Red
Sovine in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   Hill partnered with Starday owner Don Pierce in 1959, engineering
and producing records for Dottie West, Merle Kilgore, Lonzo and
Oscar, and other artists. In the 1960s, Hill and guitarist Pete Drake
formed an independent company, Stop Records. Hill formed Gusto
Records in 1972.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gwen Davenport, 91, a novelist best known for "Belvedere," a story
about a curmudgeonly English housekeeper that was made into three
movies and a sitcom, died of congestive heart failure Saturday at a
Louisville, Ky., nursing home.</LD>
<LD>   "Belvedere," published in 1947, was a light, comic novel about the
adventures of an English butler who goes to work for a dysfunctional
American family to obtain material for a book. It inspired the ABC
television series "Mr. Belvedere," which ran from 1985 to 1990 and
starred actor Christopher Hewett.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, it had formed the basis for three movies starring Clifton
Webb, beginning in 1948 with "Sitting Pretty." He also starred in
"Mr. Belvedere Goes to College" and "Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell."</LD>
<TE>   Davenport was born in Panama to a Navy physician and his wife.
Among her other novels were "Bachelor's Baby," "The Wax Foundation"
and "Candy for Breakfast."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Big John Patton, 66, a soul-jazz organ player known for his
innovative deployment of the Hammond B3 organ, died Tuesday of
complications from diabetes and kidney malfunction in Montclair, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Patton started out on the piano and played with rhythm and blues
singer Lloyd Price from 1954 to 1959. He left Price and took up the
organ. By the early 1960s, he was making his own recordings and
collaborating with saxophonist Lou Donaldson, guitarist Grant Green
and drummer Ben Dixon in a band led by Donaldson.</LD>
<LD>   For several years during the 1960s, he led his own soul-jazz trio,
which included Clifford Jarvis and James "Blood" Ulmer, and made 11
albums for the Blue Note label.</LD>
<TE>   Later he recorded albums such as "Soul Connection" and "This One's
for J.A." for the labels Nilva and DIW.</TE>
<TE>   His career enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s when John Zorn hired
him to play the "Erotico" track on his 1986 album, "The Big Gundown."
Their collaboration coincided with a comeback for 1960s organ jazz.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hans-Georg Gadamer, 102, a leading German philosopher, died of
undisclosed causes March 13 in Heidelberg, Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Gadamer was one of the best-known practitioners of philosophical
hermeneutics, the systematic interpretation of texts. His major work
on the subject "Truth and Method" was published in 1960.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Marburg, Germany, Gadamer received a doctorate in
philosophy from the University of Marburg in 1922. He taught there
and at universities in Leipzig, Frankfurt and at Heidelberg
University, where he retired in 1968. After retiring, he served as a
visiting professor at major universities in the United States,
including Catholic University.</LD>
<TE>   Alert until the end, Gadamer told a reporter the week of his 102nd
birthday in February, "Man cannot live without hope--this is the only
statement that I would like to continue defending without
reservation."</TE>

<HD>Past Sex Crime Catches Up to Pastor</HD>
<DH>Canoga Park: Paul Ilger is ousted from his church after his
arrest for failing to register as an offender. He had served time for
molesting students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An associate pastor who served four years in prison for child
molestation has been ousted from his Canoga Park church, nearly nine
months after his arrest for failing to register as a sex offender.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Henry Ilger, a former second-grade teacher, was convicted in
1988 of molesting four students in his San Luis Obispo classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Ilger, now 50, has been removed from his position with Hope Chapel
of the Valley, the church announced Monday. A church member said
Ilger was fired last week.</LD>
<TE>   "Upon discovery that Mr. Ilger violated the residency reporting
conditions of his probation, [the church] obtained Rev. Ilger's
resignation from ministry. Mr. Ilger has been completely cooperative
and submissive to these ecclesiastical requirements," according to a
statement issued by the International Church of the Foursquare
Gospel, a Christian Pentecostal denomination.</TE>
<TE>   The church also has taken unspecified internal steps "to ensure
that such a situation does not reoccur in the future."</TE>
<TE>   After prison, Ilger moved his wife and two daughters to the San
Fernando Valley and joined Hope Chapel of the Valley, where he rose
through the ranks to became a trusted pastor.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, Ilger was arrested after police learned he had failed
to register after changing addresses twice in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   As a sex offender, Ilger is required under state law to notify
local authorities each time he moves.</TE>
<TE>   He lived briefly in North Hollywood and then moved to Van Nuys. In
July 2000, he bought a house in West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Ilger pleaded guilty last month and, because it was a third-strike
conviction, could face a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. He is
scheduled to be sentenced in Van Nuys today. Prosecutors are seeking
his imprisonment for at least 32 months.</TE>
<TE>   Although church officials knew of Ilger's molestation conviction
when they hired him, most members of the congregation didn't find out
until recently.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Deyan, 43, of Van Nuys said Ilger told him he had been
convicted "for being a tree-hugger" and that his crimes involved work
as an environmental activist.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming suspicious, Deyan drove to San Luis Obispo to
review Ilger's court file.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel totally betrayed," Deyan said. "I feel lied to by my
church."</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Jeff Fischer acknowledged in a recent letter to the court
that the congregation, in retrospect, would have been better served
by the leadership's full disclosure about Ilger's history.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer said he and about 30 church elders knew that Ilger had
molested young girls before he was hired, and, as a precaution, they
restricted his church duties.</TE>
<TE>   Ilger was not supposed to be alone with children under 16 or work
with the children's ministry, Fischer wrote.</TE>

<HD>Oscar Wins Are Talk of the Town</HD>
<DH>Movies: Day after awards, many blacks are praising the
historic achievements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Halle Berry sobbed through her acceptance speech as best
actress, attorney Erica Teasley and her sister, Laura, watching at
their parents' Baldwin Hills home, cried with her.</LD>
<LD>   "As soon as they announced her name, just seeing her
reaction--that was enough to get you started," said Teasley, western
regional counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</LD>
<LD>   When Denzel Washington strode up to the stage to receive his
Academy Award for Best Actor, Darren Price shouted for joy at a
friend's house in North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Sidney Poitier received an honorary Oscar and thanked all
the black actors who came before him. "I can sit here and cry just
thinking about it again," said Sheila Frazier in her office at Black
Entertainment Television, where she is assistant director of network
talent.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday morning, Frazier and her friends included the historic
Oscar wins in their 7 a.m. prayer line, a daily conference call among
black men and women of varying ages and occupations.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my prayer partners said, 'What's your dream, Sheila?
What's your dream? If last night taught you anything, just do it,'"
said Frazier, who had roles in "Super Fly" and "California Suite" in
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "So I ran out with my head shots--which I had been slow in getting
reproduced--and went to Anderson Graphics and said, 'I want 500
pictures,'" she said. "I am inspired to act again."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired or just elated, many African Americans on Monday were
savoring the Oscar wins of Berry and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The historic awards were the talk of morning radio--with comedian
and talk show host Steve Harvey scoring the biggest coup when he got
Washington to call his show for a live interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in 'The Color Purple' years, it wasn't like this," said Ken
Johnson, who just got laid off from Boeing. "I write screenplays
myself. Now I've got time to hustle them around town. Maybe I'll be
up there in a few years getting an Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   As attorney Lynda Sheridan waited on a bench with her client
outside a courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, they took a moment to
acknowledge the Oscar victories. Sheridan's client flashed the front
page of The Times, with pictures of Berry and Washington, and smiled
at her attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, the Oscar wins were dissected in coffeehouses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete buzz," said Bobby Ross, who works in film and
music, sitting outside a Starbucks in Ladera Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "Denzel goes to my church," Ross said. (That would be West Angeles
Church.)</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he had a chance. I thought Russell Crowe would win
again. Thirty years ago, Diana Ross lost--"</TE>
<TE>   "'Lady Sings the Blues,'" his friend, Gregory Barmore,
interjected, recalling the film that earned the former Supreme a
nomination for best actress.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe she would win then," Ross said. "I didn't have
any idea that Halle Berry would win."</TE>
<TE>   From this Starbucks, you can walk to Pann's Restaurant, where
Halle Berry--who won the Oscar playing a waitress in "Monster's
Ball"--practiced waitressing.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was in there," said Kevin Boyd, a TV writer. "He called
me and said, 'Get down here, Halle Berry's serving pancakes!'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the wins by Berry and Washington were celebrated by
people of all colors. "When I looked at the way Julia Roberts hung
herself around Denzel Washington, that said it all," Frazier said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the talk, whether over lattes or radio airwaves, was about
how Berry and Washington were recognized for their work, not for
being black.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to overshadow their work by saying, 'It's a black
thing.' Denzel was well overdue," said Sheridan, who lives in Ladera
Heights.</TE>
<TE>   There was also some angst over what the awards signified.</TE>
<TE>   On one radio talk show exchange over Berry's film role, "People
were saying the Academy honored her in that role because they were
willing to honor blacks in derogatory roles," Sheridan said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't get anything, you complain," she said. "When you
do get something, you complain about how you got it."</TE>
<TE>   Deconstructing the win was part of the intense though good-natured
debate among the regulars at the Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason he got it was because Russell [Crowe] was acting
up in the last few weeks," said Tami Hamilton, an administrative
assistant in a venture capital firm. "I don't even think Denzel was
expecting it.... I think it was just a token thing."</TE>
<TE>   "You think Russell Crowe's performance was better than Denzel
Washington's?" Boyd asked her incredulously. "Just because he was
playing a bad cop? I think he deserves some credit because he was so
believable. We've never seen Denzel in a role like that."</TE>
<TE>   If Washington's role in "Training Day" sparked discussion on the
Starbucks patio, Berry's in "Monster's Ball"--which features her in
an explicit love scene with a white man with a racist past--triggered
even more talk.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of controversy about whether she should have done
the role," Hamilton said. "Honey, that's a whole other story."</TE>

<HD>A Writer Comforts Jewish Children Touched by Tragedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot up the North Valley Jewish Community
Center in 1999, nursery school teacher Sylvia Rouss volunteered to
work with the preschool children traumatized by what they had seen.</LD>
<LD>   Many were alarmed every time someone new came into the classroom.
Every loud noise and disrupted routine made them tense and fearful.</LD>
<LD>   Because Rouss is a writer as well as a teacher, she found a way to
comfort them with language. A frightened little frog emerged from
somewhere in her subconscious, a frog that might help the children
find their courage and hearten others.</LD>
<TE>   Because Rouss' work is steeped in Jewish tradition, the frog
happened to be one whose brethren rained down on Pharaoh in the
biblical account of the Jews' bondage in Egypt and their deliverance.</TE>
<TE>   The story is retold every year at Passover, which begins this year
on Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   A rhyme that seems to etch itself into young brains appeared in
the book that resulted, "The Littlest Frog," published last year:
"The littlest frog was very afraid. He hid under the bed, and that's
where he stayed." The littlest frog eventually comes out from under
Pharaoh's bed, and Pharaoh ends up cowering under it.</TE>
<TE>   Rouss, 51, is among a handful of authors who write for young and
very young Jewish children and the adults who buy books for them.
According to Darlene Daniel, owner of Pages, a children's bookstore
in Tarzana, "The Littlest Frog" sells briskly this time of year to
parents celebrating Passover with their children and to those
attending a seder and seeking a gift for the child who may be asking
the traditional four questions or hunting for hidden matzo.</TE>
<TE>   The author of almost two dozen titles, Rouss realized there was a
paucity of holiday books for Jewish youngsters a dozen years ago when
she found herself writing original material to use with her students
in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   She now teaches at the Stephen S. Wise Temple Nursery School in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional wisdom at the time held that holidays could not be
taught to 2-year-olds, Rouss recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But she knew she could do it if she used catchy rhymes and vivid
illustrations.</TE>
<TE>   Rouss gives kudos to her illustrators, Holly Hannon, Katherine
Kahn and Lisa Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   "The written word, for little children, isn't enough," she said.
"You need the visual."</TE>
<TE>   Published in 1992, Rouss' first book was "Fun With Jewish Holiday
Rhymes." Her second, published the following year, launched a series
featuring a winning arachnid named Sammy Spider.</TE>
<TE>   The book, "Sammy Spider's First Hanukkah," was a natural, in spite
of Rouss' fear of spiders, "because a spider has eight legs and there
are eight days of Hanukkah."</TE>
<TE>   Sammy typically begins his adventures as an outsider who longs to
participate in the lives of the Jewish families he lives among. That
sense of not belonging is familiar to children, Rouss said: "So often
children see themselves as the other, and especially Jewish children
see themselves as the other."</TE>
<TE>   Rouss said she wanted to write a Hanukkah story to give Jewish
youngsters a sense of the beauty of their own holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Jewish child and a Jewish family, you have to work at being
Jewish," Rouss said. "It's not out there in the stores for you.
Children were intrigued by Christmas, and I don't blame them."</TE>
<TE>   Rouss said that one of the great pleasures of reading from her
work, which she is often invited to do, is hearing a roomful of
children spontaneously chant favorite lines such as "Spiders don't
spin dreidels. Spiders spin webs."</TE>
<TE>   Compelling characters are key to Rouss' appeal, Daniel said, along
with her rhymed couplets, which give an upbeat, jaunty tone even to
material with religious themes.</TE>
<TE>   "Her books are truly loved, and I believe that is because children
identify with her characters, who are little people observing the
larger world," Daniel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rouss said she sees the roots of Sammy, with his loving mother and
irrepressible curiosity, in such classic Disney films as "Bambi."</TE>
<TE>   "The animal characters are often very curious, and they have this
doting mother who indulges them and is teaching them at the same
time," said Rouss.</TE>
<TE>   Rouss, who has three grown children, is about to publish a new
series with a human protagonist. The series "Growing Up Jewish with
Sarah Leah Jacobs" deals with the milestones of Jewish life, from
bris to death.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what possessed her to write a lighthearted book, such as
"The Littlest Frog," about divine retribution, Rouss laughed: "That's
the one plague that children are really drawn to because frogs are
seen as funny, silly and whimsical."</TE>
<TE>   As a bookseller, Daniel praised Rouss' choice of biblical
calamities: "It sure beats boils."</TE>

<LD>Scientists are closely watching more than 500 kids in the Salinas
Valley. UC Berkeley scientists and a variety of local agencies want
to know how environmental pollutants such as pesticides, pollens and
mold affect the health of children and what can be done to prevent
exposure.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Health Assessment of the Mothers and Children of
Salinas has been following these children, many from farm worker
families, since before they were born. The study is to determine how
pollutants sneak into homes.</LD>

<LD>East Bay counties again have been listed among the top destinations
for legal immigrants to the U.S., outranking the San Francisco area.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakland metropolitan area, which includes all of Alameda and
Contra Costa counties, ranked 10th on the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's list of areas where immigrants said they
planned to live in fiscal year 2000. It outranked the San Francisco
area, which includes San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties.</LD>
<LD>   The largest number of immigrants came from Mexico, followed by
China, the Philippines, India and Vietnam, according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   The INS didn't have a breakdown of where the East Bay's immigrants
came from, although the 2000 U.S. Census shows huge gains in the
area's Asian and Latino populations, probably through both
immigration and births.</TE>

<HD>State Auditors Review Impact of Secession</HD>
<DH>Finances: Mayor Hahn asked for the study of LAFCO's
assessment of the effects of an L.A. breakup. The work could cost
$300,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the 11th floor of a high-rise office building in Culver City, a
team of state auditors is poring over financial documents by the box
load.</LD>
<LD>   Their work could help determine whether Los Angeles continues to
be the second-largest city in the United States, or is split into
four smaller municipalities.</LD>
<LD>   The auditors, at a cost of up to $6,600 per day, are figuring out
whether a new city in the San Fernando Valley would operate with a
$60-million surplus without harming what would be left of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn says no. Valley secessionists--along with
those in the Harbor area and Hollywood--say yes.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the key multimillion-dollar study by the Local Agency
Formation Commission that will determine whether residents are
allowed to decide the question for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At Hahn's demand, state Controller Kathleen Connell is conducting
the 45-day review. "The independent review by our office gives it a
stamp of approval or disapproval," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Expectations are very high, but we are very limited in what we
can do," she said. "I am not allowed to opine for or against
secession. I am limited to determining whether the financial review
is complete and accurate, and whether the methodology is valid."</TE>
<TE>   Connell said that what she has seen so far has not raised any red
flags about fundamental flaws in the LAFCO report.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel they have made an effort to look at everything in the
report," Connell said. But she said it is "premature" to say what her
office will conclude on the specific questions raised by the city.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of municipal divorce look to Connell to raise questions
about the financial analysis, forcing reconsideration by LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely she will come up with a finding saying you have not
met the state requirements to put this on the ballot," said Larry
Levine, a founder of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "What I hope she finds is that LAFCO's conclusions are not
justified by the data," Levine said. "How can you cut services and
say that is not harmful?"</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the Connell review is critical, given that LAFCO's
executive director, Larry Calemine, was a founder of a former
secession group three decades ago, and an alternate on its board is
the chairman of Valley VOTE, the main secession group.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes as no surprise, then, that every fact and finding is
being twisted and distorted to support a preconceived determination
that secession is viable and harmless," Levine wrote in a letter last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn authorized spending up to $300,000 on the study because he
said the LAFCO study fails to consider that Los Angeles would be left
with more than $300 million annually in costs without Valley tax
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's office submitted more than 1,000 pages of documents to
Connell in an attempt to show that Los Angeles taxpayers would be
forced to fund the same levels of police communications, library book
catalogers and other functions even after the Valley, Harbor and
Hollywood split away.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the points of contention:</TE>
<TE>   * That proposed alimony payments from the Valley to the rest of
Los Angeles are too small because LAFCO underestimated the
centralized costs Los Angeles would have to continue to pay. LAFCO
said that as the Valley splits away, many centralized costs would be
reduced.</TE>
<TE>   * That projected reserves in the new Valley city are too low and
will result in a decrease in services or increase in taxes. LAFCO
found the reserves adequate.</TE>
<TE>   * That LAFCO failed to adequately analyze the effects on the
remainder of Los Angeles once the Valley stops contracting for
services during a transition. LAFCO found the analysis adequate.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to spend a few hundred thousand dollars to get the
information we need," said Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for Hahn. "To
have full confidence in the LAFCO analysis, we'd like to have another
look at the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   In a familiar refrain, Jeff Brain, the president of Valley VOTE,
accused the city of trying to muddy the waters with box loads of
documents that do not make sense. He said it is not logical that city
officials, including the City Council, will not be able to cut their
spending after a third of the city breaks away, as the city claims.</TE>
<TE>   When she ran for mayor last year, Connell was repeatedly described
as opposed to secession. But this week, she said she is neutral.
Brain thinks her professional review will determine that the city's
complaints lack validity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to vindicate LAFCO and say LAFCO did the right
thing, that it's a good study," Brain predicted.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO's Calemine, who has defended his financial studies, noted
that he has broad discretion to act on Connell's findings or not. He
could simply attach her report to the one already done by LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he will likely give her findings scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "If she has recommendations, we will look at them very seriously,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors' Decisions Made Mostly Behind Closed Doors</HD>
<DH>Ethics: About 90% of official business is done without
public debate. Practice is defended as efficient way to dispose of
routine matters.</DH>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors makes more than 90% of
its official decisions without any public debate, spending millions
of taxpayer dollars on contracts, settling major lawsuits and making
policy changes behind closed doors or without discussion.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors and their staffs discuss much of the county's business
in private meetings, a practice that may be illegal and that recently
has become the focus of public attention.</LD>
<LD>   County Administrator David Janssen meets every Monday with the
supervisors individually to discuss the Tuesday agenda. And the
supervisors' deputies regularly gather to debate upcoming items in
meetings. Neither Janssen's sessions nor the deputies' gatherings are
advertised to the public, and yet substantive issues are discussed at
those meetings.</LD>
<TE>   That, according to open government advocates and experts, is
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "They hammer out issues and take information back to the
supervisors and eventually a consensus is reached," said Richard
McKee of the California First Amendment Coalition. "People who have
been involved in this can see that the business is done by the time
the meeting is held."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors and Janssen defend the long-standing practice as an
efficient way of disposing of routine matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine times out of 10," Janssen said, "by the time [the matters]
come to the board the problems have been resolved. If we had to walk
through the meeting item by item and vote, you'd be there for days
and add no value to the discussion."</TE>
<TE>   The board's penchant for privacy recently surfaced after the
inadvertent release to The Times of records relating to the
supervisors' secret attempts to thwart an initiative last year. The
district attorney is reviewing a complaint brought by a county union,
and the supervisors are expected to discuss some of their practices
at their weekly meeting today, when they will debate a motion by
Supervisor Gloria Molina to require future closed-door board meetings
to be tape-recorded.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the private meetings between deputies and with
their administrative officer, the supervisors' public sessions are
often short and perfunctory. The weekly sessions are usually over by
lunchtime.</TE>
<TE>   A review of county reports from a year's worth of board meetings
reveals that just 7% of the items before them are discussed publicly
at a supervisor's request. The rest are acted upon without
discussion, continued to another date or are debated in closed
session.</TE>
<TE>   Some recent examples include:</TE>
<TE>   * After Sept. 11, supervisors met privately on a number of
occasions and approved $6.8 million in new spending without public
debate.</TE>
<TE>   * The board recently went behind closed doors to discuss smoke
alarms in foster homes, a matter that supervisors said was justified
by the need to protect the privacy of foster children killed in a
fire.</TE>
<TE>   * In at least two cases, supervisors have justified privacy by
saying that their actions might invite others to sue them, a position
ridiculed by 1st Amendment specialists.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1999, the county's entire $15-billion budget was debated and
voted upon in 49 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While some supervisors say they favor opening their staff meetings
to the public, others insist that there is nothing wrong with meeting
behind closed doors, and that most of the private deliberations are
administrative, not substantive. Similarly, they say the vast bulk of
the undebated items are so routine that none is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's self-evident that there's nothing to discuss. Public Works
has decided you need a traffic sign, or the extension of contracts,"
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. "The ones that are controversial or
substantial, they are held" for discussion.</TE>
<TE>   When questions do arise, they often are not raised during the
meeting. Rather, contentious issues often are postponed to allow the
supervisors or their staffs to discuss them out of public view.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the intent of the private meetings is not
malicious.</TE>
<TE>   "Things don't get continued to work out deals," he said. "Things
get continued more often than not, if it's me, to make sure that I
and my staff understand what's being done and have a comfort level
with what's being done."</TE>
<TE>   Experts on state open meeting laws say the current web of private
meetings is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In a written opinion and a pamphlet on open meeting laws, the
California attorney general's office has consistently argued that
public agencies should conduct their work in public--with only
narrowly defined exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it likely that a court would determine that matters
which have been placed on an agenda are to be deliberated and acted
upon by the legislative body in a public meeting," the attorney
general's office wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general warned officials against attempting to
circumvent the rules by working through their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   Conversations among elected officials or their staffs that
"advance or clarify a member's understanding of an issue, or
facilitate an agreement or compromise amongst members, or advance the
ultimate resolution of an issue" are not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Janssen does during his weekly meetings with board
members before the public session. He said that is efficient, and
stressed that he does not count votes. But the attorney general has
warned about the consequences of such an approach.</TE>
<TE>   "If these communications are permitted to occur in private, a
large part of the process by which members reach their decisions will
have occurred outside the public eye," the attorney general's office
wrote. "In this way, the public is able only to witness a shorthand
version of the deliberative process and its ability to monitor and
contribute to the decision-making process will have been curtailed."</TE>
<TE>   No Checks and Balances in County Government</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County is hardly the only California government to be
accused of disregarding state laws requiring public access to
government deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Some state agencies have ignored public-access rights, and smaller
jurisdictions throughout California have been sanctioned for their
refusal to give citizens information to which they are entitled.</TE>
<TE>   But the consequences are particularly far-reaching at the county,
a government larger than that of many states and by far the biggest
local government in California. Unlike the state government
itself--with its judicial, executive and legislative branches to
check one another--the county is run by just five supervisors. The
supervisors, in effect, are both the executive and legislative
branches of county government.</TE>
<TE>   Even the sheriff and district attorney--independently elected
officials--receive their annual budgets from the supervisors they
occasionally are called upon to scrutinize.</TE>
<TE>   The board's commitment to open government has been questioned in
recent weeks because of revelations that the supervisors
surreptitiously voted 4 to 1 in December to scuttle an initiative
intended to raise the salaries of low-paid home health-care aides.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Michael Antonovich, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Don Knabe
and Molina voted in favor of that move, which would have killed the
initiative by refusing to provide a title and summary, without which
proponents cannot gather signatures to place the measure on the
ballot. Only Yaroslavsky opposed that move, which was intended to
force the advocates to sue the county.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when the supervisors' lawyer, Lloyd Pellman, discovered
that the board was about to break the law with that approach, he
notified them and reversed course--again, without any public notice
or meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing controversy has pitted the supervisors against one
another and caused some to publicly question Pellman's competence as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had our issues with closed session, that too much
gets put in there, and Gloria's always trying to get things into the
public light," said Alma Martinez, Molina's chief of staff. Molina
has complained that it was Pellman's telephone calls that broke the
law, not the initial vote.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman maintains that no laws were broken. A conversation about
whether to sue naturally would include other options, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, Pellman adopted a similar position, saying
that the board's debate over whether to take over a separate body,
the Proposition 10 Commission, could be done in private as potential
litigation because the action probably would get them sued.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Olson, a San Francisco-based 1st Amendment lawyer, said
Pellman is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a specific threat of litigation," Olson said. "It
can't just be, 'We're doing something stupid and we're going to get
sued,' because then government would do stupid things all the time."</TE>
<TE>   It often is difficult even to discern what the supervisors are
considering behind closed doors because many items are cryptically
described on the agenda as "anticipated litigation," "department head
evaluation" or "conference with labor negotiators," with no further
detail.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors also at times "adjourn" their meetings to be
continued another day. A few are continued again and again, sometimes
taking on altogether new business.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case, for instance, in the deliberations over the
health-care initiative. The board first met Dec. 18 on a variety of
issues and continued that meeting to Dec. 21 to discuss hiring a
health director. The meeting was again continued until Jan. 4, but at
that session the topic was Pellman's handling of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Issues Usually Debated in Public for a Reason</TE>
<TE>   When supervisors do discuss an issue publicly, it is typically to
call attention to their actions or to illuminate strongly held
differences or failures of a particular county department.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the supervisors' agenda includes 76 items per week. Of
those, the supervisors discuss an average of five items in public,
and they generally receive a staff report on one more. About five
items generally are continued to another meeting, and four or five
others generally are taken up in private.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the board held a series of closed-door meetings on
terrorism readiness and security. Yaroslavsky and Molina raised
questions about holding one of the meetings in secret, but ultimately
joined their colleagues in the back room, where they approved $6.8
million worth of new spending. Once approved, the new spending was
publicly disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, board deputies regularly meet to discuss items before
they reach the public meeting for supervisors' approval. The county's
own lawyer in 1994 said that meetings by the supervisors' health
deputies should be posted and open to the public. The county counsel
later reversed itself and allowed the meetings to be closed.</TE>
<TE>   The health deputies inform interested parties of their meetings
and allow them to attend, but do not formally post their agendas.
Molina has objected to that format and last year briefly ordered her
staff not to attend because health aides were using the meetings to
make decisions and were summoning and grilling county department
heads.</TE>
<TE>   Knabe, while acknowledging that staff members do meet before the
supervisors' regular public sessions--and that the supervisors
themselves consult with their administrative officer--nevertheless
said he is confident the law is being followed.</TE>
<TE>   "I make the decisions on how I vote, not my staff," he said. "The
one thing that I always pounded into my staff is: 'Remember, your job
is to gather information and give me information. You don't speak for
me in advance or say the supervisor may support this.'"</TE>

<HD>Police Seeking Clues to Killing of Oxnard Man</HD>
<DH>Crime: No motive is apparent in the weekend shooting death
and firebombing at the home of a mentally disabled 61-year-old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fatal shooting of a 61-year-old mentally disabled man over the
weekend continues to baffle Oxnard police, who can find no motive for
the brutal attack.</LD>
<LD>   Isaac Hughes, who police said had the IQ of a 7-year-old, was shot
to death and his house firebombed about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the
1800 block of Ferrara Way.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they have no evidence that the crime was racially
motivated; Hughes was black and the neighborhood is predominantly
Latino. Investigators also have found no gang connection.</LD>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to show what happened; it's still a whodunit
now," said Oxnard Police Det. Randey Cole, who is investigating the
case. "It's strange that someone would pick him. Maybe they hit the
wrong house. We are looking at all these different angles."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Fire Department investigator Rod Thorpe said the Molotov
cocktail used in the attack was powerful enough to have burned down
the house, killing everyone inside. The firebomb was made from a beer
bottle with a makeshift wick and flammable liquid.</TE>
<TE>   "[The residents] were very lucky they discovered it as early as
they did," he said. "Had it gotten in a bit farther and hit the
carpet it could have been disastrous."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how many people were involved in the attack, in
which eight gunshots were fired through Hughes' bedroom window,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The .22-caliber bullets left a line of holes in the wall over the
bed where Hughes was sitting and listening to gospel music. One
bullet hit him in the chest, authorities said. At least one other
round went through the wall into the next room, narrowly missing
Hughes' sleeping mother and niece.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the firebomb was hurled through the kitchen window in the
front of the house. The noise woke the family, who doused the flames
and then checked on Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "I knocked on his door and called, 'Isaac! Isaac!'" said his
niece, who declined to give her name. "When I saw him, I knew he was
killed. He was slumped over the bed. No one could live through that."</TE>
<TE>   The family members, six of whom live in the ranch-style house,
gathered in the kitchen Monday looking at the blackened linoleum
where the firebomb landed. Angelus Daly, Hughes' sister, said she
wants to move, after having lived there for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we can go to Camarillo. I am so dumbfounded by this," she
said. "Isaac was into church. He loved church and listening to gospel
music."</TE>
<TE>   The family said they had not been racially harassed and didn't
believe race played a part in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Vasti Taylor, 87, said her son Isaac was born in Houston and had
lived in Oxnard for 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was handicapped, but the sweetest person you ever knew," she
said. "He was like a child."</TE>
<TE>   Aspen Bailey, 16, another niece of the victim, said that two days
before the shooting Hughes was sitting outside the house when two men
got into a car owned by a family member.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew he was slow, so they told him they were taking it to
get fixed," she said. "And they stole it."</TE>
<TE>   Some relatives and neighbors think the killing was an attempt to
keep Hughes from talking. But police said they had no reports of a
stolen car from the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker, or attackers, may have fired through drawn blinds
and may not have known Hughes was inside, Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody knows what happened, either the relatives or the
neighbors. We have no way to tie it all together yet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several remembered Hughes as a man who liked to sit in his
frontyard, play guitar and sing Christian songs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here for 30 years and can't imagine why anyone would
want to kill Isaac," said neighbor Mancel Canchila, 45. "Everyone
walking by, he would say good morning to."</TE>
<TE>   David Davis, 33, Hughes' nephew, echoed those sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was very selfish of someone to do this," he said. "He
didn't deserve what happened to him. He didn't mess with anyone."</TE>

<HD>Slumlord Agrees to Settle Suit, Pay DWP $1 Million</HD>
<DH>Housing: Lance Robbins says he'll keep buildings in decent
condition and pay delinquent bills. Judge wants a system for
monitoring properties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A landlord with one of the worst records of slum housing violations
in Los Angeles has agreed to an out-of-court settlement in which he
pledged to maintain his buildings and to pay $1 million in delinquent
Department of Water and Power bills.</LD>
<LD>   The landlord, Lance J. Robbins, also agreed to pay $200,000 to a
tenants group and its lawyers in the deal presented for certification
Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Ralph Dau took note of
the $1-million DWP payment, but gave both sides 30 days to come up
with a mechanism for monitoring living conditions at 23 buildings
under Robbins' control.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed last year by Bet Tzedek
Legal Services and the private law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher on
behalf of tenants' rights group Inquilinos Unidos and a former
Robbins tenant, Laura Ochoa. The Los Angeles city attorney's office
was also part of the action.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a good agreement," said Lauren Saunders, an attorney with
Bet Tzedek, a nonprofit law center serving low-income tenants. "We
got pretty much everything we wanted. He's giving us a list of the
properties he's involved in and has committed to personally keep them
safe and in decent condition, and has assured us that there is not
going to be any retaliation against tenants."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo praised the agreement as a
"landmark settlement" against a landlord who has troubled the city
for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "What this does is create a much-needed mechanism to [maintain]
the quality of the buildings that are under his ownership," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins could not be reached for comment, but an attorney who
represents him said the landlord was also pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "He runs his buildings very well considering where they are--in
overcrowded neighborhoods where conditions are tough for landlords to
deal with," said attorney Rosario Perry. "His repairs are quick and
efficient. We have had no problems in two years."</TE>
<TE>   Perry said the 53-year-old landlord denies there are any problems
with living conditions in his buildings and claims that he has been
responsible for rehabilitating 6,000 units in the city in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, Robbins was accused of operating a complex web of
sham corporations to hide his ownership in nearly two dozen apartment
buildings, frustrating efforts by the city's Slum Housing Task Force
to force him to follow codes.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins, who lives in Playa del Rey, has provided the court with a
list of 23 buildings in which he is involved as manager or as an
attorney representing owners. While he continues to maintain that he
doesn't own any of the buildings, he has agreed to notify the court
if there are any changes of ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't own any apartment buildings," Robbins said in an
interview in 2000. "I only represent the owners."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Robbins said it may appear to tenants that he is an
owner because he often represents the owners' interests in the
buildings he manages.</TE>
<TE>   "They come after me because I'm the guy who shows up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins' problems with the city date back to the mid-1980s, when
he faced civil and criminal charges for operating substandard housing
at various low-income apartment buildings.</TE>
<TE>   He was fined $500 for a misdemeanor health code violation, in the
first of eight convictions he would receive over the years for health
and safety violations that included rat and cockroach infestations.
He was sentenced to a 30-day jail term in 1987 after pleading no
contest in two slum cases and admitting that he violated parole in an
earlier one.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Robbins agreed to donate $5,000 to the nonprofit
Children of the Night in connection with another violation. He
pleaded no contest to three fire code violations at a 63-unit
building he runs and was ordered to serve 18 months probation.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very clever," said Gary Blasi, professor of law at UCLA.
"He has made a mockery of the legal system."</TE>
<TE>   Robbins has not ingratiated himself with other landlords.</TE>
<TE>   "He destroys our reputation," said Harold Greenberg, president of
the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles. "He should follow the
laws like the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Tenants in a Robbins-run apartment building on West Third Street
near downtown L.A. gave Robbins mixed reviews. The building has been
remodeled to attract upscale tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problems," said Nidia Reyes, who pays $550 a month for
a one-bedroom unit. "No leaks, no cockroaches, no mice. When
something breaks they repair it."</TE>
<TE>   But across the hall, Michael Malry painted a different picture.</TE>
<TE>   A tenant for less than a year, Malry said he waited four months
before workers fixed the leaks in his bathroom. The iron gate at the
front of the building and the intercom are routinely broken.</TE>
<TE>   "From July to November, I couldn't use my bathroom sink and when I
took a shower I had to put down paper towels," said Malry, who is
being evicted for nonpayment of rent. "The owner doesn't care. I've
never lived in a place like this."</TE>
<TE>   Perry said Robbins, his client, is not to blame. He said Robbins
is called upon by other building owners because he's very
knowledgeable about the restoration and repair of aging apartment
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a doctor you call in when a patient is sick," Perry
said. "You don't blame the doctor for the patient being sick. He's
there to help."</TE>

<LD>A Metrolink train struck a big-rig truck as it crossed the tracks at
5th Street and Del Norte Boulevard in Oxnard on Monday evening,
injuring the truck driver.</LD>
<LD>   None of the northbound train's 60 passengers was known to be hurt,
police said. The driver, Mike LaFrance, 52, of Palm Springs, was
taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   His condition was not immediately available.</LD>
<TE>   The truck, with an empty refrigerated trailer, was stopped on the
tracks at Del Norte about 6:30 p.m., waiting to pull into traffic on
5th Street, Oxnard Police Officer Karl Dyer said. "Apparently he
couldn't get out" as the train approached, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer said the crossing lights were operating, but he didn't know
whether the gate had come down.</TE>

<HD>Unions Win Key Ruling on Fees</HD>
<DH>Labor: Appeals court says nonmembers in an organized shop
can be charged for recruitment efforts elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor unions may charge nonmembers at companies where they have a
contract for the costs of recruiting at competing firms, a federal
appeals court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 11-0 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco is the first decision on the controversial issue from a
full appellate court.</LD>
<LD>   If the ruling stands, it means that unions in California and 27
other states will have more money to organize. That will enhance
their ability to recruit members and improve their position at the
bargaining table at workplaces where they already represent
employees, according to labor relations experts.</LD>
<TE>   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor
federation, praised the decision, saying that it would help both
unionized and unorganized workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased that the 9th Circuit has so strongly reaffirmed
what America's union workers have long known--that the best way to
win good wages and benefits is to organize," Sweeney said. "Helping
other workers form unions strengthens everyone's hand at the
bargaining table, and makes our communities better places to live."</TE>
<TE>   The National Right to Work Legal Foundation, which represented
several workers protesting the use of their dues for organizing, said
it was disturbed by the ruling and would appeal it to the U.S.
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "No worker should be forced to fund the recruitment of supporters
to a private ideological cause," said Stefan Gleason, vice president
of the National Right to Work Foundation, a staunchly anti-union
group based in Virginia that is a companion group to the legal
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Labor law experts were divided on whether the ruling would be
upheld.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, since Sweeney was elected president of the
AFL-CIO, unions have spent an increasing amount of their resources on
organizing in an attempt to arrest membership declines. Unions spend
10% to 50% of their budgets on organizing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, union leaders believe that it is crucial to organize
workers at companies that compete with employers where labor unions
already exist to strengthen their hand in collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   The decision does not affect workers in the 22 states that have
so-called "right to work" laws, where employees cannot be compelled
to join a union, even if there is a collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In the other 28 states, employees at workplaces with collective
bargaining agreements are required to pay dues for the administration
of the contract and other services. But there is a limitation on what
they can be charged for.</TE>
<TE>   For example, under a 1988 Supreme Court decision, Communications
Workers of America vs. Beck, workers cannot be forced to pay full
union dues if some of those funds are used for political purposes
such as lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's 9th Circuit decision stems from the contention that
workers who do not belong to a union at a workplace where there is a
union contract should not be required to pay for that union's
recruiting drive at a competing employer.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, in a 4-1 decision the National Labor Relations Board
rejected the contention of the nonmembers.</TE>
<TE>   The board held that organizing was "germane" to collective
bargaining and therefore the employees could be charged for the
organizing activities at other workplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Challenges to NLRB decisions go straight to federal appeals courts
across the country. In this instance--a case involving several
supermarkets where the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers represents
employees--a panel of the 9th Circuit initially reversed the board's
decision in a 3-0 ruling issued in May.</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel cited a 1984 Supreme Court decision, Ellis
vs. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks, which held
that under the Railway Labor Act a union was not permitted to charge
nonmembers for organizing activity outside its bargaining unit. The
panel acknowledged that this case arose under a different
statute--the National Labor Relations Act. However, the panel said
that in prior cases the Supreme Court ruled that the two laws were
"in all material respects identical."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges, led by Stephen
Reinhardt, perhaps the most liberal judge on the circuit, reversed
that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt said the three-judge panel had not acknowledged
significant differences between the Railway Labor Act and the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).</TE>
<TE>   When Congress enacted the NLRA, it created the NLRB to provide an
initial review of disputes that arise under that law. No such agency
was created to interpret the railway act.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt also said the three-judge panel had failed to give
proper deference to the NLRB's findings in this case.</TE>
<TE>   The NLRB's decision in the case "was supported by extensive
research and data on organizing and collective bargaining in general,
as well as with respect to the retail food industry," Reinhardt
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Numerous studies by economists and labor scholars ... documented"
that the higher the percentage of unionization in an industry, the
higher the wage rates, Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling Praised by Legal Scholar</TE>
<TE>   "The NLRB's findings reveal that management is far more willing to
negotiate higher wage rates when its competitors are subject to the
same union costs," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, "the NLRB found that for NLRA industries, organizing
within the competitive market is germane to collective bargaining,"
Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine L. Fisk, a labor law professor at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles, praised the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's right that the National Labor Relations Act and the
Railway Labor Act are different," Fisk said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, William F. Gould IV, who teaches labor law at
Stanford Law School, said that although he was sympathetic to the
decision on policy grounds he thought it was wrong on the law.</TE>
<TE>   "The Supreme Court, in the 1980s, made a terrible, terrible
mistake" when it ruled in the Ellis case that organizing expenses are
not germane to collective bargaining, said Gould, who served as
chairman of the National Labor Relations Board in the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing more germane to collective bargaining than
organizing," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "However, the Supreme Court does not agree with that and only
Congress or the Supreme Court can change that," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that in most instances the Supreme Court has held that the
Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act are
interchangeable and he expressed doubt that the Supreme Court would
agree with the distinctions drawn in Monday's 9th Circuit decision.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Gould said he hoped that the Supreme Court would
"revisit the issue and recognize what they did in the Ellis case is
fundamentally wrong."</TE>

<HD>Violent Crime Down in Ventura</HD>
<DH>Police: Crackdown on gangs is credited in part for 18% drop
in serious assaults. But identity and car thefts increased sharply in
2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With serious violence plummeting, reported crime dipped slightly in
Ventura last year despite an increase in larceny and auto theft,
police reported.</LD>
<LD>   Felony violence fell 18% in 2001, as aggravated assaults dropped
from 230 to 160, a reduction police attributed partly to a crackdown
on youth gang members.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had a very successful gang violence suppression program,"
Ventura Police Lt. John Garner said. "I'm sure that's been a major
contributor. I know that's made a major difference in our city."</LD>
<TE>   Ventura remained, however, the local city with the highest crime
rate for the eight categories of violence and property offenses
included in the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reports.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's crime rate of 32.9 offenses per 1,000 residents is
slightly higher than Oxnard's and Santa Paula's. But when violence
alone is considered, Ventura's rate is far lower than that of its two
closest neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's violent-crime rate--a ratio of murder, rape, robbery and
felony assaults to population--was 2.7 per 1,000 residents last year,
compared with 4.6 in Oxnard and 4.3 in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Total offenses in Ventura dropped by three crimes last year, to
3,370, compared with the year before. But that plateau comes after a
decade of sharp decline. Since 1991, serious crime in Ventura is down
about 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a decline across the nation, " Garner said. "There's
been a buy-in to do more community policing."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there are more officers on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that a patrol officer, who 10 years ago was more
reactive to crime, is now more proactive to his beat," Garner said.
"He recognizes that if he doesn't do something about a problem soon,
it may result in a crime."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a 30% drop in serious assaults, home and business
burglaries dropped nearly 13% last year, from 646 to 565.</TE>
<TE>   Garner said that is because thieves have shifted their focus from
breaking into buildings to stealing identities. Countywide, identify
theft is one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises, authorities
say.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a lot of people who were committing burglaries are now
finding it more financially rewarding to do identity theft or theft
of mail," Garner said.</TE>
<TE>   That often consists of stealing credit card or bank account
numbers from the mail or dumpsters behind retail businesses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So while burglaries were down 81, thefts were up 116.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicle thefts also increased sharply, from 196 to 231. Garner
said crime analysts don't really know why, although thieves stole
more often from auto dealerships last year than in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   Rape was the only violent crime category to show an increase--from
18 to 28.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at that number, you think, 'Do we have a serial
rapist?'" Garner said. "But of those cases, the assault was by an
acquaintance, a husband, ex-husband, boyfriend or friend."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 28 cases, 11 were attempted rapes, he said. And in five of
the assaults, the victims thought they had been drugged.</TE>
<TE>   "These types of cases are being reported more because of an
increase in awareness by the public," Garner said. "[Date rape] has
been in the media a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura crime has been up sharply since two years ago, partly
because of a change in crime reporting procedures. In mid-2000, the
Police Department began to follow FBI guidelines by documenting petty
thefts when citizens first report them, instead of waiting for
follow-up paperwork.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Ambassador and Publisher Annenberg, 94, Is Hospitalized</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Retired publishing magnate and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg was
in a hospital with an undisclosed illness Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 94-year-old former ambassador to Great Britain was
hospitalized near his home in Rancho Mirage, about 100 miles east of
Los Angeles, an employee in Annenberg's business office in St.
Davids, Pa., confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't know what the prognosis is, but we're hoping he'll get
back home," said the employee, who identified herself only as Joann.
She said that Annenberg had been hospitalized several times in the
past.</LD>
<TE>   Coachella Valley developer and friend Tim Blixseth said Annenberg
was taken to Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, although
hospital officials would not say whether he was there.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg, who created TV Guide, is listed by Forbes magazine as
the world's 87th richest person, with $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg was ambassador to Great Britain during the Nixon
administration. He has given more than $1 billion to educational and
medical causes.</TE>

<HD>Hazardous Waste Site Seeks to Reopen</HD>
<DH>Environment: Saying that closure poses risks, owners of the
San Bernardino County facility are contesting the state's efforts to
shut it down permanently.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIALTO</DL>
<LD>In bloated drums and railroad cars, it began piling up two decades
ago and was left, state officials say, to fester. Long-forgotten
ordnance, the lead compound used to make detonating fuses, an acid so
potent it was once harnessed to fuel torpedoes--it's all here, hidden
in the recesses of a 20-acre hazardous waste storage facility.</LD>
<LD>   The waste stored at Denova Environmental Inc., in the northern end
of this San Bernardino County city, was so volatile that it ignited
spontaneously last year, causing a brief fire and sending
firefighters scrambling to develop contingency plans for evacuating
the north end of Rialto.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing that simply moving the chemical canisters could cause them
to explode, firefighters called in the FBI and the local bomb squad
to blow up 55-gallon containers of chemicals.</LD>
<TE>   Already temporarily shut down, the site will be permanently closed
if state environmental officials have their way. Meanwhile, Denova
Environmental is preparing to argue at a hearing next month that it
is riskier to shut down the operation than to keep it open.</TE>
<TE>   Denova is the last private company left in California that is
licensed to store and dispose of certain types of explosive waste,
said Jeanne Garcia, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Toxic Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   State officials concede that if they close the site as planned,
many shipments of explosive waste will have to be sent as far away as
Texas. That will be more expensive for government contractors, law
enforcement agencies and other clients who have counted on Denova to
store and dispose of thousands of gallons of volatile, explosive
chemicals, the company argues.</TE>
<TE>   Potential Risks of Shutdown Cited</TE>
<TE>   What's more, said Charles Whisonant, the Newport Beach attorney
who will represent the company at an administrative hearing next
month in Los Angeles, the state's plan to close Denova would increase
the number of times companies and government contractors must shuttle
hazardous waste out of California. Transporting the volatile waste
across country also increases the risk of dangerous accidents,
Whisonant argues.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it will be a tremendous burden on industry," Whisonant
said. Denova, he said, "provides a service. It gets it out of the
hands of the government contractors or agency and gets it into the
hands of experts in the explosives industry."</TE>
<TE>   State environmental officials, local law enforcement officials and
neighbors remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   They point to a long list of environmental violations at Denova
that they say has been growing for years. Jim Bruce, Rialto Fire
Department battalion chief, chuckled this week when he noticed that
his Denova file is now 4 inches thick. The risks associated with
shutting Denova down, Garcia said, are vastly outweighed by the
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   One inspection conducted by state investigators, in February 2001,
discovered nearly 60,000 gallons of hazardous waste at the
facility--32,000 gallons more than Denova's license allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have a good history," Garcia said. "It poses more of a
risk for them to stay open and continue receiving hazardous or
explosive waste."</TE>
<TE>   Through Whisonant, Denova's acting president, Robert Cole,
declined to comment for this story.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the saga of Denova Environmental mirrors the growing
pains of the Inland Empire. Once a country town that catered to grape
growers and dairy farmers, Rialto today has large pockets of heavy
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Many businesses moved to the region simply because there was more
room there for large manufacturing and storage facilities--and,
environmental activists argue, because the region has not been
particularly strict about policing environmental hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "It sure seems like the regulators are asleep at the wheel at
those places out there, and completely overworked and unable to deal
with the scale of the buildup," said Daniel Patterson, an ecologist
with the Center for Biological Diversity based in Idyllwild and
Tucson. "As L.A. and areas further west got filled in, all that stuff
got pushed out. And things are bound to fall through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are leaving.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, Leonard and Bobbie Cutler bought a former vineyard in
northern Rialto and began building their home. It was in the middle
of nowhere, and at the time, they thought it would be a nice place to
retire.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're retired, and they're getting ready to move.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the industry that moved into the area began to eat
away at their community, said 77-year-old Bobbie Cutler. The traffic
became unbearable as trucks that stopped at the various "big box"
warehouse operations in the region began roaring past the Cutlers'
home 24 hours a day. An explosion at a fireworks plant several years
ago blew out the windows on many nearby buildings, Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   Denova Environmental is a stone's throw from their Locust Avenue
home.</TE>
<TE>   "The stench from that place is overwhelming at times," she said.
"And every time we hear the sirens, we don't know if something is
exploding or what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials plan to widen roads in the area to cope with the
traffic, and the government is preparing to buy the Cutlers' property
as part of the road construction project, Cutler said. The couple
plan to move to Yucaipa--22 miles east, closer to the desert, where
there are still a few vacant hilltops.</TE>
<TE>   "This house had its charm. But not anymore," Cutler said. "Between
the traffic and the smell from that place over there ... well, we
keep the doors and the windows closed."</TE>
<TE>   The Denova site, originally operated by Broco Environmental Inc.,
opened in about 1980. At a largely outdoor facility accessed by a
winding dirt road, ringed by a chain-link fence, it has stored a
laundry list of hazardous chemicals, specializing in certain types of
explosive waste that are more commonly handled by military
installations and government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Whisonant would not name Denova's customers, but said it wouldn't
be unusual for a local law enforcement agency to send ordnance that
it no longer needs to the site.</TE>
<TE>   "If they found out that they did need it, they could come and get
it," he said. "Or we would be the guys that would dispose of it."</TE>
<TE>   After an explosion in 1997, the state moved to revoke the site's
operating permit. Denova Environmental bought the compound in 1999
and had been operating under a temporary permit. But after state
inspectors repeatedly cited it for environmental violations, such as
chemicals that were leaking into the ground, the state fined Denova
$2.5 million and moved to shut it down, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Denova was also one of three companies that sent hazardous waste
to a toxic site in Brownsville, Texas, in hopes of selling the waste
to the Mexican government, Garcia said. The Texas compound has been
declared a federal Superfund site, she said, and Denova was again
accused of mishandling hazardous waste and fined more than $300,000,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Denova has appealed the state's move to permanently revoke its
operating license, leading to next month's proceedings with the state
Office of Administrative Hearings, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Whisonant said Cole, who took over from the former president--Gene
Van Houten, who resigned in the spring of 2000--has spent
considerable money and time trying to rectify Denova's problems.
Whisonant added that there is no evidence of permanent contamination
at the site to soil or ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The company will also contest the $2.5-million fine, which it
believes is excessive, Whisonant said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that to the extent that there were problems at the
facility, these were things that occurred under the previous
management," Whisonant said.</TE>
<TE>   "The current management has been spending a lot of time, effort
and money trying to address their concerns. Not that we agree that
there have been violations at all--but we do recognize that they have
some concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns, Cutler said, should allow the state to permanently
shut the site down. Cutler said she and and others in the area will
be watching next month's hearing closely.</TE>
<TE>   "The air is so rancid that you can't hardly breathe anymore,"
Cutler said. "They haven't been responsible at all."</TE>

<HD>Big Rig Drivers Chafe at Life in the Slow Lane</HD>
<DH>Truckers resent being limited to 55 mph or slower in
California while cars are allowed to go up to 70 mph.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Derden first took the wheel of a hulking big rig at the tender
age of 15, becoming one of the first black truckers in Mississippi.
And one of the youngest.</LD>
<LD>   In the 50 years since, he has rolled through 48 of these 50 United
States and Canada, hauling everything from pork skins to medical
equipment in his red Freightliner truck.</LD>
<LD>   "I've driven as far as you can drive on land," Derden said
proudly, adjusting his San Francisco 49ers baseball cap as he cooled
his heels at Bull's Truck Wash near downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Derden now calls Sacramento home, but the veteran road warrior
said he feels like a second-class citizen on California's freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: Truckers in the Golden State must drive 55 mph or
below and are, for the most part, restricted to the two slowest
lanes. Other motorists can happily cruise at up to 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of only 10 states that impose slower speeds for
trucks. Last year, California put teeth behind the slower speed
limits: Commercial drivers caught exceeding the speed limit by more
than 15 mph can face a more serious punishment than a citation. They
can be charged with a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Derden and his fellow truckers hate it. "I think it should all be
the same speed," he said, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   In those states where all vehicles have the same speed limit,
truckers are asphalt emperors, their 18-wheel behemoths ruling the
highways like bull elephants on the African savanna.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, Arizona and Nevada, for example, truckers can speed
along on the far left, known as "the hammer lane" because they can
truly lay on the gas.</TE>
<TE>   But when truckers cross the border into California, it's life in
the slow lane.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love for them to let us in the hammer lane," said J.R.
Moseley, a 42-year trucker from Alabama. "It would be a lot less
traffic and aggravation."</TE>
<TE>   The truck-speed issue is one of the most contentious topics of
debate among truckers, roadway safety advocates and transportation
experts. It is a debate that has revved up in recent years as several
states considered changing speed limits for big rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Texas raised truck speeds in 1999 from 60 mph to 70 mph. Ohio and
Michigan recently rejected proposals to increase truck speeds. In
2000, legislation to reduce truck speeds in Arizona from 75 mph to 65
mph was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Both supporters and opponents of slower truck speeds claim their
position promotes road safety. Each side cites studies and
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "The research cuts both ways," said Gerald Donaldson, a spokesman
for Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a public interest group
that supports slower truck speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of slower speeds--most notably the American Trucking
Assn.--say the risk of collisions increases when motorists sharing a
road travel at different speeds.</TE>
<TE>   That contention was supported by a 1994 federal study that said a
driver traveling 10 mph slower or faster than prevailing traffic is
six times more likely to be involved in an accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Department of Transportation used that argument to
oppose legislation aimed at reducing that state's 75 mph truck speed
limit.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a potential safety hazard when cars and trucks are
required to travel at different speeds," said Mike Manthey, an
Arizona state traffic engineer.</TE>
<TE>   "Potential conflicts occur when more vehicles are passing one
another, increasing the chances of crashes between cars and large
trucks."</TE>
<TE>   But truckers aren't the only ones who argue against the state's
differential in speed limits. Some roadway safety advocates--such as
the National Motorists Assn. and Citizens for Reliable and Safe
Highways, two national grass-roots organizations--have also urged
keeping speed limits the same for all vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Engineering studies have shown that if everyone is going at the
same speed and the same flow of traffic, you are having a safer
driving environment," said Eric Skrum, a spokesman for the National
Motorists Assn.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the argument for slower truck speeds usually
comes down to this: A 40-ton big rig traveling at 65 mph takes 100
feet longer to stop than one traveling at 55 mph. On a crowded
freeway, 100 feet can mean the difference between a close call and
carnage.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of slower truck speeds, including the California
Highway Patrol, argue that if truckers slow down, they can react more
quickly and avoid more accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply: Speed kills.</TE>
<TE>   "When you increase the speed on these things, you've got 65 feet
or 75 feet of vehicle, weighing 80,000 pounds coming down the road,"
said CHP Officer Richard Moss, who enforces commercial vehicle
violations in Sacramento. "It's difficult trying to get that monster
to stop."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their argument, supporters of slower truck speeds note
that big rigs drive about 7% of all vehicles miles in the nation but
are involved in 9% of all fatal collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Most truckers are pressed to meet tight delivery schedules, and
that often leads to speeding, Moss said. In fact, federal crash
statistics show that speeding is a factor in about 20% of all fatal
truck accidents nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   But statistics like that don't sway truckers like Ron "Shakey"
Rudy, a ponytailed driver from Kansas who was recently hauling
produce out of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   If truckers are forced to drive 15 mph slower than other traffic,
he said, big rigs become a roadway hazard as faster, smaller
passengers cars zip among and around them.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Rudy admits that he and other truckers usually
drive the prevailing freeway speed, even if it is 65 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't it hard to stop a big rig at that speed?</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy doesn't know how to control a truck at that speed, then
California shouldn't have given him a license," Rudy said angrily as
he pulled away.</TE>
<TE>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>Truck Speed</TE>
<TE>Only 10 states impose slower maximum speed limits for trucks.
Truckers say the slower speeds increase the chances of
collisions between cars and trucks. Others argue that truckers
should drive slower because it takes longer to stop a big rig.</TE>

<HD>Man Held on Suspicion of Killing Girl 18 Years Ago in New
York</HD>
<DH>Crime: He allegedly confessed to his former girlfriend,
police say. An extradition hearing is set for Wednesday.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A personal trainer in Los Angeles has been arrested on suspicion of
murdering a girl who lived near him when he was a teenager on Long
Island.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of Manuel Pacheco, 33, on Wednesday in Los Angeles
brings a measure of peace--after nearly 20 years of waiting--to the
family of Angela Wong.</LD>
<LD>   Their 11-year-old daughter went for a walk one July afternoon in
1984 and never came back. The next morning, her body was found in a
shallow creek in the woods a quarter mile from her home in
Massapequa, on Long Island's south shore.</LD>
<TE>   One side of her face was bruised. Her pants were pulled down.
Someone had held her head under water with a log and drowned her,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   In the years after the murder, Nassau County police pursued
hundreds of leads and came up with nothing--until last week. Based on
accounts from a former neighbor of Angela and a California woman,
Pacheco was arrested March 20. He is being held without bail pending
an extradition hearing Wednesday. Second-degree murder charges await
him in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Michael Kuhn of the Nassau County homicide squad, along with
his supervisor, William C. Cocks, deputy commanding officer of the
homicide squad, kept track of witnesses over the years as they moved
away and occasionally reinterviewed them.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, during a routine check of those involved in the case,
Kuhn learned that Pacheco had been arrested in Los Angeles on charges
of molesting one of his children.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a violent nature combined with sexual aggression, and that
cried out for further investigation," Cocks said.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Los Angeles police, Kuhn said he and Cocks located
one of Pacheco's former girlfriends. The woman, whom police declined
to name, said Pacheco told her he had killed Angela.</TE>
<TE>   "She had enough details that we knew to be true," Cocks said.
"She's very credible."</TE>
<TE>   Officers also reinterviewed a former neighbor of the Wongs, who
told them she had seen Pacheco and Angela walk into the woods
together that day. The woods was a shortcut used by neighborhood
children to get to the mall, but Angela's father had said that she
would never venture there by herself.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that Pacheco, then 15, had been one of the teenagers
at Angela's house the day of the murder, and that he told them after
the killing that he had last seen Angela around 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Pacheco moved to Los Angeles in 1990 and now works at
a Los Angeles gym. He never married and has six children with three
women.</TE>
<TE>   Kuhn said Pacheco has hired attorney Christopher Darden, who
prosecuted O.J. Simpson and has since gone into private practice.
Darden could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Crash Prompts Debate</HD>
<DH>Accident: Father of Oxnard teen killed in collision with
CHP car urges more caution in high-speed chases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A crash that killed an Oxnard teen over the weekend has again
prompted debate about how police should conduct high-speed pursuits
through urban areas.</LD>
<LD>   It could be weeks before investigators know crucial details about
the incident, in which a California Highway Patrol cruiser pursuing a
speeder struck another car carrying 18-year-old Jessica Mohorko on
Saturday just after midnight. It has not been determined whether the
cruiser had its flashing lights or siren on at the time.</LD>
<LD>   The victim's father on Monday implored the CHP to use more caution
on the busy stretch of Oxnard Boulevard where the crash occurred and
to reevaluate its policy on high-speed pursuits.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not going to tolerate them speeding through my community,"
said Edgar Mohorko, senior pastor at Messiah Foursquare Church in
Oxnard and a chaplain for the Oxnard Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't go out there to kill my daughter; they were doing
their job," Mohorko said of the husband-wife team of officers
involved. "But the problem is, they are also supposed to be out there
protecting my daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Mohorko died instantly. Her boyfriend, Chris Haynes, who
was driving them to a local restaurant after a school dance, suffered
a broken arm.</TE>
<TE>   Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick on Monday offered
his condolences to the young woman's family and promised a thorough
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he defended policies that allow officers to
drive at a high rate of speed to catch suspects, whether they're
traffic violators or armed felons.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times, unfortunately, when you've got to stop an
individual to ensure they don't continue down the road and do more
damage," Helmick said. "That's a thing you struggle with all the
time. If you simply went the speed limit all the time, they'd keep
going fast and someone else would get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials say Officers Jack and Christina Raughton were trying
to catch up to a speeder on Oxnard Boulevard, a commercial strip with
late-night gas stations and restaurants that connects the Ventura
Freeway to Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how long they had been following the speeder, but
Lt. Steve Munday said the car had run a red light at Vineyard Avenue,
about half a mile north of the collision site.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the CHP said, the Raughtons were not involved in a
chase, because they had not yet notified the dispatcher that one had
begun.</TE>
<TE>   "When they have an actual pursuit, the officer will get on the
radio and say that to the dispatcher," CHP spokesman Tom Marshall
said. "None of that was activated. They were just about to make a
stop, they thought. The driver, to the best of our knowledge, never
knew they were trying to stop him."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have yet to determine how fast the Raughtons'
cruiser was traveling in the 45-mph zone.</TE>
<TE>   According to the CHP, witnesses said the cruiser's flashing light
was on. But Edgar Mohorko said that when he arrived at the scene
about 30 minutes after the collision, no light was flashing.</TE>
<TE>   The Raughtons were not seriously injured but are distraught and
have been placed on paid administrative leave, Helmick said. They
will be interviewed again by authorities this week.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also hope to resolve whether Haynes should have seen
the cruiser coming before he turned left into its path from an
unprotected lane just south of the Gonzales Road intersection.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials said they have no reason to believe Haynes' driving
was impaired but that they would test blood samples that he
volunteered the night of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez declined to discuss the crash,
saying his agency was not privy to details of the investigation. But
overall, he echoed Helmick's comments about police pursuits. "From
time to time, you're going to have police chases that go through
urban areas," Lopez said. "There's a necessity for that. I'm not
going to call for any changes."</TE>
<TE>   Traffic accidents involving emergency vehicles in the city have
claimed two other lives in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In January, an Oxnard police car en route to a domestic
disturbance struck a 20-year-old man crossing Ventura Road. Officials
have said that the cruiser did not have its flashing lights or siren
turned on. An investigation into that incident remains open.</TE>
<TE>   And in May 1996, an Oxnard community activist died after his van
was broadsided by a speeding fire engine responding to an emergency
call. The midday collision occurred as 48-year-old George Valle tried
to make a left turn at the intersection of Oxnard Boulevard and
Colonia Road.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, police pursuits have been declining in recent years.
CHP statistics indicate that chases dropped from 7,817 in 1995 to
5,334 in 2000, and that fatalities have dropped dramatically as well.
During that five-year period, police chases caused 143 deaths,
according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Some police agencies in the state no longer allow chases for minor
traffic violations.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Jessica Mohorko will be held at 7 tonight
at Hueneme High School. An additional service is being organized for
Wednesday evening at a location yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko's viewing will be held Wednesday between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m. at the Messiah Foursquare Church in Oxnard. A funeral is planned
for 10 a.m. Thursday at South Coast Fellowship in Ventura, with
burial to follow at Ivy Lawn Cemetery.</TE>

<DL>DARA-I-SUF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>One icy night in mid-October, a U.S. military advisor who called
himself "Baba John" rounded up villagers in this guerrilla fighters'
paradise and asked them what they wanted when the war was over.</LD>
<LD>   A school. A clinic. Roads that wouldn't turn to mud when it rained.
Pens. Pencils. Grain.</LD>
<LD>   "Baba John offered so many things," recalls Azim Naim Zada, a
community elder. "He told us that if we fought hard against the Taliban,
we'd get so much food we'd grow fat, like him."</LD>
<TE>   The villagers did fight hard, and helped drive the Taliban out of this
rocky canyon about 75 miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif. It was a key battle
in the ground war leading to the capture of the strategic northern city,
and it triggered a Taliban retreat across the country.</TE>
<TE>   But five months later, the people here are still hungry. Waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Their fields are a sandy, seedless, unplowed mess, so heavily mined
that people are too frightened even to venture out to bury the bones
scattered around.</TE>
<TE>   At night, as they huddle over steaming bowls of grass soup, they
listen to wild dogs prowling the hills, looking for corpses.</TE>
<TE>   Many houses have been reduced to crumbled mud, some by Taliban shells,
villagers say, but others by American bombs.</TE>
<TE>   After 23 years of war, Afghanistan has heaps of misery stories. But
this one, buried in an inaccessible region where few foreigners go, has a
hint of betrayal to it.</TE>
<TE>   When Dara-i-Suf, "The Valley of Caves" in the Dari language, became a
center of anti-Taliban resistance at the beginning of the war, villagers
made sure that "Baba John" and the other Special Forces troops had the
best caves, along with rugs to line them and make them comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   The locals volunteered as soldiers, translators, guides and cooks. The
Americans liked the kebabs, many remember.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. military officials have no plans to return to Dara-i-Suf, or
to send help. Of the 65 humanitarian aid projects underway or proposed by
the military for northern Afghanistan, none involve this area.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd imagine Special Forces would say whatever they needed to, to win
cooperation from locals," said Maj. Martin Rose, an Army civil affairs
officer based in Mazar-i-Sharif. "That doesn't mean we're going down
there."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials wouldn't discuss details of Special Forces tactics,
but several said it was basic strategy during the war's early days to
offer aid assurances.</TE>
<TE>   The Army civil affairs office has deployed more than a dozen soldiers
in Afghanistan to fix generators, rebuild schools and open fire stations.
But most projects are in larger cities such as Kabul, Kunduz and
Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Dara-i-Suf is a string of little settlements stretched in canyons
between 1,000-foot rock walls where light barely reaches. There are no
roads in or out, just icy rivers to slog through. Few aid agencies work
here, despite food shortages and illness, including a disease local
people call "black leg," which cuts off circulation and hobbles hundreds
of people.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three years of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, Dara-i-Suf
served as a refuge for the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. After the
Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif in August 1998, 5,000 Northern Alliance
troops, including top commanders, retreated here.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban swept after them, taking over mountain ridges and shelling
the village below. They raided homes, cut down almond trees, stole sheep
and butchered civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "They turned me into a beggar," said one widow, Jumabegom, whose
husband was shot and hacked into pieces.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban also burned down the market, once the pride of the valley,
a 600-stall bazaar of pelt shops, blacksmiths, bookstores and cafes.</TE>
<TE>   However, the momentum turned when U.S. Special Forces soldiers arrived
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials wouldn't discuss the operation, except to say
that Special Forces troops worked closely with Northern Alliance leaders
in the area. But several Afghan commanders said that two helicopters
landed in a canyon near Dara-i-Suf one night in mid-October and that
eight U.S. advisors stepped out.</TE>
<TE>   More arrived during the next week to plan an air and ground assault on
the hundreds of mountainside Taliban bunkers that formed the front line.
The lead American advisor, villagers say, was a thick man who appeared to
be about 50 years old, didn't carry a gun and always introduced himself
as "Baba John." Baba means grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knew Baba John," said Esmatullah Ahmadi, an Alliance
commander. "He used to walk through the villages, saying to the people,
'Tashakor, tashakor,' " meaning "Thank you, thank you."</TE>
<TE>   "He promised big bags of grain and rugs for our schools," Ahmadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say that when the attacks began, several villages near the
front line were flattened by U.S. bombs, including Balooch, where they
say 45 civilians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us were lucky and hid in caves," said Mohammed Nabi, a
Balooch elder. "But the others"--he clapped his chalky hands together
once--"crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Col. Rick Thomas, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said
American warplanes repeatedly bombed the area. There was no information
on civilian casualties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite hundreds of Northern Alliance casualties, the offensive
overwhelmed the Taliban forces, pushing them back to Mazar-i-Sharif and
then east to Kunduz, where thousands of Taliban members surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   Many Alliance leaders remember Dara-i-Suf as a turning point--the
place, as commander Haji Wahab put it, where "the Taliban melted."</TE>
<TE>   The mountaintops still glisten with the litter of war: shells, bullet
casings, bleached bones of fallen soldiers and thousands of foil wrappers
from airdropped food rations.</TE>
<TE>   "We were expecting more," a former soldier, Rhoullah, said as he
stepped over a Pop-Tarts package, a strangely common sight here.</TE>
<TE>   A mile away, a sinewy man pressed ahead with two donkeys and a plow.
He turned around abruptly when he reached something shiny on the
hillside, leaving a conspicuous unplowed patch. Unexploded bombs and
mines are big problems here. Last week, a shepherd was killed chasing a
sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Although the British de-mining agency HALO Trust has removed 7,477
mines from northern Afghanistan this year, no technicians have been to
Dara-i-Suf, so it remains too dangerous for aid providers.</TE>
<TE>   Most Northern Alliance leaders who lived in the caves and fought in
the canyons haven't been back either, including Haji Mohammed Mukhaqiq,
now the planning minister for the interim government in Kabul, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Mukhaqiq said he had been busy with government
business and expressed regret that he hadn't done more to help Dara-i-Suf
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Man forgets soon," he said, quoting a Persian saying.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Jumabegom, the widow, insisted on boiling her last
chicken for a guest.</TE>
<TE>   While she was tending the pot, her 3-year-old son bolted into the
yard.</TE>
<TE>   "Tayara! Tayara!" ("A helicopter! A helicopter!"), the little boy
yelled as the rumble of a heavy engine grew louder, perhaps signaling the
arrival of foreigners. But it was just an old truck hauling dirt,
struggling over rocks in the river.</TE>

<HD>In Need? Call the Warlord</HD>
<DH>Ismail Khan, not the struggling interim government, runs five
provinces in western Afghanistan. He holds all the key titles and
dispenses all the favors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HERAT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The emir of the west, his excellency the lord and high ruler of
five provinces, Gov. Ismail Khan, was seated on a plush love seat, his
stubby fingers clicking a set of red prayer beads. He was about to answer
a question he considered impertinent. His dark eyebrows shot up, and his
wild silver beard began to twitch.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't need any military trainers," he said, responding to a
suggestion that U.S. Special Forces troops are training his soldiers. "We
know quite well how to fight."</LD>
<LD>   For the last quarter of a century, Khan has been leading men into
battle--against the Soviets, against fellow commanders, against the
Taliban. He is a man of many titles: emir, general, governor, commander.
But more than anything else, Ismail Khan is a warlord.</LD>
<TE>   In a nation where warlords write the rules, Khan is a king among
kings. No rival threatens his primacy in a swath of western Afghanistan
roughly the size of Utah. With thousands of men under arms and an armada
of tanks and cannons, he is one of the country's most powerful men. Every
civil servant and functionary in five provinces answers to him.</TE>
<TE>   Khan was the first warlord to receive a personal visit from interim
Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. The British general who heads the
international peacekeeping force in the capital, Kabul, traveled to Herat
for an audience with him. So did a delegation of former Taliban leaders
who begged for the release of 600 men imprisoned by the warlord, who
himself was jailed by the Taliban for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's struggling interim government cannot survive without
accommodating Khan and a handful of other dominant warlords. Khan has
promised to cooperate with Karzai's government, but he is an ethnic Tajik
and Karzai is a Pushtun. Another Pushtun, former Afghan king Mohammad
Zaher Shah, will have to contend with tribal leaders like Khan when he
returns to Afghanistan after 29 years in exile.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting among warlords allowed the Taliban to take power in 1996. But
now, after battling to defeat the Islamic extremists, warlords and their
followers feel entitled to retain their positions of power.</TE>
<TE>   In the east, Hazrat Ali, Haji Abdul Qadir and Haji Mohammed Zaman are
jockeying for power in the Jalalabad area and have national ambitions.
Other potential threats to Karzai's government include Gul Agha Shirzai
of Kandahar and former President Burhanuddin Rabbani.</TE>
<TE>   Among Afghan warlords, Khan is unique. Unlike his competitors, he has
a firm grip on his territory and seems uninterested in ruling the entire
country. Unlike Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, who changes
allegiances as often as he changes socks, Khan is steadfast and loyal to
what he considers the interests of western Afghanistan and, of course,
himself. And unlike some less powerful warlords who lack a steady source
of income, Khan has few cash flow problems.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, long convoys of trucks heaped with consumer goods and
foodstuffs lumber 60 miles across a rutted dirt track from the Iranian
border to Herat, a provincial capital of about 150,000 people located
along the old Silk Road that linked China and Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Just west of town, the trucks stop at a dusty outpost marked by a worn
rope stretched across the road. There, every trucker and every driver of
a used car bound for resale in Herat pays customs.</TE>
<TE>   The money does not go to the central government. It goes to Ismail
Khan. His photograph, not Karzai's, graces government buildings in these
parts.</TE>
<TE>   "In Kabul, the government cannot even pay the people's salaries. The
central bank doesn't function," Khan said. "Here, we pay the people.
Here, we have regularity. Here, we have discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Khan is, by all means, a man of discipline. He rises well before dawn,
his functionaries say, and is at his desk at Herat's provincial office
complex by sunrise. There, he attends to his warlord duties. Basically,
he goes to meetings. They stretch on all day, through dinner and into the
early morning.</TE>
<TE>   Dark, unheated government offices are filled with men in turbans,
pacing and drinking tea. They are waiting to see their emir. There are
officials and businessmen from the five provinces ruled by Khan. There
are dignitaries from Kabul, local military commanders, policemen and
merchants. They all need Khan's permission or blessing.</TE>
<TE>The Go-To Guy for Personal Crises</TE>
<TE>   Khan may be a warlord, but he also is the governor of Herat province
and the top civil official for four other provinces.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't carry a weapon, but he does carry a day planner stuffed
with notes and official documents. He's in charge of finances, the civil
service, roads, schools, social welfare, taxes and every other untended
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   He's also the go-to guy for personal crises.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, pressing against metal gates guarded by Khan's gunmen,
hundreds of ragged men and women await an audience. A toothless man named
Noor Ahman, 70, wants Khan to restore the watchman's job taken from him
by the Taliban. Gula Bakht, 35, her face cloaked by a blue burka, wants
money to feed her eight children. Kalisa Azam, 34, also covered by a
burka, wants restitution for the death of her husband, killed fighting
the Taliban, and for her 10-year-old daughter, Fahima, who lost a leg to
a land mine.</TE>
<TE>   The supplicants say they have been waiting for up to six days. Few, if
any, will actually speak to Khan. Some will pour out their stories to a
functionary. A few will receive money, food or a letter instructing one
of Khan's ministries to provide assistance. Hundreds more will follow
them to the gates the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yes, his excellency the emir is a very busy man. He sleeps just
three hours a night, maximum," said Nasir Yousofi, who carries the title
director of hospitality in Khan's Foreign Ministry. Yousofi insists that
visitors address Khan as "your excellency emir," or "your highness."</TE>
<TE>   No man can be a warlord without a healthy ego. But Afghan politicians
say the level of corruption and thuggery that characterizes Khan's rule
is tolerable, in contrast to the blatant profiteering, extortion and
drug-running that fuel the enterprises of most warlords.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say I don't work for the best interests of the people of
Herat," Khan told a visiting delegation one afternoon. "Compare me with
other commanders"--Khan doesn't use the term warlord. "Do I have an
expensive car?"</TE>
<TE>   "No!" shouted his gunmen and supporters in the audience. (Actually,
Khan is driven around town in a new silver four-wheel-drive Toyota Land
Cruiser with tinted windows--technically the property of the Herat
government, Yousofi explained.)</TE>
<TE>   "Expensive computers?" Khan asked the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "No!"</TE>
<TE>   "Do I own a single acre of property?"</TE>
<TE>   "No!"</TE>
<TE>   "These other commanders," Khan said, "they seem to own half of
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   There is one more thing that distinguishes Khan: He can play the Iran
card.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Bush administration portrayed Khan as a central figure
in an Iranian scheme to undermine the U.S.-backed government in Kabul and
extend Iran's influence in western Afghanistan. The Americans accused
Khan of accepting money, weapons and military training from Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Khan denies the accusations but asserts that he has strong "brotherly"
relations with Iran. He mentions the long common border, the two nations'
long-standing economic ties and the Persian tongue that some Afghans
share with Iranians. There is also the fact, uncomfortable from the
American viewpoint, that Iran provided Khan with refuge after the Taliban
drove him from Herat in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We get no help from any country, not even from our own government in
Kabul," Khan said, speaking the Persian dialect Dari. "So the Americans
should not worry so much about Iran."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. complaints about Iran have obscured Khan's little secret: He has
good relations with the Americans too.</TE>
<TE>   Like other warlords aligned with the Northern Alliance, Khan received
U.S. cash, weapons and air support during the war against the Taliban and
Al Qaeda. And according to his security guards, the Americans are
providing rudimentary military training to some of Khan's
soldiers--despite Khan's insistence that American money and training
ended after he retook Herat from the Taliban in November.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's security officers say his relations with the Americans are so
good that he is permitting Special Forces soldiers to live in a hilltop
fortress he built for himself when he was Herat's governor from 1992 to
1995.</TE>
<TE>   When American soldiers began setting up humanitarian projects at
schools and hospitals and in rural areas around Herat recently, Khan
assigned them armed bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure we had his permission," said Curt, a U.S. Army
captain whose surname cannot be published under military guidelines. "He
was very friendly, very helpful. He keeps telling us to let him know
right away if we don't get full cooperation from his ministers."</TE>
<TE>A Reputation for Ferocity and Liberalism</TE>
<TE>   Khan, 55, has the crisp, rigid bearing of an army officer. He is a
squat, powerfully built man with a large square head and majestic beard.</TE>
<TE>   He normally appears in public wearing an imposing black-and-white
turban, a spotless white tunic and a tan field jacket.</TE>
<TE>   He can be imperious. He showed up late for Karzai's inauguration in
Kabul in December, making a grand entrance and forcing Karzai to
acknowledge him. Khan also has a reputation as a fierce and cunning
military commander.</TE>
<TE>   But Herat is Afghanistan's artistic and cultural center, and by the
brutal standards of Afghan warlords, Khan is something of a liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Most warlords have several wives; Khan has just one. He has shocked
Afghans by suggesting that a woman could effectively run the country.</TE>
<TE>   One of Khan's first acts after driving out the Taliban was to reopen
Herat's girls schools and readmit women to the university. He also lifted
the Taliban edict requiring women to wear burkas, though virtually all
Herat women continue to wear the head-to-toe garments in public.</TE>
<TE>   "The emir, he has done wonderful things for women. He believes in
women's rights," said Aziza Saai, the principal of Mehri Herawee High
School for girls, where Khan personally escorted girls to class on
opening day Jan. 9. His photo now hangs over the school's entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Western aid officials, who were harassed and robbed by the Taliban in
Herat, say Khan declared that the region could not rebuild without
increased Western relief aid.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very reasonable man," said the director of one relief agency.
"He has staff people dedicated to relief operations. They actually wear
ties and speak English--and they listen to you."</TE>
<TE>   Amir Usman, Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan in the early 1990s,
described Khan as "very people-friendly, a trait you don't see in other
commanders. He behaves very much like a common man."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in Herat speaks highly of Khan. Pushtuns, the single
largest ethnic group in Afghanistan but outnumbered here by ethnic Tajiks
like Khan, say his gunmen have robbed, raped and killed Pushtuns in
retaliation for atrocities committed by the Pushtun-dominated Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Ghulam Sakhi, 50, a Pushtun from Herat province, said Khan's soldiers
kidnapped two of his cousins from a checkpoint in January. He carried a
letter of complaint he wanted to deliver to Khan.</TE>
<TE>   Janagha, 25, a Pushtun from a neighboring province who goes by one
name, said his brother was kidnapped and killed by Khan's men after he
went to complain about beatings they had inflicted on his relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are Pushtun, it's like they have a license to kill you,"
Janagha said. "We were happier during the Taliban time. Now, under this
man Khan, it's the time of the warlords again. No one is safe."</TE>
<TE>   Other Pushtuns complained that Khan's men punched and pistol-whipped
supporters of the exiled king during a rally in Herat.</TE>
<TE>   A Pushtun delegation of former Talibs braved the dangerous road from
Kandahar to Herat to seek an audience with Khan. They carried a thick
file of complaints accusing Khan's soldiers of murder, rape and
kidnapping of Pushtuns. They also demanded that the warlord release 600
accused Talibs imprisoned without access to lawyers or families.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Wakil Achakzai, a tall, bearded Pushtun who led the
delegation, said he did not fault Khan personally.</TE>
<TE>   "Emir Khan is a good man," he said. "He is very strong. But
unfortunately, he does not control his men."</TE>
<TE>Pushtuns Wait Two Days for Meeting</TE>
<TE>   Khan made the Pushtuns wait for two days before agreeing to meet with
them. Then, on the day of the meeting, he made them wait an hour and
watch from afar as he grandly reviewed his troops and tanks.</TE>
<TE>   When Khan finally addressed the Pushtuns, he rubbed his eyes and
arched his back.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked until 3 o'clock this morning," he told them. "Then I slept
three hours and prayed and went back to work. Now I have a terrible pain
in my side, and my doctor says I should stay in bed for three days. But
instead I came here, because I want to solve our country's problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns seemed unmoved. They began shouting and waving their
complaints in Khan's face. The emir eyed them coldly and ordered them to
sit down and keep quiet. He produced his own folder of complaints from
Tajiks abused by the Taliban and read them aloud. He mocked the visitors,
asking them why so many Pushtuns who lived in the Taliban stronghold of
Kandahar were now claiming they were never Talibs themselves.</TE>
<TE>   He reminded them that he had been imprisoned in Kandahar by the
Taliban for three years. He told them of digging a hole beneath his
toilet in a futile escape attempt. He described how his family had been
swindled out of $100,000 it raised to gain his release by selling its
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns fell silent. They knew the prison tale was a prelude to
Khan's decision on their own 600 imprisoned sons and brothers. And
moments later, Khan announced that any prisoner who had fought for the
Taliban would not be released.</TE>
<TE>   "They have sold out their country," Khan said. "So stop asking me
about these Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Khan seems haunted by his prison ordeal. He said he was betrayed by a
fellow Northern Alliance commander who was paid by the Taliban to lure
him to a 1997 breakfast meeting, where he was captured.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's escape from a Kandahar prison in 2000 is legendary. After
paying the $100,000 bribe and an additional $20,000 that also failed to
secure his freedom, Khan said, he was befriended by a Taliban prison
guard named Hekmatullah who had served under Khan against the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatullah offered to help him escape if Khan would arrange to have
the guard's family taken to safety in Iran. Khan agreed. According to
accounts provided by relatives of soldiers jailed with Khan, Hekmatullah
gave Khan a set of keys and then distracted the other guards. Hekmatullah
followed Khan out of the prison, where Khan's supporters waited in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle. They escaped Taliban pursuers in helicopters
and cars but hit a land mine as they sped toward the Iranian border. Khan
suffered shrapnel wounds to his feet, and Hekmatullah was wounded in the
leg.</TE>
<TE>   After recovering in a remote village, according to the accounts, Khan
and the guard were driven to western mountains controlled by Khan's
soldiers and from there to Iran, where he began raising an army.</TE>
<TE>   Trained at an Afghan military academy, Khan has been a military
officer his entire adult life. He rose to prominence in March 1979 when,
as a captain in the Afghan army, he refused orders from the Soviet puppet
government to open fire on an anti-Communist mob in the Herat bazaar. He
then led an uprising in which scores of Soviet advisors and their
families were massacred and their corpses mutilated. In retaliation,
Soviet aircraft bombed and strafed the city, killing thousands of
civilians, according to press accounts.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a decade, Khan led anti-Soviet guerrilla forces in western
Afghanistan. Afterward, he served as governor of Herat province until his
forces were routed by the Taliban in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, supplied with cash and weapons by Iran and the U.S.,
Khan's army headed back toward Herat. But a day before he reached the
city, the Taliban fled, driven out by American warplanes and a mutiny by
a well-armed citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   Khan was quickly chosen governor by a council of elders, according to
Sultan Hamidi, 57, who has run an antique shop in Herat for the last 35
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the emir returned, everybody hated their lives," Hamidi said.
"Time was stopped. Now we are free. So, tell me, who else could we have
chosen?"</TE>
<TE>   Khan now rules one of Afghanistan's most stable and prosperous
regions. Herat's bazaar is loaded with electronics, clothing and prepared
foods from Iran. Fruit, nuts, meat and vegetables are plentiful. The
city's spectacular main mosque is pristine, untouched by war. Even
Herat's traffic lights work.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's soldiers and police are everywhere. There is a 10 p.m. curfew;
motorists driving after the deadline are confronted by soldiers who point
AK-47s at their foreheads until they come up with the nightly password.
Those who fail the test are hauled away for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents seem to welcome the renewed sense of order.</TE>
<TE>   "Emir Khan has made Herat a livable place again," said Abdul Salam
Sadaat, a police officer and childhood friend of Khan. "As soon as he
came back, land mines were cleared and roads were opened and buildings
were repaired."</TE>
<TE>   The emir insists that he will cooperate with the Kabul interim
government, which includes his son, Sadeq Mir Wais, 28, a Cabinet
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Khan says he agrees on the need for a national army, though he has not
offered to relinquish control of his private force. And he says he
welcomes an expansion of the international peacekeeping force beyond
Kabul to "regions where there is no security." Clearly, he does not
consider Herat among them.</TE>
<TE>Subordinates Point to Their Remuneration</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Gul Agha Shirzai, the U.S.-backed warlord in Kandahar,
threatened to send 20,000 soldiers to Herat to attack Khan's army and put
an end to his alleged complicity with Iran. At the mention of Shirzai's
name, Khan grunted and then laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not worried about Gul Agha," he said. The assault never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   The emir's western provinces are secured by men such as Noor Mohammed
and Abdul Halim, who say they hid in the mountains during the Taliban
era, mounting guerrilla attacks. Even then, they say, with their emir in
jail or in exile, he still managed to pay them.</TE>
<TE>   "The emir, he cares about his fighters," said Halim, a bony,
white-bearded man toting a heavy machine gun not far from Khan's customs
post. He and Mohammed were posted outside one of Khan's military
garrisons, where a sign reads: "Real security comes from the heart of the
people."</TE>
<TE>   The two men said they had no interest in serving in a national army,
for they had heard the Kabul government doesn't pay its people.</TE>
<TE>   "We would fight for our emir even if he didn't pay us," Mohammed said.</TE>
<TE>   Halim nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "But you know," he said, "we fight even better when we are paid."</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Plants Said to Face Big Attack Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The nation's 103 nuclear power reactors are vulnerable to a
potentially catastrophic terrorist attack but have taken few safety
countermeasures since Sept. 11, even though they have been targeted by Al
Qaeda, a congressman alleged in a report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In the document--which was immediately discounted by the nuclear power
industry--Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said the nation's commercially
operated reactors are at risk from a wide variety of assaults, including
sabotage from foreign workers who were not adequately screened for ties
to terrorist organizations.</LD>
<LD>   The nuclear plants are also vulnerable to the same kind of suicide
hijackings that leveled the World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon,
Markey said in the report, titled "Security Gap: A Hard Look at Soft
Spots in Our Civilian Nuclear Reactor Security."</LD>
<TE>   Markey, a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is
a longtime critic of the commission who has accused it of being too cozy
with the industry it regulates. He said his report was based on
information provided by the commission's five members and other
regulatory officials in response to his detailed questions about nuclear
plant safety after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   If hijackers rammed even a relatively small plane into a nuclear
reactor, it could cause a full-scale meltdown and widespread radiation
contamination, Markey said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also contends that guards at nuclear plants are underpaid,
undertrained and incapable of repelling an attack from marauding
terrorists intent on gaining entry to the facility. And spent radioactive
nuclear fuel from the plants also isn't protected as well as it should
be, he added.</TE>
<TE>Industry Officials Say Report Is Too Critical</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear regulatory officials said Markey's report was far too critical
of safety issues at nuclear plants, and inaccurate in places. They would
not, however, discuss in detail where the report might be inaccurate,
saying they would respond on a point-by-point basis at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   "On the whole, we disagree with his contention that we have not done
enough to strengthen security," NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said.
"Security at nuclear plants was strong before 9/11 and it was
strengthened in the immediate aftermath of the attacks."</TE>
<TE>   But Markey said many of the responses by NRC officials were
unsatisfactory. "Black hole after black hole is described and left
unaddressed," he wrote. "Post-[Sept. 11], a nuclear safety agency that
does not know--and seems little interested in finding out--the
nationality of nuclear reactor workers or the level of resources being
spent on security at these sensitive facilities is not doing its job."</TE>
<TE>   Markey is co-sponsoring a bill that would allow the federal government
to take over security at nuclear plants in much the same way it has at
airports after Sept. 11. Such a takeover has been vigorously opposed by
the NRC and nuclear industry officials.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Markey said the NRC and its licensed operators have
ignored concerns about safety for many years, but that the issue took on
far more urgency after the Sept. 11 attacks, when evidence was found
indicating that Al Qaeda operatives are interested in targeting nuclear
materials and civilian nuclear power plants in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, The Times reported that a confidential intelligence report
indicates that Osama bin Laden's operatives displayed a keen interest in
exploiting vulnerabilities in security at sensitive U.S. facilities,
including nuclear plants, and noted that Al Qaeda-trained agents were
still at large in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Markey is exactly on target in terms of his criticism of the
commission's inaction on upgrading nuclear power plant security," said
Paul Leventhal, president of the nonpartisan Nuclear Control Institute
and a former staff director of the Senate nuclear regulation
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Markey's report also said:</TE>
<TE>   * The NRC does not know what its licensees spend on security or how
many security guards are employed at each reactor.</TE>
<TE>   * Twenty-one U.S. nuclear reactors are located within five miles of an
airport, but 96% of all U.S. reactors were designed without regard for
the potential for impact from even a small aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   * The NRC has rejected placing antiaircraft capabilities at nuclear
facilities, even though other countries have chosen to do so, especially
for reactors located close to airports.</TE>
<TE>   * Spent nuclear fuel is stored in significant quantities at reactors
across the U.S., including in California, yet it is often kept in
buildings that are not "hardened structures," some of which reportedly
have sheet metal roofs.</TE>
<TE>   But Markey said he was particularly concerned about what he described
as inadequate screening of nuclear plant employees for potential ties to
terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The NRC, he said, does not know how many foreign nationals it employs
and requires little in the way of background checks. Security is so poor,
he said, that terrorists could already be secretly working at reactors,
and the independent operators--and the NRC--would not know it. He noted
that Mohamed Atta and the other Sept. 11 hijackers had no criminal
records or other problems that would be flagged under the current
screening process.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, said the
trade association and lobbying group for the nuclear power industry
requires all power plants to screen employees and to monitor them
closely.</TE>
<TE>   The plants, he said, provide fingerprints and other information about
prospective employees to the FBI, which then examines their employment,
education and criminal history. Some employees working in sensitive areas
must also pass psychological exams.</TE>
<TE>   Singer also said the FBI "checks these people against the FBI watch
list of suspected terrorists, and the FBI continues to update that list
and share it with the [nuclear power] industry."</TE>
<TE>   And the trade association has boasted in recent newspaper ads that
security forces at nuclear power plants are highly professional. "They
are basically paramilitary forces and are highly trained," Singer said.
"These are not your typical airport security people."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI had no comment on how it works with the nuclear industry to
screen prospective employees at nuclear power plants.</TE>

<HD>Informants Named Vignali's Father</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Man who won freedom for son was himself implicated. No
charges were ever filed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal agents for more than 20 years suspected that a wealthy Los
Angeles businessman, who recruited top Southern California law
enforcement officials to persuade President Clinton to free his
cocaine-dealing son, was involved in drug trafficking.</LD>
<LD>   Horacio Vignali gained national attention last year as the dedicated
father who successfully enlisted Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca,
former U.S. Atty. Alejandro Mayorkas and a host of elected officials in a
longshot bid to win the early release of his son. Clinton eventually
freed Carlos Vignali, who had served six years of a 15-year sentence for
dealing kilos of cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   A congressional inquiry into pardons and commutations granted by
Clinton on his last day in office turned up confidential federal law
enforcement reports containing unproven allegations that the elder
Vignali also was in the cocaine business. One informant told the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration that Vignali was his son's supplier.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations, drawn from raw investigative files and based largely
on statements by informants, have never been strong enough to yield a
criminal charge against Horacio Vignali.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the report raises pointed questions about whether local law
enforcement leaders should have checked Vignali's background before
describing him to the White House as a man of the highest integrity.</TE>
<TE>   In the drug trial of his son, Carlos, prosecutors said the defendant
showed no interest in making a deal for a lesser prison term by revealing
who supplied him with the cocaine and instead went to trial despite
strong evidence against him.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Jones, the former U.S. attorney in Minneapolis, where the young
Vignali was prosecuted, said investigators and prosecutors suspected "he
did not want to snitch on his dad" or someone else very close to him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just logic," Jones said. "We knew it [the drug conspiracy] did
not end with this 21-year-old kid, so obviously there was someone close
to him that he was extremely loyal to and that he was willing to go to
prison for, for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   While emphasizing the unproven nature of the allegations in DEA files,
the House Committee on Government Reform nonetheless cited them this
month in a report critical of Southern California politicians and the two
law enforcement leaders who helped Vignali persuade Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The committee said Baca and Mayorkas would have had access to law
enforcement files and should have checked them.</TE>
<TE>Mayorkas: 'I Made a Mistake'</TE>
<TE>   Mayorkas, a Clinton appointee now in private practice, said the
committee's criticism is fair. He said he did not know the elder Vignali
very well.</TE>
<TE>   "It is reasonable to expect that someone in my position would do his
or her due diligence to learn that information," he said. "I made a
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Baca disagreed. He said in an interview that it is not reasonable to
expect him to check the backgrounds of everyone he deals with, including
campaign fund-raisers and friends such as Vignali. He disputed that
information, such as the mentions of Vignali buried in law enforcement
files, would have been readily available to him even if he had tried to
check.</TE>
<TE>   Both men said they would not have provided references if they had been
aware of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   References to Horacio Vignali and his longtime business partner in law
enforcement files appear to be based mainly on statements by
criminals--drug dealers and, in one case involving the partner,
statements by a killer for hire. They gave information to police after
they were caught.</TE>
<TE>   Although the congressional committee cited allegations only from DEA
files, Southern California-based investigators at other local, state and
federal law enforcement agencies also mention Horatio Vignali in
connection with drug trafficking in their reports, The Times found.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali and his partner are mentioned together in files of the
FBI, the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement and the criminal
investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service. A letter sent in
1994 from an IRS criminal investigator in Minnesota, where Carlos Vignali
was indicted for supplying cocaine to a Midwest ring, to an IRS agent in
Los Angeles referred to the elder Vignali as "a known drug dealer."</TE>
<TE>   Files maintained by six more federal and California police agencies
contain allegations that Vignali's partner, Los Angeles supermarket owner
George Torres, had links to the illegal narcotics trade. Torres also is
mentioned in the DEA reports cited by the congressional committee, but
there were no criminal charges filed against him.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali, through his attorney, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, through his attorney, declined an interview but denied
involvement with illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever reason, George Torres' name appears in reports," said
the attorney, Richard Hirsch. "There has been no evidence that has led
law enforcement to charge him with any crimes other than the minor ones
to which he has pled in the past. Therefore, there is no substance to
anything which appears in the House report [or the other reports]. . . .
They are simply based on information obtained from informants that has
never been corroborated in any way. . . . Informants say a lot of things
to help themselves and more often than not this information turns out not
to be true."</TE>
<TE>   The earliest reference to Vignali cited by the House committee
involves a DEA account of Vignali's own reported admission to undercover
law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   "In November, 1975," the DEA said, "he negotiated with ATF [the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms] Agents to sell a machine gun and stated
to them that he also smuggled heroin into the United States utilizing
automobiles."</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 years later, as Vignali was lobbying the Clinton White
House, internal DEA reports mentioned unconfirmed suspicions that he and
Torres were involved in large-scale cocaine trafficking, according to the
committee report.</TE>
<TE>   "To date, the investigation shows that the Torres organization is
involved in the importation and distribution of drugs throughout the
United States," said a 1998 DEA report quoted by the committee. "Latest
intelligence reveals that this group is distributing approximately one
hundred (100) kilograms of cocaine per month. . . . George Torres is the
head of this organization. . . . Vignali's role in the organization is
relatively unknown at this time. It is believed that Vignali functions as
a financial partner in the organization. Vignali has been involved in
organizing meetings between Torres and individuals with extensive
criminal backgrounds."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 DEA report continued: "The Torres organization has used its
profits from drug trafficking to purchase legitimate businesses and
properties throughout the Southern California area. . . . Investigators
believe that Torres uses these businesses . . . to launder his drug
profits. Members of the Torres organization have been involved in various
acts of violence."</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how Torres, who owns the Numero Uno supermarket chain,
met Vignali, who until recently owned the C&amp;H Auto Body Shop and custom
car dealership. But public records show they have been partners in
various real estate deals and business investments, including a swap meet
and toy and general merchandise importing businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Torres and Vignali also had other ties. Public records show they used
the same lawyers for many of their joint and separate business dealings
and in civil lawsuits. A 1997 state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement report
noted that Torres continued to pay utilities on a penthouse near downtown
after Vignali had bought it from him.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a 1993 DEA report obtained by The Times quoted an
informant who said Torres and Vignali traveled together to Las Vegas,
where they were big gamblers. Law enforcement officials later subpoenaed
casino records on Torres, which disclosed that in 1998 he held a credit
line of more than half a million dollars at one establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali has said he came to the United State with his father
from Argentina in 1962 and set up an auto repair business that flourished
on Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles. He was paid $5 million in
public funds when the city acquired some of his downtown property by
eminent domain to make way for the expansion of the Convention Center in
the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Vignali tried in the early 1990s to develop a hotel-casino and sports
arena near where the Staples Center was later built.</TE>
<TE>   Vignali also made a name for himself as a politician's friend.</TE>
<TE>   He stepped up efforts to court local officials after his son was
convicted in 1994, writing $160,000 in his own checks to candidates and
hosting fund-raising events at his auto body shop. He became well known
for putting on an apron to work the elaborate barbecue grill he often
towed to campaign fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   The gregarious 56-year-old was active in Latino politics and was seen
as an informal mediator of disputes among elected officials. He was one
of Baca's early financial supporters, giving $11,000 personally and
raising tens of thousands of dollars more for the sheriff's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign that stretched over several years, Vignali also
persuaded other Los Angeles officials to write letters or make phone
calls to the White House on behalf of his son.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Vignali, now 30, had been captured on wiretap recordings
talking in what jurors agreed was coded language, while supplying between
5 and 15 kilos to the Minnesota ring.</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali's pitch to supporters was simple. He said his son was
wrongly convicted, that all Carlos did was lend money to a friend. The
wiretaps captured conversations about the loan, he said, that were
misinterpreted by prosecutors and jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the officials he enlisted to write or call Clinton aides were
Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), former Rep. Esteban Torres, state
Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), Los Angeles County Supervisor
Gloria Molina, former Assembly speakers Antonio Villaraigosa and Bob
Hertzberg, former Los Angeles City Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Mike
Hernandez and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   Most said later they acted out of sympathy for Horacio Vignali, taking
his word that his son got railroaded. There is no evidence any of them
knew of the allegations in confidential law enforcement files that the
elder Vignali may have been involved in drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Mayorkas and Baca said they gave character references for the father.</TE>
<TE>   "I limited information to my personal experience with the father,"
Mayorkas said, explaining he had mingled with Horacio Vignali at social
events and also socialized with him a couple of times alone. "I felt some
compassion for the father and regrettably, that compassion may have been
misplaced."</TE>
<TE>   Baca said that after "listening to the father's broken heart" he wrote
a character-reference letter for Horacio Vignali and responded to a call
from the White House. Baca said, however, that he remained neutral on
clemency and told a White House official the decision was Clinton's. The
official who spoke with him, however, said she came away believing the
sheriff supported clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Former Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey spotlighted Baca's and
Mayorkas' roles in the final decision. Lindsey told a congressional
hearing last year that he went along with Carlos Vignali's early release,
saying if Baca and Mayorkas "were not concerned about him coming back to
their community, that I thought it was an appropriate commutation."</TE>
<TE>   Horacio Vignali also paid $200,000 to Hugh Rodham, former First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, to lobby the White House on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said in an interview he learned only last month that Congress was
preparing to disclose the unproven allegations against Horacio Vignali.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Baca said, he returned the $11,000 in contributions from
Vignali and began trying to find out about the allegations himself. He
said he called and wrote letters to top officials of the FBI, DEA and
U.S. Customs Service in Los Angeles, asking them if Vignali had been
suspected of criminal activity. He said he was told "no" and has not
heard back in three weeks on follow-up written requests.</TE>
<TE>   "The fallaciousness of the [congressional] report is that this
information is so easy to get," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>Baca: 'The Whole Thing Stinks'</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said responsibility lies with the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disgusting that the White House doesn't do due diligence and
it's disgusting that the Congress wants to blame the sheriff of Los
Angeles County for what the president did," Baca said. "The whole thing
stinks. Vignali stinks. The White House stinks, this report stinks."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said he also did not know of the unproven allegations
against Torres, whom he described to the committee as "a legitimate
businessman."</TE>
<TE>   Public records show that Torres, 45, dropped out of high school in Los
Angeles to begin working on his father's fruit truck route and
family-owned store. He later expanded that into a supermarket chain and
won community accolades, including a plaque from the Los Angeles City
Council, in part for giving free rides to low-income patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Police files portray him less flatteringly.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Whittier police department reports obtained by The
Times from the late 1980s cited, respectively, a narcotics detective's
and an informant's account that Torres was suspected of shipping cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Another informant, arrested with a truckload of cocaine, gave the FBI
a tour of what he described as sites related to the ring. He pointed out
a warehouse owned by Torres, as well as Vignali's downtown car business,
according to the FBI reports, saying it was a storage facility for cars
owned by ringleaders.</TE>
<TE>   In spring 1993, two other informants were questioned by the DEA,
according to law enforcement reports. One of these informants told the
DEA he believed Torres trafficked in 100-plus kilo lots of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Still another informant, who was arrested for running drugs, told the
DEA he had bought hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Vignali's son and
that Horacio Vignali was the source of his son's supply, according to an
DEA report.</TE>
<TE>   The same informant later told the DEA that Torres supplied Vignali's
son and claimed that neither Torres nor the elder Vignali handled the
drugs themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Within a month of Carlos Vignali's indictment in Minnesota in December
1993, public records show, Horacio Vignali transferred ownership of a San
Fernando Valley condominium that he had purchased from the informant's
mother back to her.</TE>
<TE>   Public files in Los Angeles County show Horacio Vignali has no
criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   Torres has a short criminal record. He was convicted in 1992 of gun
possession for having a loaded .25-caliber handgun in his vehicle and
again in 1996 for having loaded 9-millimeter and .380-caliber
semiautomatic handguns in a car he was driving.</TE>
<TE>   Torres was placed on probation for gun possession. While he was on
probation, his flagship supermarket on Jefferson Boulevard at San Pedro
Street, an adjacent warehouse and his homes were searched in 1999.
Authorities can search probationers without a warrant, meaning they do
not have to persuade a judge that they have good reason. They found about
$1 million in cash, as well as weapons and ammunition, but no drugs. They
also found a copy of a confidential DEA report on Torres and Vignali.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch, Torres' attorney, said the guns belonged to Torres' security
force and had been in a storeroom since the 1992 riots. Torres ultimately
was sentenced to 30 days for leaving the state without the permission of
his probation officer.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Won't Name Abusers</HD>
<DH>Catholics: He says to do so would traumatize victims further, but
they can break confidentiality agreements if they wish.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At an extraordinary "Mass of reparations," Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
told about 300 Catholic priests Monday night that he would support
victims of long-ago sexual abuse who want to break confidentiality
agreements and talk, but would not release the names of their abusers.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't care less about confidentiality agreements," Mahony told
reporters after the Mass in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   But he cautioned that identifying priests involved in older cases
could traumatize their victims again.</LD>
<TE>   "The last thing any of us want is to victimize all over again many
years later," he said. "If I felt that making those few names public
would in any way protect children and youth or help victims, I would do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in a Christian penitential season, Mahony said he accepts
full responsibility as head of the nation's largest archdiocese for the
sins of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I offer my sincere apologies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's remarks during the Mass and at a news conference
afterward came at a time when the nation's bishops have been under
unrelenting pressure to face up to the widening sex abuse scandal in the
Roman Catholic Church. Some within the church have called it the gravest
crisis to confront the Catholic faith in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also said that the subject of marriage in the priesthood should
be open to discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all these questions are open; I never said they should not be
raised," he said. Mahony also made it clear that he saw no correlation
between the church's current mandate of celibacy and child abuse. Sexual
abusers, he said, are often married men.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the fact that an American cardinal would suggest an open
discussion on married priesthood was likely to cheer liberals and offend
conservatives. Pope John Paul II has been unbending in his opposition to
a married priesthood and has said the subject was closed.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony made it clear that new cases of sexual abuse would be
thoroughly aired, and that the church would cooperate fully with law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "A new standard of openness and frankness has been established," he
said. The archdiocese's sexual abuse policy has been strengthened over
the years since it took effect in 1988. As of July, the archdiocese has
imposed a "zero tolerance" policy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, church officials have examined thousands of priests'
personnel files, past and present, looking for reports of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   One new case of alleged abuse reported on the church's hotline is
under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, he
said. A priest also was dismissed last week from the presidency of an
Encino Catholic school because of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, however, the number of sexual abuse cases involving the
archdiocese has been small compared to those in some other areas, but
Mahony would not be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's remarks at Our Lady of Refuge Church in Long Beach came as
the Catholic Church and Christianity around the world entered Holy Week,
the most sacred time on the Christian calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the Los Angeles diocese's white-robed priests and an equal
number of nuns and members of the laity, Mahony said that in all his 40
years as a priest and 27 years as a bishop "I have never felt so
devastated, so sad, and so besieged."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, archbishop of the archdiocese that includes Los Angeles,
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, said the sins of a few priests had
pulled a "blanket of shame" over its 1,200 priests.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged full disclosure and cooperation with law enforcement in any
new cases, and repeated that the church is undergoing a time of what he
called purification. He said the church's truthfulness, honesty and
credibility have been deeply wounded.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged a new standard of openness and frankness to close what he
called "a very wide gap between the church, its people and society."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Mass was an annual event at which the cardinal blesses the
holy oil that priests will use throughout the next year for baptisms,
confirmations and the ordination of new priests. It also was a time for
priests to renew their ordination vows. The title of Monday's Mass,
however, suggested the uniqueness of events</TE>
<TE>   "We pause to measure ourselves against Jesus Christ," Mahony said. "In
past years, we have always come up short. . . . But this year, the church
and priests are undergoing an incredible purification because of the
sinful [actions] of a small percentage of priests."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was outraged at the harm done to children and youths
entrusted to the church's care.</TE>
<TE>   Given the enormity of the scandal in the church, Mahony told
reporters, he was glad the archdiocese newspaper in Boston, the Boston
Pilot, had recently raised the issue of a married priesthood. Although he
didn't offer his personal views on that subject, he contended that there
is no connection between celibacy and sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing priests to marry would reverse hundreds of years of church
tradition and could only be made by the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mahony's comments were warmly received by many priests in his
congregation Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran priest who spoke on condition of anonymity said: "He's a
realist. We're open to the future. The Lord works in various ways."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's remarks on sexual abuse were generally applauded by his
priests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very difficult period we are going through in the church,"
the Rev. Carl Bell said. "Whatever the cardinal says, not everyone is
going to be satisfied. Some are going to want more, some are going to
want less."</TE>
<TE>   As for relations with young congregation members, he added, "We don't
want to push a child away, but we don't want to seem to pull them too
close. We are all treading on eggshells."</TE>
<TE>   There have been calls in Boston for the resignation of Cardinal
Bernard Law. A bishop in Florida resigned after disclosures he had
molested a seminary youth years earlier. Last week, Pope John Paul II
said priests had succumbed to evil and brought a grave scandal to the
church.</TE>
<TE>   But the response from U.S. bishops, each of whom heads an autonomous
diocese and is answerable only to the pope, has been uneven. Mahony,
while consistently decrying sexual abuse and early on putting sexual
abuse policies in place, has not been as forthcoming as some bishops in
offering a public accounting of the number of priests accused of sexual
abuse in his archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was confronted by Catholics carrying placards after a Palm
Sunday Mass in Camarillo Sunday. One man said his son had been sexually
abused by a priest. Another man said he was molested when he was a boy.
They and other demonstrators said Mahony had mishandled the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Although the scandal erupted in January with disclosures in Boston and
elsewhere, Mahony remained publicly silent until last week. Sources
within the church disclosed that in February, Mahony removed six to 12
priests from their ministries because of past sexual abuse. The Times
published that report March 4.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony declined to confirm or deny the report until March 22 when
he issued a partial confirmation in a message to Catholics he wrote for
the archdiocesan newspaper. He conceded that a few local priests had been
removed from their ministries.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not say precisely how many clerics were involved. Nor did
he say when the reported abuse occurred, where the priests had served, or
when the archdiocese first learned of the allegations. He said only that
virtually all of the cases cited in the media were old, having occurred
as long as decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since the offenses, the priests, some of whom served jail time,
reportedly had undergone psychological therapy and counseling and
apparently were leading acceptable lives, one source said. Mahony's
decision to terminate the six to 12 priests appeared to be the result of
the civil suit settlement last year in which the Los Angeles Archdiocese
and the Diocese of Orange agreed to rid themselves of anyone found guilty
of sexual abuse in the past. In that case, $5.2 million was awarded to a
man who said he had been sexually abused as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was the first time Mahony had addressed the archdiocese's
priests en mass on the subject. All or most of them recently completed a
series of regional workshops on observing personal boundaries in their
ministries.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which has addressed
the problem in years past, will take up the issue again when they meet in
Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Kill Vehicle Scores a Hit With Proponents of Missile Defense</HD>
<DH>Weapons: The Pentagon says the successful tests may restore
credibility to the program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Minuteman missile carrying a dummy nuclear warhead soared across
Southern California's crystal-clear sky this month on the way to its
destruction over the Pacific Ocean, part of a high-stakes test of the
Bush administration's ballistic missile defense plan.</LD>
<LD>   The missile was pulverized in space by a compact device, dubbed the
exoatmospheric kill vehicle by engineers and described as the most
sophisticated weapon ever developed.</LD>
<LD>   The test marked the third consecutive time that the device, the
product of research labs around Southern California, scored a bull's-eye
in space. The kill vehicle is at the heart of the missile defense system.</LD>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, missile defense proposals have failed to gain
credibility, but the current system and the success of the latest
intercept have emboldened Pentagon officials. They called the March 15
test a major step in the program, though many thorny problems remain and
the future of the program is hardly assured.</TE>
<TE>   The kill vehicle has the job of intercepting a warhead at a closing
speed of 15,000 mph--more than four miles a second or five times the
speed of a bullet. It must measure where it is going, calculate a
collision path and operate rocket thrusters to score a hit in millionths
of a second at the very end of its flight. The kill vehicle not only has
to find its target in the void of space, but distinguish it from decoys
and other countermeasures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like hitting a golf ball across the country, from Los Angeles to
New York, and getting a hole in one even though the pin is moving and
there are whole bunch of others that look just like it," said Charles F.
LaDue, Raytheon Co.'s program manager for the weapon, also known as the
EKV. "And we're going to have to do that every single time. The
consequence of failure is tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle was developed by Raytheon's unit in Southern California
and assembled at its missile plant in Tucson. Key pieces of the
device--along with much of the entire missile defense system--were
designed or developed here.</TE>
<TE>   The device carries a range of sophisticated items, including optics to
navigate by the stars, antennas to receive data from ground radar, a
small computer and a refrigeration unit to form krypton ice cubes for
cooling sensors. The whole thing can fit on a kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   Because it carries no explosives or other munitions, the kill vehicle
destroys the target by the sheer force of the collision. But hitting the
cone-shaped warhead, typically about 6 feet tall, isn't enough. The
device must hit the warhead at its so-called sweet spot--measured in
centimeters--where the nuclear munition is housed to prevent an errant
nuclear explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing that the Department of Defense has done that is as
difficult," said Philip E. Coyle, a former assistant secretary of
defense, who is senior advisor at the Center for Defense Information.</TE>
<TE>   As such it also has been the most controversial. Despite four
successful hits out of six tries--including the March 15 test that
included distinguishing the warhead from three Mylar balloon
decoys--critics have questioned the capabilities of the kill vehicle's
sensors to adequately distinguish a warhead from decoys.</TE>
<TE>   Just adding more decoys does not increase the difficulty of the test,
said David Wright, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a group critical of the program.</TE>
<TE>   They also raise doubts about other countermeasures that an enemy might
put up. The critics say an enemy could refrigerate a warhead to confuse
the kill vehicle's sensors, an argument that defense experts dismiss as
technologically unfeasible.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Wright said, the whole missile defense system requires
detailed knowledge of how warheads would appear to the kill vehicle's
sensor, an intelligence task that is "highly unrealistic."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Pentagon and at Raytheon acknowledged some of the
criticism, noting that the initial tests were not meant to be realistic
but to prove the technology and gather data to field an operational
device, sometime in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, interceptor tests, planned about every four months, are
expected to increase in complexity with more decoys and other
countermeasures. And within 18 to 24 months, Raytheon officials plan to
test the kill vehicle without any advance knowledge of what the targets
may be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a flight test program," LaDue said. "You want it
well-instrumented and measured. It's what you want to do in a test
program."</TE>
<TE>   After logging a hit in its first attempt in October 1999, the second
test was botched by a glitch with the kill vehicle's cooling system and
in the third test the device failed to separate from its booster. The
device has since had three consecutive hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon plans to conduct 20 more tests to help develop a final
design for the kill vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what seems to be a very difficult task, hitting a warhead is
not as challenging as developing the technology to discriminate targets,
missile defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, the Army tested a "hit-to-kill" device that after three
failures hit a target missile. The program was canceled after it was
determined that the tests had been rigged. In any case, the device was
considered too heavy and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, vast improvements have been made with both the sensors and
the computer processing power.</TE>
<TE>   The target missile is a modified Minuteman II with a dummy nuclear
warhead and decoys, launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base. A military
satellite orbiting Earth detects the target and relays the information to
ground radars in Hawaii and on Kwajalein Island, about 4,800 miles from
California. The radars, also built by Raytheon, then begin tracking the
target missile.</TE>
<TE>   About 21 minutes later, a booster rocket carrying the kill vehicle is
launched from Meck Island, near Kwajalein, headed toward the incoming
missile.</TE>
<TE>   The kill vehicle doesn't much look like a weapon. And indeed, some
have described it as resembling a large muffler or a jackhammer. It is
just 55 inches long and weighs about 120 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Each device costs about $25 million, and Raytheon has a contract to
build 26. It has built seven so far. Under current plans, the Pentagon
sees buying up to 250--a potential production program of $6.25
billion--as it builds up the missile defense program.</TE>
<TE>   As the booster makes its ascent, it uses a telescope with three
mirrors and two infrared sensor systems to look out hundreds of miles for
its targets, while getting help from ground radar. The telescope is made
with beryllium to protect against electromagnetic pulse from potential
nuclear blasts that could damage its electronic components.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after launch, the kill vehicle starts its cryogenic
refrigeration system, which cools the infrared sensors to hundreds of
degrees below zero. Krypton gas is funneled to the area around the
sensors. Krypton ice cubes form and stay with the device until it
collides with the warhead. Cooling the sensors is vital to detecting and
discriminating the target from decoys and countermeasures.</TE>
<TE>   In Raytheon's kill vehicle, the infrared sensors take precise
measurements of heat radiation, distinguishing the relatively warm
warheads against the ice-cold background of space. The readings are
digitized, converted to a numerical value and analyzed by computers.</TE>
<TE>   The infrared sensors, considered the most vital elements of the kill
vehicle, were developed at Raytheon's El Segundo facility. The sensors
feed information into infrared detectors that analyze the signals. Those
were developed by Raytheon engineers in Goleta, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how it distinguishes a decoy from a real warhead is highly
classified, but it uses computer algorithms to make the decision. The
algorithm includes preprogrammed profiles of enemy warheads compiled by
U.S. intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   About three minutes into its flight and 1,400 miles from the target,
the device separates from the booster in a show of pyrotechnics as more
than a dozen cables and connectors are blown off. The kill vehicle itself
is gently pushed out by four springs.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after separating from the booster, the kill vehicle uses
its thrusters to sharply move to its right or left to avoid getting hit
from behind by the booster. It is carried forward to the target by only
its own momentum. The four divert thrusters mounted on its sides were
tested recently at Edwards Air Force Base, where the device was able to
hover about 20 feet above the tarmac for about 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 seconds before impact, the sensors are turned on and begin
to detect and discriminate the target, sending signals to the computer
that steers the device. Until this point, it navigates by using an
inertial navigation system, aided by star sightings through a separate
stellar navigation unit.</TE>
<TE>   The computer uses Intel processors that are more than 10 years
old--though Raytheon says it may upgrade to a newer chip. Most of the
number crunching is completed by an electronics unit, Raytheon officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although small compared with other sophisticated satellites and
weapons, the kill vehicle takes about 24 months to produce with about
half of that time spent undergoing tests and sensor calibrations. There
are no moving parts except for the valves on the thrusters. To ensure
quality, Raytheon built a high-tech, dust-free manufacturing plant in
Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a spacecraft that will have to stay in the ground for years and
still be expected to work every time," LaDue said. "It's got to work
every time. We just can't miss."</TE>

<HD>At Pig Farm, Vancouver Police Reap Grisly Clues</HD>
<DH>Canada: Remains of two prostitutes have been found. But 48 other
women are still missing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada
</DL>
<LD>She was one of the 50 "missing women," as they are generically
called here, a recent entry on the police's numbingly long list of
prostitutes who disappeared from the city's seedy east side and are now
feared to have been the victims of what could be one of North America's
worst serial killings.</LD>
<LD>   But Sereena Abotsway is no longer counted among the missing.</LD>
<LD>   Early this month, in the bright vaulted chambers of Vancouver's
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, she became the first of the 50 to be
ceremonially put to rest. Slain sometime late last year at age 29 and
declared dead last month, Abotsway was eulogized in a memorial Mass by a
priest who knew her as a child and wistfully remembered her off-key hymn
singing. Her half brother Jay Draayers chokingly recalled a protective
but playful older sister with "roaring laughter and warm smiles."</LD>
<TE>   A prayer card distributed at the service bore a photo of this earlier,
innocent Abotsway, taken long before she became a prostitute and drug
addict, before her skull was fractured and her face disfigured in an
assault that apparently occurred on what social workers here
euphemistically term a "bad date."</TE>
<TE>   The text, a poignant remembrance of all the missing women from the
east side, was written by Abotsway herself. She had joined the marches of
feminists and downtown activists who had been demanding for a decade that
city and federal police mount a joint investigation into the
disappearances.</TE>
<TE>   "When you all went missing each and every year we all fought so hard
to find you," Abotsway wrote. "You all were part of God's plan. He
probably took most of you home. But he left us with a very empty spot."</TE>
<TE>   There was no burial service for Abotsway, though. The family has
nothing to bury.</TE>
<TE>   In February, six months after she vanished from the gritty streets,
police discovered what they told relatives were identifiable fragments of
her body on the grounds of a Vancouver-area hog farm. Police also found
the remains of another missing downtown prostitute, Mona Wilson. The
farm's 52-year-old co-owner, Robert William Pickton, was charged in their
murders.</TE>
<TE>   Pickton remained silent as the first-degree homicide charges were read
to him in a two-minute court appearance Feb. 22 shortly after his arrest.
He is scheduled to return to court next Tuesday to begin pretrial
proceedings that experts say could take years, including a possible
change of venue request from the defense. Pickton has not yet entered a
plea, but his lawyers said he denies any role in the women's deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities here are legally constrained from saying whether Pickton
is believed linked to any of the other 48 cases.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vancouver city detectives who were assigned to the cases and
later left the force said they reported three years ago that they
believed most of the disappearances were the work of a single killer or
several operating together. Pickton was identified as a possible suspect
in 1999, they said, but there was no systematic surveillance of him or
his property until last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Pickton farm in Port Coquitlam is now the focus of one of the most
intense criminal investigations in Canadian history, with earthmovers
scouring the 10-acre property for buried evidence and a team of Royal
Canadian Mounted Police experts examining unearthed clues at an on-site
forensics lab. More than 80 local and federal police and technicians are
assigned to the investigation, police said.</TE>
<TE>Search of Farm Expected to Take Many Months</TE>
<TE>   "The detailed, inch-by-inch search of the farm property will continue
for many months to come," Catherine Galliford, a spokeswoman for the
joint city-federal police investigation, said after Pickton's arrest. "We
believe we now have answers regarding the disappearance of two missing
women. But this is a case involving 50 missing women. There are a lot of
questions still unanswered. We will not rest until those answers are
found."</TE>
<TE>   On March 10, relatives of missing women were shown photographs of
shoes, shirts, jackets, jewelry and other items that they assumed were
recovered from the site, though police would not confirm that. Nor would
police tell reporters whether the families recognized anything.</TE>
<TE>   But Abotsway's family said evidence they had been presented earlier,
including DNA samples, showed that she and Wilson were victims of "very
gruesome" killings. "There is definite DNA evidence that Sereena and Mona
are no more," said Bert Draayers, Abotsway's foster father.</TE>
<TE>   Prostitutes began disappearing from Vancouver's east side in the
mid-1980s, with cases climbing to three or four a year through the
1990s--a disturbing and statistically anomalous pattern that
investigators then feared might suggest one or several serial killers.
But it was not until 1999 that police publicized their first list of the
missing women, circulating a poster featuring 31 faces--some from family
snapshots, most from police mug shots--and an advertised $100,000 reward
for information leading to arrests in what were presumed to be their
murders.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 31 were soon found alive; two others had died natural
deaths. But there was little progress on the other 27 cases. A police
task force dwindled from nine investigators to two, and the reward offer
was quietly shelved.</TE>
<TE>   But the disappearances continued. In February 2001, community pressure
and persistent media inquiries brought the federal resources of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police into the case. In December, 18 more names were
added; in January, police listed five more.</TE>
<TE>   Abotsway, unlike most women on the list, came from a tightknit
family--a foster family, but one to which she remained close--with
resources and social standing.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, she fit the tragic profile well. Like most of the others,
she was laconically described in police missing-person posters as a
"known drug user and sex trade worker in the downtown east side area." A
decaying port district of flophouses and crack houses, Vancouver's east
side has long been the lowest-income census zone in Canada and has
perhaps the country's most visible concentration of hard-drug usage.</TE>
<TE>   And like at least 21 of the 50 missing women, Abotsway was an American
Indian, one of the "urban aboriginals," in Canadian parlance, who have
long been among the poorest of the poor here. They make up barely 3% of
greater Vancouver's population but account for more than half of its
downtown street prostitutes. Many share Abotsway's history of
early-childhood abuse and subsequent foster care, a pattern
disproportionately common among Canada's native peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these women already had two strikes against them, as
prostitutes and hard-drug users. Their ethnicity may have contributed
further to the seeming official indifference to their fate, said Ernie
Crey, a local American Indian rights advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning, the police all but acknowledged this, saying
things like, 'These people are different from us,' " said Crey. "There is
a well-documented history of Native Canadians being mistreated by law
enforcement, and so many of these women were of aboriginal ancestry.
Might these attitudes have played a role in how their cases were handled?
I think so."</TE>
<TE>   Crey believes the investigation is now quite rigorous. He is not a
detached observer: His sister, Dawn Crey, is among the missing. Like
Abotsway, she had suffered abuse in childhood and spent time in foster
care, then went on to a life of prostitution and frequent drug use. In
November 2000, at the age of 43 and after nearly a decade on the east
side, Crey vanished. Her disappearance was reported by the methadone
clinic she had begun to visit and by the welfare agency whose checks she
no longer cashed.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Crey doesn't know if his sister ever visited the Pickton farm,
but other missing downtown prostitutes did, their friends say. When
Heather Chinnock was last seen, she was talking about visiting the
Pickton place, according to Garry Bigg, Chinnock's fiance and a friend of
others on the missing list.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by encroaching suburbia an hour's drive east of downtown
Vancouver, the Pickton farm is a defiant remnant of a rougher, more rural
British Columbia, replete with wrecked cars and shanty-like outbuildings.
The chain-link gate is covered with warnings that may have once looked
cartoonish but now seem menacing: "No Visitors, Agents, Peddlers or
Salespeople--Admittance by Appointment Only!! (No Exceptions)" and "This
property protected by: Pit Bull With AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the gate, makeshift shrines of flowers and candles and
scrawled notes commemorate women thought by friends and family to have
died inside: "To Kathy Gonzalez--'Forever Young, Forever Missed' " and
"To Diane Melnick--I'm so sorry. Ingrid."</TE>
<TE>   The Pickton property is encircled with yellow police tape.</TE>
<TE>Imagining 'Most Grisly Scenes Imaginable'</TE>
<TE>   Speculation centering on the slaughterhouse and feeding troughs at the
hog farm have compounded the horror for friends and relatives of the
missing. "The police tell us almost nothing, and we are left to imagine
the most grisly scenes imaginable," said Suzanne Jay, a director of a
Vancouver rape counseling center.</TE>
<TE>   Jay says prostitutes are vulnerable to violence from many sources. The
center's extensive records of assaults against women--information that is
routinely turned over to police but rarely prompts arrests, she
says--show that many men here have committed violent attacks against
prostitutes, runaways and other vulnerable women.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Duddy, the executive director of Women's Information Safe House,
or WISH, a social service center for downtown streetwalkers, said Pickton
and his farm were never mentioned in her agency's internal "bad-date
sheet" of confidential complaints about customers. However, the
prostitutes did voice worries about frequent violent mistreatment by
foreign sailors who brought them on board ships in the harbor. Police are
belatedly but seriously questioning prostitutes about these and other
leads, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 50 earlier killings of streetwalkers here--known to be homicides
because corpses were recovered--police investigations led to the
convictions of 17 individuals for "highly violent and sadistic" killings
with knives or fists, said John Lowman, a criminology professor at Simon
Fraser University. Most remain unsolved, however.</TE>
<TE>   Lowman is calling for an inquiry into the city police department's
handling of the missing women's case, which he contends was plagued by
failures to reinvestigate convicted killers of prostitutes and to
cross-check information with other law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lowman said the bigger issue was the unwillingness of police
and civic authorities to devote sufficient resources to the first wave of
disappearances, which coincided with a city crackdown on street
prostitution and failed to rouse mainstream concern.</TE>
<TE>   Like some other close followers of the case, Lowman said he had
initial doubts about the serial-killing hypothesis in part because it
might discourage separate and thorough investigation of each case.</TE>
<TE>   But now, after observing the intensive investigation at the hog farm,
Lowman is changing his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that this doesn't stop here," Lowman said. "We
are a society with multiple personality disorder on this issue, and we
have to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Uncovering evidence on the farm, if it is there, will prove difficult.
Much of the property was used until recently as a commercial landfill
site; it is covered with layers of trucked-in soil and refuse dozens of
feet deep. Exacerbating the problem, much of the Pickton land is newly
built over with tract homes, a real estate project that coincided with
most of the disappearances.</TE>
<TE>   Recently sold houses now overlook the overturned muck of the crime
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't know anything about it when they bought their houses;
then, hey, holy smokes, it's right under their noses," said Donald
Stewart, a patrolman standing guard at the police-taped boundary between
the hog farm and the Pickton family's year-old "Heritage Meadows" housing
development.</TE>
<TE>   Before police began searching the farm last month, the biggest
obstacle to the investigation was the lack of any forensic evidence--any
proof, say some in the police department's defense, that there were any
homicides at all.</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, one survivor of what police said was a
near-homicide at the farm five years ago. Wendy Eistetter, also an east
side prostitute, was stabbed repeatedly by Pickton at the farm in 1997 in
what she said was a murder attempt foiled only by her furious resistance.
Pickton was charged with attempted murder and "unlawful confinement."
Eistetter was hospitalized with scores of serious knife wounds; but so
was Pickton, who claimed self-defense. When Eistetter failed to show up
for pretrial hearings, the prosecution was suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence collected at the time may be introduced at the Abotsway and
Wilson trials, prosecutors said as they won a court order earlier this
month to have the 1997 records sealed from public use until then.
Eistetter could be a key witness in the Abotsway and Wilson cases,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   In the five years since Eistetter's stabbing, the number of reported
disappearances of downtown prostitutes nearly doubled, note Crey and
other relatives of the missing women.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people with families out there like mine who are
just beside ourselves," Crey said. "However unpleasant the truth may be,
we want to find out what happened."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Steps Up Diplomacy on Mideast Peace</HD>
<DH>Conflict: American officials seek to build momentum for Saudi
proposal. Israel debates whether to let Arafat attend Arab summit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Calling on allies in Europe and the Arab world to help, the United
States on Monday engaged in intense diplomacy with Israel and the
Palestinians in a bid to reduce bloodshed and generate momentum for a
peace proposal to be debated this week at an Arab League summit.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration quietly tried to win Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's approval for Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
to attend the summit in Beirut, which begins Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In return, Arafat would have to come back immediately to pursue talks
with Israel rather than launching a world tour to rally support.
Washington also wants assurances from Israel that Arafat will be allowed
to return to the West Bank, where he has been virtually confined for more
than three months.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they were somewhat optimistic about winning
Sharon's approval, barring another devastating attack on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, Sharon's deeply divided Cabinet debated Monday night
whether to let Arafat travel to the summit. Hard-liners who dominate the
government argued against allowing Arafat to go. As an alternative, some
suggested allowing him to attend but not letting him return.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he would make a final decision today, after Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres returned to Israel. Both Peres and Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, moderates in the government, advocate letting
Arafat go.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's presence at the summit is considered crucial to winning
approval of a Saudi peace proposal that would provide Israel with full
Arab recognition in exchange for its withdrawal from lands it occupied in
the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>'Time for Arab Nations to Seize the Moment'</TE>
<TE>   To spur behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts, President Bush called on
Sharon to allow Arafat to attend what could be a historic summit. At the
same time, Bush urged the Arab League to embrace the peace proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes that the best way to pursue peace, as far as
the Arab summit, would be for Chairman Arafat to travel there," White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. "The president believes it is time
for Arab nations in the region to seize the moment, to create a better
environment for peace to take root."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke by phone with Sharon and
Arafat over the weekend and on Monday, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Washington also has encouraged the European Union, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Britain and Germany to apply pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Powell talked with Arafat for about 30 minutes Monday and urged him to
publicly condemn the escalating violence in "clear and unambiguous"
terms, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   Reining in Palestinian militants, including Arafat's own faction, is
critical to reviving a cease-fire plan drawn up by CIA Director George J.
Tenet. U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni is currently mapping out steps
that both sides could take to end the violence, a senior State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official added that Powell made clear to Arafat that if Israel did
allow him free passage to the summit, he should not use it to go on a
"world tour."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon reiterated his determination to keep Arafat confined to the
West Bank city of Ramallah unless Palestinian attacks on Israelis came to
a halt. In his telephone conversation with Powell, Sharon said
restrictions on Arafat were "a matter of principle," Israeli television
reported.</TE>
<TE>   The liberal daily Haaretz said refusal to release Arafat would send
the wrong message to the Arab world and could doom the Saudi initiative.</TE>
<TE>Arafat Must Be Kept Confined, Some Say</TE>
<TE>   But Danny Naveh, a Cabinet minister from Sharon's right-wing Likud
Party, said Arafat should not be allowed to go anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced that many in Israel are asking themselves what has
actually happened. Has Arafat suddenly changed his ways, has he stopped
being a terrorist, has he started to fight against terror?" Naveh said.
"All Arafat wants is some cheap ticket to Beirut and perhaps some
American recognition in the form of a passing grade."</TE>
<TE>   Education Minister Limor Livnat, also from Likud, said Arafat's "war
of terrorism" had made him an enemy who should not enjoy privileges such
as safe passage.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an enemy as far as we are concerned, and an enemy cannot move,
cannot leave, cannot travel, and we can't talk to him and we can't
negotiate with him," she said. "An enemy is an enemy is an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   On the Palestinian side, senior mediator Saeb Erekat said Israel's
restrictions on Arafat violate signed treaties. "Mr. Sharon must stop
this blackmail," he said outside Arafat's Ramallah compound.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said that if Arafat did not travel to Beirut, he
would deliver a speech by a live television hookup.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's leftist Meretz Party demanded Arafat's "unconditional"
release because, it said, Israel's best interest would be served by the
success of the summit.</TE>
<TE>'Focus Will Be on the Palestinian Question'</TE>
<TE>   From Sharon's perspective, Israel stands to lose whether Arafat goes
or stays. If he goes, he could use the summit as a platform to denounce
Israel and could emerge as a survivor who has defied the Jewish state and
who remains the indispensable leader of the Palestinian struggle.</TE>
<TE>   If he stays in the West Bank, he could play the role of martyr and his
empty chair at the summit would be in the spotlight. He might even enjoy
greater stature among the Arab states by not being there.</TE>
<TE>   "Either way, the focus will be on the Palestinian question and
Arafat," said Bruce Maddy-Weitzman, a political scientist at Tel Aviv
University.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel will call more attention to itself by preventing him from
going than by letting him go where he will interact with leaders who
don't have a great love for him," Maddy-Weitzman said. "If he doesn't go,
the summit will become much more about his absence, he will be remembered
as a hero, he will bolster his image and score points."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggest that Arafat might actually prefer to stay home,
especially if the summit is dominated by the Saudi peace initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commentator Sever Plotzker, writing Monday in Israel's largest
daily, Yediot Aharonot, said that what Arafat really wants is for Israel
to forbid him to travel, since that would make the Jewish state look bad.</TE>
<TE>   "That in itself is a good reason to tell him: Go, Yasser, go,"
Plotzker wrote. "As far as we're concerned, you can go and you can come
back. You're here, you're there, it doesn't matter. Terrorism will
continue anyway and, in any case, an agreement is getting farther away."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Could Widen Anti-AIDS Drug's Reach</HD>
<DH>South Africa: The government loses an appeal to limit access to
nevirapine at hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The government on Monday lost a court appeal that could have
allowed it to continue restricting access to a key drug for thousands of
pregnant women who are HIV-positive.</LD>
<LD>   Reaffirming an earlier ruling, a Pretoria high court ordered the
government to provide the anti-AIDS drug nevirapine to all public
hospitals with the capacity to use it, even as the government awaits a
hearing before the country's Constitutional Court in May.</LD>
<LD>   The government provides nevirapine at 18 test sites but has refused to
expand the program to the rest of the country.</LD>
<TE>   AIDS activists backed by a group of pediatricians launched a court
action in December to require nationwide use of nevirapine, arguing that
the government had a duty to offer it because the constitution lists
health treatment as a right of South Africans.</TE>
<TE>   Under the earlier ruling, the Health Ministry was ordered to return to
court by next Sunday to show how it would expand its nevirapine program.
Earlier this month, the court again granted an order compelling the
government to expand the use of the anti-AIDS drug. But the government
requested the court's permission to appeal the order while the entire
case was pending before the Constitutional Court.</TE>
<TE>   High court Judge Chris Botha said Monday that he did not want any more
lives lost unnecessarily while the government waited for its appeal to be
heard.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the choice was between tolerating the loss of life and
tolerating inconvenience, no matter how many lives were at stake," Botha
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 babies are born HIV-positive every day in South Africa, and
studies have shown that nevirapine can reduce the transmission of the
virus from mother to child during labor by up to 50%. About 4.7 million
of South Africa's 45 million people are HIV-positive. The government has
cited cost, inadequate infrastructure and safety concerns to justify its
reluctance to make the drug available at public hospitals and clinics
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials have expressed concern over what they believe to be
overeagerness on the part of some Western nations and big pharmaceutical
companies to require use of nevirapine in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that some people . . . are forcing us to use nevirapine and
not using it themselves?" a senior government official asked during a
recent interview. He spoke on condition of anonymity. "You have to ask
yourself: Why is there so much pressure on us in South Africa to use
nevirapine?"</TE>
<TE>   Government health officials were unavailable for comment on Monday's
court ruling, and it was unclear whether the government would go ahead
with an earlier threat to disobey the Pretoria high court.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang told the South
African Broadcasting Corp. that she would not heed such a court order
because it would violate the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   South African President Thabo Mbeki has been widely criticized for
questioning the link between AIDS and HIV, or the human immunodeficiency
virus. His aides say his position has been misinterpreted.</TE>
<TE>   But many respected figures in South African society have condemned the
government's response to the AIDS epidemic, including Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the skills, expertise and resources. So for goodness sakes,
stop fiddling," the South African Press Assn. on Monday quoted Tutu as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   Zackie Achmat, chairman of the Treatment Action Campaign, the lobbying
group that launched the December court case against the government,
added: "There's just a level of frustration and anger that one has
because unfortunately the government's ideology and obsession about
antiretroviral drugs is turning it into an issue about the rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   The government also is considering withdrawing the registration of
nevirapine and halting distribution altogether because of questions that
have been raised about how tests of the drug in Uganda were administered.</TE>
<TE>   Botha, the Pretoria judge, said Monday that the government had
provided no evidence of side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Said Prudence Mabele, director of the Positive Women's Network, who
has lived with HIV for 10 years: "I get so frustrated by our own
government depriving us of the right to live.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so tired, burying people on a daily basis," she said.</TE>

<HD>Plunging Currency Provokes New Pain</HD>
<DH>Argentina: Decline of peso panics depositors and jeopardizes the
tenure of the fifth leader since December.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentina's economic crisis took a new, potentially calamitous turn
Monday as the value of the national currency plummeted despite desperate
measures by the government over the weekend to prevent its slide.</LD>
<LD>   The devaluation comes as President Eduardo Duhalde faces new questions
at home and abroad about his government's ability to lead the country out
of its economic and social crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Valued at one to the dollar in December and at 2.4 just a week ago,
the peso closed Monday at an average rate of 3.8 to the dollar. Lines
hundreds of yards long had formed outside Buenos Aires banks and exchange
houses.</LD>
<TE>   After a sharp drop in the value of the peso Friday, the government
announced a series of emergency measures over the weekend to defend the
currency, including a fixed rate on the value of dollars sold by the
nation's central bank. But the peso continued to drop Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The situation raises the specter of hyperinflation in a society
already racked by an official unemployment rate of 22% and by daily
protests that shut down roads and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warned that the devaluation and Argentina's failure to reach
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on terms for a new
round of emergency loans could bring down Duhalde's government. The
former senator and governor of Buenos Aires province came to power in
early January after rioting and street protests forced President Fernando
de la Rua and three other presidents to quit in quick succession.</TE>
<TE>   "The free fall of the peso and a likely surge in inflation threaten
the near-term viability of the Duhalde government," Credit Suisse First
Boston said in a report.</TE>
<TE>   With several local commentators also suggesting that public confidence
in Duhalde had evaporated and that his government was in danger, the
president said Saturday that he would remain in power "even if the dollar
reaches nine pesos."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to live through moments more difficult than these,"
Duhalde said.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade free from the high rates of inflation that were once
the bane of the Argentine economy, prices rose 8% last month. At the same
time, economic activity is contracting dramatically--construction starts
in February were down 43% compared with the same period last year,
according to figures released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Recent days have seen no letup in protests and social disorder.</TE>
<TE>   In the resort city of Mar del Plata, a group of angry depositors took
over a bank branch Monday for several hours. Television footage from
Rosario, a city northwest of Buenos Aires, showed more than 100 slum
dwellers descending on an overturned cattle truck Saturday and
slaughtering the animals with sticks and knives so they could carry off
chunks of meat.</TE>
<TE>   A growing chorus of conservative voices is calling for a crackdown on
the protests--including a televised street-corner assault on Roberto
Alemann, a former economy minister--which in recent weeks have taken on a
more personal and vindictive tone. Many middle-class residents have
directed their ire at the banking sector, where millions of dollars in
deposits remain frozen.</TE>
<TE>   "A society cannot exist for much time in a state of chaos," wrote
Mariano Grondona, an influential columnist for the daily La Nacion.
"Someone will have to respond to the general clamor for order."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of some sort of military intervention have been circulating
through the Argentine media since February, forcing the head of the army,
Gen. Ricardo Brinzoni, to issue repeated denials.</TE>
<TE>   "The army does not have the desire or the training to replace the
police in the face of the social disorder," Brinzoni said recently on a
radio program here. "We are subordinate to the constitution and the law.
Only an act of Congress could change that."</TE>
<TE>   The sense of uncertainty is being fueled by Duhalde's negotiations
with the IMF. The president has balked at IMF demands that Argentina
carry out drastic financial reforms, especially in its heavily indebted
provincial governments. Several provinces--including Buenos Aires
province, the country's most populous--continue to issue their own
currencies to pay salaries and other obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Fears that the IMF might abandon Argentina altogether have helped push
down the value of the peso.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's steep decline, several men and women arrived in the
predawn hours Monday to offer their services as place holders in lines
that were already forming in the downtown banking district.</TE>
<TE>   The government announced late Sunday that exchange houses would be
open for only limited hours beginning at 11:30 a.m. But the official
declaration didn't reach many exchanges houses, which opened as usual at
9.</TE>
<TE>   By midday, an atmosphere of barely controlled chaos reigned, with the
crowds of people who were waiting to buy dollars spilling onto the
streets and blocking traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unbelievable. It just doesn't stop," muttered one
businessman, shaking his head outside an exchange house where the rate
posted on an electronic bulletin board had risen from 3.4 pesos to the
dollar to 3.7 during the hour he waited in line.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Won't Chase Enemy Into Pakistan</HD>
<DH>War: Rumsfeld notes nation's cooperation in arresting fighters who
cross from Afghanistan. But he says he's concerned about Iran.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States will not pursue Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
into Pakistan because it is satisfied that President Pervez Musharraf's
government is "working very hard to help us to stop them from coming
across," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Calling Musharraf "enormously cooperative," Rumsfeld said Pakistani
troops posted along the porous mountain border with Afghanistan have made
"a good deal" of arrests of those who managed to cross. Last week, the
American commander of the fierce battle in eastern Afghanistan's Shahi
Kot valley said U.S. troops might chase fleeing Al Qaeda forces into
Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld said he was far more concerned about the Afghan-Iranian
border.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no question but that Iran has not been doing what Musharraf
and the Pakistanis have been doing--indeed, quite the contrary," Rumsfeld
said in a Pentagon briefing. The Iranians have been "notably helpful" to
fleeing Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt at all but that people have been moving back and
forth across that border, to the great disadvantage of the interim
government of Afghanistan and the Afghan people," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking the borders has become a crucial focus in the U.S.-led
military campaign because Pentagon strategists believe that Al Qaeda
fighters are seeking to regroup in Afghanistan, neighboring countries and
other regional nations such as Yemen to plot acts of terrorism. Pentagon
officials fear that a reconstituted Al Qaeda could mount new attacks
within months.</TE>
<TE>   The officials note that the battle at Shahi Kot involved Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters who apparently had assembled there. U.S. forces
searching the area after the battle have found small arms, mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns, computers, manuals,
passports, phone lists, maps and bomb-making notes that indicate an
active terror movement, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said at the briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Myers said that, over the weekend, U.S. forces in the
southern province of Kandahar found a laboratory containing equipment
that could be used to make anthrax. It looked as though someone had tried
to destroy the gear, which included a dryer and an autoclave, Myers said.
Not all the equipment needed to make anthrax was found, and there was no
evidence that the occupants had been able to turn the powder into a
weapon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Swabs of substances at three of five such labs in Afghanistan turned
up evidence of anthrax and ricin, a toxin made from castor bean plants.
But the samples were in trace amounts that might have occurred naturally,
a defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld and Myers also offered the first details of how the U.S. Army
will train a new Afghan military. U.S. soldiers--numbering in the "low
hundreds at most," Myers said--will put Afghan troops through 10-week
training cycles at the squad, platoon, company and battalion levels.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officers are expected to take over training by the end of the
year, and the program should be complete within 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The size and cost of the U.S. training effort are still under
discussion. The trainers would come from Army Special Forces soldiers
already in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai told him several weeks
ago in Afghanistan that forming an Afghan army was among his top
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "He was emphatic in stating that he did not want us to do this job for
him but wanted us to provide the wherewithal so the Afghans could do it
for themselves," Myers said in the briefing. "So this training effort is
in that spirit."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Afghan authorities arrested two gunmen who had been working for
U.S. forces Monday after an attack on the security chief of the eastern
city of Khowst.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Mohammed Ebrahim Mashfeq, governor of Khowst province,
said the men arrested were part of a U.S.-trained band who defied efforts
to disarm them Sunday by the city's security chief, Sur Gul.</LD>
<LD>   Gul was unhurt in the ensuing shootout, but his driver was killed and
two people were injured. The band retreated to a nearby air base where
U.S. Special Forces troops are stationed. The men were arrested outside
the base.</LD>
<TE>   "There was bad blood between Gul and the men who did not want to give
up their weapons," the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Gulbuddin, a senior aide of Afghan Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim
Fahim, dismissed the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "There are mercenaries all over this area. They change sides all the
time," he said. "They are a nuisance but not a threat."</TE>

<HD>Court Overturns Stoning Sentence</HD>
<DH>Nigeria: Divorced woman was convicted under Islamic law for having
sex outside wedlock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria
</DL>
<LD>A Muslim appeals court acquitted a Nigerian woman Monday who had
been sentenced to death by stoning for having sex out of wedlock. The
case had prompted protests at home and abroad and raised fears of
religious unrest in the West African nation.</LD>
<LD>   Tambari Usman, one of four judges on the panel hearing the appeal in
the northern city of Sokoto, said the evidence presented was insufficient
to warrant a conviction.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you, thank you," Safiya Hussaini murmured as well-wishers
translated the ruling from Arabic into her native Hausa language.</LD>
<TE>   The 35-year-old mother of five was the first of at least two women
sentenced to death by stoning since a dozen Nigerian states began
implementing Sharia, or Islamic law, two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Amina Lawal Kurami was condemned to the same fate Friday in Katsina
state, just days after President Olusegun Obasanjo's government declared
unconstitutional the harshest of Sharia punishments, such as beheadings,
stonings and amputations. She has 30 days to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In Kurami's case, the offense also was having sex out of wedlock. She
gave birth to a girl more than nine months after divorcing her husband.
The man she said was the father was acquitted for lack of evidence after
he denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Sokoto Gov. Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa called Monday's decision "fair
and just" and evidence of Sharia's effectiveness. Several other northern
state governments also say they will continue to uphold the laws, despite
the mounting opposition from the federal administration.</TE>

<LD>   "We reassessed the situation, and the latest assessment was that it is

<HD>Industry's a Key Player in Energy Data</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bush team, faced with a deadline, releases documents on
task force. Many passages are edited out, fanning controversy.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Monday released thousands of documents on
its energy task force, showing that industry groups provided substantial
input in drafting the president's energy plan.</LD>
<LD>   In putting out 11,000 pages of documents before a midnight deadline,
the Energy Department gave new ammunition to critics of the
administration's energy policy, who say it is tilted in favor of the
coal, gas, oil and nuclear industries.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show that Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham met with more
than 30 industry representatives at eight sessions from Feb. 14 to April
26. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the Independent Petroleum Assn. of
America and the American Coal Co. were among the business groups invited
to those sessions.</LD>
<TE>   No representatives of environmental or consumer groups were listed as
meeting with Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Abraham said the documents show that the energy plan
was "balanced" and that the Energy Department "not only sought but
included all viewpoints." Department officials said they sought input
from environmentalists but were often rebuffed. Environmental groups have
said their calls to administration officials weren't returned.</TE>
<TE>   The department said that Abraham had declined a number of requests
from business executives for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The documents did little to quell a legal and political controversy
over the dealings of the energy task force, established by President Bush
only days after he took office. Bush, a former oilman, named Vice
President Dick Cheney, who had led an energy services company, to head
the task force.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's refusal to provide details of the task force's
meetings led the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, to file its first-ever lawsuit Feb. 22 against the executive
branch. That lawsuit has not been resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental
organization, and Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group,
successfully brought court cases forcing the Energy Department and other
federal agencies that participated in the task force to make their
records available.</TE>
<TE>   Those two organizations had sought documents last spring under the
Freedom of Information Act and sued when it appeared that the government
was dragging its feet on those requests. The two judges in these lawsuits
set Monday as the deadline to begin releasing the documents.</TE>
<TE>Energy Dept. Withholds Thousands of Pages</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Energy Department documents, about 5,000 pages of
documents were released Monday by the Department of Agriculture, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Management and Budget.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department withheld 15,000 pages of documents. Of the
11,000 provided, many were heavily redacted. The omissions fanned the
controversy over the task force's secret meetings and contacts with
industry groups, many of which were sources of sizable donations to the
Bush-Cheney campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Abel Lopez, director of an Energy Department office that deals with
requests for records, said the deletions were permitted under the Freedom
of Information Act, which "protects advice, recommendations and opinions"
that are part of the executive branch's decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   Such redaction is not uncommon. Under the Freedom of Information Act,
government agencies may refuse to release information for a variety of
reasons, including protecting an individual's privacy or shielding policy
debates.</TE>
<TE>   But Judicial Watch officials accused the administration of holding
back key records and vowed to return to court. "They're withholding
information that the public has a right to obtain," said Larry Klayman,
chairman and general counsel of the conservative watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The documents were provided to a variety of environmental groups and
media organizations, including The Times, which had requested the
information under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   The documents show that the California energy crisis last year was a
much-discussed topic at the Energy Department, with e-mails on the
state's troubles often flagged as high priority. But in most cases, the
content of the e-mails was edited out.</TE>
<TE>   "Virtually all the e-mails we have seen have been completely blanked
out," said John Walke, director of clean air programs for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "There are huge blank passages associated with
the e-mails. Some of the sentences are cut off in the middle and redacted
out in the bizarre way."</TE>
<TE>   Walke was particularly interested in learning about plans for the new
source review provision of the Clean Air Act, which requires plants to
install state-of-the-art pollution control devices when they renovate
their plants in a way that increases pollution.</TE>
<TE>   But while the phrase "New Source Review" or its abbreviation may
appear in the subject or below an attachment icon, there is no text.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you nothing," Walke said. "The substance is purposefully
stricken from the document."</TE>
<TE>Give-and-Take Revealed in E-Mails</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents released were e-mails between energy officials,
detailed schedules for the secretary's chief of staff and other key
officials, e-mails from citizens praising the plan or suggesting various
technologies that would help solve the country's energy woes.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the e-mails from industry lobbyists and representatives to key
members of the administration's energy task force suggested that there
was significant give-and-take in the development of the plan. For
instance, the National Petrochemical and Refiners Assn. and the Nuclear
Energy Institute supplied recommended paragraphs to drop into specific
sections of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The release also included many documents already public, such as
energy proposals from think tanks, environmental groups and industry
associations; administration officials' testimony to Congress; letters to
the agency from members of Congress; and news reports on energy troubles
from newspapers, wire services and broadcast outlets.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA documents included appeals by the oil industry for reducing
the number of gasoline formulas used across the country and by the auto
industry for reevaluating the government's fuel-economy standards. The
administration's plan called for studying both issues.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers contend that the energy industry, including
scandal-plagued Enron Corp., heavily influenced shaping of a
production-tilted energy policy that favors the oil, gas, coal and
nuclear industries. Indeed, the administration has acknowledged that
Enron officials met six times with task force officials, including once
with Cheney himself.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House last summer approved an energy plan
that included a number of the administration's initiatives, including
opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.
The Democratic-controlled Senate has been bogged down in a debate on a
far different energy bill that would stress conservation over production.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO is continuing to wage its legal battle to secure additional
information, including White House records. Administration officials have
said they may claim executive privilege--a doctrine that presidents from
George Washington onward have used to withhold information from Congress
or the judiciary--to maintain the confidentiality of Cheney's records.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that releasing the information would set a bad
precedent for future administrations seeking candid advice from outside
experts.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday that the release of
the documents did not alter the White House's opposition to making public
the details of Cheney's meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "The constitutional principle that the president and the vice
president have enunciated remains in place," Fleischer said, "and the
president will continue to fight for that."</TE>

<HD>Flight 93 Families to Hear Tape of Jet's Last Moments</HD>
<DH>Hijacking: The FBI had resisted sharing the 'graphic' recording of
the struggle aboard the aircraft on Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Hoping to recognize the voices of their loved ones who died Sept.
11 on United Flight 93, family members have convinced the government to
let them hear the cockpit tape of the hijacked plane's last moments, when
passengers struggled to seize control of the aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   "Anyone who has heard one of these tragic recordings doesn't want to
hear another one--they are unimaginably tragic," said aviation consultant
Peter Goelz, who listened to several cockpit tapes in his former capacity
as managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI has agreed to play the half-hour recording in a private
session tentatively scheduled for April 18, ending months of reluctance
to accommodate the families' requests. Cockpit tapes are closely held and
usually are played only for investigators, although it is common for
authorities to later release an edited transcript.</LD>
<TE>   Flight 93 crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers apparently
tried to take back control of the Boeing 757 to thwart a second attack on
Washington. "There are sounds of a struggle," an FBI official said. "It's
fairly graphic."</TE>
<TE>   A widow whose late husband is believed to have been a leader of the
revolt began the campaign for a listening session for the families. Deena
Burnett's husband, Bay Area businessman Tom Burnett, was among 40
passengers and crew who were killed on the Newark, N.J.-to-San Francisco
flight. Four hijackers also died.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorists took control, quite likely killing the pilots,
the Burnetts spoke four times by telephone. Deena Burnett said she told
her husband about the attacks on New York and Washington, and that
strengthened his determination to act, regardless of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "When we hung up from that last conversation, I felt that Tom had
complete confidence that he was capable of handling the situation and
that I was going to see him later that day," Burnett said. "I want to
hear from the cockpit voice recorder what happened after he hung up the
phone."</TE>
<TE>   She began asking to hear the tapes even before they were recovered
from the crash site crater. But the FBI resisted.</TE>
<TE>   "While we empathize with the grieving families, we do not believe that
the horror captured on the cockpit voice recording will console them in
any way," Assistant Director John E. Collingwood wrote Rep. Ellen O.
Tauscher (D-Alamo), who had taken up Burnett's cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The voices are, for the most part, indistinguishable," Collingwood
warned.</TE>
<TE>   But the prospect of hearing the voices of loved ones now remembered as
national heroes exerts a powerful pull on some of the family members. The
families' case became stronger after detailed descriptions from the tapes
were published by Newsweek magazine in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be confused and muffled, and frantic and
frustrating, but perhaps there will be just a smattering of recognizable
voices," said Alice Hoglan of Los Gatos, Calif., whose son Mark Bingham
is also believed to have taken part in the passenger rebellion. "It's the
only hard evidence we have aside from the eyewitness accounts of the
crash. I know it's going to be excruciating, but I can't help but think
it might be somewhat healing."</TE>
<TE>   Aviation experts are not sure. "Some of the families think this will
give them closure," said an industry official who asked not to be
identified. "But people could get nightmares from listening to this and
have to live with that for some time."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI will provide counselors to help family members during and
after the listening session, Burnett said. The government has offered to
cover expenses for two people from each family to travel to a facility in
Princeton, N.J., where the session will be held. No recording devices
will be permitted. The tape will be played twice, and in between,
officials will answer questions from family members.</TE>
<TE>   Even in her own family, Burnett said there are some who probably will
not want to hear what is on the tape. "They want to remember how Tom
lived as opposed to having imprinted on their minds--with sounds--how he
died," she said. "Some people are most comforted by their imaginations,
but my imagination wreaked terror on me. It's better for me to hear the
sounds than lie awake at night imagining what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Steadfast in her determination, Burnett hopes the knowledge she gains
from the tape will become part of her husband's legacy to their three
young daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "From the very beginning, I've tried to hear his voice," she said. "I
have complete confidence he was in the cockpit when that plane crashed.
But regardless of what we hear or do not hear, there were 40 heroes on
Flight 93 and they all should be remembered and known."</TE>

<HD>Nursing Homes Warn of Medicare Cuts' Effects</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nursing homes may be forced to cut jobs and services if the federal
government eliminates billions of dollars in federal Medicare funding
this October, industry officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like pushing access to quality patient care into a free-fall,"
said Dr. Charles Roadman, president of the American Health Care Assn.,
which represents nursing homes.</LD>
<LD>   The industry released figures claiming it would lose nearly $3 billion
if the Medicare cuts move forward. Congress agreed to cut billions of
dollars from Medicare in 1997 when it balanced the federal budget. But
lawmakers restored some of the money after health providers complained.
Those givebacks are due to expire this fall.</LD>

<LD>Nevada's only medical school will lose its malpractice insurance
July 1, and if replacement coverage is not found, the medical care of
thousands of patients treated by faculty and residents could cease,
university officials said.</LD>

<LD>A former police officer awaiting retrial in the torture of Abner
Louima was indicted on perjury charges.</LD>
<LD>   According to federal prosecutors, Charles Schwarz lied at a trial in
2000 when he denied escorting Louima inside a Brooklyn station house and
being present when the Haitian immigrant was assaulted.</LD>
<LD>   Schwarz has said he wasn't present when Officer Justin Volpe sodomized
Louima with a broken broomstick. After Volpe pleaded guilty in the 1997
attack, a jury convicted Schwarz of violating Louima's civil rights by
holding him down during the assault. Last month, a federal appeals court
overturned Schwarz's conviction.</LD>

family of a man who died after taking its Rezulin diabetes drug for about
a month, a jury ruled.</LD>
<LD>   State court jurors in Tulsa deliberated more than 10 hours before
voting, 10-2, that Rezulin was responsible for Michael Wakefield's death.
The 41-year-old salesman died of liver failure in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The case is among thousands of suits filed on behalf of former Rezulin
users who say company officials hid the drug's health risks to pump up
sales. The drug was yanked off the market in the U.S. in March 2000 after
being linked to at least 63 liver-related deaths.</LD>

<LD>A Miami Shores, Fla., nursing home asked that a union vote be
thrown out, saying a series of voodoo signs may have scared the
facility's large Haitian American work force into voting to organize.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at Mount Sinai-St. Francis Nursing and Rehabilitation Center
testified during a National Labor Relations Board hearing that they saw
lines of pennies, half-empty water cups and a union supporter twisting
black beads in her hands before the Feb. 28 vote.</LD>
<LD>   The workers voted after complaining of low wages, unaffordable health
insurance and mistreatment.</LD>

<HD>Mojave Preserve Makes 10 Most Endangered Parks List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Mountain views in some of the country's signature national parks
are clouded by air pollution, while historic monuments are crumbling for
lack of cash, a park advocacy group says.</LD>
<LD>   The National Parks Conservation Assn. Monday released its annual list
of "America's Ten Most Endangered National Parks."</LD>
<LD>   Mojave National Preserve in California is among the newcomers. Among
its problems: water drained by nearby development, illegal wildlife
poaching and habitat damage from off-road vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   The list also includes Yellowstone National Park, which is threatened
by air pollution caused by snowmobiles--and Federal Hall National
Monument in New York, where George Washington was sworn in as president.
The lower Manhattan site was damaged during the attack on the nearby
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Although our national parks are protected on paper, the dangers they
face continue to multiply," said Thomas Kiernan, president of the
conservation association. "Our national parks need to be protected and
fully funded, and the parks must be freed from the burdens of encroaching
development and air and water pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Kiernan said President Bush's plan to increase funding for national
parks is good, but more is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has proposed $663 million for new construction and maintenance
projects, ranging from erecting new buildings to repairing sewer lines.
That proposal for the year beginning Oct. 1 is about $2 million more than
Congress appropriated for the current year.</TE>
<TE>   The parks association is lobbying Congress for more money to hire
additional park employees, such as archeologists and biologists, and to
catch up on a substantial maintenance backlog.</TE>
<TE>   David Barna, a spokesman for the park service, said the agency
appreciates the attention the conservation group gives to national parks.
But he said the issues parks confront can't be limited to a list of 10.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 385 sites, and it is like we have 385 children out there,"
Barna said. "Nobody likes to pick out a favorite child."</TE>
<TE>   The National Parks Conservation Assn., founded in 1919, is a private
nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to national parks.</TE>

<DL>ALTO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>Sandy Gilmore kicked through the charred remains Monday of what was
once her mobile home, reduced by a mountain fire to steel girders on a
cinder block foundation.</LD>
<LD>   "All the clothes are gone, but the hangers are lined up on the
ground," said Gilmore, 46, sorting through the blackened debris that was
her closet.</LD>
<LD>   Her Yorkie-mix dog, Poochie, has been missing since Saturday when the
blaze hopscotched through Gilmore's subdivision in the Sacramento
Mountains, forcing the evacuation of 1,300 people and destroying 28
homes.</LD>
<TE>   No one was injured, but there was little else for Gilmore and her
neighbors to cheer about when they returned home Monday. Smoke still
curled from a hot spot about 500 yards away from the end of Gilmore's cul
de sac.</TE>
<TE>   The initial damage estimate by the Lincoln County assessor's office
was $5.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gary Johnson said the south-central New Mexico blaze, which
charred about 960 acres, started when a resident dumped fireplace ash in
a backyard in the mistaken belief the ashes were cold. Wind gusting
almost 60 mph churned the flames.</TE>
<TE>   That blaze was fully contained Monday night as firefighters continued
to mop up. But another fire burned on more than 16,400 acres in the
nearby mountains of the Mescalero Apache Reservation. The area was
declared a state disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Nina Pedroni and her husband, Steve, were watching from a ridge
Saturday as the blaze raced closer to their mobile home. The flames
stopped about 50 feet short of their home.</TE>
<TE>   "We got here and there was ash on our house," she said. "The smoke
detectors were going crazy."</TE>

<HD>Audit Able to Beat Security at Airports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the government waged a "zero tolerance" policy against aviation
security lapses after the Sept. 11 attacks, investigators were able to
get knives, guns and fake bombs past airport baggage- and
passenger-screening checkpoints, a government source said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Undercover investigators, conducting an audit of 32 airports for the
Transportation Department's inspector general, were also able to gain
access to restricted areas or even board airplanes without being
challenged by security on dozens of occasions, according to the source,
who requested anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Inspector General Kenneth Mead's report found that screeners missed
knives 70% of the time, guns 30% of the time and simulated explosives 60%
of the time, the source said.</LD>
<TE>   The story was first reported in USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   The tests were conducted while the screening checkpoints were still
primarily under the supervision of the airline industry, with some
oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration. The new Transportation
Security Administration took over responsibility for airline security
Feb. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Security administration spokesman Paul Turk said the White House
requested the inquiry. "The idea was to get a realistic assessment of
potential needs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The security agency is hiring 30,000 federal employees to take over
passenger screening. On Monday, it began training the first 300 of 1,200
senior supervisors, who will run the airport checkpoints. The other 900
will be trained over the next three weeks. The supervisors all have law
enforcement, security or military backgrounds, Turk said.</TE>
<TE>   Security breaches caused the government to evacuate 59 airport
concourses or terminals from Oct. 30 to March 7, forcing 2,456 flights to
be delayed or canceled, the FAA says. Passengers on an additional 734
flights had to leave their seats and go through security a second time,
the FAA said.</TE>
<TE>   Former FAA security chief Billie Vincent said the report was not
surprising, considering that checkpoints were staffed by the same
low-paid, poorly trained screeners who were there before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Vincent said, current equipment cannot detect explosives,
neither can it detect many varieties of cutting tools.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology at the screening points is not there," Vincent said.
"The current metal detectors won't do the job. If you turn it high enough
to detect that much metal, you will have an alarm on every person going
through."</TE>

<HD>FDA Warns That Kava Use May Cause Liver Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers and doctors
Monday that kava, a popular dietary supplement, carries a "potential
risk" of causing severe liver damage.</LD>
<LD>   The advisory urged kava consumers and their doctors to be on the
lookout for signs of liver injury. It came three months after the FDA
asked doctors to review their cases for links between kava and liver
problems.</LD>
<LD>   FDA officials said the decision was made to alert consumers about the
rare pattern while they continue to search for a "biological
relationship" between cases of liver toxicity and use of kava, which is
marketed to relieve sleeplessness, stress, anxiety and menopausal
symptoms.</LD>
<TE>   "What we are saying is: 'OK, consumers, if you are taking kava you
should be aware of this pattern,' " said FDA spokeswoman Ruth Welch.
"We're saying there is some reason for concern, but we do not have a
biological explanation for this."</TE>
<TE>   The herbal supplement has been connected to more than 25 cases of
liver-related injuries in other countries, FDA officials said. The FDA
noted the product has been the target of warnings and even recalls by
foreign regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators know of at least one U.S. case of a previously healthy
young woman who required a liver transplant after taking kava. The agency
is still attempting to establish a link between use of the herb and the
woman's liver failure.</TE>
<TE>   Several other reports of liver problems in individuals who had
consumed kava have been reported since the FDA began actively seeking
information about side effects from doctors and consumers in December.
The plant indigenous to South Pacific islands is marketed as a drink or a
pill.</TE>
<TE>   Kava ranks ninth in herbal supplements sold in the U.S., with about
$68 million in annual sales, according to industry groups. The most
popular anti-stress herb, it is packaged under a variety of names,
including ava, awa, intoxicating pepper and kew.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA urged consumers to watch for signs of liver trouble such as
jaundice and brown urine. It advised them to consult a physician if they
experience less specific symptoms such as nausea, weakness and unusual
tiredness.</TE>
<TE>   "Given these reports, persons who have liver disease or liver
problems, or persons who are taking drug products that can affect the
liver, should consult a physician before using kava-containing
supplements," the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest warning about a dietary supplement comes after a string of
enforcement efforts by the FDA on the loosely regulated,
$15-billion-a-year supplement industry. A 1994 law made the industry
largely responsible for guaranteeing the accuracy and safety of its
products before bringing them to market, although the FDA still has
post-marketing responsibilities for safety and product information.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, popular dietary supplements promoted for prostate health
by Brea-based BotanicLab Inc. were recalled after the California
Department of Health and Human Services found the over-the-counter pills
PC SPES and SPES contained prescription medication.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about potential risks associated with kava have concerned
the dietary supplement industry, which has backed FDA efforts to
investigate it.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand [the FDA's] concern and the decision to send something
out to the consuming public," said Loren Israelson, executive director of
the Utah Natural Products Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "we'd hoped to work with them a bit more on how best
to communicate what we do know and what we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Israelson said that while the number of cases is "very small but very
serious," he noted that causes of the problems aside from kava have not
been ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Harvey, chief scientist for the National Nutritional Foods Assn.,
which represents 3,000 retailers and 1,000 manufacturers, said the
industry wants to get to the bottom of any potential risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Kava has been very popular and used for centuries," Harvey said. "And
just like any food, certain people may be sensitive to a product. Nothing
is 100% safe for all people."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said Monday it will continue to investigate adverse effects
believed to be related to kava and alert consumers to the findings.
Officials said they will take additional action "if warranted."</TE>
