<LD>A rocket scientist walks into a comedy club on Hollywood Boulevard
....</LD>
<LD>   Improv comic Gregory Harrison's best line is not a joke. Yes, his
day job is rocket science, doing what he calls his "Mars work" at the
Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   And at night, he performs at the ImprovOlympic West in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not really funny around here," said Harrison, apologetically,
as he walked from the "sandbox"--a simulated Mars environment where
rover test operations take place--to his office upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   And no, he hardly ever jokes about space. The connections between
his day job and his night job are more subtle than that.</TE>
<TE>   "The romantic way I see it is to think of myself as an explorer
here and as an explorer on stage," he says. But at JPL, "there's a
lot of deep thought, absorbing something and exploring all the
possibilities." On stage, "it's very different. I have to act and
react fast." At the lab, 37-year-old Harrison analyzes thousands of
problems, denoted in spreadsheets. "I have a Type A personality," he
says. "I'm very goal- and success-oriented ... constantly thinking,
how much time do I have? In five minutes, I have to do this. I've got
it all mapped out in my head." With improv, "there's no way of
knowing where it's going to go. The lack of knowing the
future--that's what really gets me." It's an antidote, he says, to
days spent anticipating problems and fixing them.</TE>
<TE>   He bases his material on "the quirkiness of my own self," like
reading the entire car owner's manual at 2 a.m. in preparation for a
road trip to Sacramento. "It was totally insane. I was like, 'OK,
here's the headset. This is how you adjust the headset.' Nobody does
that."</TE>
<TE>   This obsessive manual ritual became a skit in the one-man show
he's tentatively scheduled to perform at the ImprovOlympic in late
June. "Basically, I will personify the owner's manual and put it on
the psychiatrist's couch--the trauma of having been read cover to
cover." The one-man show is a divergence from Harrison's other comedy
work--long-form improvisation, the anarchistic performance of free
association.</TE>
<TE>   "Monty Python is a real big influence," he says. "The freshness of
the sketches, the wackiness." His favorite skit is the "fish-slapping
dance" in which Michael Palin slaps John Cleese on the cheek with a
little fish, in what seems like a ritualistic dance. Cleese responds
by whacking Palin in the head with a much bigger fish. "What does it
mean?" Harrison says, grinning. "Nothing, but I love it."</TE>
<TE>   There was no fish-slapping as Harrison took the stage on a recent
night with the eight-member group Stabile, just an improvisation on
how a member of the audience might dream that night--and the word of
the night: "peanut," which Harrison played out as a peanut-news
newscaster, a child with a benign tumor, a peanut-store
accountant....</TE>
<TE>   And there were no jokes about Mars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Power to Them</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Portman  brought a spot of color into a room full of
studio execs, publicists and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   She beamed at everyone who met her gaze, gave her publicists a
high-five and held herself with a balletic poise that evaporated when
she spotted a bearded man in the corner.</TE>
<TE>   In one movement, she was in his arms. He was former 20th Century
Fox chief Bill Mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   After that brief but emotional moment, she moved on through the
crowd, telling another guest: "I just masquerade as if I'm cool."</TE>
<TE>   It was lunchtime on Wednesday at the Four Seasons in Beverly
Hills, and Portman was one of five people honored by Premiere
magazine as Hollywood's "new power."</TE>
<TE>   The others included actor Hugh Jackman and producer Nancy Juvonen,
director Christopher Nolan, and 20th Century Fox executive Emma
Watts.</TE>
<TE>   Between the salad and the salmon, talk at one table turned to the
Cannes Film Festival: Sharon Stone's winning personality, the
shortage of televisions at the Hotel du Cap and the lack of menu
variety ("I had sea bass five nights in a row," one woman said.)</TE>
<TE>   At another table, Tracey Ullman amused her mates with a quick
dance number between tables.</TE>
<TE>   As waiters handed out mini lemon meringue pies, Carrie Fisher paid
her respects to the "new" Hollywood power, which she said arrived
just in time, as "some of the old power was beginning to smell."</TE>
<TE>   In her speech honoring Portman, Fisher joked that she and the
21-year-old actress share a special bond as participants in the "Star
Wars" franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both little dolls and big cardboard cutouts and Pez
dispensers," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "For a price, you can flip our heads back, and a tiny rectangle
wafer will come out of our necks. How many people can say that?"</TE>

<LD>THE COUNT AND THE CONFESSION</LD>
<LD>   A True Mystery</LD>
<LD>   By John Taylor</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   366 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Opposites fascinate. Roger Zygmunt de la Burde, born to a bullying
father and suicidal mother in Nazi-occupied Krakow, lived a largely
self-fantasized life. In Powhatan County, Va., he pulled enough wool
over enough eyes to pass himself off as a wealthy Franco-Polish count
of ancient lineage. It didn't hurt, of course, that he was a renowned
art collector and a chivalrous lover to his wife, while keeping his
mistresses discreetly on the side. ("European morals," the locals
diagnosed.)</TE>
<TE>   The ever-flamboyant De la Burde could boast some real
accomplishments. He amassed real estate assets that could have erased
his mounting debts. He adored the art he stole and fenced, and put
years into writing a book about it. He was a valued chemist, working
in the labs at Philip Morris until he quit in order to launch a
potentially lucrative "stolen patent" lawsuit. If Burde often rubbed
men the wrong way--"impatient and unrealistic ... suspicious,
tightfisted, and easily angered," according to his own publisher, he
could charm women, from his housekeeper-cum-procuratress to the
daughters of his girlfriends. For 13 years he enjoyed the love and
support of a Southern lady of pedigree and social standing, finally
relinquishing his marriage of appearances for the sake of her
company. It was this woman, Beverly Monroe, who would be convicted of
his murder.</TE>
<TE>   In his account of the 1992 case, "The Count and the Confession,"
writer John Taylor displays a respect for facts and for people that
his subject, poor, narcissistic Burde, utterly lacked. Each of the
carefully sketched portraits in this engrossing tale manages to slide
smoothly inside a certain point of view, heightening the tale's
tension through an overall effect of blind single-mindednesses and
colliding misapprehensions. Taylor's self-effacing style permits the
story to race ahead in all its garish improbability. Given the
complexities of the Monroe case, one wouldn't be surprised to find an
author falling back on that irritating device so popular with
nonfiction dramatizers, the "imputed" inner life of characters. But
Taylor refrains from fudging: Every thought and emotional response
recorded here has a documented ring to it, and the text is nowhere
weakened by a rash of "conceivablies," "probablies" and "almost
certainlies."</TE>
<TE>   The county's chief investigator, David Riley, who by the end of
the day would succeed in eliciting Monroe's confused and later
retracted confession, summed up the case's tabloidish aspects to his
suspect directly, in a confidential  tete-a-tete. Riley didn't blame
her, "considering Roger's abominable behavior and his affairs with
Krystyna Drewnowska [a new girlfriend pregnant with Roger's child at
the time of the shooting]....What surprised him, he said, was that
she had been able to tolerate the heartless monster for so long. 'You
should get a medal,' he told her." A little later Riley emphasized
that "the commonwealth attorney ... could paint her as deceitful,
manipulative, and vengeful--'a black widow spider ... that killed her
mate.'"</TE>
<TE>   Taylor does a nuanced job on the elements of scandal and personal
weakness, never allowing this true story to slip into titillating
sensationalism. But it is when he lays bare the legal, procedural and
institutional scandal and weakness that his work really shines.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the book arrives at its white-knuckle conclusion, the
players stand out clearly as either fairly reprehensible (Krystyna, a
perjuring witness, possibly Riley), dubious (De la Burde, his
daughter Corinna, the defense trial lawyer), or holding fast to the
high ground (Beverly's oldest daughter, her boyfriend, Alan, and
perhaps Beverly herself). The police and justice systems come out
looking thoroughly tarnished and inadequate--frightening, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   Appearances of official impropriety add up, acts of omission and
commission that go well beyond the "one-sidedness" inherent to an
adversarial system of law. They range from alleged lies that
encourage the confession, and undisclosed and possibly "lost"
evidence, to a judge and prosecutor in cahoots to wrap up a
first-degree-murder trial in time for their alma mater's big football
game. Whatever the reader's personal leaning with regard to the
question of Monroe's guilt or innocence--and Taylor does not push his
own views on us--one cannot help feeling a frisson of terror at the
thought of ever waking up in her predicament.</TE>
<TE>   As her incredulous children gather round, as job and friends, life
savings and house melt away, as the press mocks and community
ostracizes her, Monroe even in prison keeps her head high. She holds
fast to the Southern manners that are her inalienable birthright. In
fact, some readers may end up feeling that even if innocent of
murdering her lover, Monroe nevertheless bears some guilt in this
story--for being a good girl, for having placed far too much trust in
the patriarchal society that always promised to look after and defend
her, as long as she did what the old boys wanted.</TE>

<HD>Donatella's Versace</HD>
<DH>Five years after her brother's murder, the Italian designer
is a creative force on her own</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a hairstylist on guard with a brush and a makeup artist standing
sentinel with a powder puff, fashion diva Donatella Versace thrusts
her left hip toward the camera. "My best side," she says in a smoky
voice, hooking her thumbs on the waistband of a pair of pants just a
shade more tangerine than her tan.</LD>
<LD>   Posing in front of a bougainvillea bush outside her bungalow at
the Beverly Hills Hotel, the designer is commanding every click of
this photo shoot. "Standing, no sitting," she says, grabbing at an
invisible roll at her tummy.</LD>
<LD>   An admitted control freak, Versace has been at the helm of an
Italian fashion house with annual sales close to $500 million since
her older brother Gianni was murdered in Miami five years ago this
July. Now, she seems finally to have emerged from his shadow.</LD>
<TE>   Riding high on a series of hit collections, dressing Jennifer
Lopez for the recent Academy Awards and playing Pygmalion to Chelsea
Clinton, she's turning her attention to expanding the Versace brand.
Still, she doesn't pretend to be her brother.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no comparison. Gianni was a genius. I'm ... a sister,"
she says sweetly on Tuesday, two days before she is to present her
fall collection at a benefit for the Children's Action Network and
Westside Children's Center. "Whatever I learned, I learned from him."</TE>
<TE>   Gianni may have coined Versace's over-the-top, glitzy sex goddess
look in the 1980s and 1990s, but it is Donatella who has brought it
down to earth for the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the excesses of her brother's era--chain-mail gowns
and gilded Byzantine images of Madonna and child on
clothes--Donatella's style is more restrained, less sex object and
more self-confident.</TE>
<TE>   Not that she hasn't pulled a red-carpet trick or two. The
navel-gazing green palm-leaf print dress Lopez wore to the Grammys in
2000 was all Donatella.</TE>
<TE>   But in her new fall collection, inspired by 1960s psychedelia, the
designer tempered the cleavage and slits with refined coats and
low-slung trousers for the cash-flush. (Versace's 10 lines range from
haute couture to the lower-priced Versace Jeans. Pieces from the
ready-to-wear collection, which range in price from $400 for a
swimsuit cover-up to $13,000 for a gown, are sold at the Beverly
Hills Versace boutique and Neiman Marcus.)</TE>
<TE>   "Gianni worked in another time," she says inside her bungalow, the
flame of a tuberose candle sputtering quietly on the table in front
of her. "He made people's careers with dresses with safety pins down
the side. Today, we want to be less impressive when we walk around.
We don't need to reveal our bodies with safety pins."</TE>
<TE>   Her brother is always present. She keeps a photo of him by her bed
when she travels, takes lunch in his art-filled office at the
company's Milan headquarters and thinks of him the minute the lights
go up after every runway show.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, 'Do you like this, yes or no?'" she says, taking a sip
of water from a straw so as not to smudge the pale pink lacquer on
her lips. "I think he was upset for a few things we did, but with
Gianni and me it was always like that. There were always
confrontations. People say I was his muse, but I was really his
disturber. I was the only one who would tell him the truth."</TE>
<TE>   If there is one thing Versace can't stand, it's yes men. She
insists that her 15-person design team is full of people who aren't
afraid to disagree with the boss. "I don't want them to have my
philosophy," she says, pushing a strand of arrow-straight,
miraculously blond hair behind her shoulder. "I tell them, 'I'm
hiring you because you like Yohji Yamamoto.' He's an artist, but I'm
not there [yet]."</TE>
<TE>   She oversees all of the collections including the lower-priced
Versus, where she got her start in 1993 designing under her brother's
tutelage.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion was different then, she says. "Used to be, the theme of a
collection was a trip to India or Morocco, but now the inspiration is
the real world, the cities, the people, the attitudes, the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting forward on a plush sofa, the designer is dripping with
jewels. On her right hand she wears a 1940s gold cuff with a
tourmaline the size of a half-dollar and a ring with a yellow
sapphire, both gifts from Gianni. On her left hand is a
knuckle-cracking diamond, a gift for Donatella from Donatella.</TE>
<TE>   Versace, whose birth date is the subject of some controversy
(variously listed as 1955, 1958 and 1959), is an inveterate traveler.
The house in Milan is for work and family. The renaissance Villa
Fontanelle on the shores of Lake Como, outside of Milan, is for
relaxing and partying. (Last fall, Donatella feted Lopez and hubby
Cris Judd there, and the couple stayed on for much of their
honeymoon.)</TE>
<TE>   She finds inspiration in London, where she recently cheered on her
pal Madonna in the play "Up for Grabs"; in New York, where she keeps
her brother's upper East Side apartment; and in L.A., where she soaks
in the colors of the city.</TE>
<TE>   She visits several times a year and shoots nearly all of her
advertising campaigns here. Diversions include dinner at Ivy at the
Shore in Santa Monica and cruising Venice Beach to watch surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way they put fashion together," she says, lighting a
Marlboro with a canary yellow rhinestone-studded lighter with the
company's Medusa emblem. "I mean, they are not scientists, but it
takes passion. New York people think about how to be chic and safe.
Here they dare, and that I like."</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere she goes, her bodyguards aren't far behind. Where
antique art influenced Gianni, she is constantly seeking out
cutting-edge artists and musicians for ideas or to sit in the front
row at her shows. (Both Moby and Robbie Williams were early Versace
discoveries.)</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't wear clothes by other designers except for Azzedine
Alaia, who is known for draping the body in second-skin, stretch
jersey. "The best fabric in the world," she says. Still, she likes to
stop into Fred Segal and Maxfield when she's in town, or she might
pick up something from Chrome Hearts on Robertson Boulevard, where
the rocker-chic aesthetic works perfectly with her wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   There are also lots of social calls to famous friends Kate
Capshaw, Rita Wilson and Melanie Griffith, who is host of a benefit
where Versace is presenting her runway show.</TE>
<TE>   Running with the jet set takes discipline. To keep herself up as
the quintessential tanned, taut and blond Versace queen, she works
out five days a week on a StairMaster and lifts free weights. She
doesn't diet but places a premium on the presentation of her food.
"Even if it's just an apple, I like it to be presented a certain way
on the plate," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there are late nights, which "I regret in the morning,"
says Versace who, like her brother, is famous for entertaining the
rich and thin.</TE>
<TE>   Not just a diva, she's also a mom. You won't find her slaving away
over Shake 'n Bake in the kitchen, but when she's in Milan, she
leaves work in time to have dinner with her kids, Allegra, 15, and
Daniel, 11. (Versace was married to the American-born Paul Beck, a
former model who oversaw the company's ad campaigns.)</TE>
<TE>   "Daniel wants to be a rock star--not a musician, a rock star," she
says grinning with pride.</TE>
<TE>   Allegra, who has been known to steal mommy's Manolos, is a budding
actress who plans to attend a theater program in New York City this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'You are going to be rejected. You're going to go to
casting, and you have to be ready to be rejected.' I told her the
truth," Versace says, shrugging. "But she likes the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Although she would never force her children into the family
business, they never miss a runway show. "After the show is over, I'm
terrified--not of the press, of them--that they'll say, 'Mommy, you
look so old!'"</TE>
<TE>   Runway shows with stellar front rows are Versace's forte. (At her
last couture show in Paris, Gwyneth Paltrow was wedged between
Chelsea Clinton and Madonna.) But the fashion business hinges on more
than a celebrity following.</TE>
<TE>   In a climate where luxury conglomerates Gucci Group and LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton make a large portion of their profits from
accessories, Versace isn't the house one looks to for the season's
hot bag or shoe.</TE>
<TE>   While company sales rose last year, profits dropped because of
increased investments in advertising and store remodeling. So,
Versace and her older brother, chief executive officer Santo, are
launching a two-year plan to gain tighter control over the house's
image, with the help of outside investors.</TE>
<TE>   Plans include buying back some licensing and franchising deals,
boosting accessories and home collections and opening new,
free-standing accessories stores.</TE>
<TE>   Versace dismisses rumors that she wants to take the company public
or to sell a majority stake. "It's not about the money," she says.
"It's about establishing Versace as a luxury brand."</TE>

<HD>The Straight Story: Hair Treatment Rules the Waves</HD>
<DH>Locks that stay smooth and silky is the promise of a new
perm that's catching on among the frizz-weary</DH>

<LD>Julie Mitchell's long, wavy hair normally coils into an unruly mass.
"I'd spend all this time getting ready, and I'd still be a big
ball of hair walking down the aisle," said the 38-year-old flight
attendant for Southwest Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   That was life P.P.--pre-perm. Now her shoulder-length hair hangs
ramrod straight, and her daily battle with the blow dryer is over.</LD>
<LD>   Her frizzy, out-of-control waves are getting flattened by a new
kind of chemical- and heat-based straightening process that's putting
Marcia Brady-perfect tresses on the heads of hundreds of relieved men
and women.</LD>
<TE>   For those with crazy, wavy, frizzy curls that spring and sproing,
the new treatments are to hair what Botox is to wrinkles: a
guaranteed quick fix for one of life's most vexing beauty hassles.
Tamed into a slick and soft texture, hair treated with the new
straight perms, also called retexturizing, radiates with an
indelible, natural-looking shine that was once impossible to obtain
artificially.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell has become so committed to her fuss-free straight hair
that last week she flew from Phoenix to have her third $350 treatment
at Gavert Atelier in Beverly Hills, which she discovered on the
Internet. She compares her natural hair to "Seinfeld's" Julia
Louis-Dreyfus character, Elaine, and has tried everything, including
relaxers that fried her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that said it would straighten, I would get. Anything
that said it would defrizz, I would get," she said. "I was obsessed
with it."</TE>
<TE>   So was Rhoni "Sweet Pea" Kahn, 38, an extraordinarily wavy-haired
boutique owner in Carmel who paid a San Francisco salon $450 for her
first straight perm in February.</TE>
<TE>   "It literally changed my life," she said. "I'm telling you as a
person who is in the garment industry who is very fashion-conscious
and ... completely obsessed about my hair, it's unbelievably
incredible," Kahn said. "It gives me an amazing amount of freedom.
You'd never know that I wasn't born with beautiful, straight, WASP-y
hair."</TE>
<TE>   Like Botox injections, the treatment requires a commitment of time
and money. In upscale Los Angeles salons, prices start at $250 and
can easily hit $600 or more for the three- to four-hour process,
while New York prices can begin at $800 or $900. By comparison, a
session of intricate color highlights can hit $150 or $200 in some of
these same salons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the coolest thing that has happened in hair in a long
time," said Mary Atherton, editor in chief of Modern Salon, a trade
publication based near Chicago, a city where the treatments are
gaining popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The several brands of perms now common in the United States derive
from a heat-based technique developed in Japan about seven years ago.
When used on already straight hair, the process gave the typically
coarse texture of Asian hair a soft and glossy finish--silk instead
of wool.</TE>
<TE>   Like a curly perm in reverse, most procedures use a combination of
ammonium thioglycolic acid to soften the hair, which is then
meticulously ironed to perfect flatness. A final neutralizing
solution locks in the texture and straightness.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike traditional relaxers or straighteners, which are harsh,
short-lived and apt to damage hair, the process actually improves
hair condition, vanquishes frizzies and lasts for months, said Stuart
Gavert, who has been offering the service at his salon for a year and
a half. The products and the ironing lock down the outermost layer of
the hair shaft to deliver softness and shine. Only about 5% of
Gavert's retexturizing clients are men, but he said that number may
increase as longer, and harder-to-tame, hairstyles become more
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Though straight perms are becoming increasingly available on the
coasts, they're still new to many mid-size cities. "No one had ever
heard of it in Phoenix," Mitchell said, "so I thought it was worth it
to come out and do it." Mitchell's wavy-haired sister, Janet
Townsend, 35, loved the look on Mitchell so much that she flew in
from Albuquerque for her first treatment, joining her sister at the
Beverly Hills salon.</TE>
<TE>   Though costly, the perms allow hair to emerge frizz-free from a
humid day or a dunk in the pool. For Carmel boutique owner Kahn, that
means Hawaiian vacations are no longer nightmares of hair taming and
desperate visits to hairdressers. Now that her hair air dries
reliably straight, Mitchell said she has shaved 30 minutes from her
grooming routine.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell also said, however, that after her first treatment, not
even a hot curling iron could put a bend in her tresses. After her
second treatment 10 months later, her hair became a little easier to
manage and to style into a soft wave.</TE>
<TE>   Most clients can wait five to six months before they need to treat
new hair at the roots, said Joe Furuhata, assistant manager of the
Yuko System Salon in Beverly Hills, a full-service salon that also
teaches the procedure and sells the professional products. "The
curlier hair you have, the more often you have to do the retouching,"
he said, "because the gap is more obvious." The regrowth, however,
can add a welcome lift to the flat hair.</TE>
<TE>   The treatments are in such demand that the Yuko System Salon and
the training classes are booked nearly six weeks in advance. Gavert
Atelier frequently performs three or four retexturizing perms a day.
Many of the clients are Japanese, yet a growing number are Persian,
Latino or of other ethnic backgrounds with wavy hair. Though African
American hair can be difficult to treat, Gavert said, his stylists
have found a combination of heat and tension that maintains a degree
of body in the sometimes ultra-fine and soft strands.</TE>
<TE>   Gavert warned that highly processed or damaged hair isn't a good
candidate for the perm. Thanks to new heat-activated products, he
said, he's been able to develop a thermal reconditioning treatment
that seals a rich protein conditioner into the hair and lasts from 10
to 15 shampoos. The $75 reconditioning tames frizz similarly to the
perm, but without the straightening effects or the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Hair salons across the country are welcoming the new process,
partly because it's lucrative, said Atherton of Modern Salon. It also
offers women with hard-to-manage hair a high-quality solution, as
long as they like board-straight hair. However, because the procedure
consumes so much of a stylist's day, some salons, such as Gamine in
Los Angeles, require a deposit and an initial consultation to
determine the cost and the hair's suitability. Gamine owner Julie
Rosenberg said she often tells clients to test the look with a $50
flat-ironed styling session at the salon before they commit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of miraculous, especially when you see it on a
curly-haired person," said Rosenberg, who is giving serious thought
to having her profuse curls straightened. "If I had this when I was
in high school--hello!--my life would have been so happy!"</TE>

<LD>Stars and Other Stuff</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever walked outside at night to look at the stars? Maybe
you have wished on a shooting star. (Actually, that was a meteor
blazing across the sky.) Or, perhaps you have recited "Star light,
star bright" and made a wish on the first star of the evening. (That
was probably Venus.) Wishes aside, stargazing is an enjoyable and
inexpensive activity that requires no special equipment. On a clear
night, you can see more than 2,000 stars with just your eyes!</LD>
<LD>   When you look at the sky at night, you are actually looking back
in time. The light from stars takes so long to reach our planet that
what you see is how they looked when their light started traveling to
Earth. This measure of distance is called a "light-year," which is
how far a beam of light travels in one year. For example, Sirius, the
brightest star in the sky, is 8.7 light years away. That means it
takes 8.7 years for its light to reach Earth.</LD>
<TE>   Stars change over millions of years. Many become larger and
eventually explode, blowing away most of the star and leaving a
tightly packed core that spins rapidly. These stars, known as
"pulsars," send out radio waves that can be detected on Earth.
Astronomers study pulsars to find out more about other stars,
including our sun.</TE>
<TE>   If you enjoy learning about our universe, tune in to the Reading
Rainbow episode "Space Case," airing at 12:30 p.m. Monday on KLCS-TV.
You can hear about the work of an astronomer at Lick Observatory in
Santa Cruz and visit an enormous radio telescope in Puerto Rico that
gathers the waves of pulsars. To learn more about stars and other
space objects, visit the Lick Observatory Web site at www.ucolick.org

<HD>Inevitably, a Non-Reporter News Anchor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcast journalism crossed a qualitative Rubicon this week, when
NBC announced that Brian Williams, a 43-year-old cable-news reader,
will replace Tom Brokaw, 62, as the network's news anchor following
the 2004 election.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, the dominant on-camera presence for MSNBC--the
third-rated cable-news network--will become the first person to
anchor a major network without any significant reporting experience.
Other than a brief stint in NBC's Washington bureau, Williams' entire
career has been spent on local television stations and in cable news,
where over the last few years reportage has given way to attitude and
correspondents have been replaced by a series of interchangeable
ranting heads.</LD>
<LD>   To his credit, Williams professes a total commitment to hard news.
His employers, meanwhile, promise two years of remedial education in
interviewing and international reporting. It is all a rather long and
dreary distance from the days when years of distinguished domestic
and foreign correspondence were prerequisites for aspiring anchors.
But serious analysts of broadcast news' distressing state think the
Williams moment was inevitable because television anchors with
extensive reporting experience are vying for a spot on the endangered
species list.</LD>
<TE>   "In many ways, the networks today are all front office and no
bench," says Martin Kaplan, who directs the Norman Lear Center at
USC's Annenberg School for Communication. "A generation ago, a
network correspondent could have gone from bureau to bureau across
the country and around the world gaining experience. But years of
corporate consolidation and retrenchment have left the networks with
one correspondent in London, who covers all of Europe and probably
North Africa, too.</TE>
<TE>   "With those exigencies at work, the only place from which a TV
journalist can emerge is the local affiliate," says Kaplan. "And when
you look at what local news in America is like, it's clear it's just
a desperate attempt to grab people's attention. Appearance, which is
one of Williams' strengths, is certainly one way to grab attention."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan thinks Williams may be the perfect anchor for these times
in which baby boomers may still care about networks and anchors,
while younger viewers may not need an institutionalized father
figure. "What the young seem to need," he says, "is quick fixes of
infotainment. For them, boredom is the biggest sin, not ignorance."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to literature, what the young seem to need is a good
long look into the mirror of self-regard. That, at least, is what is
suggested by forthcoming titles in "young adult fiction," geared to
readers between 13 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   Young adult is a category that now attracts serious literary
writers, the latest of whom is the improbably prolific Joyce Carol
Oates. Her novel, "Big Mouth and Ugly Girl," depicts the friendship
of a female high school athlete, "a loner," who comes to the defense
of a boy who foolishly jokes about killing people at school. The
story is loosely based on a series of such incidents that followed
the killings at Columbine High School.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a moral in my writing," Oates said in a recent
interview, "although it's not necessarily explicit. These young
people are made to realize certain flaws in their personalities and
characters, which we all can learn."</TE>
<TE>   Oates said she believes teenagers are "looking for stories about
their own lives, ways to behave and analyze emotional situations."</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic, awash in the profits from its Harry Potter series,
apparently agrees. It plans four young adult books for its new PUSH
imprint, and their subjects include self-mutilation, eating
disorders, drugs and arson.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids, like all the rest of us in American society, are given to
navel gazing," says Marc Aronson, a longtime editor of young adult
books and author of "Exploding the Myth: The Truth About Teenagers
and Reading." "But, 'What does this have to do with me?' is not a
question this generation invented. In this, adolescents' reading
habits have become most similar to confessional television and the
memoir vogue in adult publishing."</TE>
<TE>   And while what Aronson calls "the overly elaborated problem novel
with a 'bibiliotherapeutic' aim" has come to dominate the genre, he
believes some publishers are losing sight of another "vibrant strand
of interest" that leads teenagers to seek experiences apart from
their own. "There is a kind of mantra among publishers," Aronson
says, "that kids want to read only about themselves. So, there is
reflexive bowing to the god of realism. But the success of 'Harry
Potter' proves that kids want to read about a world that isn't their
own, one that is heroic, as in Tolkien."</TE>
<TE>   David Halberstam is the author of 18 books, most recently "War in
a Time of Peace" and the forthcoming "Firehouse": "I'm deeply engaged
in something I've wanted to do for a long time, which is a book on
the Korean War. Its focus is a battle fought at Thanksgiving time,
1950. There was a terrible miscalculation on the part of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur and others, and American troops were sent to the Yalu River
in arctic temperatures, there to be hit by Chinese forces, who
outnumbered them roughly eight to one--terrible odds. In the days
that followed, you have the heroic march of the First Marine Division
out of the Chosan, while the Army's Second Infantry got smacked. A
shooting war with the Chinese began, the Cold War deepened
dramatically and bad things happened as a consequence.</TE>

yellow bookshelf that has decorated the bedrooms of millions of
American girls. Ten, 20, 30 spines side by side, running from pale
lemon to dandelion, depending on the age of the book, titled in
identical typeface and carrying that small but familiar profile with
the magnifying glass--Nancy Drew.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to accept that Nancy Drew is dead. Certainly her
publishers would have us believe it is not so. Archway Paperbacks
finally got the girl detective into college six years ago where she
continues to stumble upon crimes that now include dorm thefts and
date rape. But for women of a certain age--let's be kind and say 30
and older--there was only one Nancy Drew--the slim, titian-haired
girl of the early books, the ones written by Mildred Benson, the
first of several writers to use the pen name Carolyn Keene for the
series, who died Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Nancy Drew is an American icon, perhaps the most widely
recognizable detective this side of the Atlantic, certainly one of
the most enduring figures in adolescent literature. Her name has
become shorthand for an adventuresome young female, the girl who,
upon hearing creaking floorboards and muffled knocks, advances,
flashlight in hand, while all her friends whisper after her, "Are you
crazy?"</LD>
<TE>   Benson's vision of Nancy Drew, the early Nancy Drew, is a rare
alchemy of fairy tale, adventure and camp, the magical elixir of
literary immortality. Her mother was dead, her father took her
seriously, her friends--Bess, fretting endlessly over her
"irrepressible plumpness," and tomboy George-- were neurotic enough
to make her look good, her boyfriend was true, if dull, she was
pretty and smart and, most important, she had a blue roadster of her
very own.</TE>
<TE>   For pre-"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" generations, she was all that
stood between us and our induction into the grim world of adult
literary heroines--the Madame Bovaries, the Sister Carries and the
Anna Kareninas, even the Elizabeth Bennets for whom happiness equaled
a wedding day. Nancy Drew would have found her runaway sister
herself, before the family's honor had been compromised, and the only
way Nancy Drew would throw herself under a train was if there were a
very important clue dangling there.</TE>
<TE>   "She could do everything," says Lea Fox, who runs a Web site
devoted to the foreign editions of the books (Drew has been
translated into 22 languages). "People criticize her for being
perfect, that she wasn't realistic, but I wasn't looking for realism
in my books when I was 12. I aspired to her level of competence."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy never got older, says Fox, 36, and she never got too
involved with the stalwart Ned Nickerson, which Fox also appreciated
when she was young. Where even feminist maverick Louisa May Alcott
capitulated to the traditional desires of demanding "Little Women"
fans and married off Jo March to her dreary Teutonic professor and a
life of maternal servitude, Benson refused to even entertain such a
notion.</TE>
<TE>   Her Nancy flew her own airplane, was up and about moments after
being bashed on the head or almost suffocated. She coolly faced down
jewel thieves and kidnappers, ducked out of dances in pursuit of
clues, never left her friends in danger and almost always picked up
the check. As for the dated details of the early books--the gloves,
the pumps, the constant mention of the heroine's blazing blue
eyes--well, what's accurate in one era is enjoyably campy in another,
even when you're 12.</TE>
<TE>   Although it wasn't until 1980 that Benson revealed herself as the
author of the first 23 books, somehow my friends and I knew that,
although Carolyn Keene was a pseudonym, this wasn't the work of a guy
in a porkpie hat churning out copy for a buck a page. Keene, we knew,
had to be Nancy's aunt, or Nancy's pal, or Nancy all grown up.</TE>
<TE>   We also knew something changed after her first couple dozen books.
Numbers 24, 25 and 26 ("The Clue in the Old Album," "Ghost of
Blackwood Hall" and "The Clue of the Leaning Chimney") were pretty
good, but then Nancy lost some of her oomph, became too ladylike,
more apt to help trusty housekeeper Hannah Gruen with the dishes than
slam out the back door with the carefree thoughtlessness of
privileged youth. And, indeed, there was a concerted effort in the
1950s to tone Nancy down, to keep her, with the rest of American
women, closer to home. An effort Benson had nothing to do with.</TE>
<TE>   Like Arthur Conan Doyle with Sherlock Holmes, Benson grew sick of
her famous creation. She wrote many other books, including several
series of other girl detectives that she liked better than Nancy, but
to the reading public, Nancy Drew she was, and Nancy Drew she
remains.</TE>
<TE>   When fans learned of Benson, of her days as a pilot and
adventurer, of her career as a journalist when that was still a
breakthrough job for women, even of the fact that she died just hours
after being in the newsroom working on a column, it validated all the
hours so many of us had spent with our heads bent over those pages.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of us, millions of us, trying to learn Morse code and
the stickman alphabet, reaching for our flashlights in the half-hope
that the rattle we heard outside our window wasn't just a branch in
the wind, that something exciting was about to happen to us. We
weren't just dreaming all those hours away. Nancy Drew had been real
after all.</TE>

<LD>It's called the Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent, but when the
Council of Fashion Designers of America convenes Monday evening at
the New York Public Library to hand out that award and others in its
annual ceremony, the debate will begin again over the meaning of
"emerging."</LD>
<LD>   One of the nominees, Rick Owens, 40, has been creating a hotly
sought collection of sensual women's clothes for 10 years. Yet the
lean and muscular designer, who keeps an atelier in Hollywood, has
become something of a new discovery in New York. Since September,
when he was included in a Vogue photo essay on independent designers,
Owens' name has been on the glossy lips of important image makers.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just photographer Annie Leibovitz's decision to capture
him shirtless that's made the fashion mavens atwitter. It's his
sensual, hand-worked clothes that seem to disappear out of high-end
boutiques like Maxfield.</LD>
<TE>   Owens was subsequently one of two designers handpicked this spring
to have New York shows underwritten by the Web site style.com. Now
this low-key "newcomer" isn't so undiscovered. Yet he'll face some
stiff competition from the other nominees, Behnaz Sarafpour, Peter
Som and the latest press darling, Zac Posen.</TE>
<TE>   The awards will be televised nationally 5 p.m. (PDT) June 8 on WE:
Women's Entertainment network.</TE>
<TE>   To see the embodiment of the Owens look, check out his muse and
longtime partner, Michele Lamy, at her Hollywood hot spot, Les Deux
Cafes.</TE>

<TE>   Revised Show Dates</TE>
<TE>   The New York and British fashion industries have swapped preview
dates in September so American designers would not have to hold their
shows on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh on Sixth, organizers of New York's Fashion Week, the
Council of Fashion Designers of America and the British Fashion
Council announced the revised dates for the Spring 2003 collections
as Sept. 12-17 in London and Sept. 18-23 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The groups stressed this is a one-time adjustment to the fashion
calendar, which traditionally starts with the New York shows then
moves to London, Milan and Paris, was made to accommodate
commemorative events on the first anniversary of the terrorist attack
at the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "New York looks forward to resuming its position in future seasons
as first on the calendar," said Fern Mallis, executive director of
Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.</TE>
<TE>   New York Fashion Week has been cut from its usual eight days to
six to minimize the impact on the Milan shows, which run Sept.
23-Oct. 1.</TE>

<TE>   Shoppers can buy designer accessories for half price during the
fifth annual "QVC's Cure by the Shore" without leaving their homes
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast, live from Malibu from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., is a
cooperative effort between cable's QVC and the Entertainment Industry
Foundation to raise money for the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society. Soap opera star Don Diamont of CBS' "The Young and the
Restless" serves as host.</TE>
<TE>   The special will feature a wide array of sunglasses, accessories,
jewelry and beauty items from leading designers, brands and
manufacturers, including Burberry, Carrera, Christian Dior, Gucci,
Kate Spade, Valentino, Ck Calvin Klein Eyewear, DKNY Eyes, Fendi and
Nautica Eyewear.</TE>

<TE>   Smoking Study</TE>
<TE>   A national obsession with the body beautiful may be damaging
Brazilian women's health.</TE>
<TE>   In a country renowned for its sexy supermodels and revealing
beachwear, up to 90% of Brazilian women who smoke may be afraid of
giving up the habit in case they put on weight, according to a
medical study released this week.</TE>
<TE>   The study, by the Sao Paulo Heart Hospital, showed many women
choose to smoke to suppress their appetite.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes a person eat too much is anxiety and if she begins to
smoke, the attention is diverted to the cigarette and away from
food," said Silvia Cury Ismael, coordinator of the study carried out
among 100 smokers-- half of them women--during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian women show more resistance to quit smoking than men. The
National Cancer Institute found that the number of male smokers
dropped by 14.7% in Rio de Janeiro between 1989 and 2000, while women
smokers declined only 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "I know smoking is bad, but I don't want to stop because it makes
me lose weight," said Tais Thormann, a 23-year-old model. "When I am
hungry, I go for a cigarette and a little coffee."</TE>

<HD>Take Along Straw, Fabric Bags to Fit Summer's Breezy Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I have particular difficulty in selecting
purses, but I recognize how much the right purse adds to an outfit.
In particular, I'm not sure what kind of purse to use on weekends
when I am in my athletic leisure clothes and am going to the mall or
the grocery store, and perhaps to the to gym. I am petite so I don't
want to carry anything huge, but purses nowadays need to be large
enough for your cell phone and a PDA. I am middle-aged and wondering
what you would suggest for a basic purse wardrobe.</LD>
<LD>   --IT'S IN THE BAG</LD>
<LD>   Dear It's: Lucky for you it's summer, when casual handbags abound.
Since your weekend wardrobe is extremely casual, we suggest your
accessories be the same. Since you're petite, your bag shouldn't
overwhelm you. Yes, we all have oodles of things to carry, but pare
down as much as you can (you'll reduce strain to your back and
shoulders, too). Choose a smaller, more lightweight wallet, and carry
only what you need.</LD>
<TE>   We like straw bags because they lend an informal, summery look and
come in a range of styles, sizes and prices, from big and bold, with
3-D fruit and flower motifs, to smaller and more conservative. Check
out Coach's small straw market tote with leather accents ($188;
www.coach.com, or call [800] 223-8647.)</TE>
<TE>   Gcbag.com has a square straw handbag with skinny leather handles
($23.99; www.gcbag.com, or call [800] 382-1731), and Coldwater Creek
has a finely woven, cloth-lined bag in bright summer hues ($39;
www.coldwatercreek.com, or call [800] 510-2808.)</TE>
<TE>   Cloth is another option; Old Navy has a cute tote in cotton canvas
($12.50; www.oldnavy.com, or call [800] OLD NAVY.) Coldwater Creek
offers a lined linen tote ($49), and Coach's Hampton Twill Market
Totes come in various sizes, colors and patterns. Coach also has a
Girlie Denim Clip Hobo bag that's perfect for weekends ($198).</TE>
<TE>   Straw and fabric bags demand a little more care than leather,
which tends to be more rugged. Don't toss these handbags around with
abandon--straw may unravel if subjected to a lot of stress. Treat
fabric stains per the manufacturer's instructions.</TE>
<TE>   If you do opt for leather, choose a light shade and casual style.
Coach has a small Duffle Sac ($228), and Spiegel offers a leather bag
with Lucite handles ($79; www.spiegel.com, or call [800] 527-1577.)</TE>
<TE>   How many bags you have depends on you. If you like to vary your
looks, get a couple--maybe one fabric, one straw, and one in a
neutral and one in a color or pattern. If you're hard on your bags,
you may need more than one to see you through the season.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: Here is the dumbest question you have ever
gotten: I love scarves, especially silk scarves. But I don't know
what to do about the tags on them. If I don't leave them on, I won't
know for sure which scarves are washable and which are not. Sometimes
I don't remember the designers, which is good to know if I want to
buy another of their scarves. Is it an absolute fashion crime to
leave the tags on? They often show and sometimes are hard to tie if,
for instance, the tag is in the middle of one side on a square scarf.</TE>
<TE>   --IN KNOTS</TE>
<TE>   Dear In: Don't worry, this isn't anywhere near the dumbest
question we've ever gotten. But it is similar to a question from a
reader in a previous column about how to take the tags off of scarves
(Remove them with a stitch ripper; if the hem becomes undone, sew a
few hem stitches with matching thread. Take it to a pro or a friend
who knows how to sew if you don't.)</TE>
<TE>   But it's no sin to leave the tag on, and many women do, primarily
for the reasons you list--and to let everyone know they're wearing a
designer scarf. Of course, some designers have come up with the
brilliant notion of incorporating their names as part of the pattern.</TE>
<TE>   If you're worried about the tag being too conspicuous you can hide
it in a fold or a knot. For ideas on scarf tying, try these two Web
sites: www.fashionmall.com/guide/scarves/doc/ and www.members.
aol.com/modefrance/tying/scarf_ty ing.html.</TE>
<TE>   But having that little tag show shouldn't ruin your day. And if it
does, it's time to re-prioritize.</TE>

<LD>"What news is so terrible that you need to interrupt me while I am
questioning this Earth creature?" the head grasshopper asked.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, sir," the crew member wailed. "We have a report from our
spies on Earth." He waved around a small green tube.</LD>
<LD>   "Stop that and give me the report," the head grasshopper ordered.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," the crew member said nervously. He handed the small
green tube to the head grasshopper.</TE>
<TE>   The head grasshopper broke off the end of the green tube and a
picture expanded in front of him. It was a picture of the window of
the PDQ Schultz toy store where Jim had purchased Ignatz.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, sir," the crew member said, "hundreds of creatures just
like this one. Suppose they are all as brave and tough as he is. We
wouldn't have a chance to conquer Earth."</TE>
<TE>   "Silence!" the head grasshopper shouted. He thought so hard that
the three antennae on his head tied themselves into knots.</TE>
<TE>   "You are correct," the head grasshopper said at last. "Take him
back. If we are lucky, no one will believe him when he talks about
his experiences here. Take him back now."</TE>
<TE>   Dawn was just breaking when the ship that looked like a giant
grasshopper swooped low over the sleeping city and hovered outside
Jim's bedroom window.</TE>
<TE>   Ignatz reappeared in a flash on the windowsill of Jim's room. He
watched as the alien ship bobbed uncertainly, then suddenly rose into
the sky, quickly becoming too small to see.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Jim began to stir. He sat up in bed, and when he saw Ignatz,
he smiled. He ran to Ignatz and hugged him. "We're going to play all
day, I promise," Jim said. "I hope you weren't bored sitting on the
windowsill all night."</TE>
<TE>   Heroically, Ignatz said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gilden's alien teddy bears inspired this story. You can find
it on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new, five-part
story begins on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Foreign Films, Shaking off Dust, Are Appealing to Wider
Audiences</HD>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>

<LD>Eric Rohmer is a cultural guardian of France. The 82-year-old is a
founding member of the 1950s New Wave film movement, an auteur
director and, like his colleagues, a maker of movies the rest of the
world has come to view as quintessentially French: talky, ironic,
small in scale and evidently shot on a two-croissant budget.</LD>
<LD>   So imagine the surprise of filmgoers filing into Rohmer's most
recent effort, "The Lady and the Duke," released earlier this month.
They saw his actors moving against lavishly digitized backdrops,
reveling in special effects that would compare to those of any
Hollywood blockbuster.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, something has changed.</LD>
<TE>   It would be easy but not altogether correct to say foreign
filmmakers are aping Hollywood--that they've shelved their
self-seriousness and are now producing movies designed to be seen, as
opposed to reviewed in alt-weeklies. That last part is true--there
has been a marked turn to commercialism in foreign films.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the arrival of a generation who tackles what was once
left to Hollywood, and they are doing it very well," said Catherine
Verret-Vimont, executive director of the New York office of
Unifrance, the French agency charged with promoting French cinema
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   As the annual film festival in Cannes concluded last weekend, U.S.
distributors spent the previous week snapping up foreign pics. Fox
Searchlight Pictures bought the U.S. distribution rights to France's
"L'Auberge Espagnole" ("The Spanish Apartment"), a hit comedy with
Audrey Tautou, star of France's top earner in the United States last
year, "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers abroad are not so much trying to make "American" films.
Instead they are responding to market forces within their own
countries: Foreign filmgoers have seen enough American films poorly
dubbed into their languages and want to see movies about themselves
in their own tongues.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the blockbuster success in France of this year's "Asterix &amp;
Obelix: Mission Cleopatre," a live-action adventure based on French
comic book characters who are heroes to the Gauls.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Gaulywood enjoyed its best year ever at the box office,
largely on the back of popular, home-grown movies. French films took
in $87 million in France in 2001; ticket sales were up 10% over 2000.
French taxpayers pay twice for their movies: About half the budgets
of all French movies come from government-enforced subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   In tone, the sweet-natured "Amelie" would not be considered a
stereotypical French film by many American filmgoers whose notion of
Gallic films is probably informed by filmmakers such as Jean-Luc
Godard and his 1960 classic, "Breathless," a meandering, amoral tale
about a small-time French thug who kills for no apparent reason and
tries to seduce an aspiring journalist.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just Americans who think that way about French films;
French film directors do as well.</TE>
<TE>   They are "very sad movies with intellectual Parisians, and a
couple fighting in the kitchen--very boring," Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who
directed "Amelie," told the Christian Science Monitor last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The boost in U.S. audience for foreign films comes squarely from
the youth market, industry executives say, which is a marked change
from art-house audiences of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember seeing balding heads and blue hair in theaters before
the lights went out," said Tom Bernard, co-president of foreign-film
distributor Sony Pictures Classics, recalling foreign-film audiences
of his youth.</TE>
<TE>   Technology aside, the key to foreign film success in the United
States is tone. And if any foreign film is guaranteed to resonate
with American audiences, it is the upcoming "Tanguy," from France:
It's about a couple who can't get their 28-year-old son to move out
of the house.</TE>

<HD>Tavis Smiley Hits Double in Comeback</HD>
<DH>Two local stations will feature the show that lends an
African American perspective to NPR.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way Tavis Smiley sees it, one challenge of being an African
American broadcasting pioneer is striking a balance between reaching
a broad audience and remaining, as he calls it, "authentically
black." Another challenge is getting up for work at 2:30 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Monday, Southland listeners will get two chances a day to
hear how he does it, when his 5-month-old, hourlong show debuts on
KPCC-FM (89.3) and KCRW-FM (89.9). National Public Radio is touting
the program as its first signature show with an African American
host, and its first to originate from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "You're going to hear issues discussed on our show you won't hear
discussed anywhere else on NPR--not by default but by design," said
Smiley, a 37-year-old author, commentator and businessman who was
once an aide to former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley and in 1994-95
co-hosted a talk show on L.A. outlet KMPC-AM.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday the show examined diversity--or the lack thereof--in
the nation's newsrooms. Last week Smiley discussed a university study
showing that blacks and whites both discriminate based on the
lightness or darkness of skin color. Another recent show looked at
the proliferation of black/white buddy movies. His assembly of
regular analysts includes Connie Rice, feminist commentator and
cousin of Condoleezza Rice; Princeton professor Cornel West; and
Karen Grigsby Bates, journalist and guest host.</TE>
<TE>   While Smiley plans to bring African American perspectives to the
broader NPR audience, the L.A. native said he just as strongly wants
to expose the country to West Coast viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles gets short shrift when it comes to the contributions
we have to make to the national debate on a variety of issues," he
said. "California politics can either cast a long shadow or a long
sunbeam and show the rest of the country how to deal with an issue."</TE>
<TE>   He'll debut in Los Angeles with a two-part interview with Magic
Johnson, talk to L.A. Mayor James Hahn about secession and also host
Gov. Gray Davis during the week. "The Tavis Smiley Show" will air
weekdays at 5 a.m. on KCRW and at 8 p.m. on KPCC.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley is uncomfortable with the term "crossover" and doesn't want
to belabor the comparison to Arsenio Hall, but he said his show is
somewhat like the comedian's talk show of the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to come up with an example of what our mission was,
and Arsenio was a pretty good example," Smiley said. Every day he did
a show that was authentically black for the hip-hop audience, "but at
the same time, the show was of interest to people not of African
descent. Every night he would book the biggest names, never mind
their color. His show was relevant to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   NPR president and chief executive Kevin Klose said the show, which
began in January and now airs on 23 stations, is key to the network's
efforts to diversify--demographically and geographically.</TE>
<TE>   The program arose out of discussions between National Public Radio
and the network's stations with predominantly African American
audiences, such as those based at traditionally black colleges,
including WEAA-FM at Morgan State University in Baltimore, and
WCLK-FM at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "African American stations had begun to be disappointed in the
amount of programming that was really compatible with their
audiences. There was some excellent jazz programming; there wasn't
enough news and information programming," said Loretta Rucker, a New
York-based radio consultant working as a liaison between the stations
and NPR. In 2000 the network and the stations began designing the
show, and "it was very serendipitous at that time Tavis Smiley became
available."</TE>
<TE>   Black Entertainment Television, the network where Smiley had
hosted a talk show for five years, fired him in 2001 when he aired an
interview with former Symbionese Liberation Army member Sarah Jane
Olson on ABC. BET said it deserved first refusal of the exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   "Eight weeks after I was fired, it turned out in retrospect to be
the best thing that ever happened to me professionally. I sat at my
desk one day looking at about 35 different offers and phone calls,"
including the NPR program, Smiley said. "I didn't know about the
frustrations of the African American stations, but I recognized the
value of the network and the opportunity. NPR is pure credibility."</TE>
<TE>   He's not the first host of color on National Public Radio. Juan
Williams helmed "Talk of the Nation" from 2000-2001, Korva Coleman
co-hosts the classical music program "Performance Today," and Kojo
Nnamdi hosts the Washington, D.C.-based call-in show "Public
Interest." But Smiley's is the first program built around a black
host, Rucker said.</TE>
<TE>   KPCC has been monitoring the program since it began, mulling where
to fit it in the station's lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a strategic decision to wait until they worked some of
the bugs out of their system," said Bill Davis, president of Southern
California Public Radio, which manages KPCC for Pasadena Community
College. KPCC is pulling the evening re-broadcasts of its daytime
"Air Talk" and "Talk of the City" shows for Smiley and the BBC
newsmagazine "The World Today."</TE>
<TE>   While KPCC had been eyeing the show for months, KCRW general
manager Ruth Seymour heard Smiley two weeks ago at the national
Public Radio Conference in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I went, I saw, he conquered," she said. "I wasn't looking for it.
He's fast, he's funny, he's extraordinarily engaging. He's a
powerhouse."</TE>
<TE>   That convinced KPCC to move up its planned July start date, and
now Smiley's show will be one of the few programs that the competing
stations both air.</TE>

<HD>'Circuit': Slick Yet Gritty Look at a Shallow World</HD>
<DH>Dirk Shafer's film is a lively, sexy soap opera and at the
same time a cautionary tale set on the gay circuit party scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dirk Shafer's lively "Circuit" is at once a sexy soap opera, at times
lurid and bathetic, and also a gritty cautionary tale made by a
filmmaker honest enough to have it both ways. In other words, Shafer
can see the circuit party scene with its sex, drugs and celebration
of physical perfection, the epitome of a shallow and self-destructive
aspect of gay culture, but also can acknowledge that it can make
participants feel pretty great about themselves, whether the high
they're on is natural or otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "Circuit" is a solid, more polished follow-up to Shafer's 1996
autobiographical mockumentary "Man of the Year," in which he played
himself as a gay man who poses for a Playgirl centerfold only to find
himself picked as the magazine's man of the year and expected to
represent an ideal heterosexual male for a year.</LD>
<TE>   Jonathan Wade Drahos stars in "Circuit" as a handsome, clean-cut
small-town cop whose chief advises him that as an openly gay man he
ought to move to a community more compatible with his lifestyle. In a
flash Drahos' John heads to West Hollywood, where his gay cousin Tad
(Daniel Kucan), a struggling documentarian, is attempting to make a
film about the gay party circuit and its participants. Naive and none
too reflective, John is swiftly swept up in the very scene his cousin
is documenting. He is dazzled by the availability of so many
spectacular men, and in his state of euphoria he doesn't put up too
much resistance to the drugs constantly being urged upon him.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, he's attracted to circuit party star Hector (Andre
Khabazzi), who's darkly dashing with Rudolph Valentino sideburns. The
attraction is mutual, but there's a hitch: Hector is a top-dollar
hustler, and it's a matter of pride that nobody has him for free.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hector sets to work on John to meet a fantasy ideal through
workouts and steroids, and he picks out a snappier wardrobe for him.
But most of all, he turns John into a drug-abusing party boy, even
for those events that John has ostensibly been hired as security.</TE>
<TE>   The overarching question naturally becomes whether John will come
to his senses and break his free fall into self-destruction, but his
story also frames some sharply drawn character sketches and vignettes
created by Shafer and his co-writer, Gregory Hinton. Khabazzi offers
an intense, tightly focused portrait of a narcissistic man smart
enough to feel a gnawing sense of hollowness despite all the numbing
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lekakis' Bobby, an iconic gay porn star and stage performer,
struggles with impotence and the irony that although he's
HIV-positive he may never develop full-blown AIDS and therefore is
thrown by the prospect of having to deal with a future that he never
thought he'd have. John unexpectedly crosses paths with Kiersten
Warren's likable Nina, his vivacious down-to-earth girlfriend from
college days, who has come to L.A. to try to make it as a stand-up
comedian.</TE>
<TE>   Nina's growing dismay over the path John has taken is paralleled
with that of Nancy Allen's Louise, who is becoming increasingly aware
of and disgusted by her husband Gino (William Katt) a promoter of big
circuit party events who also supplies drugs to them. Brian Lane
Green is Gill, Tad's ex-lover who has outgrown the party scene and
found himself. There are cameos from Bruce Vilanch as the emcee of
the stage show in which both Bobby and Nina appear, and from director
Randall Kleiser as Bobby's reassuring doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Shafer does a persuasive and sympathetic job of showing how
overwhelming the temptations can be for a young gay man in a major
city's gay community. At one point John asks Gill how a man can
handle "being gay and having all this freedom." Shafer and his
skilled cinematographer, Joaquin Sedillo, incorporate actual major
circuit parties in the film. It builds to Palm Springs' legendary,
long-running three-day White Party, which annually attracts some
25,000 revelers at the city's convention center. The soundtrack
blends actual circuit favorites with original music composed by
DJ-remixer Tony Moran and Centaur Entertainment's Nick Di Biase.</TE>

<HD>Art, Politics and Dissent in Sweeping 'Pentecost'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Edgar's "Pentecost" was first produced in 1994, before the
events of Sept. 11 had so radically reconfigured the world political
landscape. A certain anachronistic mustiness is evident in the play's
current production at the Evidence Room. However, that and the play's
other shortcomings are dwarfed by the sheer scope of director Bart
DeLorenzo's sweeping, magnificently designed staging, an
accomplishment that expands the potential of 99-seat theater.</LD>
<LD>   Challenging, convoluted and at times blatantly self-indulgent, the
play is set in an abandoned church in an unnamed Eastern European
country shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A 13th-century
fresco--hidden, ironically, behind a wall emblazoned with a
revolutionary Communist painting--has just been discovered. If proved
to predate the works of Giotto, as suspected, the crucifixion scene
could explode accepted notions about European art, not to mention
trigger a lucrative tourist boom.</LD>
<LD>   The first half of the play concerns whether or not the painting is
authentic, and whether it should be stripped from the wall and
removed to the country's national museum. The simple premise spurs a
prolonged and provocative discussion that ranges from the fallacy of
cultural relativism to the increasing disillusionment of Eastern
European society in the post-Soviet order.</LD>
<TE>   Frustratingly, Edgar's intellectual cerebration turns hemorrhagic
when a dozen or so armed and desperate refugees barricade themselves
inside the church, taking hostage the Western art experts inside. A
polyglot mix, the refugees, who range in ethnicity from Sri Lankan to
Kurd to Bosnian, are a remarkably egalitarian group presided over by
a female Palestinian, whose absolute authority the men accept without
a murmur. Granted, the refugees are subtly sliding into dissent by
the play's final cataclysm. That is to Edgar's credit, as is his
prescient grasp of the destabilization soon to follow the Soviet
fall, including the dispiriting surge of nationalism and ethnic
hatred. But Edgar, a dedicated leftist perhaps best known for his
Tony-winning adaptation of "Nicholas Nickleby," reduces his
multiethnic assemblage to polemical exponents, stridently decrying
the big, bad West for the ills of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Edgar knows his way around an epic. In fact, "Pentecost" is
part of a trilogy of plays inspired by Edgar's travels to Eastern
Europe both before and immediately after the Soviet collapse. For
Lorenzo and company to even assay a project of this magnitude is
remarkably gutsy. Only once does Lorenzo's staging falter, in a
painfully leisurely sequence evidently meant to induce a trance-like,
tribal atmosphere, especially excessive considering the play's
three-hour-plus running time.</TE>
<TE>   With only rare blunders, a large and ardent cast manages to hold
our interest throughout. The design components--especially Jason
Adams' set, Lap-Chi Chu's lighting, and John Zalewski's sound--are
world-class by any standards.</TE>
<TE>   As for the play, it holds no easy answers and little hope for a
brighter tomorrow. But whether you agree with Edgar's passionate
denunciation--or indeed, can even make sense of it--there's no doubt
that you will leave the theater continuing the discussion.</TE>

<HD>Further Adventures of Ahmad Jamal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The notion of a jazz artist as a stylist--as a performer with an
immediately identifiable musical personality--hasn't been
particularly present in the art in recent decades. The quest for
technical virtuosity, for retro visits to past eras, has tended to
minimize the emergence of players with unique characteristics.</LD>
<LD>   Many of those younger artists would do well to check out the
approach favored by Ahmad Jamal. On Tuesday night at the Jazz Bakery,
the veteran pianist once again offered a potent reminder of what the
jazz world was like when such musicians as Erroll Garner, George
Shearing, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins, among dozens
of others, were on the scene. Stylists all, their primary goal was to
follow the pathways opened by their individual Muses rather than
replicate the work of others.</LD>
<LD>   Jamal has been offering a unique musical vision since the '50s,
his mastery of pacing and rhythm balanced by thunderous chording and
slyly articulated melodies. It's a formula that allows him complete
freedom to explore his improvisational inventiveness while affording
his listeners a referential framework that allows them to fully
experience his most adventurous flights of fancy.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, accompanied by his regulars--bassist James Cammack,
who has played bass with Jamal for nearly 20 years, and drummer James
Johnson--he applied that formula to a program ranging from the
standard "You Go to My Head" to his own "Kaleidoscope." Each piece
emerged as a complex amalgam of music and theater, of rhapsodic piano
passages suddenly giving way to crisp drum accents and deep,
fundamental bass notes.</TE>
<TE>   The effect, especially with familiar material, was electric. Jamal
continues to be one of the jazz world's greatest interpreters. Like
Gil Evans, he deconstructs a tune before putting it into his own
dramatic reassemblage, filled with intriguing new facets of sound and
rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   The technique was less successful, however, when applied to more
obscure numbers, largely because the music's many theatrical elements
functioned on their own, without a central reference point. But even
here the sense of style was ever present, giving a moderate-sized,
enthusiastic crowd the opportunity to hear one of the jazz world's
true originals.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmad Jamal Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver
City. Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Jay Bennett Revels in a Rich Post-Wilco Vibe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaled by the soundman at Spaceland on Wednesday that he was ready
for the show to start, musician Jay Bennett responded from the stage,
"Roger ... " and then hesitated.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't say the next word around here," he remarked, the next
word normally being "Wilco," and Wilco being the band he left last
year just after it completed "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," one of the most
celebrated albums to come out this year.</LD>
<TE>   But there wasn't the least bit of regret evident in Bennett's show
with partner Edward Burch. The Champaign, Ill.-based pair, in fact,
told the small but hearty group of fans several times that they were
honored to have people come see them at all. When they played music
from their new, independently released album, "The Palace at 4am
(Part I)," it was a largely different experience than on the record,
with just the two of them (mostly on guitars) rather than the
elaborate ornamentation of the studio--an enticing blend and
testimony to Bennett's role in writing and crafting some of Wilco's
exhilaratingly creative sounds. The evening's loose, homey vibe did
nothing to undermine the richness of the duo's melancholy meditations
on loneliness and yearning, set in pastiches of '70s rock and country
influences. And Bennett is hardly denying his past. The show included
an outtake from the "Yankee" sessions and two leftovers from Wilco's
"Mermaid Avenue" teaming with Billy Bragg, featuring Bennett's music
for lyrics by Woody Guthrie.</TE>
<TE>   Ragged, sure, but it was also involving and charming, keyed by the
apparent fact that Bennett is much happier playing with his friend to
a couple dozen people in a small club than playing second banana in
Wilco.</TE>

<HD>With Remakes, Something Is Often Lost in Translation</HD>
<DH>The studios have a long history of retooling
foreign-language films for American audiences. But it's a spotty
record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH HORNBLOW</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans love foreign cars.</LD>
<LD>   American homes are full of foreign-made electronics, kitchen
gadgets, and furniture.</LD>
<LD>   Americans love Chinese food, Japanese sushi, Italian pasta and
pizza, Vietnamese spring rolls, Thai pad Thai.</LD>
<TE>   But when it comes to foreign films, xenophobia prevails. With the
exception of last year's embrace of Ang Lee's martial-arts action
picture "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," most Americans have
demonstrated that they refuse to pay money for films with subtitles,
for films that demand accommodating language barriers and cultural
differences, for films whose stars are not on the cover of this
week's celebrity chronicles.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a predictable trend in Hollywood whereby
terrific--sometimes even classic--foreign films are greedily snapped
up by Tinseltown studios and remade and repackaged for American
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The remakes range from successes including "The Magnificent Seven"
to abysmal failures including "Breathless" and "Sommersby" (the
remake of "The Return of Martin Guerre").</TE>
<TE>   Every remake is freighted with the problem of originality. At
best, a redo such as "Insomnia," will live up to the original by
essentially copying it. In the first film, a taut psychological drama
directed by Norwegian Erik Skjoldbjaerg, the exceptional Stellan
Skarsgard plays a cop who comes unraveled as he investigates the
brutal murder of a young woman in the land of the midnight sun. In
the remake, directed by "Memento's" Christopher Nolan, Al Pacino
plays the cop with Robin Williams cast as the crafty murderer.</TE>
<TE>   But any faithful remake essentially requires that a director
follow in the footsteps laid down by another. (The most egregious
example here is the case of Gus Van Sant, who remade Alfred
Hitchcock's "Psycho" by reshooting it frame-for-frame.) The point of
the process seems nothing more than an academic exercise in
monkey-see, monkey-do. If original thinking is brought to bear, it
requires that the redo specialists apply new ideas and innovations
within the confines of essentially the same story. If there were no
serious flaws in the original film, the question presents itself: Why
bother?</TE>
<TE>   In the legion of mangled crossovers, no single culture has been
more abused than the French. Roger Ebert, movie critic for the
Chicago Sun-Times, once remarked that there seems to be, "a trend in
which Hollywood buys French comedies and experiments on them to see
if they can be made into English with all the humor taken out."</TE>
<TE>   In honor of films defiled in the trans-Atlantic or Pacific
adaptation process, we herewith offer a compendium of favorite
foreign films that argue to be seen in lieu of the remakes. For the
sake of fairness to poachers of foreign products, we also include a
few first-rate remakes.</TE>
<TE>   We chose our favorite low-lights from France and other offended
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "A Bout de Souffle" ("Breathless"): Jean-Luc Godard's 1959 New
Wave classic about a Parisian hood (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his
American girlfriend (Jean Seberg) was remade in 1983 by Jim McBride
and stars Richard Gere. "Quel horreur," as they say in France.</TE>
<TE>   "M": German director Fritz Lang's harrowing and humane 1931
thriller stars Peter Lorre as a child murderer who is as anguished as
he is cunning. The 1951 remake, set in Los Angeles instead of Berlin,
finds David Wayne attempting the impossible feat of following in
Lorre's footsteps. "Abysmal," quoth one film fan.</TE>
<TE>   "Godzilla": Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake was only the latest to
try to outdo or update or cash in on a sequel to the Japanese
original, 1954's "Gojira," which had inserts by Raymond Burr added
for its United States release called "Godzilla: King of the
Monsters."</TE>
<TE>   "La Chevre" ("The Goat"): In Francis Veber's hilarious 1981
comedy, Gerard Depardieu plays a detective who sets off to Mexico to
locate the missing daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Underfoot is
the industrialist's accountant, an amateur sleuth played by Pierre
Richard. The lame American remake, 1991's "Pure Luck," starred Danny
Glover and Martin Short as the bungling duo.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Comperes": Veber teamed again with Depardieu and Richard for
this 1984 comedy in which the desperate mother of a runaway
16-year-old boy leads two of her former lovers (Depardieu and
Richard) into believing that each is the father of her missing child.
The tepid remake, "Father's Day," teamed Robin Williams and Billy
Crystal but drew far fewer laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Fugitifs": Veber surfaced on this side of the Atlantic in
1989 when he chose to copycat himself in the encore production of the
American remake of his successful French comedy. Nick Nolte and
Martin Short tried hard in the resulting "Three Fugitives," but they
are no match for the original with Veber regulars Depardieu and
Richard.</TE>
<TE>   "La Cage aux Folles": Mike Nichols' "The Birdcage," the remake of
Edouard Molinaro's divine 1978 comedy, is a nicely polished piece of
work, but why redo the perfection of the original, which stars Michel
Serrault and Ugo Tognazzi as gay partners who must pose as a straight
couple in order to meet the ultra-conservative prospective in-laws of
Tognazzi's son? Nathan Lane and Robin Williams played the comic roles
in the remake, but "pour quoi?"</TE>
<TE>   "L'Homme Qui Aimait les Femmes" ("The Man Who Loved Women"): Blake
Edwards took Francois Truffaut's 1977 comedy, removed all of the
sophistication, charm, clever pacing, jaunty attitude and that
certain "je ne sais quoi" that feels like love in a Truffaut film and
made his own version. Burt Reynolds actually does a fairly decent job
in the 1983 remake, but everything else is "tres, tres, tres" wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Le Retour de Martin Guerre" ("The Return of Martin Guerre"):
Sometimes even Jodie Foster makes mistakes. Take "Sommersby," Jon
Amiel's pretty but passionless 1993 remake of Daniel Vigne's
extraordinary 1982 French hit. Richard Gere was no match for his
French counterpart in the role, the busy Depardieu. And Foster came
on cool and chilly where Nathalie Baye burned.</TE>
<TE>   "La Femme Nikita": Luc Besson's stylish bad-girl 1990 drama has
the distinction of having been remade in America by John Badham as
"Point of No Return" and in Hong Kong as "Black Cat." No word on the
Asian effort , but the movie remake with Bridget Fonda was a pale
cousin to the original with Anne Parillaud as the street punk who
gets recruited by French intelligence to be an assassin.</TE>
<TE>   "Jakob der Lugner" ("Jakob the Liar"): Frank Beyer's 1974 East
German film, a best foreign film Oscar nominee about a Jew whose
false tales spread hope in a Polish ghetto, was remade as "Jakob the
Liar" with Robin Williams, Alan Arkin and Armin Mueller-Staller.</TE>
<TE>   "Abre los Ojos" ("Open Your Eyes"): Cameron Crowe got in over his
head when he took young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar's stylish
psychological story of a yuppie's comeuppance and turned it into
"Vanilla Sky." Vanilla indeed, despite the presence of Penelope Cruz,
who also appeared in the original.</TE>
<TE>   "Le Grand Blond Avec Une Chasseur Noire" ("The Tall Blond Man With
One Black Shoe"): Not even Dabney Coleman and Tom Hanks could make
much of "The Man With One Red Shoe," Stan Dragoti's 1985 remake of
the story of an innocent man mistakenly believed to be a spy. Pierre
Richard starred in the original 1972 farce.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, the remake specialists get it right. Among the
first-rate ones are:</TE>
<TE>   "A Fistful of Dollars": Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's 1961
samurai picture "Yojimbo" inspired two American films. The first and
best is Sergio Leone's classic 1964 spaghetti western "A Fistful of
Dollars" with Clint Eastwood. The second is Walter Hill's dull remake
"The Last Man Standing."</TE>
<TE>   "The Magnificent Seven": Kurosawa's classic 1954 film "Shichinin
No Samurai" originally was released in the United States under the
title "The Magnificent Seven." (It later bore the title "The Seven
Samurai.") In 1960, it spawned an American remake, "The Magnificent
Seven" that has become a classic in its own right. In both films,
residents of a village hire a group of men (samurais in Kurosawa's
film, gunslingers in John Sturges') for protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Intermezzo": The young Ingrid Bergman stars opposite Gosta Ekman
in Gustaf Molander's 1936 film about the affair that blossoms between
a young pianist and a married violinist. Bergman made her Hollywood
debut in the 1939 remake directed by Gregory Ratoff and starring
Leslie Howard in the role of the violinist.</TE>

<HD>For HBO's Well-Made 'The Wire,' Crime Pays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HBO is an Energizer Bunny whose assembly line of first-rate series
keeps going and going.</LD>
<LD>   Joining "Six Feet Under," "Sex and the City," "Curb Your
Enthusiasm" and "The Sopranos" on this pedestal is "The Wire," a
scorching look at the drug trade in a Baltimore housing project
through the eyes of mid-level dealers and police.</LD>
<LD>   Locating flickers of goodness even in street criminals and flaws
in heroes with badges, this dual perspective strips back layers of
complex human behavior to affirm that few of us are entirely wicked
or entirely virtuous. It's a point FX makes, too, with the crooked,
homicidal cop protagonist and his comrades in its new series "The
Shield." But with a sledgehammer.</LD>
<TE>   "The Wire," on the other hand, has virtues galore. Its first five
episodes rank with TV's elite crime-busting hours at their best, from
NBC's late, great "Homicide: Life on the Street" and durable "Law &amp;
Order" to ABC's ongoing "NYPD Blue."</TE>
<TE>   No cable slouch, either, is Showtime, whose smart, seductively
charming comedy "The Chris Isaak Show" resumes in witty top form
Tuesday night. Showtime is entering the crime sphere impressively,
too, for arriving June 23 is its new weekly series "Street Time," a
superbly executed account of parolees and the cops who keep close
watch on them.</TE>
<TE>   These pay-cable channels, which are supported by subscriptions
instead of advertising, often have detractors in their largest
broadcast competitors. The latter aging titans pout and whine on cue,
for example, when HBO embarrasses them by annually earning Emmys and
other big awards far out of proportion to its relatively slim
audience base.</TE>
<TE>   The sourest of these grapes--despite heading TV's overall Nielsen
ratings--is NBC. This poor baby complains that narrower-casting HBO
has an unfair advantage when drawing critical praise, because its
production budgets usually top those of broadcast TV, its ratings
criteria are less demanding, and looser cable standards invite
raunchier sex, language and gestures.</TE>
<TE>   All true. You know you're watching cable when a police major in
"The Wire" flips off a detective with both hands, and the noisy,
grinding sex in Episode 3 makes "NYPD Blue" look like C-SPAN.</TE>
<TE>   But unfair? You play the cards you're dealt. HBO's most critical
advantage is the same one Michelangelo had over house painters. In
other words, those shaping the course of TV occupy different levels
on the talent-and-vision food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Based on its uneven pilot, for example, NBC's own coming new fall
series about L.A. crime, "Boomtown," will operate several zones
beneath the stratosphere of "Street Time" and "The Wire."</TE>
<TE>   The latter is from David Simon, a former crime reporter and
executive producer of "The Corner," HBO's brilliant, Emmy-lavished
2000 miniseries based on a nonfiction book that he wrote with ex-cop
Edward Burns.</TE>
<TE>   Just as "The Corner" defined a Baltimore neighborhood's seedy,
destructive drug subculture in aching detail, crime and narcotics are
also the architecture of the West Side's Franklin Terrace in "The
Wire." It's where junkies shoot up and float off, where young
gangsters deploy 8-year-olds as lookouts for invading squad cars,
where rap and sirens are the music of a teeming underclass, where
police and traffickers cross paths provocatively.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tossup, at times, which side of the law is less admirable
or more self-serving, as lines between good and evil blur in this
turbulent drug arena. Simon creates almost parallel universes in
which Baltimore police and drug dealers bloody themselves in bitter
turf wars and operate by chains of command, including a police
bureaucracy headed by a deputy commissioner less sensitive to public
need than to public relations.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Simon and directed by "Homicide" regular Clark Johnson,
the premiere has a murder trial going bad when a key prosecution
witness is intimidated by thugs working for a gang leader. This
Franklin Terrace drug lord is then targeted by a hastily assembled
unit of homicide and narcotics cops in an awkward union of police
divisions no more compatible than the FBI and CIA. Although it is an
understaffed and underequipped face-saving gesture designed for
stagnancy, the investigation turns up surprises while uncoiling
wiretaps and surveillances, and teaming a pair of high achievers who
share a desire to throttle the drug trade.</TE>
<TE>   One is narcotics Detective Shakima Greggs (Sonja Sohn), a lesbian
taking college classes with an eye toward a career change. The other
is homicide Det. Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), a divorced father with
an angry ex-wife and a custody problem. Under everyone's skin, it's
McNulty who gets that double bird from his major, initially appearing
to be another of TV's many maverick cops whose greatest ambition is
to irritate their superiors. Happily, he turns out to be much more
interesting than that.</TE>
<TE>   It's a very good cast. Sohn and West are persuasive, as is Lance
Reddick as Lt. Cedric Daniels, the new unit's politics-playing leader
who appears reluctant to take any step that would hinder his
promotion to major. Also notable is Larry Gilliard Jr. as D'Angelo
Barksdale, a young murderer and drug dealer who by the end of Episode
2 appears to be acquiring a conscience. We'll see.</TE>
<TE>   Coming soon, meanwhile, are a pair of cover-ups, one tied to
police brutality. And further down the line, there's talk of a dirty
cop.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wire" has its own blemishes.</TE>
<TE>   A drug dealer's swift capitulation in a coming interrogation is a
big stretch, though not as big as cops exposing a key snitch by
routinely driving him around in daylight, then publicly depositing
him back in the projects.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, though, "The Wire" is more evidence that TV's best
crime shows are in their own golden age. It is also topical, as in an
FBI roundup of drug dealers being greeted apathetically by agency
higher-ups because "not one of them was named Osama."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it sugarcoat reality. "You can't even call it a war," a
cop says in the premiere about battling drug activity. "Wars end."</TE>
<TE>   "The Wire" premieres Sunday night at 10 on HBO. The network has

<HD>Wisconsin's Tale of Two Performance Centers</HD>
<DH>The arts* Appleton's new complex is backed by Clear
Channel's booking clout. So where will this leave Green Bay's?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS JONES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>APPLETON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>From Los Angeles to Miami, theaters are clamoring for the first
national tour of Mel Brooks' "The Producers," the biggest Broadway
hit in years. No Chicago-area theater has yet announced a booking,
but it's already on the 2002-03 slate for the new Broadway season in
Appleton, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   Appleton?</LD>
<LD>   Despite a population of only about 70,000, a downtown struggling
for life and a state government that has refused to help, a coalition
of corporate boosters from this little college town somehow has
managed to finance the kind of massive and opulent new downtown
performing arts center usually found only in large cities.</LD>
<TE>   Appleton, the birthplace appropriated by Harry Houdini (who was
actually born in Europe), the burial ground of Joseph McCarthy and
the hometown of Lawrence University, will make a full frontal assault
on Green Bay's long-established role as the area's cultural
headquarters when the arts center opens this fall. The rivalry is
evolving into a juicy drama here, where the brutal winters make the
population as passionate for the arts as for the Green Bay Packers.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox Cities Performing Arts Center will seat more than 2,000
people and ultimately cost in excess of $45 million--$38 million of
which has already been raised through the collaboration of a paper
products company, a fraternal benefit society and a car dealer, all
eager for a cultural lure to attract and retain employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We're building a Lambeau Field for the arts," says John
Bergstrom, a local automobile dealer and the president of the
center's board of directors. "This community is getting to show what
it's made of."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if Appleton's frisky leadership gets its way, when it
comes to a night out, traffic will soon be flowing out of blue-collar
Green Bay (population 103,400) and heading 28 miles south to
Appleton.</TE>
<TE>   "The night when this theater opens will be a defining moment for
the future of Appleton," says Tim Hanna, the town's cherub-faced
mayor. "People will no longer be able to say, 'Why would I want to
move to Appleton? There's nothing to do there.'"</TE>
<TE>   None of this sits well with Green Bay, which already has a spiffy
performing arts center that's almost the same size as Appleton's.
Built in 1993 at a cost of $19.4 million on the campus of the
University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, the Weidner Center offers the same
mix of Broadway, classical music, pop acts and light entertainment as
the one projected for Appleton.</TE>
<TE>   The Weidner Center has about 10,000 subscribers. And because a
quarter of its customers come from the Appleton area, it is not
pleased to see the new competition.</TE>
<TE>   "The new building is almost identical to ours," says Weidner
Center executive director Tom Gabbard. "This is a small community.
And even though there's been a rivalry between Appleton and Green Bay
for generations ... , this is really all one market."</TE>
<TE>   But fortunately for the Appleton boosters, the Weidner Center is
not affiliated with any of the large corporations that run the
Broadway seasons in most major American cities. It is an independent,
nonprofit presenter. The Appleton center, on the other hand, will be
partnering with Clear Channel Entertainment, one of the biggest
producing and presenting firms.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Clear Channel has had to send its shows to the
Weidner Center to get access to the lucrative Green Bay market. For
its part, the Weidner Center thought it could do better by combining
Clear Channel shows with others and doing the presenting by itself.</TE>
<TE>   But as it has shown in other areas of the country, Clear Channel
much prefers to control both the product and the venue. And once it
has both pieces in place in a given market, it has a history of
freezing out independent arts centers.</TE>
<TE>   By signing a contract with Clear Channel, the new Fox Cities
Performing Arts Center will benefit from Clear Channel's clout to get
Appleton most of the big, profitable shows, including "Mamma Mia" and
"The Producers" and the many pop and rock acts in which Clear Channel
has an interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Weidner Center is clearly in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "We have waited patiently for this new facility to come together
in a great market," says Scott Zeigler, who runs Clear Channel's
North American operations from New York, "and we feel very strongly
that whoever controls the product will do very well there."</TE>
<TE>   "It remains to be seen how all this will shake down in the
marketplace," says Gabbard. "They have their building to run, and we
have ours."</TE>
<TE>   Gabbard also said he will try to persuade Green Bay residents that
the money they spend at the Weidner represents local support.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in this community and put all our profits back into the
community," Gabbard says. "Clear Channel takes them out of town."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the entertainment business operates on a national scale.
Zeigler said he has already been working hard to convince other
producers that the Appleton theater is their best option for the
Green Bay market. And when a bidding war erupted between the Weidner
and Appleton theaters for the lucrative tour of "Mamma Mia," Clear
Channel won the deal by offering incentives in one of its other
markets on the West Coast. The Weidner Center cannot compete with
that.</TE>
<TE>   The deal with Clear Channel was not the only strikingly savvy part
of the Appleton development. While most of the cultural facility
development in downtown Chicago has required taxpayer subsidy,
Appleton's corporate leaders have done it largely themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Philanthropy aside, Aid Assn. for Lutherans and Kimberly-Clark,
both big organizations with a major presence in Appleton, had a
specific reason for coming up with the money to get this new building
off the ground: the need to recruit and retain choosy employees
looking for nighttime activities during the long winter.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very good business decision," says Alyce Dumke,
director of community relations at the Aid Assn. for Lutherans, a
fraternal benefit society that plunked down a startling $8 million to
get this project rolling (and that temporarily loaned Dumke herself
to the fund-raising effort). "The more vibrant a community becomes,
the more you can hire and retain quality talent."</TE>
<TE>   "We have outstanding schools and hospitals," says Kathi P.
Siefert, an executive vice president at Kimberly-Clark in Appleton,
where the corporation has 6,000 employees. "But our people have told
us that we also needed something like this." Kimberly-Clark came up
with more than $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The local movers and shakers took this core funding and persuaded
others to join the list of givers. The group also successfully talked
local hoteliers into supporting a room tax aimed at raising between
$5 million and $8 million from out-of-towners. The city of Appleton
agreed to pay for the infrastructure on the site--a commitment worth
close to $4.2million. Still, the perception locally is that the
center is a private corporate gift to the community that will revive
Appleton's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "This used to be such a thriving downtown," says Sharon Hibbard,
who has tended bar for almost 25 years at Cleo's, a tavern just down
the street from the construction site. "Everyone is jumping on the
arts center bandwagon now. They've even opened a martini bar across
the street from there. For Appleton, that's different."</TE>
<TE>   "People told me I should get out front with this center," said
Mayor Hanna. "But I said I wasn't going to let this be perceived as a
government project. If it had been perceived as a government project,
it would have failed."</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to be able to tell people that they were not going to
see this center on their taxes," Sie- fert said. "We want this
project to support residents of this community, not hurt them."</TE>
<TE>   For Appleton's semiprofessional Fox Valley Symphony, the new
center is musical manna. And the new presence will allow the local
orchestra to spend less time looking enviously northward at the
larger Green Bay Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "This will allow us to expand our artistic goals," says Brian
Groner, the orchestra's part-time music director and a man still
getting used to the idea of having such opulent surroundings. "Right
now we're making sure we can fill up that huge stage in terms of
bodies and instruments."</TE>
<TE>   So will Appleton's center have the support to survive?</TE>
<TE>   There's still $7 million to be found in capital costs--and the
problems won't end there. Even in far larger markets, most comparable
arts centers do not bring in enough money at the box office to pay
their overheads.</TE>
<TE>   Bergstrom says he's not worried about the rest of the
fund-raising. The residents of Appleton, he says, are rising to the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "A fellow gave us $500,000 just last week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the proud corporate parents of the center all say
they fully expect the venue to need an operating subsidy each year,
and that they will raise the funds.</TE>
<TE>   They also point to the combined population, more than 350,000, of
the cities in the local media service area--including Oshkosh,
Menasha, Neenah and Appleton. Moreover, they say similar new projects
elsewhere have generated an increase in the pool of buyers for arts
and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Already, nearly 7,000 subscriptions have been sold to Broadway in
the Fox Cities.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Metzger, Appleton's newly hired executive director, says he
hopes his operation and the Weidner can "stay out of each other's way
as so as not to drive up the costs of entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Appleton clearly will need to pull a fair percentage of its
audiences from Green Bay to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the artistic face of this part of Wisconsin won't ever
be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "To a large extent, Clear Channel came and this center got built
because of our success," says the Weidner Center's Gabbard. "I
suppose we only have ourselves to blame."</TE>

<HD>Glass Only  3/4 Full for 'Morning's at Seven'</HD>
<DH>The revival has received three featured-actress Tony
nominations--but it has four featured actresses. The honorees propose
an ensemble category.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When this year's Tony nominations were announced, there was the usual
joy tempered with sorrow. Over at "Morning's at Seven," the feelings
were even more intense.</LD>
<LD>   The good news was that the revival snagged nine nominations,
including three in the featured actress category. The bad news was
that the play has four featured actresses.</LD>
<LD>   You do the math.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole thing is a bit crazy," says Frances Sternhagen, one of
the lucky three. "In a way, having any kind of artistic endeavor be
judged the way athletic competition is judged is kind of crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Sternhagen, 72, and cast mates Elizabeth Franz, 60, and Estelle
Parsons, 74, were nominated for best featured actress--a group that
now has a collective 13 Tony nominations, three wins, an Emmy and an
Academy Award.</TE>
<TE>   Sternhagen got the news from a friend on the Tony nominating
committee. A well-connected gym teacher told Parsons before her
morning workout. And Franz came home to discover her answering
machine blinking madly.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, though, all three were more worried about the
exclusion of the fourth actress in their production--Piper Laurie,
70, whom they consider as essential as a fourth leg holding up a
table.</TE>
<TE>   "We all came to the theater that night and went right to Piper
Laurie and said, 'You should have been nominated,'" says Sternhagen.
"She said, 'I'm just not going there. It's OK.'"</TE>
<TE>   Besides Sternhagen, Franz and Parsons, the featured actress
category is rounded out by Kate Burton of "The Elephant Man" and
Katie Finneran from "Noises Off." The awards will be handed out
Sunday in ceremonies on PBS and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have the same attitude, which is, 'What? We're all
nominated? This is too strange.' I don't think there's any feeling of
competition," says Sternhagen, who won Tonys for "The Heiress" and
"The Good Doctor."</TE>
<TE>   "Morning's at Seven" also earned nominations for best revival,
costume design, scenic design, direction and featured actor--Stephen
Tobolowsky and William Biff McGuire.</TE>
<TE>   "With such seasoned actors, you'd think you'd get into ego
problems. There hasn't been a moment of that," says Franz, whose
credits include "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and a Tony for "Death of a
Salesman."</TE>
<TE>   Parsons endorses that wholeheartedly. "We've had no rancor. We've
had a really heavenly time right from the very beginning," says the
Oscar-winning actress from "Bonnie and Clyde," who has earned four
Tony nominations during her career.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of collegiality is unlike the play itself, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Paul Osborn, "Morning's at Seven" explores the
long-standing sibling rivalries of four aging sisters who live cheek
by jowl in a Midwestern town in 1939. Their relationships grow
strained when a nearby house becomes available and they begin to
jostle over how to live out their remaining years. A long-buried
family secret complicates matters even further.</TE>
<TE>   Offstage, the actresses refuse to allow a mere Tony nomination to
create such tension. Anyway, Laurie is hardly without her own honors,
having earned three Oscar nominations, a Golden Globe for "Twin
Peaks" and an Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   "Piper is such an incredibly gracious lady that it couldn't
possibly ever be awkward," says Parsons. Franz agrees: "In fact,
we're laughing at it a lot," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Sternhagen, Franz and Parsons have even come up with a solution to
end such a theatrical dilemma, and in separate interviews the three
actresses propose it as if reciting from the same script: ensemble
awards.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping we'd get an ensemble award because we knew this
kind of thing was bound to happen," says Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in it should have been nominated in some way, and the
best way would have been to have an ensemble category," says
Sternhagen.</TE>
<TE>   Such a category hasn't been created yet at the Tonys, despite some
lobbying by the actresses even before the nominations were announced
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "They say it doesn't make money. They can't sell it," says Franz.
"And I said, 'How would you know? Why don't you try it? Then you can
take it off the next year if it doesn't sell.'</TE>
<TE>   "You don't act by yourself. You can sing by yourself, you can
dance by yourself, play the piano by yourself. But you cannot act by
yourself. And if you are, it's not working."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the appeals, the nominating committee didn't go for it.
The actresses now face the prospect of negating one another in the
featured category and splitting the vote.</TE>
<TE>   That's OK, they say, and predict that Burton will win.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very surprised if any of us won, but I would be very
happy if one of the others won," Parsons says, then pauses. "I think
I would be--you'll have to ask me Tony night."</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose, she adds, just being nominated is an honor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just so grateful for the experience, for all of us to be at
our ages and be all together and actually have a play to do," she
says.</TE>

<HD>Talented Cast Can't Put the Spark in 'Bartleby'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jonathan Parker's "Bartleby" is an ambitious attempt to update the
1853 Herman Melville novella "Bartleby the Scrivener." It's not a bad
idea, and it has the right cast and the right look. But, sad to say,
it lacks the pace and energy to make it come alive and therefore
remains more of a literary conceit than a movie.</LD>
<LD>   David Paymer, who also narrates, plays the Boss, heading up a
public records firm that has just landed the contract to maintain the
records of a small city. Glenne Headly's Vivian, a seductress who
speaks with great precision in a breathy, Marilyn Monroe manner,
manages the office, whose staff also includes Joe Piscopo's
ladykiller Rocky and Maury Chaykin's klutzy Ernie. With the new city
contract, the workload becomes sufficiently heavy to require
additional help. Enter Crispin Glover's Bartleby, a strange,
reticent, formally dressed young man who accepts a clerk's job and
swiftly proves his worth in his zealous approach to filing.</LD>
<LD>   The Boss is therefore understandably taken aback whenever Bartleby
is asked to perform any other kind of task in an office suffused with
dull routine and replies with a polite but firm "I would prefer not
to" without further explanation. The Boss tries to order Bartleby
around but to no avail. Essentially a kindly man, he decides to cut
Bartleby some slack, but the situation only worsens.</LD>
<TE>   What Parker means to make of the Boss' predicament is a portrait
of a decent but complacent man whose life is jolted out of its
comfortable, orderly existence by his concern for his obstinate
employee. Always an actor with plenty of resources to draw upon,
Paymer is in danger of being undone by his steadfast kindliness. The
sharp-featured, angular Glover is a master at expressing
disconcerting weirdness in an amusing manner. Headly is deliciously
insinuating. In addition to the ever-reliable Chaykin and Piscopo,
there are sharp portrayals from Seymour Cassel, Carrie Snodgress and
Dick Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the best efforts of this distinctive cast and others
involved with this off-beat production, filmed in San Rafael, this
"Bartleby" remains stubbornly lifeless.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: PG-13, for some sexual content. Times guidelines.
Suitable for older children.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty years ago, Harold Lloyd had cut a scene from his 1925 classic
"The Freshman" in which his character, a college freshman dying to be
popular, breaks down and cries in his girlfriend's arms.</LD>
<LD>   "My grandfather didn't like that scene," says Suzanne Lloyd Hayes,
director of the Harold Lloyd Trust and co-author of the new book
"Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian." "He didn't want audiences to see him
vulnerable and crying."</LD>
<LD>   But when audiences see the newly restored print of the film that
premieres Saturday at the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's 13th-Annual
Silent Film Gala, that short scene (less than two minutes) will be
back in the picture.</LD>
<TE>   Lloyd Hayes says she "tussled inside for a long time" about
putting the scene back in the film. "Since he took it out, there must
have been some means to his madness. He knew basically what he wanted
to do with his films." But she eventually decided it was time to
reinstate the touching sequence after heeding the advice of film
historian Kevin Brownlow and Carl Davis, who has composed a new score
for "The Freshman."</TE>
<TE>   "You look at it now and it makes sense there in the film," she
says. "It gives him more of a vulnerability. It gives you more of a
form of closeness or a bond to that person he is playing. So I put it
back in. I hope lightning doesn't come and get me."</TE>
<TE>   "The Freshman" is the third Lloyd classic to be screened at the
Silent Film Gala, which takes place at UCLA's Royce Hall. Previously
"The Kid Brother" and "Safety Last"--featuring the famous scene of
him dangling from the hands of a clock high above downtown L.A.--were
shown. Davis will be conducting LACO in his new score for "The
Freshman," as well as for the 1920 Lloyd short comedy, "An Eastern
Westerner," which will open the event.</TE>
<TE>   Dustin Hoffman will make his second appearance as honorary
chairman of the gala. Two years ago, he presided over Charlie
Chaplin's "Modern Times."</TE>
<TE>   "I have never ceased being in awe of the fact that the art form of
movies is in its infancy and that I was lucky enough to be a part of
it at the beginning," says the two-time Oscar-winning actor. Silent
films, he adds, were "literally the Stone Age part of it, and it is
like you were an archeologist and go into a cave and see
hieroglyphics on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   People who spend their lives doing movies, Hoffman relates, "know
more than anyone else that what we consider silent movies are really
the purest form of film. The more you make movies, the more you
realize that it is the visual impact that really conveys the most
information between people."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Hayes says "The Freshman" was one of her grandfather's
favorite comedies. Lloyd, Chaplin and Buster Keaton were the top
comedic stars of the silent era. With his straw hat and black-rimmed
spectacles, Lloyd excelled in playing eager, sometimes naive young
men. He was as athletic as Chaplin and Keaton and his films were
filled with daring stunts.</TE>
<TE>   "'The Freshman' is the ultimate college movie," says Lloyd Hayes.
It also gave her grandfather--who was born in 1893 and died in
1971--a chance to finally go to college. (Some of the football
sequences were shot during games at the Rose Bowl and at Berkeley.)
Lloyd never finished high school but "he always wanted to go to
college," says Lloyd Hayes. "He loved the element of learning. He was
brilliant at math."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Freshman," Lloyd plays a fish out of water who desires to
be the big man on campus. "He wants to be on the football team and he
wants to be in the fraternity," she says. "But he gets there and his
clothes are about 10 years out of style. Everybody is laughing at
him. They put him on the team as the water boy and, poor guy, they
use him as a tackling dummy and they make him do all the horrible,
schleppy work." In typical Lloyd fashion, though, he ends up becoming
a football hero.</TE>
<TE>   Reviews were glowing. The New York Times reported that "judging
from what happened in the packed theater in the afternoon, when old
folks down to youngsters volleyed their hearty approval of the
bespectacled comedian, the only possible hindrance to the physical
well-being of the throngs was an attack of aching sides."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has been scoring silent films since 1980, says "The
Freshman" is very close to his heart. "It has qualities that make
Harold very moving," he says. "Harold is a toughie. He is a tough
character who doesn't show his emotions very much. But in this one he
did, and what I am trying to do in the score is to kind of get at his
feelings. My melodies are really to keep moving the story. "</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Hayes says it's always a thrill to see her grandfather's
movies screened for audiences with a live orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a total experience of sight, film and music combined," she
says. "It's not a Broadway show but it's not a film show. It is
somewhere in the middle."</TE>
<TE>   The gala is just one of the Lloyd films screening this summer. On
July 3, the Los Angeles Conservancy's Last Remaining Seats festival
will screen "Girl Shy." And on Aug. 22, the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art will celebrate his work with a three-week festival of his
features and shorts.</TE>

<LD>   Hearn to Be Honored at Local Emmy Awards</LD>
<LD>   KTTV Channel 11 led all other outlets with 18 nominations for the
54th-annual L.A.-Area Emmy Awards, announced Thursday by the Academy
of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. KNBC Channel 4 and Fox Sports Net each
collected 12 nominations, and KCAL Channel 9 picked up 11.</LD>
<TE>   The winners will be announced in ceremonies June 29 that will
include Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn and KCOP Channel 13
producer Pete Noyes receiving the academy's Governors Award, honoring
career achievement in local television.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 105 nominations, unveiled Thursday in
categories such as news specials, education, crime/social issues and
culture/history, all of the local daily newscasts--morning, afternoon
and evening--will compete against one another in categories
determined by their length.</TE>
<TE>   Networks Focus on World Trade Center</TE>
<TE>   Television networks paused with victims' families and salvage
workers Thursday to mark the end of the cleanup of the near-empty lot
where the World Trade Center towers stood until Sept. 11. ABC, CBS,
NBC and the cable news networks all interrupted regular programming
to cover the short, mostly silent ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, Ground Zero feels like a church," noted CBS reporter Byron
Pitts.</TE>
<TE>   As cameras followed a truck removing the trade center's final
supporting beam, NBC's Tom Brokaw noted that "it was an attack not
just on the World Trade Center but on the fabric and the family of
America."</TE>
<TE>   TV networks already are planning coverage for the first
anniversary of the attacks, with ABC having announced that it will be
on the air with a daylong special report.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Academy Creates New Grammys in Rap, R&amp;B</TE>
<TE>   Four new Grammy Award categories have been added by the National
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, which also has created a
separate field for dance music.</TE>
<TE>   The new categories are in rap and R&amp;B, starting with the academy's
decision to split the rap solo vocal performance award into male and
female divisions. And in R&amp;B, contemporary R&amp;B album and
urban/alternative performances will have awards of their own. The
changes bring the number of Grammy categories to 104.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy for best dance recording has been moved out of the pop
field into a newly created dance-music field. Because members may
vote in a limited number of fields, the move will tend to discourage
voting by members without expertise in that area, academy officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the academy's annual grant program will increase its
funding this year from $400,000 to $700,000, channeling the money
primarily toward musical preservation and research projects.</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Broadway Attendance Down--but Not Much</TE>
<TE>   The League of American Theatres and Producers painted a good
news/bad news picture of Broadway box office for the 2001-02 season
in a news conference this week. Though attendance dropped after the
Sept. 11 attacks, as expected, the fall wasn't as precipitous as some
had feared.</TE>
<TE>   The box-office gross between the first week of June 2001 and the
week ending May 26, 2002, was $643.4 million--3.4% lower than the
previous, record-setting year. Tickets sold: 10.95 million--a 7.9%
dip from the numbers chalked up last season, also a record.</TE>
<TE>   Theater League Heading for Pasadena Civic</TE>
<TE>   Theater League, which once presented musicals at Pasadena Civic
Auditorium, is returning to the venue next season. The move fills a
gap created by the January collapse of a series sponsored by the
facility's now-defunct foundation and adds another Southland link to
the Theater League series in Thousand Oaks and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled for next season: "Beauty and the Beast" (Sept. 10-15),
the dance revue "Burn the Floor" (Nov. 29-Dec. 1) and "Miss Saigon"
(April 4-6).</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Diana Ross has voluntarily checked into Promises, a Malibu rehab
center, to deal with "personal issues" prior to her summer tour,
according to her publicist.... Eva Georgia, a veteran radio
journalist in her native South Africa, was named Thursday to be
general manager at public radio station KPFK-FM (90.7).... The
unscripted series "Big Brother" will start a new round on July 10,
continuing to air three nights a week on CBS....Anthony Hopkins,
Katie Couric, Julia Roberts,  Billy Crystal and President Bush are
among those participating in a 16-part public TV series, "Freedom: A
History of Us." Based on textbooks by historian Joy Hakim, it's due
to air in January....Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers will start a U.S.
tour in June with original bassist Ron Blair taking over for longtime
member Howie Epstein. Epstein has left the band "because of his
ongoing personal problems," according to a group spokesman.</TE>

<HD>In These Ghostly Homes, Scenes of Anxiety</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The houses in Kevin Appel's six new paintings at Angles Gallery are
the domestic equivalent of ghost ships: phantom apparitions whose
mysterious beauty is shot through with enough menace to make your
spine tingle. Combining equal measures of dreamy intangibility and
raw anxiety, these wall-size pictures bring the perceptual refinement
of classic Light and Space works into contact with the queasy realism
of art inspired by film noir.</LD>
<LD>   It's a volatile combination. At once seductive and chilling,
atmospheric and claustrophobic, Appel's haunting paintings lure
viewers into a world where every dream is caught in a nightmarish
undertow.</LD>
<LD>   All of his images depict solitary buildings, either a modest cabin
made of plywood or a more elaborate dwelling made of concrete and
beams. All are set in the woods. And all are empty.</LD>
<TE>   Some resemble stylish summer homes. Others have more in common
with the Unabomber's cabin. Devoid of furniture, all appear to have
been abandoned while still under construction, just after their
frameworks were built, but before any plumbing, electricity or other
finishing touches were added.</TE>
<TE>   They embody an extreme and peculiar type of stillness. Unlike the
quietness that's conducive to relaxation, the silence that thunders
through Appel's paintings recalls those moments when things are too
quiet, when you know in your bones (and at the base of your brain)
that something bad is about to happen. Time seems to stand still.</TE>
<TE>   Appel intensifies this anxiety by limiting his palette to white.
Traditionally, white signifies purity. But it's also a sign of
surrender--of yielding to a superior force or suspending a battle to
face one's enemies peaceably, if momentarily.</TE>
<TE>   At first the paintings appear to be too antiseptic to be
emotionally engaging. But after a while, their subtle color
distinctions get more vivid. Although it's easy to lose count, it
seems that they include about 40 different shades, from feathery
grays to warm creamy tones. A rich range of variations recalls views
through green-tinted sunglasses or icy blue plate-glass windows. One
of the best things about Appel's art is that it treats white as a
color, a physical entity too complex and sensuous to be exhausted by
the words we have for it.</TE>
<TE>   Another is his masterful command of surface texture. Slathering on
paint with spatulas and sculpting individual wood grain with a knife,
Appel pays homage to plasterers and carpenters, working people whose
knowledge (and love) of a job well done is an end in itself.</TE>

<TE>   Finding Power in</TE>
<TE>   Random Destruction</TE>
<TE>   In eight large paintings and 23 small drawings at L.A. Louver
Gallery, Guillermo Kuitca uses found imagery to meditate on various
forms of loss. Ranging from the inconvenience of lost luggage to the
sadness of lost innocence, and from the regrets of a lost weekend to
the tragedy of lost loved ones, his diagrammatic pictures cover an
impressive variety of subjects.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the Buenos Aires artist's second solo show in Los
Angeles is an encyclopedia of melancholy. The core of his exhibition
consists of four black-and-white acrylics on canvas that depict
enlarged versions of palace floor plans and ceiling patterns
illustrated in Denis Diderot and Jean d'Alembert's 28-volume
"Encyclopedie." The two 18th century Frenchmen attempted to summarize
all knowledge in their magnum opus, which was out of date by the time
it was published.</TE>
<TE>   Kuitca has faithfully reproduced illustrations from their
ill-fated effort, which includes such architectural details as
decorative marble floors, grand staircases and theatrically framed
spaces for paintings. Before these images have dried, he has poured
water over them, dissolving their crisp lines into blurry messes. The
breakdown of the orderly precision and rational clarity is a metaphor
for the transience of cultural achievements--and ordinary
forgetfulness.</TE>
<TE>   In his drawings, he treats diagrams of modern buildings similarly.
Visiting various Web sites, Kuitca has printed out the seating charts
of Staples Center, Dodger Stadium, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and
the Hollywood Bowl. He has also splashed a turpentine-like solution
on the color-coded charts, dissolving solid blocks of color and sharp
lines into hallucinatory blurs and scattered fragments.</TE>
<TE>   A few of these images are pretty. Their flowing forms suggest
music drifting through a venue. Most, however, are beautiful--and
violent. They evoke explosions--sudden, earsplitting eruptions that
destroy entire sections while leaving others untouched. People in the
cheap seats are no safer than those up front.</TE>
<TE>   The randomness of the destruction is what gives Kuitca's works
their power. His pictures of places where crowds gather invite
contemplation about the relationship between individuals and groups,
happenstance and fate, anonymity and fame, responsibility and
blamelessness.</TE>
<TE>   But another type of randomness diminishes the impact of Kuitca's
best works. The range of subjects he depicts suggests that his art is
less driven by content than by loose formal relationships and glib
technical facility. His pictures of baggage-claim conveyor belts,
empty stages and an Alka-Seltzer tablet dissolving in a glass of
water have the presence of exercises--arbitrary dabblings that lack
the concentrated focus of his more poignant pieces.</TE>

<TE>   A Visual Equivalent</TE>
<TE>   to Comfort Food</TE>
<TE>   If James Gobel were a chef, his specialty would be comfort
food--heaping helpings of hearty dishes that taste great, stick to
your ribs and warm the cockles of your heart. But he's an artist, so
he serves up the visual version of these physical experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Generous, accessible and unpretentious, his unconventional
paintings and no-nonsense drawings at Hayworth Gallery turn life's
simple pleasures into lasting satisfactions. Gobel pieces together
his pictures by gluing carefully cut sections of felt to variously
sized panels. Outlining these bold shapes with strands of yarn, he
adds more details by stitching color-coordinated threads into the
fabric.</TE>
<TE>   He never pastes one piece of felt atop another but makes a place
for each, adjusting its contours so it snugly abuts its neighbors.
All inhabit a single picture plane.</TE>
<TE>   Depicting stylish yet budget-conscious interiors, each of his
images includes at least one section of felt that has been painted.
In "Paul on Beanbag," for example, the hefty sitter reclines on a
bright red beanbag in front of floor-to-ceiling windows that open
onto an expansive view of the sky. Gobel has used an airbrush to
spray cottony clouds on the baby-blue felt. These illusionistic
additions provide a lovely contrast to the sharply silhouetted leaves
of a potted plant and to the weighty solidity of the nude man.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the simplicity of Gobel's materials, he gets them to
convey nuance. Although Paul's posture mimics that of a decadent
hedonist, he appears to be self-conscious and a bit awkward. His
fleshy body recalls that of Buddha, but his wholesome face expresses
none of the inner serenity for which the Eastern god is known.</TE>
<TE>   Charm rather than grandeur characterizes the world Gobel
represents in his modestly luxurious images. It's where regular guys
live.</TE>
<TE>   In other pieces, he paints abstractly, sometimes dripping acrylic
paint in the manner of Jackson Pollock, brushing it on gesturally, a
la Franz Kline, or adding marbleized details like a set decorator.
Abstraction and figuration freely intermingle in all of Gobel's
painted collages, which also treat fine art and Saturday-afternoon
crafts as if they belonged to one big happy family. As warm and fuzzy
as they are formally refined, his works demonstrate that every once
in a while, you can eat your cake and have it too.</TE>
<TE>   Hayworth Gallery, 148. N. Hayworth Ave., (323) 933-5565, through
June 14. Closed Sunday-Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Hoeber's World:</TE>
<TE>   the Horror, the Humor</TE>
<TE>   A baseball bat, a manikin's lifelike head and a mechanism that
spurts fake blood are some of the props in Julian Hoeber's solo debut
at Blum &amp; Poe Gallery. Also included are several series of color
photos shot on the set of "Killing Friends," a digital video that
screened for one night last week at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Hoeber's 30-minute video is far more gripping than these artsy
souvenirs in the main gallery. Unfortunately, the only way to see it
is on a small monitor in the back room. Although this setting
accentuates the fugitive feel of the finely wrought work, there's no
compelling reason it doesn't play continually out front.</TE>
<TE>   At once deadpan and demented, troubling and arch, whip-smart and
hilarious, "Killing Friends" is the result of an original vision. It
tells the story of a serial killer whose antics are both gruesome and
touching. Impossible twists and delicious details complicate a
narrative riddled with logical impossibilities and emotional
conundrums. Scenes filled with unspeakable cruelty segue gracefully
into moments of unbelievable gentleness.</TE>
<TE>   At one level, Hoeber's video spoofs the type of big-budget
earnestness found in such films as "The Killing Fields." It follows
precedents set by David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" and Quentin Tarantino's
"Pulp Fiction."</TE>
<TE>   At another level, Hoeber's video treats trashy slasher films as if
they were as respectable as early art videos. Since the 1970s, when
this genre was born, most artists have acted as if it had nothing to
do with the movies. But Hoeber plants one foot in each world. A
member of a generation for whom sleazy entertainment and influential
video masterpieces are two sides of the same coin, he's someone to
watch.</TE>

<HD>'Johnny' Takes a Seriocomic Journey to Maturity</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The opening image of "Johnny on the Spot," now at the Matrix, is a
glowing joint, followed by the toker's radio-announcer intonations.
Thus the title character of Neil Landau's new play about a Peter
Pan-syndrome poster boy's journey to maturity is introduced.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny (Jason Brooks) fears conformity, as he directly informs us,
but the box is closing in. Neither his long-suffering, pregnant
girlfriend (Helen Cates) nor his pill-packing mother (Miriam Flynn)
think Johnny is ready for fatherhood. Having just lost his insurance
job, he quite agrees.</LD>
<LD>   Enter three dead policyholders (Flynn, Richard Burgi and Cort
McCown), who have arrived from limbo to send Johnny on a surreal
excursion through past, present and future. Taking in, among others,
his dead father (Hugh O'Gorman) and unborn scion (Shane Hunter,
alternating with Travis Mannon), Johnny's cosmic sojourn leads to
catharsis.</LD>
<TE>   Director Jules Aaron stages this post-Durang parable with sleek
expertise. The design scheme is superb, with John Iacovelli's set, J.
Kent Inasy's lighting, John Zalewski's sound and Shon LeBlanc's
costumes all spot-on.</TE>
<TE>   The cast is wonderful. Brooks, balancing priceless stoner moments
with inner anguish, is marvelously attuned to the affecting Cates.
Burgi, McCown and O'Gorman effortlessly negotiate their seriocomic
shifts. Hunter is charming, and Flynn's locomotive delivery hijacks
the house.</TE>
<TE>   Landau's quirky, assured script carries post-larval incongruities,
the ghosts erratically integrated and Johnny's narration evaporating
midstream. But merely the emotional tug of the inspired denouement
disarms criticism, as does the immensely satisfying trip it
concludes.</TE>

<TE>   Slides Resurrect a</TE>
<TE>   Long-Gone Southland</TE>
<TE>   Historical preservationist, raconteur and piquant social
commentator, Charles Phoenix escorts us on a warmly nostalgic tour of
a more innocent time in "God Bless Americana, Part 2: The Retro Slide
Show Tour of Southern California," at the Egyptian Theatre's American
Cinematheque.</TE>
<TE>   A passionate collector of vintage photographic slides, the aptly
named Phoenix resurrects dying images from the ashes of garage sales
and thrift stores, and transforms them into a vibrant mythical
record. His particular specialty is America's fabulously kitschy
era--the decades from the 1940s through the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix's Sunday matinee features color slides solely from
Southern California. His Saturday show, "God Bless Americana Part 1:
The Retro Vacation Slide Show Tour of the USA," is national in scope,
a collection of vintage tourist snapshots showing Americans at play
in the postwar boom.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect any fancy theatrical effects or glitzy staging. This
is, after all, a slide show. The lights go down, the slides start
clicking, and Phoenix, a genial host in a Hawaiian shirt and
beachcomber's hat, starts chatting.</TE>
<TE>   But what slides. And what chat. A lifelong thrift-store enthusiast
who started collecting slides a decade ago, Phoenix combs shops and
estate sales for boxes of family slides. Working from the notations
on the slides, he reconstructs the provenance of each picture,
including delicious details that might have passed unnoticed without
a keenly analytical eye. Past "excavations" have turned up priceless
finds, such as the hundreds of candid shots taken behind the scenes
of "The Ten Commandments" by Cecil B. DeMille's personal assistant.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures range from revealing family shots of the most
hilarious stripe to iconic portraits of Los Angeles' tragically
squandered glories--the Brown Derby, the Pacific Electric Red Cars,
the fading splendors of Bunker Hill's doomed Victorian mansions. Some
images are painfully ironic, such as that of a small and worried
audience that has crammed inside the storefront offices of the
American Cancer Society to watch a film on cancer. Look closely--the
guy in the front row is smoking a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix, who has published several books culled from his
collection, begins his show by intoning that in post-World War II
America, "the mood is up, prosperity rules and the standard of living
is flying high." Perhaps that's an overly halcyon view. But the
sun-kissed Southern Californians seen here, standing by swimming
pools and new Buicks, are clearly having the time of their lives. And
so are we.</TE>

<TE>   A Rewarding 'Patience'</TE>
<TE>   Is Helped by Experiment</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the thrill of discovery. It's what turns people into theater
junkies.</TE>
<TE>   One place to experience that rush is Cal State L.A., where an
experiment in having students work alongside professionals has
resulted in a captivating presentation of the literary love story
"Burning Patience."</TE>
<TE>   Student actors Jonathan Williams and Norma Perez have leading
roles in the adaptation of Antonio Skarmeta's novel (the source for
the movie "Il Postino"), and it's exhilarating to see them hold the
stage with as much charm and authority as the veterans who perform
opposite them, Henry Darrow and Marta DuBois.</TE>
<TE>   The movie transferred this story--in which Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda finds himself mentoring his young postman in the fine arts of
writing and wooing women--to the Italian island of Capri during
Neruda's exile there in the 1950s. The play, however, takes place
from 1969 to '73 in the poet's beloved Isla Negra, a Chilean coastal
village. Snezana Petrovic, a design professional on the faculty,
renders the waterfront setting with a colorful sense of heightened
realism. It's life-size folk art, dreamily lighted by visiting
professional James L. Moody.</TE>
<TE>   Anything could happen in a place like this, and under the
imaginative direction of theater department chairman Stephen Rothman,
it does.</TE>
<TE>   As the postman, Williams is like a puppy nipping at the poet's
heels--so irresistibly playful and so hungry for attention that
Darrow's Neruda can't help but spend a few minutes each day tossing
metaphors for the young man to retrieve.</TE>
<TE>   Awakened to the power of words, Williams' postman begins to lavish
them on the young barmaid who has captured his heart. Teeming with
life and confident she has found her soul mate, Perez defies her
deliriously overprotective mother (DuBois) in hopes of rewriting her
future into a Nerudian poem.</TE>

<TE>   Familiar Material,</TE>
<TE>   Resourcefully Handled</TE>
<TE>   Referential echoes haunt "Snowing at Delphi," receiving its local
premiere at the Hudson. Catherine Butterfield's 1993 examination of
holiday-bound yuppie angst emulates a latter-day Philip Barry social
comedy, albeit one refiltered through "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   The setting is an upstate New York cabin where hosts Sarah (Linda
Park) and husband Nick (Graham Sibley), a former child star, are
introduced at rise playing parlor games with squabbling Gary (Mike
Hyland) and Marcy (Debra Azar). The subsequent arrival of Sarah's
college crony Allan (Michael Popp), in tandem with his unexpected,
very expectant companion Brenda (Kimberly Dawson) initiates the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Of principal concern is Sarah, as her bustling serenity conceals
traumas newly triggered by streetwise Brenda's directness. Meanwhile,
Brenda entreats publisher Gary to read the posturing Allan's
sociological diatribe, while Allan discovers muse potential in the
neurotic Marcy. A weekend of shifting alliances and revelations
unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy McClellan's direction is resourceful, negotiating the
split-focus locations with admirable ease. Given that these are more
archetypes than characters, the appealing cast demonstrates uniform
proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Park and Dawson embody their apposite women with equivalent
acumen, and Azar's acidic vulnerability is very apt. All three men
are likewise adept, especially considering their roles are virtually
interchangeable in twentysomething requirements.</TE>
<TE>   This predigested quality marks Butterfield's script, sound in
basic notion while presuming audience identification beyond what the
explicated subtext as dialogue can sustain. Despite the respectable
intent, such familiarity seems like postdated Lifetime TV, which is
perhaps its ideal destination.</TE>

<TE>   Historical Context</TE>
<TE>   Lifts 'Picon Pie'</TE>
<TE>   Those who became familiar with Molly Picon during her later
career, when she was a ubiquitous character actress in everything
from A-list feature films to television commercials, may not have
been aware that the sweet old lady with the oh-so-familiar face was
actually a luminary of the Yiddish theater whose career spanned about
80 years before her death in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Leiman Goldemberg undertakes a comprehensive and respectful
retrospective of this once well-known but now largely forgotten
actress in "Picon Pie," her original musical play now receiving its
world premiere production at the Santa Monica Playhouse. The piece
recapitulates Picon's life from her early roots in vaudeville to her
ascension as the undisputed queen of 2nd Avenue, the "Yiddish
Broadway."</TE>
<TE>   The play, briskly directed by Chris DeCarlo, features Jack Kutcher
as Jacob Kalich, Molly's husband-manager. But the piece is
essentially a one-woman show, a diverting but somewhat episodic
character study brought to full life by Barbara Minkus, the petite
dynamo who plays Picon. Minkus is a warm performer with a powerhouse
voice well-suited for the beloved Yiddish standards that are
prolifically interspersed throughout. Music director Beth Ertz, who
contributes the show's incidental original music, accompanies Minkus
on keyboards, backed up by clarinet and saxophone.</TE>
<TE>   Picon was a precocious performer who got her start playing boys in
the early days of the last century. A lifelong star who was married
to the same man for 58 years, she was a staid and sensible
lady--hardly a fitting subject for a dishy tell-all. Yet Goldemberg
drums up what dramatic tension she can by emphasizing Picon's early
abandonment by her father, along with her various financial and
marital woes.</TE>
<TE>   The most affecting scenes derive not from Picon's personal
biography, but from the sweeping historical context of the 1920s and
her return tour to Europe after the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   It is this wrenching material that allows Minkus to show her
authoritative range, from the antic to the resonantly anguished.</TE>

<HD>Making the Most of What He Has Left</HD>
<DH>Music* A mysterious ailment could have ended Gary
Graffman's concert career. Instead, former students write concertos
especially for him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN STEINBERG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>What does a pianist do after losing full use of his right hand and
going to 18 doctors and getting 18 diagnoses?</LD>
<LD>   Gary Graffman commissions works for the left hand.</LD>
<LD>   Graffman has performed two world premieres of left-handed
concertos this season: Daron Hagen's "Seven Last Words" with the New
Mexico Symphony and Richard Danielpour's Piano Concerto No. 3 "Zodiac
Variations" with the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. He will
premiere a third, "Concierto para la mano izquierda" by Luis Prado,
at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Graffman was among the so-called the
OYAPs--Outstanding Young American Pianists--a group that included Van
Cliburn, Leon Fleisher and Eugene Istomin and was to take over from
the generation of Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Rudolf
Serkin. At age 7, he started studying with Isabelle Vengerova of
Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music; at 20, he won the
Leventritt Award; later, he studied with Horowitz and Serkin.</TE>
<TE>   For 30 years, he performed 100 concerts a year.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the late 1970s, he noticed his right ring finger and
little finger would collapse when he reached for notes. There was
nothing sudden and no pain, Graffman recalled during an interview in
his stately apartment overlooking Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It was little by little. I was having problems with certain
[chord configurations], usually in Brahms. It was hard to realize
that something was going wrong. It just seemed like, 'Well, it's a
difficult [passage], and I'm getting older,'" said the 73-year-old
pianist, who, despite the ailment, still shakes hands with a firm
grip.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Naomi, said he was reluctant to have it looked at.</TE>
<TE>   "'They'll think I'm crazy,'" she recalled his saying. "I said,
'But you have to go to the doctor.' I thought it was maybe some
calcium spur. He said, 'I don't want to,' but he finally did. And
they did think he was crazy. And then came the great trek to the [18]
different doctors [with the 18 diagnoses], which in retrospect is one
of the most ridiculous experiences anybody could ever have."</TE>
<TE>   Graffman gave up performing and tried numerous remedies and
pursued other interests. He studied Asian art history, learned some
Mandarin and made many trips to Asia. The fruits of this passion fill
his apartment, which has an impressive collection of Asian art (in
addition to side-by-side Steinway grand pianos).</TE>
<TE>   His medical problem eventually was determined to be a focal
dystonia, in which the brain seems to get confused by the nerve
impulses and sends out the wrong signals to an appendage.</TE>
<TE>   "When he realized he wasn't dying, he felt much better about it
because they were all convinced he had some terminal illness," Naomi
Graffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is no cure, and no treatment has worked for him.</TE>
<TE>   During his performing hiatus, Graffman started to teach at Curtis
and at the Manhattan School of Music and wrote the memoir "I Really
Should Be Practicing." He became director of Curtis in 1986 and has
been its president since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   He also started to learn the left-handed repertoire, as did his
friend and colleague Fleisher, who also suffered from a right-hand
problem but has recovered and can play from the two-handed
repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous piece for left-handed piano is a concerto by
Maurice Ravel commissioned by Viennese pianist Paul Wittgenstein. A
pianist's right hand is more susceptible to injury because it
generally plays the melody and is used more. Wittgenstein lost his
right hand while fighting on the Russian front during World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Wittgenstein also commissioned similar works by Sergei Prokofiev
and Benjamin Britten. Erich Wolfgang Korngold, better known for his
Hollywood scores, also wrote a concerto for him.</TE>
<TE>   There are hundreds of other works for left hand, including a
transcription of Bach's solo violin "Chaconne" by Johannes Brahms for
Clara Schumann, prepared after she strained her right hand. However,
Graffman said he found the repertoire confining.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Ned Rorem composed a piece for him. In 1996,
William Bolcom composed a concerto for Graffman and Fleisher, "Gaea,"
in which Graffman performed the first movement, Fleisher the second
and both played the third.</TE>
<TE>   Next season, Graffman is scheduled to perform with the Minnesota
Orchestra a left-handed concerto written for him by Stanislaw
Skrowaczewski.</TE>
<TE>   The piece being premiered with the Chamber Orchestra of
Philadelphia Sunday gives Graffman more than the opportunity to
display his single-handed dexterity. Prado, the composer, graduated
from Curtis. The conductor is Ignat Solzhenitsyn, the son of the
Nobel Prize-winning author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and a former piano
student of Graffman's.</TE>
<TE>   "As I'm getting older, more and more conductors that I play with,
I signed their diplomas," Graffman said.</TE>

<HD>'Brother' Has Great Fun With 'Shaft' Genre</HD>
<DH>Eddie Griffin and his Afro lead the merriment in a film
that, in its way, shows how things have changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Brooklyn Museum might want to consider pulling some of the space
it is taking up with "Star Wars" gear and reallocating it to a
mustard-colored Cadillac Coupe de Ville that spins like a woozy top
when you hit the brakes. If you want to see the real pop-culture
design statement of the '70s, look no further. This is the dream
machine of "Undercover Brother," a super soul man who wears a
matching, two-toned mustard-colored leather jacket and chugs a
complementarily tinted soft drink.</LD>
<LD>   God knows what's in that soda, but it is having such a euphoric
effect on the drinker and his audience, it couldn't possibly be
legal.</LD>
<LD>   Adapted by John Ridley and Michael McCullers from Ridley's
Internet film series, "Undercover Brother" is a funkadelic fun ride
that shrewdly reinvigorates the eye-popping styles and pulpy veneer
of '70s blaxploitation flicks. Unlike the "Scary Movie" films, whose
stop-at-nothing jokes were an end unto themselves, this is broad
movie spoofing with a point: using the racial divisions and
stereotypes manipulated by the "Shaft"-"Super Fly" genre to show how
whites came around over the intervening decades to embracing their
inner blackness. And how ambivalently many blacks feel about that in
return.</LD>
<TE>   The jubilantly upbeat Eddie Griffin sports a panoramic Afro and
pork chop sideburns as the Undercover Brother, a crime fighter whose
flair for disguise is in keeping with his taste for in-your-face
clothes. (He surfaces incognito at a conservative country club golf
course dressed as a rainbow-colored Rastafarian.) He is recruited by
an African American justice organization known as the
B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. to fight alongside the sultry Sistah Girl
(Aunjanue Ellis, in the Cleopatra Jones part). Their target is an
evil cell run by the Man, a shadowy white bureaucrat credited with a
decline of black cultural identity that reached its nadir with Dennis
Rodman.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodman reference signals the take-no-prisoners esprit of a
film that rides roughshod over contemporary black role models ranging
from Colin Powell (Billy Dee Williams, as a general who throws in his
presidency bid to open a fried chicken chain) to Al Roker (a portly
and bespectacled Gary Anthony Ramsay, as Smart Brother). The film's
most inspired character is Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle, a
textbook in comic timing), a pull-string puppet of angry young black
man paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   The object of Conspiracy Brother's knee-jerk contempt is embodied
in the Man's aide-de-camp, the fey Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan, riffing
on gay villains of '70s cinema infamy) and the voluptuous White She
Devil (Denise Richards). The inevitable shower-wrestling scene
between Sistah Girl and White She Devil represents "Undercover
Brother" at its glibbest, but the cast is having such a ball (is this
the hippest comedy ensemble since "Young Frankenstein" or what?) and
director Malcolm D. Lee (of the elegant "The Best Man") keeps it all
moving so breathlessly, you don't have time to fine-tune your PC
radar.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for language, sexual humor, drug content and
campy violence. Times guidelines: Even if there were a reason to keep
your teens away (there's not), you probably couldn't.</TE>

<HD>It's the Very Latest in Ojai From Impassioned Pianist
Formenti</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ojai Music Festival this year is concerned with "last and latest
thoughts." For the main concerts tonight, Saturday night and early
Sunday evening, the Emerson String Quartet will play late Beethoven
and Shostakovich. A symposium, begun Thursday and continuing today,
examines the nature of late work in general and that of Beethoven,
Shostakovich and Strauss in particular. Marino Formenti, the
phenomenal Italian pianist, tackles recent music in a recital for
kids Saturday morning and one for adults in the afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   But to begin it all, Formenti performed a four-hour marathon
Wednesday night in a gallery of the Ojai Art Center, with the
audience seated on folding chairs placed in a semicircle around the
piano. It consisted of late work by Beethoven, Schubert, Morton
Feldman and three Czech composers who died in the Nazi concentration
camp Terezin. Probably this extraordinary pianist didn't intend to
turn the theme of the festival into an oxymoron, but that is what he
did, in a riveting, unique event.</LD>
<LD>   For Formenti, "last and latest" might as well be one and the same.
Everything he plays seems like latest thoughts, namely his own.
Formenti surely must have prepared long and hard for this incredibly
demanding and brilliantly executed program, but it all sounded as
though he were making it up on the spot.</LD>
<TE>   Formenti has become a familiar, if ever astonishing, figure in
Southern California over the past few years. The Vienna-based
pianist, who is a member of the new-music group Klangforum Wien, has
offered venturesome one-man festivals at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art and has given recitals in Orange County and Cerritos.
He is a volatile, passionate modernist who can bring a sense of
theater to even the most complex, knotty modern music.</TE>
<TE>   He holds audiences in thrall with his ferocious percussive
intensity at one extreme and his otherworldly lyricism at the other.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Formenti took on two 19th century
masterpieces--Beethoven's Bagatelles, Opus 126, and Schubert's Sonata
in B flat, D. 960.</TE>
<TE>   Beethoven's last work for piano consists of six miniatures, each
an exercise in condensation. With time running out for Beethoven, he
made each phrase an essential expression and left us to fill in the
gaps. Syphilitic Schubert wrote his transcendental B-Flat Sonata the
last year of his short life, but it is music in no hurry. Rather, the
sonata is an uncompromising study in the unfolding of the long, lyric
line.</TE>
<TE>   Formenti played both works in what appeared to be a state of
wonder. His Beethoven raged with fury one moment and seemed lighter
than air the next. In the Schubert, the pianist lingered on the
haunting dark ringing of the low trills in the first movement and
then lifted the black mood with a lyricism that bordered on the
ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   For the Terezin works--excerpts from Pavel Haas' Suite, Opus 13,
Viktor Ullmann's Sonata No. 6 and Gideon Klein's Sonata, Opus
49--Formenti had little opportunity to exploit his lyric gifts. This
is mainly busy, Expressionist music. But what Formenti did is bring
dramatic fervor to this often gray music. There was nothing maudlin
or exploitative here, as there can be in performances of these
composers, just exciting playing, and, in the case of Haas, a feeling
that here was one composer who might have been able to carry on where
Janacek left off.</TE>
<TE>   The marathon's concluding performance, Feldman's "For Bunita
Marcus," was an event all by itself. Written in 1985, two years
before the composer's death and not his last work for piano, it
nevertheless has the feel of music that has transcended the physical
realm altogether. For the 76-minute performance, which went on past
midnight, many of the chairs were replaced by cushions and futons
around the piano. Lights were kept dim. The music is very soft
(rarely rising above the dynamic of piano) and exceptionally minimal
even for Feldman. Much of it is single notes loosely strung together.
About every 10 minutes comes a chord.</TE>
<TE>   Formenti's performance was mesmeric, shamanistic, unforgettable.
He was, I'm fairly certain, quieter and more still than any other
pianist who has tackled this work (there are two recordings of it,
and only a handful of other pianists have played it). But what was
most striking about the performance was its beauty of tone. Every
note was like a shimmering star in a clear, beautiful night sky. That
sense of lyrical wonder that Formenti made momentary in Beethoven and
Schubert came to seem permanent here. Time stopped, last and latest
merged into one.</TE>
<TE>   The long evening began before Formenti performed when members of
the California EAR Unit offered the premieres of works by young local
composers.</TE>
<TE>   Both works were winners in an Ojai Festival competition sponsored
by the Gould Family Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In "Transits to Paradise," a trio for cello, clarinet and piano,
Kay Kyurim Rhie contrasted bright rhythms with longer floating lines
as she imagined music to accompany a bus ride through Los Angeles
smog. Patricio da Silva's ensemble work, "Periodically Aperiodical,
Aperiodically Periodical," proved stimulating chaos, small bundles of
notes bouncing about unpredictably but pleasingly, like molecules in
space.</TE>

Bowl, Ojai Avenue at Signal Street, Ojai, (805) 646-2053.</TE>

<HD>A Complex Nuclear Equation</HD>
<DH>'The Sum of All Fears' takes an overly convoluted yet
ultimately absorbing approach to adapting the Tom Clancy thriller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of Sept. 11, "The Sum of All Fears" could hardly be more
timely or frightening in its depiction of the world's vulnerability
to weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. This
crackling, if overly complicated, version of the Tom Clancy
action-political thriller imagines what could happen if a nuclear
warhead threatened an American city--a scenario that seems less like
fiction every day.</LD>
<LD>   The film opens during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when Israel
dispatches a plane carrying an atom bomb in case its ground forces
are overrun by Egypt and Syria. The jet, however, is downed in the
Golan Heights, its atom bomb ejects and remains hidden by shifting
sands in the desert, where it is uncovered by scavengers 29 years
later and sold to a Damascus-based South African arms merchant.</LD>
<LD>   That's all we're told by Clancy adaptors Paul Attanasio and Daniel
Pyne, who don't make it clear why this all matters until the film is
about half over. Until then it jumps all over the Eastern seaboard of
America, Western Europe, Russia and the Middle East; it's best to
resist the urge to connect the dots in this hard-to-follow film and
trust that all will become clear in good time.</LD>
<TE>   The effect of this approach does not evoke ambiguity as much as it
does just plain obscurity. "The Sum of All Fears" could have been
lots scarier lots earlier with just a soupcon of clarity; the
all-too-human temptation to try to figure out what's going on can
become truly distracting.</TE>
<TE>   As with so many films with ultra-complicated plots, the story is
simple at heart, so much so in this instance that it's hard to
discuss without giving everything away. Let's just say that America
and Russia have been brought to the brink of nuclear war, but CIA
analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) seems to be the only man in the
universe who is either willing or able to consider the possibility
that some evil individual is playing the two major nuclear powers
against each other. This conviction propels Ryan out of the office
and into the realm of the action hero who ends up single-handedly
having to save civilization--and with only an hour to do it.</TE>
<TE>   When the many parts of "The Sum of All Fears" start falling into
place under Phil Alden Robinson's trenchant direction, it's possible
to begin to appreciate how skillfully the film plays Ryan's thriller
heroics against the horrific predicament the presidents of the U.S.
and Russia (James Cromwell and Ciaran Hinds, respectively) find
themselves in. They must show courage and judgment under the greatest
pressure imaginable yet cannot divorce themselves from feelings of
pride and machismo. Hinds' President Nemerov has his clutch of
advisors, to be sure, but they're more deferential than their
American counterparts; indeed, Cromwell's President Fowler is thrust
into an immediate tug-of-war between his hawkish Secretary of Defense
(Philip Baker Hall) and his dovish Secretary of State (Ron Rifkin).</TE>
<TE>   In the film's sharp ensemble cast, Affleck and Morgan Freeman as
director of the CIA are indubitably its stars. Although a bit bland
in comparison to Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford, who have also played
Jack Ryan in films (Affleck's Ryan is considerably younger and less
accomplished), Affleck has the intelligence and athleticism to carry
off the singularly unpretentious and fiercely diligent hero.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman's character has such shrewdness, self-discipline and
humanity it's too bad he isn't running the CIA for real.
Scene-stealing Liev Schreiber's CIA operative is breathtakingly
fearless, resourceful and witty as well; Alan Bates is a neo-Fascist
villain with a terrifying superiority complex and deep pockets; and
Bridget Moynahan is a beautiful young doctor who is falling in love
with Ryan without knowing what he really does.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sum of All Fears" has vast scope, unflagging energy, a
rousing Jerry Goldsmith score and a horrendous disaster sequence that
conveys much in discreet fashion in keeping with post-Sept. 11
sensibilities yet is needlessly evasive in telling us the precise
extent of its magnitude. "The Sum of All Fears" is absorbing and
disturbing--perhaps more disturbing than originally intended--but a
little clarity would have gone a long way.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence, disaster images and brief strong
language. Times guidelines: disturbing in its depiction of the
detonation of a nuclear device though not overly graphic; too intense
for younger audiences.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a decade away from the cameras doing silly stuff like getting a
college degree, Keshia Knight Pulliam evidently figured it was time
to give this show-biz thing another shot.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of weeks ago, the youngest person to receive a best
supporting actress Emmy nomination (as Rudy on "The Cosby Show")
dipped a toe back in the prime-time waters on the "Cosby" reunion
special. But tonight Pulliam dives in with a starring role in the
two-hour TV movie "What About Your Friends: Weekend Get-Away" (8
p.m., UPN).</LD>
<LD>   Although the film is built upon a rather routine coming-of-age
framework, there's a hip-hop essence just peering around the edges
that gives the movie some fresh angles and allows Pulliam an
opportunity to charm viewers as a young adult.</LD>
<TE>   Pulliam plays Temple, the well-to-do centerpiece of a trio of
longtime girlfriends that includes middle-class Alex ("Baby Boy's"
Angell Conwell) and working-class Breena ("American Pie's" Monica
McSwain). The high school seniors are just getting their career plans
in gear when they learn of a scholarship competition that could help
them get a leg up on their hopes for the future.</TE>
<TE>   The competition, which unfolds over a weekend on a college campus,
brings out things in the girls and their friendship that threaten to
tear them apart and send them home with their dreams in tatters.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Gossett Jr. makes a brief appearance as dean of the college,
and Kym E. Whitley is a strong presence as an overseer of the
scholarship program, but the three young women show enough spark to
carry the action and help you forget some improbable plot conceits.</TE>
<TE>   There's music, romance, tears of anger and tears of joy. Just
another weekend on a college campus, right?</TE>

<HD>Trey Anastasio Is All Funk, No Phish, on First Solo Tour</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marc Weingarten</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trey Anastasio has found the funk. For his first tour as a solo
artist, the guitarist and primary songwriter for Phish has left that
band's baroque song structures behind and dug his heels into big,
brassy grooves that take their cues from James Brown, Little Feat and
Fela Kuti. Anastasio's L.A. solo debut at the Greek Theatre on
Wednesday was less jam band and more jam on it.</LD>
<LD>   He was working with a larger band than Phish's four-piece lineup.
While bassist Tony Markellis and drummer Russell Lawton provided
supple grooves underneath, a five-piece horn section dipped and
swooped around songs that took a world tour of dance styles. With its
stutter-step syncopation, "Push On 'Til the Day" was Anastasio's
tribute to James Brown's great band the JB's, while "Money, Love and
Change" was a groove under a gospel tent.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, traces of African highlife, reggae and merengue could
also be heard. Anastasio kept things loose, allowing the songs to
spill out into long yet disciplined jams, while he alternated between
soaring leads and chicken-scratch accents on guitar.</LD>
<TE>   There was a conspicuous absence of Phish material during the
nearly three-hour performance, but it hardly seemed to deter the
faithful, who kept trying to dance in the aisles, despite the
admonishments of the security corps.</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Mates</HD>
<DH>Gays and seniors have made 'Sordid Lives' a cult hit in
Palm Springs, where the film has played for months</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the quirky, gay-themed comedy "Sordid Lives" first opened at the
Camelot Theater in Palm Springs in November, theater operator
Marshall Stone admits he would have been happy had the film brought
in some business at the box office for two or three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Little did he dream that 29 weeks later, "Sordid Lives" would
become a local sensation, one that first appealed to the growing gay
population here and then crossed over to the area's other major
demographic: seniors.</LD>
<LD>   Although it received scant attention and was panned by many
critics after it opened in Los Angeles in May 2001, the small-budget
film--about a dysfunctional Texas family and a grown gay grandson
living out in L.A. who worries about returning for his grandmother's
funeral--has succeeded on strong word of mouth. It is a feat rarely
achieved in this era of big-studio, marketing-driven blockbusters. As
a result, "Sordid Lives," which stars Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia,
Delta Burke and Olivia Newton-John (with close-cropped bleached hair
and studs in her earlobes), is quickly becoming an unlikely cult hit.</LD>
<TE>   "I think a lot of [the buzz] started in the beauty salons, barber
shops and grocery stores," Stone said. "We had a lady who works right
here at Vons, and she told me one of her customers told her she ought
to go see the movie. She and her husband came in and watched it, and
they've been back three times."</TE>
<TE>   In April, the theater invited some cast members for two evenings
of questions and answers with the public, and it sold so many tickets
that Stone said he could have sold 2,000 more had he had enough
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the theater has invited Bridges, Newton-John and other
cast members for another sold-out question-and-answer session. The
$500,000 film has so far taken in $472,000--half of that total at the
Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   "It has amazed me," said John Lambert, president of domestic
distribution at Santa Monica-based Regent Entertainment. "It has
leapfrogged right past the gay population. They actually have
busloads of gray-hairs coming in to see the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are flocking to the Camelot simply to see what
people in town are talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone and their brother who I talk to has seen the movie,"
said Charlotte O'Brien, who works at a local watering hole called
Toucan's. "There are people who have seen it nine times. I'm a
bartender, and it's all they can talk about." Decked out in a summery
polka-dot dress and wide-brimmed hat, she stood at the ticket window
buying $100 worth of gift certificates. She hopes they will be used
to see "Sordid Lives."</TE>
<TE>   How "Sordid Lives" became an unexpected hit in the heat-drenched
climes of the Coachella Valley underscores the unique dynamics of the
Palm Springs region, which in recent years has seen a large influx of
gays and lesbians drawn by the same swank resorts, glistening
swimming pools and lush golf courses that long ago made this desert a
playground for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Box-Office Records at the Camelot</TE>
<TE>   Screening four times a day, "Sordid Lives" has out-grossed every
other film at the Camelot for 19 of 25 weeks, holds the record for
the top five grossing weeks at the triplex theater, and the theater
management already is planning for big showings next Thanksgiving,
when winter brings the tourists and "snowbirds" back.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what to make of it," writer-director Del Shores
said of the town's embrace of his film. "I am overwhelmed. I always
knew, judging from audience response at film festivals, that if word
of mouth could kick in and let it set there, it would take off.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing that solves the mystery of life in it," he
added, "but it is very funny."</TE>
<TE>   But can the appeal of "Sordid Lives" stretch beyond Palm Springs'
gays and grays? That's what the film's distributors are betting on.</TE>
<TE>   Amazed at the film's strong draw in Palm Springs, Regent
executives plan to expand the film's release beginning June 14 with
weekend midnight shows at the Regent Showcase Theater in Los Angeles,
followed by openings in Boston, Denver and, come August, perhaps New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Some moviegoers are even beginning to compare "Sordid Lives" with
the cult status reserved for the kinky horror-movie spoof "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show," which drew gay and straight fans to midnight
showings years after its initial run in 1975. Indeed, the gay
community has a long history of lavishing attention on smaller films
with gay subject matter--films like 1994's "The Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and last year's "Hedwig and the Angry
Inch."</TE>
<TE>   "It did start out that we promoted it strong in the gay
community," Stone recalled. "Now, it has flipped over, and it is
really the senior citizens who come to the theater. We're having
groups of 12, 15, 20 people come in, and they're just having a little
party."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Green, president of the Desert Gay Tourism Guild, said
Palms Springs has seen a dramatic increase in its gay population in
the past 10 years. Of 43,000 residents, Green estimates that between
35% and 40% are gay.</TE>
<TE>   "A good example of this is some of the newer housing developments
in town," Green said. "One on the north end of Avenida Caballeros has
about 80 homes in it. They did a directory for the development, and
fully 90% of the homes are gay couples or gay singles."</TE>
<TE>   That large gay population has fused with the equally large
community of retired seniors. Statistics show that a fourth of Palm
Springs' permanent residents is 65 or older. The result has been a
mixing of both worlds in a spirit of tolerance not found in many
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "We just finished a City Council election, a very contentious
election, and the woman who won, who is straight, really had support
all over the city," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at her election-night victory party, and it was amazing
to see this cross section of people at that party, chatting together,
visiting."</TE>
<TE>   Film Wasn't a Hit in Other Cities</TE>
<TE>   "Sordid Lives" arrived under the radar last year, playing about 10
weeks at the Laemmle Sunset in West Hollywood to moderate success.</TE>
<TE>   It also played for 32 weeks at the Highland Park Theater in
Dallas, but Lambert noted that because the theater is owned by
Regent, the film could be kept on a screen even though it struggled.
The movie also ran for 10 weeks in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and four
weeks in Atlanta, but died after only a week in Chicago, San
Francisco and Seattle after poor reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The run of "Sordid Lives" in Palm Springs began Nov. 2 and shows
no sign of stopping. Using a combination of fliers, radio
commercials, mailings and e-mails, theater management got the word
out. The Camelot, which is owned by Ric and Rozene Supple, took out
commercials on local radio stations owned by the couple, Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   "The first week we showed the movie, we had one of our customers
come in and he wanted to know if he could take the fliers to some of
his friends," Stone recalled. "He took them to all the barber shops
and beauty salons and beauty supply places. He told us there were
probably 150 places he took them to."</TE>
<TE>   The unrated film is based on Shores' 1996 play, which had a
13-month run in L.A. and features some nudity and strong language.</TE>
<TE>   The story revolves around a dysfunctional family in a small Texas
town that is preparing for the mother's funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges plays G.W., who had an extramarital affair with the dead
woman and is brooding at the bar at Bubba's Beer Joint because she
killed herself by tripping over his two wooden legs. Burke plays
G.W.'s bitter, gun-toting wife, Noleta.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Sissy, the dead woman's sister, played by Beth Grant,
who wears a beehive hairdo and tries to quit smoking by snapping her
wrist with a rubber band every few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   (At the April screening in Palm Springs, Shores noted, people in
the audiences wore rubber bands on their wrists and snapped them as
Grant snapped hers in the movie.)</TE>
<TE>   Bedelia plays the strait-laced daughter, Latrelle; Kirk Geiger is
her gay son, Ty; Ann Walker is Latrelle's buxom sister, LaVonda; and
Leslie Jordan plays Brother Boy, the dead woman's son who has been
sent to an insane asylum because he thinks he's country singer Tammy
Wynette.</TE>
<TE>   Story Was Based on Playwright's Life</TE>
<TE>   Shores said he based some of the characters on people he knew
growing up near Laredo in Zapata, Texas, population 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "'Sordid Lives' was really a gift to myself," Shores said. "I had
so much self-loathing about being gay and so much shame about being
gay, that when I finally wrote about it, I was still experiencing
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to the theater and seeing people embrace my character and
the characters around me and seeing them stand up and applaud and
laugh was a way I ultimately started loving my gay self."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Southern Baptist minister and a high school drama
coach, Shores was married for 91/2 years and had two daughters when
he came out of the closet at, he says, "the pathetic age of 36."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Sordid Lives," Shores also adapted his stage play
"Daddy's Dyin' ... Who's Got the Will?" into a 1990 film starring
Bridges. His other notable plays include "Cheatin'" and "Daughters of
the Lone Star State."</TE>
<TE>   Shores said it is amazing to sit in a theater and hear people
shout out lines from the film at the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Straight or gay, many moviegoers are coming back again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things you can relate to," said Betty Ekmanian
of Palm Desert, who has seen the film three times. "People.
Personalties. It may be exaggerated, but it's there. It's just funny.
Makes you belly-laugh. It's a hoot. ... And the smoking thing. I'm a
smoker and it was really funny to me."</TE>

<HD>Stardom's a Lethal Weapon for Good in Danny Glover's Hands</HD>
<DH>Activism* The actor used his money to save the faltering
TransAfrica Forum. Now he's devoting time and energy to rebuilding
the think tank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WILTZ</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There's no entourage nipping at his heels, no burly bodyguard, just a
regular Joe strolling the street--except that, of course, he isn't,
but it's easy to forget that.</LD>
<LD>   Which means that the homeless dudes in Dupont Circle feel free to
hit him up with their requests: This one could use an autograph. That
one could use a little cash. The one with the pants sliding south
could use his San Francisco Giants baseball cap. Perhaps deferring to
the royal burnish of celebrity, they're unfailingly polite. Please.
If I could trouble you for just a minute. Thank you, Mr. Glover.</LD>
<LD>   So that one gets the autograph, the other one gets a few bucks,
but no, man, you can't have his baseball cap. And, brother, could you
hold off for just a minute? Please. He's busy right now.</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Glover is taking a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   This is what Danny Glover, star of "The Royal Tenenbaums" and the
"Lethal Weapon" movie series, does these days: He takes meetings,
though usually not with slick studio execs but with death penalty
abolitionists, environmental activists, literacy advocates, human
rights workers and those seeking to eradicate AIDS in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   He's a man in transition, trafficking in the glitz of celluloid
but feeling duty-bound to rescue the world, particularly Africa and
other parts of the globe inhabited by folks of African descent. So he
exists on five hours of sleep, rising at dawn and sneaking in naps so
he can wring more time out of his overstuffed day for his many
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Since October, much of his attention is focused on his duties as
chairman of TransAfrica Forum. The 22-year-old think tank, founded by
anti-apartheid activist and scholar Randall Robinson, was on life
support before Glover bailed it out in 1999 with a $1-million pledge,
says Bill Fletcher, a labor activist who became its president in
January.</TE>
<TE>   He's doing more than writing checks. He's helping rebuild an
organization that's struggling after the departure of its charismatic
founder. As Glover sees it, his role at TransAfrica is a "supportive"
one, trying to rebuild an organization and figure out how to push
African Americans front and center into the dialogue about the future
of Africa and the African diaspora, including those in South America
and the Caribbean--what Glover calls the "Global South."</TE>
<TE>   All these meetings, all the planning and strategizing, make Danny
Glover one very busy man. If acting gets pushed to the background, so
be it. Time on the set is fun time, self-indulgent time, basically
vacation time. Of course, filming can't halt the deluge of faxes and
e-mails he gets.</TE>
<TE>   He ambles into the new offices of TransAfrica, running a little
late, looking a little weary and lugging a tote bag stuffed with six
books, a Washington Post, yesterday's New York Times, bottles of
vitamins, a DVD of one of his more forgettable flicks and a couple of
Chucho Valdes CDs. The aforementioned Giants cap covers his
salt-speckled crop; jeans and a T-shirt cover his 6-foot, 4-inch
frame. A navy Yohji Yamamoto jacket, tricked up with pleated sleeves
like something out of "Star Trek," is his only concession to fashion.
Yamamoto, he says, knows from big men, and Glover is a man who
occupies space.</TE>
<TE>   His voice is a bass-line rasp, mixing and mingling with Fletcher's
low-key murmur as the two outline their plans for the reconfigured
TransAfrica.</TE>
<TE>   The Issues Aren't Easily</TE>
<TE>   Distilled Into Sound Bites</TE>
<TE>   The men are friends, veteran activists who came of age during the
civil rights movement. They met a couple of years ago, on a
TransAfrica-sponsored trip to Cuba. Now they talk several times a
week, plotting and planning, determined to take the organization to a
different level. Instead of lobbying politicians for dispensation for
Africa, they want to lobby African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, TransAfrica mirrors the trajectory of the civil
rights movement. There was a time when the direction was clear:
State-sponsored segregation was wrong, whether the apartheid was in
the South or in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But now, in this post-civil rights, post-Cold War, post-Nelson
Mandela era, the issues aren't so easily distilled into sound bites
and images.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the matter of Robinson, who has retired to St. Kitts,
where his wife is from, and has written his latest book, "The
Reckoning," about the intricate relationship of crime and poverty,
prison and politics. His was the face of TransAfrica, from his
well-publicized hunger strikes on behalf of Haitian refugees to his
quest for reparations to his lobbying of "pro-justice" political
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Robinson gone, changes are being made. The organization
recently sold its Dupont Circle mansion for $5.2 million and paid
cash for its new headquarters, a 5,000-square-foot condo in another
Dupont Circle mansion that's been converted into a multi-use
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher and Glover both say they want a grass-roots movement:
They want to engage African Americans in the drive for reparations
for the descendants of American slaves, to promote debt relief for
African nations, to rebuild a network of support within organized
labor and to halt the disaster AIDS is wreaking throughout Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the goals are prosaic concerns: There's money to be
raised, boxes to be unpacked at the new office and an image to
rebuild in the post-Randall Robinson era, all the while making sure
the institution stays afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Glover is now the public face of TransAfrica, meeting with heads
of African states, raising money and giving speeches on college
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very careful about his time," Fletcher says. "When you have
the level of stature and fame that Danny has, everyone wants a piece
of him."</TE>
<TE>   "When I believe in something," Glover says, "I have a sense of
justice in my beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's a sense of self-righteousness peppered with a dogged
sense of inadequacy. "Sometimes I think I don't speak up enough.
Sometimes I feel that I'm not doing enough."</TE>
<TE>   Some saw him as doing and speaking too much last November, when
Glover spoke out against the death penalty during a panel at
Princeton University. A student asked him if he would spare the life
of Osama bin Laden; Glover responded that he was opposed to the death
penalty in all instances. A furor ensued, with conservatives like
Oliver North calling for a boycott of "The Royal Tenenbaums." The
Modesto City Council withdrew its sponsorship of Glover as the
featured speaker for its Martin Luther King Day celebration. After a
write-in campaign by Glover supporters, the City Council reversed its
decision, and Glover spoke after all.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time, perhaps, that the actor, who normally
enjoys positive press, was pilloried for his politics. "I was angry."</TE>
<TE>   Glover uses Hollywood as a springboard to riskier, more
independent endeavors. To do "Lethal Weapon 3," he negotiated with
Warner Bros. to donate $3 million toward the making of "The Saint of
Fort Washington," an independent film in which he plays a homeless
man.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to feel that I got something; I changed the dynamic.
It's a give-and-take. Maybe I can get them to do a story that I want
to make. If you're fortunate to get to a certain point in the
business, you can do that."</TE>

<LD>Coho salmon--A story in some editions of Thursday's California
section misstated the California Department of Fish and Game's
recommendation regarding the coho salmon. The agency recommended that
the fish be granted protection under the state Endangered Species Act
from San Francisco to the Oregon border. Populations of coho salmon
from San Francisco to Punta Gorda in Humboldt County would be listed
as endangered, while those from Punta Gorda to Oregon would be listed
as threatened.</LD>

<HD>Allen Said to Be Near Deal With Adelphia</HD>
<DH>Cable: Loan of up to $2 billion would come as Chapter 11
looms. New board member Leonard Tow balks at sale of prized L.A.
systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to stave off bankruptcy, cable operator Adelphia
Communications Corp. was in intense negotiations late Thursday with
billionaire Paul Allen to secure a loan of as much as $2 billion,
sources close to the talks said.</LD>
<LD>   Allen, who controls the nation's fourth-largest cable firm,
Charter Communications Corp., was putting the finishing touches on
the deal, which would be structured to protect him if Adelphia is
forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In exchange for
his support, Allen would buy cable systems from Adelphia, including
its lucrative franchises in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Under the complicated deal, Allen would buy pieces of Adelphia in
stages. For instance, Allen would buy 450,000 of Adelphia's 1.2
million customers in Southern California with an option to purchase
the remaining properties at a future date. He is also interested in
assets on the East Coast, including systems in North Carolina and
Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   For Adelphia, the chances of a bankruptcy filing increased
Thursday when Nasdaq announced plans to delist the stock Monday.
Adelphia had missed several deadlines to file an annual financial
report.</TE>
<TE>   The delisting would give bondholders the right to force Adelphia
to buy back $1.4 billion in convertible debt, which could cause the
company to file for bankruptcy protection, analysts have said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Adelphia shareholder Leonard Tow, who joined the
company's board Tuesday, is attempting to block any quick sale,
particularly the prized Los Angeles cable systems, by the company.</TE>
<TE>   In a regulatory filing Thursday, Tow, whose family owns 12% of
Adelphia's stock, told interim Chief Executive Erland Kailbourne to
hold off on any decisions until a board meeting Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Tow's filing said the company is rushing to complete a cable deal
by tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia is the target of an accounting
investigation by U.S. regulators because of loan guarantees to the
founding Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has said the family and partnerships it owned used
company funds to finance private transactions without board approval.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases' partnerships borrowed $3.1 billion that was backed by
Adelphia, according to a regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, John Rigas and his three sons have stepped
down from their executive posts and relinquished control of Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Tow became Adelphia's largest shareholder after the Rigases in
1999, when he sold Century Communications' cable systems to Adelphia
for $5.2 billion. At the time, Century was the largest cable operator
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Tow may be working with Adelphia's lenders to delay
immediate payments and keep the company out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Tow would rather work out a new debt-payment schedule with the
banks than sell Adelphia's best cable assets, especially Los Angeles,
at fire-sale prices.</TE>
<TE>   Allen is willing to pay Adelphia $3,400 to $4,200 per subscriber
for the cable systems he is interested in, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Adelphia investors and bondholders are campaigning for Tow to
take over as the company's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne said in a letter to Tow that was released late
Thursday, "No transaction would be completed internally or otherwise
before the board meeting." He also acknowledged Tow's proposal to
become chairman.</TE>

<HD>Partner Tells How He Heard of Policy</HD>
<DH>Courts: Senior Andersen accountant says he was unversed on
company's stance on document retention until being told about it last
fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A senior member of Arthur Andersen's technical accounting unit
testified Thursday that he was unaware of the firm's
document-retention policy until an in-house attorney brought it to
his attention last fall.</LD>
<LD>   John Stewart, the senior partner of Andersen's Professional
Standards Group and a 30-year veteran of the firm, said he learned of
the policy in a conversation with in-house attorney Nancy Temple in
late September or early October.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's policy calls for its accountants to preserve only
records needed to back up their audit conclusion and plays a central
role in Andersen's trial on obstruction of justice.</LD>
<TE>   The testimony from Stewart, summoned as a defense witness,
actually appeared to support one of the prosecution team's
contentions, that Andersen executives started promoting the policy
only after Enron's financial situation started to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said the issue arose as partners debated internally over
what to do with a series of memoranda regarding disputes between the
technical-accounting unit and the Houston-based team auditing Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Lead Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin called Stewart to the witness
stand to detail the disputes and to attempt to shed light on the
intent of Temple, who has refused to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Temple intended to obstruct justice when
she sent an e-mail to the Houston office Oct. 12 urging Enron team
members to comply with the document policy.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he learned in September that the firm's Enron
auditors had drafted a series of memos that misrepresented his advice
on how to treat a set of off-the-books Enron partnerships, and that
Andersen ordered the documents to be corrected to reflect his initial
advice.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said Temple told him that the firm wanted to retain both
the original memos and the corrected version, but not drafts of
either.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the idea of keeping the records from the SEC "didn't
come into my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Michael Jones, a partner from Andersen's London
office, described his co-workers' document destruction there last
fall as part of a badly needed office cleanup, not an attempt to
conceal files from the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the cleanup had been planned for some time, but under
cross-examination from prosecutors, he conceded that he accelerated
the effort after receiving a phone call from David Duncan, the lead
partner auditing Enron, around Oct. 23, asking him to comply with
firm policy. He said Duncan's tone made the matter seem urgent.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also lost a procedural battle Thursday when U.S. District
Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that prosecutors could question witnesses
about whether investigators mistreated them during pretrial
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has suggested that pressure from prosecutors prompted
Duncan to plead guilty to obstruction of justice, and the firm had
argued that testimony about how investigators dealt with other
witnesses was irrelevant to that point.</TE>
<TE>   Asked outside the courthouse Thursday whether he believed Andersen
was receiving a fair trial, Hardin said, "I think this jury is going
to give us a fair verdict."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, posted the fastest
job growth rate of any large U.S. county at the height of the tech
boom, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.</LD>
<LD>   From 1999 to 2000, Santa Clara County added 58,000 jobs--for a
sizzling growth rate of 6.2%.</LD>
<LD>   That pace was well ahead of the other U.S. counties cracking the
top five in the 2000 County Business Patterns report rankings,
including runner-up New York County at 3.9% and Los Angeles County,
which ranked fourth with a 3.1% increase in jobs.</LD>
<TE>   But that was in the good old days before the tech meltdown and
Nasdaq crash, underscoring how quickly census figures can look dated
when the economy takes a turn.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area still is setting job records, only in the opposite
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, San Jose, the largest city in Santa Clara County, had
the distinction of posting the largest year-over-year jump in
joblessness--4.7%--of any metro area in the country, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In April, San Jose's unemployment rate was 7.4%, up from 2.7% in
April 2001. So much for records.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>T.G.I. Friday's, a casual-dining restaurant chain, and CKE
Restaurants Inc.'s Carl's Jr. reached a confidential settlement to
end a dispute over the fast-food company's "$6 burger" advertising
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit "has been resolved to the satisfaction of both
parties," said Narina Singh, a spokeswoman for Santa Barbara-based
CKE. A spokeswoman for T.G.I. Friday's, which is based in Dallas,
didn't immediately return a telephone call.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's in July sued in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
claiming that Carl's Jr.'s advertisements are false, misleading and
unfair competition.</LD>
<TE>   One of the Carl's Jr. ads stated that the fast-food chain's $3.95
burger is "like the burger I just paid about $6.25 for at Friday's."</TE>
<TE>   CKE shares fell 24 cents to $10.21 on the New York Stock Exchange,
before news of the settlement was released.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy Gives Watson Expensive Send-Off</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. Chief Executive Charles L. Watson, who agreed this week
to leave the troubled energy firm, is set to receive at least
$33million more in severance payments than he would have made had he
served out his contract.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy declined to comment on Watson's severance package, which
was described in public documents about two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The contract requires that if Watson were forced out that he be
paid three times the amount of his average compensation in his three
best years, including the projected value of stock options he would
have received over the next three years.</LD>
<TE>   Under the contract that he signed in early 2000, Watson, 52, has
been compensated more than $11million a year, including the projected
value of his stock options, according to company filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Watson also would get compensation he would have earned over the
next eight months, before his contract expires Feb. 1, which could be
an additional $7million. His annual base salary was set in 2000 at
$1.5million, a raise from $1million. He received bonuses of
$4.3million to $5million in the same three years.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's severance package also would include the projected value
of stock options, as much as 3.75 times his base salary, according to
a March 2000 Dynegy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The company declined to say whether Watson, who also served as
chairman, quit or was fired, but directors said his departure,
announced Tuesday, was unrelated to Dynegy's recent problems.</TE>
<TE>   Watson was a co-founder who became chief executive of Dynegy's
predecessor in 1989 and built Dynegy into one of the largest 100 U.S.
corporations, with $42billion in revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Dynegy began to unravel about the time that Watson made an
aborted bid to buy troubled rival Enron Corp. last fall. Dynegy's
stock tumbled further amid questions about possible phony trades
designed to puff up the Houston-based company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   A Dynegy spokesman declined to say whether the board knew about
the severance package when it agreed to replace Watson this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The compensation is a matter between Chuck and the board,"
spokesman John Sousa said. Dynegy has named board member Daniel L.
Dienstbier as interim chief executive and Glenn Tilton, vice chairman
of ChevronTexaco Corp., as interim chairman. ChevronTexaco owns 26.5%
of Dynegy.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy shares rose 33 cents to $8.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have declined more than 80% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Airport Switches Face-Recognition Systems Over Accuracy
Concerns</HD>
<DH>Security: Fresno Yosemite International stops trial use of
Viisage product in favor of passenger verification unit by Visionics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMOND LOCOCO</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresno Yosemite International Airport, the first U.S. airport to try
Viisage Technology Inc.'s face-recognition technology, stopped using
the system because of concerns about its accuracy, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Viisage system was deployed at the airport in October, but it
stopped using the system by January. It was removed by Feb. 1 and
replaced by one from rival Visionics Corp., said Ron Cadle, vice
president of closely held Pelco, the contractor running the airport's
trial of facial-recognition systems.</LD>
<LD>   Fresno was one of four airports that had agreed to try the Viisage
system, which compares the faces of ticketed passengers against a
database of terrorists' photos.</LD>
<TE>   "We started off with Viisage but dropped Viisage and went with
Visionics because it had a higher accuracy rate," airport spokeswoman
Patti Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Face recognition is an experimental technology being tried at
airports in California, Massachusetts, Texas and Florida as part of
an effort to boost security in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. U.S. airports are expected to spend $100 billion on security
in 2003, and Viisage and Visionics are counting on their systems to
grab a share of that market.</TE>
<TE>   "This is totally new news to me," said Viisage Chief Executive Tom
Colatosti after he was informed Thursday of the system's removal by
Bloomberg News. "I'm stunned by that."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Colatosti identified the Fresno site as
one of the airports now using the Littleton, Mass.-based firm's
system.</TE>
<TE>   Cadle said Viisage was notified orally around the time of the
removal but not in writing. He didn't say whom he notified. Cadle
declined to provide data on the relative performance of the systems
from Viisage and Visionics, and said only that the airport got better
results from Visionics.</TE>
<TE>   Colatosti said Viisage received no negative feedback from Fresno
on the system and no notification it had been removed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard that we had a performance problem" in Fresno,
Colatosti said. "The last I heard, they were very pleased with it."</TE>
<TE>   He said the manner of removal was inappropriate and
unprofessional.</TE>
<TE>   Viisage announced a contract with New Hampshire's Manchester
Airport on May 16.</TE>
<TE>   The company news release didn't disclose that the airport paid
nothing for the Viisage system, which was presented by an independent
foundation as a gift, according to airport and foundation officials.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Viisage fell 62 cents to $5.43, and Visionics closed
unchanged at $10.26, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Continental Raises Fares on Leisure Travel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continental Airlines raised most leisure fares Thursday, which could
prompt another attempt by major U.S. air carriers to improve finances
shaken by a drop in travel after the Sept. 11 hijack attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Previous bids to raise leisure fares industrywide have failed,
most recently in April when Northwest Airlines Corp. opted not to
match an increase and forced other carriers to roll back increases to
stay competitive.</LD>
<LD>   However, there is no reason to expect Northwest's response to be
different in May from what it was in April, and going along with an
increase would run counter to the airline's philosophy on fares, UBS
Warburg airline analyst Sam Buttrick said.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe it very unlikely Northwest will go along with this
increase," Buttrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Continental, the No. 5 U.S. carrier, raised published leisure
fares Thursday by $20 per round-trip on most routes.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, has not matched the Continental
increase, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Northwest goes along with the increase, then it would likely
stick, but if Northwest fails to match it [Thursday night], that
doesn't necessarily mean the initiative is dead," J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;
Co. airline analyst Jamie Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   It may take a few days to see if the increase sticks, but
industrywide fare sales mean passengers often are not paying
published fares anyway, analysts said. The last industrywide leisure
fare increase came in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Raising published fares and raising paid fares are two entirely
different things," Baker said. "Raising the latter is considerably
more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Average domestic air fares were down 12% in April from already
depressed year-ago levels as traffic fell nearly 11%, according to
the Air Transport Assn., an industry trade group for major U.S.
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Continental fare increase comes less than a week after
low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines raised fares for all classes of
service by $2 to $6 round-trip on about one-third of its schedule.
Southwest is the No. 7 U.S. carrier.</TE>

<HD>Former FBI Agent Jailed in Stock Fraud Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former FBI agent accused of helping stock trader Amr I. "Anthony"
Elgindy manipulate shares by giving him secret information was jailed
Thursday by a federal judge for allegedly contacting a witness in the
case.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie ordered Jeffrey A. Royer, a
former FBI agent in Oklahoma and New Mexico, to jail after
authorities accused him of improperly contacting and coaching a
witness in the case against him.</LD>
<LD>   Royer and a current FBI agent, Lynn Wingate, are charged with
supplying confidential information from FBI databases to Encinitas,
Calif.-based Elgindy, who is accused of using the information to
target stocks for "short sales"--a bet on falling prices. The agents
and Elgindy were indicted last week.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Kenneth Breen told Dearie that Royer
contacted a law enforcement officer in New Mexico after he was
released from custody Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Breen said Royer tried to coach the unidentified officer about the
case, and the officer contacted authorities. "This is a defendant who
cannot abide by the conditions of his release," Breen told Dearie.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Lawrence Gerzog argued before Dearie that Royer's
only reason for contacting the New Mexico officer was to apologize to
his friend "for getting his name mixed up" in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Royer will remain at the Metropolitan Detention Center in
Brooklyn, N.Y., until at least Monday or Tuesday, when a hearing will
be conducted on the government's tampering allegation, Dearie said.</TE>

<HD>FERC Rejects Refund Extension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday rejected
California's demand to expand an existing case and order electricity
refunds of as much as $11.7 billion for a surge in prices during the
state's power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   FERC agreed with California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer that there are
problems with how power sellers report their electricity transactions
to the agency. But it disagreed with Lockyer's March complaint
alleging those deficiencies are grounds to authorize an extra
$2.8billion in refunds for electricity sales to the state from May
through October 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer sought to extend the time period for refunds in
California's nearly year-old case that seeks $8.9 billion for alleged
overcharges for October 2000 through June 2001. That case was not
affected by the FERC ruling Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general's office had no immediate reaction to the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Under FERC rules, the agency can launch a refund proceeding only
if a complaint is filed within 60 days of the alleged overcharge.</TE>
<TE>   FERC commissioners rejected Lockyer's argument to waive the 60-day
deadline--and extend the refund period by six months--because of
"deficiencies" in the quarterly transaction reports that electricity
sellers are required to file with the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "The reporting deficiencies identified by the attorney general in
the quarterly reports, while serious and in need of correction, do
not invalidate market-based pricing tariffs as lawful, filed rates,"
the agency said in its order.</TE>
<TE>   The state and its two major utilities have accused marketers of
overcharging during the power crisis and pocketing huge profits. The
state was forced to step in to buy wholesale power to keep the lights
on after utilities could no longer afford to buy power.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said the public utility sellers, which made short-term
sales to the state, should file new quarterly reports detailing
specific transactions.</TE>
<TE>   FERC said its reporting requirements for energy companies is legal
under the Federal Power Act. "I do think the legal analysis and the
outcome were correct in this order," said FERC Chairman Patrick H.
Wood III.</TE>
<TE>   The agency previously announced it would require all Western
sellers to submit specific transaction data for 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It also has approved new transaction-specific requirements for all
wholesale electricity traders, with the first report due at the end
of July, a FERC staffer said.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction data requests stem from a FERC investigation into
whether more than 100 energy companies' trading strategies
contributed to the soaring electricity prices of late 2000 and 2001
that led to California blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will deliver to Congress an interim report by the end
of July, Wood said.</TE>

<HD>Foreign Stock Funds Overlooked in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Investing: Given recent gains, Americans could be missing
the boat by shying away, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors have shown a strong appetite for domestic stock mutual
funds this year despite a rocky U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Americans' appetite for foreign stock funds appears
tepid--even as the performance of foreign funds trounces U.S.
returns, thanks to big gains in many smaller overseas markets and the
dollar's slide against key currencies.</LD>
<LD>   In April, domestic stock funds took in $11.1 billion in net new
cash, boosting the year-to-date total to $62.4 billion, according to
data reported Thursday by the Investment Company Institute, the
funds' chief trade group.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, international stock funds had a net cash inflow of
$678million in April, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.4
billion, the institute said. Net cash flows measure new dollars
invested minus redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   The money going into foreign funds this year is 6.6% of the total
stock fund inflow. That's down sharply from 2000, when foreign funds
took in 16.1% of all new dollars invested in stock funds. In the
early 1990s, foreign funds grabbed as much as 38% of total inflows.</TE>
<TE>   Small investors often are accused of chasing hot fund sectors, but
that doesn't seem to be true with foreign funds this year. Through
last week, the average international stock fund was up 5.9% for the
year, while the average U.S. stock fund was down 4.3%, according to
fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Some individual sectors within the foreign stock fund universe
have been rocketing. The average Japanese fund was up 13.9%
year-to-date through last week; the average emerging-markets fund was
up 14.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Though financial advisors say performance-chasing is one of the
easiest ways to ruin a portfolio--because of the risk of buying a hot
sector just as it peaks--some analysts say investors might be missing
the boat by shunning foreign stock funds this year.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. market valuation is still quite high on the world scale,"
said Don Cassidy, an analyst at fund data tracker Lipper Inc. in
Denver. "Even without the portfolio-diversification argument, which
people can and do disagree about, you can find cheaper companies
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Some advisors recommend keeping 5% to 15% of one's total equity
holdings in foreign stocks, as part of basic diversification.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign markets, particularly in Asia, have posted strong
gains this year on expectations that their economies will rebound
sharply as the global economy recovers. The South Korean market, for
example, is up 18% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar's slide against the euro, the yen and other
key currencies is boosting foreign stock returns for U.S. investors.
As foreign currencies grow stronger, assets denominated in those
currencies automatically are worth more when translated into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Though most European markets have fallen this year, the strong
euro currency has cushioned losses for U.S. investors. The German
market, for example, is down 7.7% in local currency terms, but in
dollar terms it's down 2.8%--a smaller decline than the 7.3% drop in
the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for many Americans, "There may be a fear of markets that are
far away and perhaps hard to understand--and that fared worse than
the U.S. in recent years," Cassidy said. Indeed, foreign stock fund
returns lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 in six of seven years between 1995
and 2001, souring many people on the idea of foreign diversification.</TE>
<TE>   This year, more investors appear to be taking an interest in
emerging-markets funds, which own stocks in markets such as Mexico,
Thailand and South Africa. The sector makes up about 4% of total
foreign fund assets but has accounted for 22% of foreign fund cash
inflows this year, through April, according to ICI data.</TE>
<TE>   Along with emerging-markets funds, some major international funds
with solid long-term records are attracting plenty of cash this year.
Best-selling funds include Artisan International, which took in a net
$1.2 billion this year through April, and American Funds' EuroPacific
Growth, which took in $714 million, according to Boston-based
consulting firm Financial Research Corp. Both funds are slightly in
the black year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Stock funds overall continue to attract new money, despite the
struggling U.S. market, because investors continue to save regularly
for retirement in 401(k)s and IRAs, analysts say. Also, more money
has been flowing into small-stock funds and value-oriented funds,
which have fared best this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the total April stock fund inflow of $11.8 billion was down
from $29.6 billion in March.</TE>
<TE>   Bond mutual funds attracted more cash in April: Net inflows
totaled $7.8 billion, up from $6.7 billion in March.</TE>
<TE>   At fund giants Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group, recent
trends continued in May, spokesmen said, with net inflows for their
stock and bond funds.</TE>

<HD>Blue Shield of Calif., Lifeguard to Join Forces</HD>
<DH>Health care: Merger would trim the number of HMOs in the
state to fewer than 20. Some fear reduced choice for consumers,
employers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue Shield of California has agreed to take control of Lifeguard
Inc., a health maintenance organization with about 200,000 members
concentrated in the San Jose area.</LD>
<LD>   The merger announcement Thursday comes only weeks after San
Francisco-based Blue Shield outbid rivals to win as many as 350,000
more CalPERS members. With the addition of Lifeguard, a well-regarded
but financially struggling HMO, Blue Shield said its membership rolls
probably would increase by almost 25% to 2.8 million by next year,
its biggest growth spurt in years.</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms of the deal were not released. Blue Shield and
Lifeguard are not-for-profit entities that were started by
physicians.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts viewed the merger as a sign of renewed consolidation
in the managed-care industry after a relative lull in the last couple
of years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's going to be typical," said Clifford Hewitt, a
health-care analyst at Legg Mason, a Baltimore brokerage. "It's just
become harder and harder for these [smaller] plans to be viable."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lifeguard would maintain its name and operate as a
subsidiary of Blue Shield, the deal would reduce the number of
commercial HMO companies in California to fewer than 20, from about
30 five years ago, said Allan Baumgarten, an independent analyst in
Minnesota who researches HMOs in California and other states. Among
those no longer doing business in California are United Healthcare
and Maxicare.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates expressed concerns about the dwindling number
of managed-care companies operating in the state, saying that greater
market concentration will reduce choices for consumers and employers.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Mark Smith, president of California's Healthcare
Foundation in Oakland, said Lifeguard's members probably will benefit
by becoming part of a stronger health plan with deeper resources.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Thursday, Blue Shield's chief executive,
Bruce Bodaken, and his counterpart at Lifeguard, Mark G. Hyde, said
the merger would strengthen the not-for-profit health-care sector in
the state.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California, which is owned by publicly traded
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. of Thousand Oaks, is the state's
largest medical insurer with about 6.6 million members, followed
closely by nonprofit Kaiser Permanente.</TE>
<TE>   Bodaken said there would be no immediate changes for Lifeguard
members.</TE>
<TE>   The merger would double Blue Shield's membership in Silicon
Valley, where Lifeguard's roster of employers includes
Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM Corp. Blue Shield also would vastly
increase its presence in the San Luis Obispo area, where Lifeguard
has about 22,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde said Lifeguard has been profitable in the first four months
of this year. But the company's latest filing with the Department of
Managed Health Care showed that it lost $24 million last year and
that its assets as of Dec. 31 dropped by more than half from the
previous year to $43 million. Lifeguard's membership fell sharply
this year when it lost 30,000 CalPERS enrollees.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield said it would extend a line of credit to Lifeguard
upon completion of the merger, which company executives are expecting
within two months.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguard is unusual among HMOs in California because it pays its
doctors on a fee-for-service basis, instead of capitated or monthly
per-member fees other HMOs pay to physician groups.</TE>

<HD>Panel Urges Reform of Affordable-Housing Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deploring the lack of affordable housing nationwide, a commission
appointed by Congress to examine the issue recommended Thursday an
overhaul of federal policies to provide more units for low- and
moderate-income people.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which broadly examined housing for the first time in
decades, faulted federal policies for creating too little housing for
lower-income households.</LD>
<LD>   In finding that nearly one out of four households spends more than
30% of its income on housing, the report described affordability as
"the single greatest housing challenge facing the nation." The other
urgent priority, the report said, is raising the homeownership rate
among minorities.</LD>
<TE>   The Millennial Housing Commission, with almost two dozen
bipartisan members appointed by Congress 17 months ago, did not
suggest funding levels or numerical goals for housing. The report
does list 13 proposals to reform or streamline existing
affordable-housing programs and add some new ones. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Provide sellers of deteriorating properties with tax relief,
easing transfers to organizations that could turn the units into
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   * Restructure the Federal Housing Administration, allowing it to
adapt to marketplace changes without approval from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   * Require able-bodied adults who receive housing assistance to
work, allowing them to increase their income so they can move out of
subsidized units and free up housing for other families.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate industry groups generally applauded the commission's
efforts, though most of them stopped short of endorsing specific
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   One supporter was Will Cooper, president of WNC &amp; Associates Inc.
in Costa Mesa, a real estate investment and management company. "They
focused on improving the programs in place, not just making new
ones," Cooper said, "which I think is critical."</TE>

<HD>Japan Jobless Rate Steadies; Prices Drop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's jobless rate held steady in April at 5.2%, slightly better
than expected, but consumer prices fell for a 31st month,
underscoring the severity of a battle to curb deflation in the
world's second-largest economy.</LD>
<LD>   The economy contracted for three quarters to the end of 2001, but
rising exports, on the back of a global recovery and improvement in
industrial output, have suggested the worst may be over.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, economists put a big question mark over the
sustainability of the turnaround, saying the outlook for corporate
capital spending and personal consumption remains weak, while
deflation has not gone away.</LD>
<TE>   "Because the deflationary trend is severe, we must take solid
measures to revitalize the economy," Economics Minister Heizo
Takenaka told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Such steps are expected to include tax reforms to be compiled
before Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi meets President Bush
and other leaders of the world's seven richest nations and Russia at
a June 26-27 summit in Canada. Japan is expected to be grilled at the
Group of Eight meeting. Adding to the pressure, credit-rating company
Moody's Investors Service is expected to downgrade Japan's
local-currency debt rating today by one or two notches.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide core consumer price index fell 0.9% in April from a
year earlier, dropping for the 31st straight month, government data
showed today.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment was flat at 5.2% in April from March--not far from a
postwar-era high of 5.5% in December. Most economists expected a
jobless rate of about 5.3%.</TE>
<TE>   There also appeared to be more jobs available in April. For every
100 job seekers at government-run job agencies, there were 52 job
offers, up from 51 in March.</TE>

<HD>Market Slide Slows; Energy Futures Plunge</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Dow rides late rally to a narrow loss; Nasdaq
gains slightly. Surge in U.S. gasoline inventories roils commodities
trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street on Thursday had its best showing of the week, as selling
pressures abated somewhat and most key indexes closed with narrow
losses.</LD>
<LD>   In commodities markets, energy prices fell sharply after a report
showed a surge in U.S. gasoline inventories. Treasury bond yields
continued to slide, as did the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   In the stock market, the Dow was off as much as 121 points at
midday, but prices rallied sharply in the final two hours. The Dow
closed with a loss of 11.35 points, at 9,911.69.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite turned a 17-point loss at its low into a
7.53-point gain by the close. It ended at 1,631.92.</TE>
<TE>   Some traders said they were surprised by the market's rebound
because the news didn't appear to improve as the day progressed.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the session the market was depressed by growing concern
about a major Pakistan-India military clash and by the U.S.
government's report that the number of workers who qualify to draw
unemployment benefits rose for a fifth week--suggesting that the
economic recovery could be stalling.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are uncomfortable, uneasy, nervous," said Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Still, losers just edged winners by 17 to 15 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 18 to 17 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks may have been helped by lower energy prices. Gasoline
futures fell to a seven-week low in New York, pulling crude oil
lower, after an American Petroleum Institute report showed
unexpectedly high U.S. inventories at the start of the peak-demand
summer season, Bloomberg News reported.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline inventories rose 1.4% to 218 million barrels in the week
ended last Friday, the industry group said. The gain left supplies 6%
higher than a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "We're well-supplied going into the summer," John Kilduff, senior
vice president of energy risk management at Fimat USA Inc. in New
York, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline futures fell 3.9 cents to 73.4 cents a gallon. Crude oil
futures slid $1.09 to $24.67 a barrel, the lowest since April 15. Oil
prices topped $29 a barrel in mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   Also in energy trading, natural gas prices had their biggest drop
in five months after an Energy Department report showed a
larger-than-expected inventory gain.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless-benefits data helped drive more investors into
Treasury securities, perhaps betting that the Federal Reserve will
delay tightening credit this year.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 5.02% from 5.06% on
Wednesday, and now is the lowest since March 5. Shorter-term yields
were largely unchanged, however.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar continued to slump against key currencies. It fell to a
six-month low against the yen after Bank of Japan Governor Masaru
Hayami suggested that the central bank was unlikely to sell more yen
soon to curb the currency's advance. The dollar ended at 123.05 yen
in New York, down from 124.34 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the euro edged up against the dollar, to 93.8 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The weak dollar is depressing foreign investors' appetite for U.S.
stocks, many analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks were broadly lower on fears about continuing
state and federal investigations into research analysts' credibility.
Morgan Stanley fell $1.40 to $44.64, Merrill Lynch lost $1.15 to
$40.76, and Goldman Sachs was off $1.07 at $75.08.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco International closed up 37 cents at $21.50 after rising as
high as $22.50 after rumors spread that Chief Executive Dennis
Kozlowski had resigned. Tyco, which has been dogged by concerns about
its accounting, said the rumors were "absolutely false."</TE>
<TE>   * Among blue chips, Procter &amp; Gamble rebounded $1.73 to $88.75;
Coca-Cola rose 24 cents to $54.39.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense shares resumed their rally after recent profit taking.
General Dynamics climbed $1.25 to $99.80, Raytheon was up $1.70 to
$44.60, and Northrop Grumman added $1.06 to $123.06.</TE>
<TE>   * Health-care services providers attracted buyers. WellPoint
Health Networks gained $2.13 to $74.92, and Tenet Healthcare jumped
$1.22 to $74.20.</TE>
<TE>   * Overstock.com, an initial public offering priced Wednesday at
$13 a share, rose slightly to close at $13.03 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks followed oil prices lower. Exxon Mobil fell 95
cents to $39.35, ChevronTexaco lost $1.10 to $86.80, and Burlington
Resources slid $1.94 to $40.27.</TE>

<HD>GM Joins Top Tier in Quality Rankings</HD>
<DH>Autos: The company becomes the first from the U.S. to break
into the top three in J.D. Power survey. Toyota, Honda retain Nos. 1
and 2 slots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. broke the import auto makers' stranglehold on
the top slots in the annual automotive Initial Quality Survey by J.D.
Power &amp; Associates, taking third place in corporate standings away
from Nissan Motor Co., industry executives familiar with the study
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan's Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
retained their respective first- and second-place positions.</LD>
<LD>   Among individual models, Toyota and its Lexus luxury brand swept
six of the seven truck categories and took top honors in three of
nine car classes. GM brands captured four top car awards, and Ford
Motor Co. brands, including Mazda, topped one truck and two car
classes.</LD>
<TE>   The closely watched ratings measure complaints from about 65,000
new-vehicle buyers during the first 90 days of ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Although the J.D. Power organization does not release corporate
rankings, the auto makers leak the results to boost their images; GM
held a news conference Thursday to boast of its scores.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's results mark the first time in the survey's 16-year
history that a domestic auto maker has made it into the top three
among the major manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Survey standings routinely fuel expensive advertising campaigns by
the category winners although they measure only the first 90 days'
performance and do not differentiate among kinds of problems: A
squeaky glove box gets the same weight as a catastrophic engine
failure.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Power and other market research organizations also publish
long-term quality and buyer satisfaction studies.</TE>
<TE>   GM's finish probably will help the company overcome a decades-old
reputation for poor quality. And with its Big Three rivals Ford and
the U.S. arm of DaimlerChrysler inching up in the rankings, U.S. car
shoppers' image of American cars could start improving, said Gordon
Wangers, president of AMCI, a San Diego County-based auto industry
consultancy.</TE>
<TE>   "But it will take three to five years, because perception lags
reality in matters of car quality," Wangers said.</TE>
<TE>   The industry average of 133 problems per 100 new vehicles sold or
leased in the 2002 model year is the lowest problem count in the
study's history and continues an annual quality improvement trend.
This year's improvement is a 10% hike, the biggest single-year leap
for the industry since 1997, said Brian Walters, product research
director at Westlake Village-based J.D. Power.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer is the real winner" in the industry race for
improved quality ratings, said Gary Cowger, president of General
Motors North America.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Power study is valuable because "problems we see in
initial quality are the same that turn up in the second and third
year" and help predict long-term durability, said Kent Sears, GM
North America's vice president for quality.</TE>
<TE>   In the corporate rankings, Toyota was first with an average of 107
complaints per 100 new cars and trucks. Honda retained its
second-place spot with 113 problems per 100 vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the world's largest auto company, placed third with 130
problems per 100 cars and trucks. The company placed fourth among
major auto makers last year with a score of 146.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler posted a 10% gain for the year to finish fourth
with 141 problems per 100 vehicles--the total lumps Mercedes-Benz and
Chrysler Group vehicles together. Ford, which placed last among the
seven major auto makers last year, moved into fifth place with a
score of 143.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan fell into a sixth-place tie with Volkswagen of Germany,
with 152 problems per 100 vehicles. That represented an improvement
for VW, which scored 159 last year, but was a huge drop for Nissan,
whose score of 145 last year put it in third place.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not happy about this," said Jed Connelly, senior vice
president of Gardena-based Nissan North America.</TE>
<TE>   Though Nissan launched several models this year, its problem rate
was higher than can be explained by new-car glitches, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is too early to pinpoint the causes," Connelly said, "but we
will do it and we will improve."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Terril Yue Jones in Detroit contributed to this

Freddie Mac said. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for
refinancing, fell to 6.22%, down from 6.28% last week.</LD>
<LD>   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 4.76%, down from 4.85%. These rates do not
include add-on fees known as points, which averaged about 0.7% of the
loan amount for all three types of mortgages.</LD>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. reportedly is negotiating with the Securities and

misrepresented its financial performance.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than impose fines, the SEC probably will bring civil
charges that Microsoft failed to keep accurate books, the Wall Street
Journal reported.</LD>
<LD>   A common resolution in such cases is for a company to promise to
follow SEC rules in the future. The SEC would neither confirm nor
deny the report.</LD>

Inc., however, was not among them.</LD>
<LD>   Caldera International Inc., Turbolinux Inc., SuSE Linux and
Conectiva Corp. jointly will develop the distribution called
UnitedLinux and sell it, by the end of the year, under their own
brand names. Previously, each company released its own flavor of the
operating system.</LD>
<LD>   The group hopes to speed further business adoption of Linux by
releasing a single version supported by all. Caldera said Red Hat and
other major distributors have been invited to join. A spokesman for
Red Hat did not return calls.</LD>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s ratings were cut to "junk"
status by Moody's Investors Service, which said the No. 4 U.S. local
phone company has too much debt and may face a cash crunch if it does
not sell assets quickly.</LD>
<LD>   The downgrade affects $26.4billion of debt and comes as Qwest,
which is trying to avoid violating a bank covenant, markets its phone
book business, QwestDex Yellow Pages, for up to $10billion.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's cut the senior debt of Qwest and its Qwest Capital Funding
unit two notches to Ba2, its second-highest junk grade, from Baa3,
its lowest investment grade.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest shares rose 14 cents to $5.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Auto makers may install one of two types of tire pressure monitors
under a compromise between government vehicle safety experts and the
White House.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement will require that vehicles built after November 2003
have a dashboard warning to alert drivers when the tires are
under-inflated.</LD>
<LD>   Auto manufacturers applauded the decision for providing
flexibility, but safety advocates said the rule is insufficient to
protect consumers and was made to save auto makers money.</LD>

<HD>SEC Workers Protest Pay Raise Proposals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>About 200 employees at the Securities and Exchange Commission rallied
Thursday to protest management proposals for salary raises.</LD>
<LD>   A union representing 2,000 of the 3,000 SEC employees has sought a
federal mediator after talks with SEC's management over how to
implement $25 million in funding for "pay parity"--putting SEC
staffers on par with those at other regulatory agencies--stalled more
than a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   The National Treasury Employees Union is seeking about 60% of the
money, which was approved by Congress last year and signed into law
by President Bush in January.</LD>
<TE>   Union officials estimate that SEC management wants to provide only
about 40% for union-represented salaries for the remainder of the
fiscal year but said they could not be certain because management has
failed to disclose how the funding is to be used.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a new pay scale implemented by management this month
that the union says favors managers and supervisors. The union also
said it opposes a proposal for an initial 6% increase because it
would not benefit workers over the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's regrettable it has come to this," Solomon Cromwell, an
accountant in the SEC's division of corporation finance, said at the
afternoon rally.</TE>
<TE>   The rally at the SEC's main office in Washington was often
punctuated with chants by employees carrying signs expressing
displeasure with the stalled negotiations and deriding SEC Chairman
Harvey Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   "Your version of pay parity sounds like the board of
Enron--Unfair," read one sign. "Pitt's pay scale is the Pitts!" and
"No more Enrons," read others.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt declined to comment on the negotiations.</TE>

<HD>South L.A. Still Awaiting Promised Grocery Stores</HD>
<DH>Retail: Despite some progress after '92 riots, access to
quality food marts continues to lag behind other areas, a study
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only about half of the full-service grocery stores promised for a
riot-torn stretch of Los Angeles and other low-income communities in
the South Los Angeles region were built, a study to be released today
found.</LD>
<LD>   After the 1992 unrest, executives with Vons Cos., Ralphs Grocery
Co., Food 4 Less and Smart &amp; Final Inc. vowed to build as many as 32
new supermarkets in the central city and nearby low-income areas with
limited access to fresh meats and produce, according to the report by
the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute at Occidental College.</LD>
<LD>   But, according to the report and the grocery chains, only 18 chain
stores opened in the last 10 years in or near the South L.A. area
initially targeted by RLA, the nonprofit group set up after the riots
to help rejuvenate the area. And several of those replaced existing
company stores and did not increase overall access to quality food
marts in the area.</LD>
<TE>   RLA, formerly known as Rebuild L.A., pushed supermarket
construction as one means to address crucial needs in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But the chains pulled back on building stores, and nationwide
consolidation in the grocery industry in the 1990s was sweeping from
the landscape some chains that had been prominent in the area.</TE>
<TE>   From 1992 to 2002, the number of chain stores in the area of South
Los Angeles hardest hit by the riots grew by only seven, according to
the report. Even with independents opening markets--especially stores
aimed at Latino clients--shopping options in South Los Angeles
continue to lag behind other regions, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows the lack of access [to] full-service supermarkets, and
that hasn't really changed since 1992, even though there was
significant rhetoric and promises," said Robert Gottlieb, a professor
of urban and environmental policy at Occidental, who worked with
Amanda Schaffer, a student who compiled the data, to produce the
study.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly promises were made, but most of those promises were not
kept."</TE>
<TE>   The chain that "made the biggest commitment and did the least,"
said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, was Vons.</TE>
<TE>   In a well-publicized news conference in July 1992, Roger
Stangeland, then-chairman of Vons, announced a $100-million plan to
build 12 or more grocery stores in inner-city Los Angeles and
surrounding communities. Then-RLA Chairman Peter V. Ueberroth praised
the chain for setting a good example for other companies.</TE>
<TE>   RLA had focused attention on the grocery needs in a 52-square-mile
stretch from Wilshire to El Segundo boulevards and Alameda Street to
Crenshaw Boulevard. And it was widely anticipated that the new stores
would be built in or near that area.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Calderon, a spokeswoman for Vons, now a unit of Safeway
Inc., said the $100-million commitment was not just to build stores
in South L.A. but also to rebuild some existing stores and provide
employee training.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the commitment, Vons opened one store within the RLA
target area, on Compton Boulevard in Compton, and a store in a
low-income area of Pomona. The Pomona and Compton stores have since
closed.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 years, the company also abandoned plans to build at
Slauson and Vermont avenues and to upgrade a store in the Pico-Union
area.</TE>
<TE>   "Each [decision] had its own reasons, but basically the issue was
economics," said Calderon, adding that the shuttered Compton store
operated at a loss for years, even after it was converted to a
warehouse format.</TE>
<TE>   "Independents are able to run their stores at more competitive
prices. We pay union rates," she said, adding that the average Vons
clerk earns about $18 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most active and successful retailers in the region are
Smart &amp; Final and Food 4 Less, two chains that appeal to discount
shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce-based Smart &amp; Final committed to opening 12 stores in the
region, according to the report, and opened at least seven outlets in
or near the target area. One replaced a Vermont Avenue store burned
down in the unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Food 4 Less announced plans to build as many as four stores and
opened eight, including some that replaced their corporate cousins,
such as Boys and Viva. In the last 10 years, mergers and
consolidations combined Ralphs, Boys, Viva, Food 4 Less and other
chains under the umbrella of Kroger Co., the largest U.S. supermarket
operator.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs committed to four stores and built two. Today, two-thirds
of the stores in the region are either Ralphs or Food 4 Less,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, whose 8th Council District was hit hard by the
riots, concedes that the region remains underserved. But he was
nonetheless pleased with the progress made thus far.</TE>
<TE>   "You have more stores, and you have better-built stores," he said.
"There's a lot to celebrate, but the grocery bag is only half full."</TE>

<HD>TiVo, BBC Hijack Video Recorders</HD>
<DH>TV: British network uses on-demand technology to foist an
unrequested sitcom on viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>English couch potatoes got a glimpse this month of a high-tech vision
of television, and it was about as welcome as cold eel pie.</LD>
<LD>   Eager to boost its new series "Dossa and Joe," the BBC used
technology from TiVo Inc. of San Jose to deliver the show to about
50,000 viewers with TiVo's digital video recorders. The recorders,
which store programs on a hard drive instead of tapes, can be set by
TiVo to capture programs viewers don't specifically request.</LD>
<LD>   At 10 p.m. on May 22, TiVo recorders automatically tuned to BBC2
and recorded "Dossa and Joe." A link to the program then popped up on
the recorders' main menu, titled "Must See from the BBC 'Dossa and
Joe.'"</LD>
<TE>   This version of video on demand is something the BBC and TiVo have
been working on for two years, hoping to foment "a revolution in
personal television in the U.K.," as the BBC put it. And it's an
approach TiVo hopes to replicate around the globe with other
partners, including U.S. satellite-TV leader DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo owners in England responded quickly, posting more than 1,100
comments on the company's Internet bulletin boards. Although some of
the responses were positive, many viewers were angry that the BBC had
commandeered their recorders in prime time to foist a sitcom on them
that they hadn't requested.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this isn't going to be happening again," wrote one.
"Suggestions are one thing, forcing them on you is another."</TE>
<TE>   Others complained that a show with salty dialogue shouldn't be
delivered to homes with young children, particularly when their
parents had no clue it was coming. Major British papers picked up on
the controversy Thursday, airing the complaints prominently.</TE>
<TE>   In defense of the BBC and TiVo, some viewers noted that no one was
forced to watch "Dossa and Joe." The program was stored on a portion
of the hard drive reserved for promotions, so it didn't eat into
subscribers' 40 hours of recording time.</TE>
<TE>   And if subscribers had something else scheduled on their TiVos,
"Dossa and Joe" would have passed by unrecorded.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Brodie Keast, a senior vice president at TiVo, said, "It's
pretty clear we could have done a better job in the U.K." In
particular, he said, consumers needed more advance notice, the
recording shouldn't have happened in prime time and the program
should have been "family friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Although TiVo has used the automatic recording feature to deliver
short promotional fare to subscribers, "Dossa and Joe" was the first
full-length program to be pushed to viewers.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Keast said, the BBC might have done better with a
trailer for the program instead of the show itself.</TE>
<TE>   "TiVo's always been about both choice and control of the content
you want," Keast said, adding, "For some viewers in the U.K., this
didn't feel consistent with that philosophy." The company remains
confident that targeted promotions that are both relevant and
entertaining will be effective.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, TiVo, DirecTV and Starz Encore Group plan to store
several movies each week automatically on certain subscribers'
recorders. But in this version of video on demand, only viewers who
give their permission in advance will receive the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the reaction [in England] is necessarily damning
the idea of pushing content to the box," said Brad Beale, a senior
vice president at DirecTV. "We will take baby steps here ... [and]
try to make it as valuable and non-intrusive as possible."</TE>

<HD>Lantronix Restating Revenue</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The Irvine company, which fired executive, also
reports two leaving the board.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lantronix Inc., an Irvine maker of computer servers that fired its
chief financial officer earlier this month, said the company is
restating fiscal 2001 and 2002 revenue and that two executives
resigned from its board.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue for both years will be reduced by less than 15%, the
company said in a prepared statement. Board member H.K. Desai
declined to provide further details. Desai was elected chairman today
after Bernhard Bruscha resigned.</LD>
<LD>   Lantronix booked sales as revenue when it shipped products to
distributors. It now plans to book sales as revenue when distributors
ship products to customers, Desai said. The company had $55.2million
in revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and $48million
for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.</LD>
<TE>   The company will disclose the exact amount of reductions in a
couple of weeks, Desai said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said third-quarter profit, announced May 1, will
be restated to include an expense of $1 million to $2 million for
excess and obsolete inventory. Lantronix will file amendments to its
financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Also stepping down was Chief Executive and President Fred Thiel,
who will become chief technology and strategy officer. He also
resigned from the board. The board positions haven't been filled,
Desai said.</TE>
<TE>   Lantronix selected Marc Nussbaum as interim chief executive and
president.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the company fired Steven Cotton, the chief
financial officer and chief operating officer. Jim Kerrigan, a former
Lantronix finance chief, was chosen interim chief financial officer.</TE>

<LD>In case you're wondering whether the Lakers will be eliminated from
the NBA playoffs tonight by Sacramento, Tim Kawakami of the San Jose
Mercury News is adamant the series will be extended to seven games.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lakers will win Game 6 at Staples Center--probably by a
point, since that's exactly how the last two games have been decided.
But the series will be tied, both teams on the edge of elimination.
And there will be a Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   "Mark it down in ink, and tattoo it on Shaquille O'Neal's arm if
you can find room. Get ready for Sunday, because the whole show is
coming back one more time."</LD>
<TE>   Hmm, what does he know that we don't?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the Laker playoff leader in field-goal
percentage with a minimum of 30 attempts?</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time: Eleven years ago, Spud Webb was traded from the
Atlanta Hawks to Sacramento, which was 1-40 on the road during the
1990-91 season. King guard Bob Hansen greeted his new teammate by
saying, "Welcome to hell."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad about it, to tell you the truth," Hansen told Mike
Hlas of the Cedar Rapids Gazette. "What I meant was that it was like
NBA hell, where you were banished to purgatory."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer nut: Gene Wojciechowski of ESPN magazine is trying to get
interested in the World Cup, but.... "I've got nothing against
soccer, except it's more boring than an underwriters seminar and has
less scoring than a post-prom party supervised by Jerry Falwell.
Plus, the hooligans drink all the good beer.... I'd rather watch the
running of the squirrels than 22 folks running around on a pitch. To
me, it's hockey on grass ... without the fistfights."</TE>
<TE>   Is that all? Lennox Lewis commenting to the Associated Press on
his June 8 opponent, Mike Tyson: "He's a cartoon character. He's
ignorant, arrogant and an imbecile."</TE>
<TE>   Tyson was gentler in his appraisal of Lewis: "My main objective is
to be professional but to kill him. That's what it comes to. He
should want to kill me, too, because I want to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   "But I still love him."</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold your breath: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune is
patiently waiting for the White Sox to put together a meaningful
winning streak: "[They] have been threatening to go on a roll for
more than a year, so when [it] happens, it will be something to
behold.</TE>
<TE>   "When those victories start piling up, everything the Sox touch
will turn to gold. The local economy will improve dramatically, and
don't be surprised if dandruff is eradicated. It will be that big."</TE>
<TE>   No high there: Jim Caple of ESPN.com, on how the Japanese will
deal with soccer hooliganism: "Japan is ... discouraging hooligans by
selling only U.S. beer during the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Kurt Rambis, 59.2%.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A 13-year-old boy in Winnipeg was knocked off his
skateboard by a goose that apparently misjudged its landing pattern
at a pond.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned," said Shawn Hacking, who had two scraped knees, a
sprained wrist, a ripped shirt and a red face where a wing slapped
him.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came in," his mother, Kim, told the Associated Press, "He
said, 'I got hit by a goose.' I thought it was some kind of car or
something."</TE>

<LD>Johnny Buss, president of the Sparks, may be fined by the WNBA for
remarks published Saturday in The Times regarding player salaries.</LD>
<LD>   Neither league nor Spark officials would comment Thursday, but
sources said WNBA Commissioner Val Ackerman was "infuriated" by Buss'
comments.</LD>
<LD>   Buss said he would like to see salaries increase by 50%, or even
double. The minimum salary for a veteran is $40,000 a season. Players
negotiate salaries with the league, not individual teams.</LD>
<TE>   The standard fine for remarks by players, coaches or team
officials deemed "detrimental" by WNBA officials has been $500.</TE>

<KH>COLLEGE BASEBALL ERIC STEPHENS</KH>
<HD>Regional Bias in the NCAA Brackets?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coaches on the West Coast have long maintained that there is a bias
against their teams when it comes to the postseason. Perhaps it is
because USC long dominated the sport and other local teams have
regularly reached the College World Series, sometimes playing each
other to determine a championship.</LD>
<LD>   Whether there is any truth to that perception is open to debate.
But the decisions made by the NCAA baseball committee in determining
this year's 64-team tournament have fueled the argument.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford will play host to one of the toughest regionals ever.
Included in that four-team bracket are the Cardinal, Cal State
Fullerton, Long Beach State and San Jose State. The Cardinal has been
in the top 10 all season. Big West Conference rivals Fullerton and
Long Beach have been in and out of the top 25. San Jose State has won
a school-record 45 games.</LD>
<TE>   Other regionals are clearly inferior. Baseball committee chairman
Wally Groff admitted as much, explaining that the committee operated
under an NCAA executive committee mandate to make selections based on
geography to minimize air travel after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at some of the brackets, it doesn't make sense,"
Groff said. "The weight of some brackets compared to others ... it
definitely was different from what we've done in the past. From that
perspective, it's definitely harder."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem isn't the four-team regionals, because most
coaches expected the NCAA to match up teams in close proximity. The
biggest source of controversy is the way the fields for the
best-of-three super-regionals were determined.</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the two California regionals will play each other
in the next round. Of West Coast teams, only Washington and Arizona
State were put in other regionals, and neither is seeded first. Thus
it is possible that only one team from west of the Rocky Mountains
will be among the eight that go to Omaha. And that scenario troubles
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, USC, Fullerton and Stanford got to Omaha," he said.
"Now this year, that cannot possibly happen. When you do that, it
compromises your national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two regionals that contain teams from Florida will not
send their winners to the same super-regional. Granted, eight teams
are seeded nationally and Stanford, the eighth-seeded team, is in the
same bracket as top-seeded Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   But the four teams in the regional hosted by USC--in which the
Pacific 10 champion Trojans and Big West champion Cal State
Northridge are seeded 1-2--should have been placed in another
eight-team bracket. Instead, two West Coast teams, the winners of the
USC and Stanford regionals, will meet in the same super-regional.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Mike Gillespie worries that some teams that reach Omaha
this year will be less than deserving.</TE>
<TE>   "When all the dust clears, there are going to be some pretty good
teams staying at home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Coach George Horton was more blunt. "Maybe they're
trying to assure new blood in the finals," he said. "I don't think
the committee is trying to get the top eight teams in Omaha."</TE>
<TE>   Marquess, whose team has hosted regionals the last eight years,
said it may be better for a team not to host if the selections in the
future are done under the same criteria. He cited many teams from the
West that have been sent to regionals in other parts of the country
and have advanced to the College World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you host if your goal is to win a national
championship?" he said. "There would need to be changes. You would
hope there will be enough flexibility in the brackets in later years.
There's no way you should have two schools in the same conference
play in the same region."</TE>
<TE>   Marquess said the Sept. 11 tragedy is not a valid excuse and that
the NCAA may be trying to maximize its revenue generated from the
College World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been traveling all year," he said. "If it was such a
concern, wouldn't you think athletic directors across the country
wouldn't have allowed their schools to travel? We made $1 million
last year. As long as you're making money, you would think they could
send more teams out to balance the brackets like they do in
basketball."</TE>

<HD>UCLA's Griffith Wins the High Jump</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>The Griffith name took its place in UCLA track and field history
again Thursday when Darnesha Griffith--a niece of the late Florence
Griffith Joyner--won the NCAA high jump title at Louisiana State's
Bernie Moore Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Griffith needed to clear only six feet to win, but completed a
rare double by adding the title to the NCAA indoor championship she
won in March, making her the fifth woman to sweep the titles.</LD>
<LD>   Griffith lived with Griffith Joyner and her husband, Al Joyner,
her senior year at Trabuco Hills High. Griffith was a freshman at
UCLA when Griffith Joyner died of a seizure in 1998 at 38.</LD>
<TE>   Asked about her aunt after her victory, Griffith smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, she knows," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very supportive. Her and Al got me into track, and I've
loved it ever since."</TE>
<TE>   Joyner still coaches Griffith as a UCLA assistant.</TE>
<TE>   After two days, the top-ranked UCLA women lead the NCAA meet with
25 points. Defending champion USC is fourth with 11, trailing
Washington State and Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   USC's hopes of its first individual title of the meet ended when
defending javelin champion Inga Stasiulionyte passed on all three
throws in the finals because of a sore right elbow. She finished
second with a throw of 177 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Realistically, her hopes ended in the preliminaries when Serene
Ross of Purdue set an American record at 195 feet 8 inches on her
first throw.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Angela Williams took an easy step in her attempt to win a
fourth consecutive title in the 100 meters, winning her preliminary
heat in 11.39 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise of the day in the men's competition came when
Stanford's Gabe Jennings, a 2000 Olympian, failed to reach the 1,500
meter final.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech and Clemson are tied for the second-round lead in the
NCAA golf championship at Upper Arlington, Ohio. Washington's Brock
Mackenzie leads the individual competition at seven-under 135.</TE>

<HD>Moving Matador</HD>
<DH>Batesole will take over at Fresno State next season after
reviving Northridge</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Batesole has the Cal State Northridge baseball team back in the
top 25 and heading to the playoffs. As the Matadors prepared for the
NCAA regionals that begin today, the 38-year-old coach got a nice
reward for those feats.</LD>
<LD>   Except that reward didn't come from Northridge, where the promise
of upgraded facilities and a new baseball stadium has gone with the
wind.</LD>
<LD>   The reward came from Fresno State, where Batesole landed a job
formerly held by only two previous coaches--legends Pete Beiden and
Bob Bennett--since 1948.</LD>
<TE>   Normally, that might irritate the school that is losing a quality
coach, or the team that is losing its leader. But at Northridge,
Batesole's decision to go after his "dream job" has been met with a
fair measure of support, even during one of the most important times
in the program's history.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for him," junior pitcher Kameron Loe said. "I
know he really deserves it. He's done some incredible things here."</TE>
<TE>   Batesole and the Matadors have worked a near-miracle, considering
that five years ago, the school shut down the program. Northridge won
the Big West Conference title in only its second season in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   The 15th-ranked Matadors broke a five-year run by Cal State
Fullerton, one of the sport's traditional powers.</TE>
<TE>   At 40-15, they have their best record since 1997 and swept the
conference's major awards, Batesole being named coach of the year and
junior outfielder Eric Verbryke player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a long tradition as a Division II power and a program that
has produced major leaguers Adam Kennedy of the Angels and Robert
Fick of the Detroit Tigers, Northridge baseball has long been an
afterthought in the community. Their dilapidated stadium, Matador
Field, is essentially a diamond with some metal bleachers and a press
box made of aluminum siding. The field itself is browning around the
edges and is largely cared for by the players. There are wooden
lockers in the small clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   But the team has had five winning seasons in Batesole's seven
years since he succeeded Bill Kernen. In 1996, the Matadors won 52
games and nearly reached the College World Series. Tonight's game
against Maine at USC's Dedeaux Field marks their first postseason
appearance since then.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Grant Hohman, who played for Batesole in 1996,
said the program's disadvantages are what drive the coach and the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "The amazing thing is, he likes the challenge," Hohman said. "We
like being the underdog. You've got to like beating USC, UCLA or
Fullerton, the cream of the crop, because they have everything. They
have 11.7 scholarships, they have the facilities, they get all the
recruits. We have none of that and yet when you beat them, it makes
you feel real good."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge and Maine have never met on the field but there is a
connection.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Bubb has been a senior associate athletic director at Maine
since November. He was the athletic director at Northridge when the
school cut baseball and three other sports on June 11, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He also is happy for the Matadors' success.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so glad that Northridge still has baseball," Bubb said from
his office. "If you can imagine, one of the greatest thrills of my
time at Northridge was when the baseball team got the regionals in
1991 and got to play against Fresno State. To be with the team in
1996, it was just a great experience."</TE>
<TE>   Bubb said he had submitted a plan to then-Northridge president
Blenda Wilson to cut a growing six-figure athletic department
deficit. Eliminating teams was only one of the options he gave in the
report and was not his preferred option, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, he lamented the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt at Northridge, that part of my heart was cut out because
we had to cut sports," Bubb said. "It goes against what I thought
were the reasons at that time. I disagreed with the decision but I
didn't say so at the time because I was an employee of the school at
that time."</TE>
<TE>   Batesole said he holds no grudge against Bubb.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the guy who hired me," he said. "We went through a lot
together. When programs are eliminated, somebody has to be the fall
guy. In this instance, whatever the circumstances were, he had to be
that fall guy whether it was deserving or not."</TE>
<TE>   Batesole said hearing news of the program's demise was "like I got
hit with a sledgehammer." The hardest part, he said, was explaining
it to players and their families who had made commitments to attend
the school.</TE>
<TE>   Players immediately sought to transfer. Coaches from prominent
programs across the country called Batesole, essentially to snatch up
his players.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a feeding frenzy," he said. "My phone was ringing off the
hook."</TE>
<TE>   A $586,000 bailout by the state legislature helped Northridge
reinstate the four sports a month later. Public outcry and massive
criticism helped spur the school's reversal.</TE>
<TE>   Batesole, who lost many players and an assistant coach, put his
energy into rebuilding a foundation built through 38 years. Hohman
said hard work rescued the program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Mike Batesole," he said. "He put the time in that summer. I
don't remember a second we didn't go recruit.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on the phone, talking to other coaches, seeing if they
were going to let somebody go. We said, 'We'll take them.' Anybody.
Everybody."</TE>
<TE>   They were able to patch together a team that went 37-19 in 1998.
Supporters still consider that a remarkable feat considering the
Matadors were an independent and had to cobble together a schedule.
Batesole was named national coach of the year by Collegiate Baseball
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hiegert, who coached at Northridge from 1967-84, said he
wasn't surprised that Batesole was able to resuscitate the program so
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to pick up some Division I transfers that could come
in and get to play immediately," said Hiegert, now the commissioner
of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. "He knew straight out
what he had to do to get the program going again.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the program been dropped and he left and they had this long
search for a coach, you would have lost six months of really valuable
time and that program may have never come back to this level.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, they're fortunate to have him."</TE>
<TE>   Batesole deflects much of the credit.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this happened without these kids," he said. "It's about
all the players coming in and performing on a daily basis with
character. All I've done is sat back and watched."</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, Batesole has made Northridge an attractive
place to play baseball again, even with the few amenities. Players
appreciate his no-nonsense, hard-driving style.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was recruited here, I talked to my friend J.T. [Stotts]
and he told me that Batesole was going to work your butt off but you
wouldn't want to play for anybody else," sophomore third baseman Ryan
Haag said.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge Athletic Director Dick Dull, who said he would like to
name a new coach in the next month, said his soon-to-be former
employee will leave a lasting mark.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a remarkable advocate for baseball at this institution,"
he said. "He has an intensity about him that has not been duplicated
by many people that I've met.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to be rejoicing that he was here as long as he was."</TE>

<HD>Ferrero's Win No Fake</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Spaniard wins at French Open despite bad ankle and
opponent's doubts about the injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Usually, if a tennis player thinks his opponent is faking an injury,
it is mentioned subtly or with a bit of sarcastic understatement.</LD>
<LD>   Not at the French Open. Frenchman Nicolas Coutelot turned the
previously nondescript Juan Carlos Ferrero into a figure of
controversy, or at least tried to, declaring Thursday that the
Spaniard was really not injured. The 11th-seeded Ferrero defeated
Coutelot, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, 6-2, 6-0, in 2 hours 53 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Coutelot blamed nearly everyone for his second-round loss to
Ferrero, including the media and French radio in particular ("they're
crazy on radio"), and even managed to bring Osama bin Laden into the
discussion.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course, I knew about this supposed injury," Coutelot said.
"Just look at the way he played today. I'm very disappointed by the
press. I don't understand that the press talks about things they
don't know about. I don't understand how it's possible to say
positively things that aren't true.</TE>
<TE>   "Well now I'm angry and I say to those who made this stupid thing,
it was a lie. It's like you said Bin Laden was dead, it's not true.
We saw today he's not injured."</TE>
<TE>   There was one problem with this stream of random comments.
Ferrero, twice a semifinalist here, really was injured, having hurt
his right ankle the previous day, and would have had to possess the
skills of a master thespian. A group of Spanish journalists saw him
tumble in the final minutes of his practice against Tommy Robredo.</TE>
<TE>   An amused Ferrero took the high road. "Oh great, I got injured and
everything is going in my favor, everyone is going to be [tight]
against me," he said, laughing, to Spanish reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Even though medical examinations showed no ligament damage,
Ferrero thought his French Open run was over Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Because in the night, I couldn't walk," he said. "So I thought
today was impossible to play this match. Finally, with the help of a
doctor, I could play. So much injections."</TE>
<TE>   His fitness was a big story here because of his clay-court
stature. Ferrero won the first major clay-court tournament of the
season last month at Monte Carlo and had been considered a stronger
challenger because three-time winner Gustavo Kuerten had hip surgery
in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Two other challengers looked vulnerable but finished strong in
their second-round matches. Second-seeded Marat Safin of Russia was
pushed to the limit by diminutive Belgian Olivier Rochus, winning,
4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, and No. 4 Andre Agassi advanced when David
Sanchez of Spain retired because of a blister on his left foot, with
Agassi leading, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was getting better as the match was going on,"
Agassi said. "That's always a great sign for me."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, who is playing in his 14th French Open, was reflective and
talked about how his life has changed since he won this title in
1999. He was asked if, at 16, he could have envisioned playing until
32.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's hard to think past your evening date that night,"
Agassi joked of being 16. "It's hard. Look how my life has changed in
three years. How do you ever predict what's in store for you, for
better or worse? To look at something 16 years later, it's an
absolute impossibility.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had me take a guess then, I would have said I couldn't
have, I wouldn't have, and I wouldn't have wanted to [play] when I
was 32 years old."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi was joined in the third round by fellow American Vince
Spadea, who, playing on an outside court, survived two match points
against Adrian Voinea of Romania in a 3-hour 40-minute marathon,
winning, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 8-6. The final set lasted 54
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Another American, James Blake, almost pushed his match to a fifth
set but fell short against Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean on the main
show court, Court Philippe Chatrier.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, in his French Open debut, rallied from a 5-1deficit in the
fourth set, fought off a match point and tied it, 5-5, before the
10th-seeded Frenchman prevailed, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great," Blake said of the setting. "I actually expected
[the fans] to be much harsher than they were. They were cheering when
there was good tennis for me. There were obviously a few 'Allez Sebs'
going on all the time. But I enjoy playing in front of a biased
crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Grosjean eliminated Agassi last year, turning the match around
when President Clinton arrived at Philippe Chatrier.</TE>
<TE>   Next for Grosjean is Spadea, who is this year's Slam revival
story, coming back from the depths of the challenger circuit. He was
ranked as high as No. 19 in the world in September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest point was in September 2001, when he dropped to No.
240.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the top 20," Spadea said, snapping his fingers. "Before
I realized it ... I was in Las Vegas at a challenger and I hadn't
looked at [the ranking] and it was 240. Whoa! That was my type of
rock-bottom situation. It wasn't a good feeling."</TE>

<LD>The world's fastest man took it slow for five months. But Maurice
Greene, refreshed and no longer plagued by tendinitis or leg
injuries, said Thursday he's ready to renew his assault on track's
record books.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, the Sydney Olympic gold medalist and three-time world
champion in the 100 meters, said he will compete in a Grand Prix meet
at Athens on June 10, in seven Golden League meets in Europe and in
the U.S. outdoor championships next month in Palo Alto. He's
considering doubling in the 200 at the U.S. championships.</LD>
<LD>   "My plans are simple: to go undefeated for the year and to break
my world record," said Greene, who set the world record of 9.79
seconds in 1999. "I've been No. 1 in the world since '97. I needed
that long break. I know what I'm capable of doing and I know what I
did last year."</LD>
<TE>   Greene won the 100 at last year's world championships in 9.82
seconds, the third-fastest time ever, despite injuring his left
quadriceps muscle 60 meters into the race. He wonders if he might
have broken the record that day if he hadn't had to pull up.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my coach, John Smith, when I run 9.6 I will retire,"
Greene said. "That's why the Lord didn't let me finish that race
[injury-free]. He doesn't want me to retire."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olympic 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman of Australia, who hasn't
competed since the Sydney Games, canceled her European summer
schedule to be with her husband while he undergoes cancer treatments.
Freeman said her husband, Sandy Bodecker, has a tumor in his mouth.</TE>

<HD>Baffert and Lukas Save Best for Last</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: With a Triple Crown on the line, trainers are
again the centerpiece at Belmont.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The War Emblem-Proud Citizen rivalry has not stirred up Triple Crown
memories of Affirmed and Alydar, or even Sunday Silence and Easy
Goer, perhaps because Proud Citizen was beaten by four lengths while
second in the Kentucky Derby, then he backtracked to third place in
the Preakness.</LD>
<LD>   The Bob Baffert-Wayne Lukas story line has more of a chance as
their horses head into the Belmont Stakes a week from Saturday: two
refugees from the quarter horse ranks at Los Alamitos, Lukas having
won the Belmont four times and Baffert trying to win his second in a
row. The bigger picture is the Triple Crown--Baffert horses were
thwarted twice in a bid for a sweep, and more recently Lukas missed
out when his Charismatic, after winning the Derby and the Preakness,
finished an injured third in the 1999 Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   At Churchill Downs, Lukas trains Proud Citizen out of a barn less
than 100 yards from where Baffert is sending War Emblem, the
Derby-Preakness winner, through his daily paces. Their two colts will
share a plane with several other horses who are being flown to New
York on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, Lukas thought Charismatic had a big chance to end the
Triple Crown drought, but instead Lemon Drop Kid, at 29-1, won the
race and Lukas' colt suffered a career-ending leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Charismatic's chances of winning the Belmont were
better than Baffert's two horses [Silver Charm and Real Quiet in
1997-98] before us," Lukas said, "and now I think War Emblem's
chances are better than either of Baffert's other two horses. The
[front-running] style that War Emblem used to win the Derby and the
Preakness bodes well for him in the Belmont."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lukas and his jockey, the veteran Mike Smith, will not be
running for second money. The Belmont will be Smith's 26th Triple
Crown race. He won the 1993 Preakness with Prairie Bayou, three weeks
before the ill-fated gelding broke down and was euthanized after the
Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they'd try to spoil my Triple Crown if I was going for
one," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 36, has won more than 4,000 races and likes the idea that
Belmont Park can be considered a home track for him and Proud
Citizen, even though the horse and the jockey began the year in
Southern California. In his first start as a 3-year-old, coming off
ankle surgery from the year before, Proud Citizen beat only one horse
in the Santa Anita Derby. Smith, who moved from the East Coast to
California in May 2001, is a seven-time riding champion at Belmont,
where he won two Breeders' Cup races, with Unbridled's Song and
Inside Information, in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Proud Citizen ran the first two races of his career at Belmont,
breaking his maiden by 91/4 lengths in a sprint there about a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This could work to our advantage," Smith said. "It would be a big
thing if I could pull it off."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has grudging admiration for War Emblem, a versatile colt
whose six wins have come at five tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse had a lot of trouble in the Preakness," Smith said, "but
when we got close to War Emblem, he showed another gear."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lukas, "I thought we had a great chance going into the
Preakness, and if he had had a decent trip, he would have done a lot
better. As it was, he ran a super race. You just couldn't spot a
cruising leader the trouble we had in the race. My horse's energy
level has been good since then. The Belmont's always an intriguing
race, because it's the only one run at a mile and a half, and that
makes for a gray area. You always wonder about a horse's ability to
run that far."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug Cauthen, president of WinStar Farm, said that his farm and a
minority partner, Taylor Made Farm, paid $10.1 million for Our
Emblem, the sire of War Emblem.... Pat Day will ride Like A Hero in
the Belmont. Laffit Pincay had ridden the colt in his only four
races.... Request For Parole, fifth in the Kentucky Derby, will miss
the Belmont. He suffered a slab fracture to his left foreleg and,

<KH>MOTOR RACING MARTIN HENDERSON</KH>
<HD>Zanardi Is Inspired by Little Victories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His auto racing days may be over, but Alex Zanardi is piloting a
hand-operated BMW these days, not driving around in circles, but
moving forward in life, despite the loss of his legs.</LD>
<LD>   Zanardi was nearly killed last fall in the quickly renamed
American Memorial 500 champ car race in Germany, only days after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when his car was struck broadside by Alex
Tagliani's. Zanardi spoke with reporters on a conference call from
his home in Monte Carlo this week and showed he can still laugh, or
be introspective--basically the engaging character who won
consecutive Championship Auto Racing Teams titles for car owner Chip
Ganassi in 1997 and '98.</LD>
<LD>   A two-time winner at Long Beach, Zanardi spends his days enjoying
his family and his boat, learning to walk again on prosthetic legs,
and swimming, his new favorite exercise. He prefers the Mediterranean
to a swimming pool, finding it embarrassing to remove his prosthetic
legs around children who "tend to watch you like you were a strange
kind of animal," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "The sea is big enough for nobody to notice a strange human being
without legs going up and down in the water," Zanardi added,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   He says he lacks the determination and self-discipline to return
to racing as a team owner, and that he still has days when he is
absolutely miserable. But he forges ahead, finding little victories,
such as changing a car tire on Tuesday, or recently walking in his
garden without using a cane.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sort of a new life, and every day that I do something
new, it's a little win," Zanardi said. "I am the only crowd. There's
no crowd like when I won Long Beach [in 1997 and '98]. It's still an
achievement for me. It's progress. I am moving forward. I am fighting
and every time I achieve a result, I realize that I am fighting, that
I am improving, so it's a reason for me to smile."</TE>
<TE>   Zanardi holds Tagliani blameless in the accident, in which Zanardi
lost control of his car leaving pit road and drifted sideways into
the line of race traffic. Tagliani's car sheared off the front of
Zanardi's Honda-powered Reynard and tore off Zanardi's legs above the
knees.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had to drop one single tear of cry after my accident,"
he said. "Maybe if I could cry sometime, it would help. I don't think
I am a tough guy, I just have a very good relationship with life in
general and, therefore, I can still see a lot of positives in my
life.</TE>
<TE>   "My accident was just a result of fate. So I wouldn't be scared to
drive again, I would only be excited to do it again. But I have great
resolve behind me, a lot of trophies, is it really worth it to
jeopardize the quiet of my family?"</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of local racers who dreamed of sitting in Helio
Castroneves' car Sunday when he won his second consecutive
Indianapolis 500. Some were at Perris Auto Speedway on Saturday,
which had its Sprint Car Racing Assn. "Salute to Indy" with a 50-lap
main event instead of the usual 30-lapper.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, however, went to Mike Kirby, 38, a Saturday night
racer from Torrance with no aspirations of racing at the
Brickyard--unlike Cory Kruseman of Ventura, who got his Indy Racing
League license last June, or Tony Jones of Garden Grove, whose
father, Bubby, raced at Indy in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a lot better if we were there, but unfortunately, if
you don't have the money to back your name, you're not going to get a
ride, so hopefully we'll get somebody to step up behind us before the
end of the year and possibly run a race or two this year," Kruseman
said. "Unfortunately, my family doesn't own a Brazilian cigarette
company," alluding to the common practice of a driver bringing a
sponsor to his team.</TE>
<TE>   Kruseman, who raced last Friday in Indiana, Saturday in Perris,
and was scheduled to race Sunday in Ohio and Monday in Wisconsin,
canceled the last two stops after being knocked unconscious in a
main-event crash while running fourth at Perris. He dropped from
first to third in the standings, behind Steve Ostling of Corona and
Richard Griffin of Silver City, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a rough night for Jones, who failed to make the main
event because of an earlier crash and dropped from second in the
season standings to fourth, 35 points behind Ostling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in my blood," Jones said. "This salute to Indy means almost
as much to me as the Oval Nationals [run at Perris in November]
because of what it represents.</TE>
<TE>   "When my dad raced [at Indy] in 1977, they took sprint car
drivers, they took open-wheel racers who stood on the gas and had
their elbows out. We had more of an opportunity at that time than we
do now. It's who you know, and how much money you have. We would love
to go out there and have an opportunity to do something like that....
If we get the opportunity to go, I'd be the happiest guy in the
world, but if this is all I have, I'll be tickled to death. I love
what we're doing out here."</TE>
<TE>   California Speedway</TE>
<TE>   California Speedway has relished its role as the host track for
CART's season-ending race, but the two-mile oval in Fontana won't
have that distinction this year. CART announced last week that
construction delays in Mexico City will move the race there from Oct.
13 to Nov. 17. The Mexico Gran Premio 2002, on a 2.7-mile road
course, is expected to be one of the best-attended races in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we could have moved our date to retain the last
date of the year after we started selling tickets," said Bill Miller,
president of the California Speedway, now site of the season's 19th
of 20 events. "At least everyone was pro-active enough to get it on
the table now, rather than it be a last-minute decision."</TE>
<TE>   CART and California Speedway have a contract through 2004, but
Miller is unsure where the series' only 500-mile race will fit on the
schedule beyond this season. CART has indicated that it prefers its
series to begin and end in Florida. St. Petersburg will have the
first event of 2003, and a street race in Miami--added to the
schedule this season for Oct. 6--would be the obvious candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "The positioning of the event between CART, ourselves and sponsors
is to have the season end with a 500-mile on a high-speed oval,"
Miller said. "What better way to crown a champion than with a
500-mile race?"</TE>
<TE>   Another champion who could be crowned after a 500-mile race is in
the IRL. Miller is having talks with that sanctioning group, hoping
to lock down a date for next season that might be part of a 500-mile
triple crown of motorsports.</TE>
<TE>   "Conceptually, [the IRL has] talked about a triple crown," Miller
said. "We're in a dialogue right now. Whether we're first second or
third, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   To bring the triple crown to fruition, the IRL could simply
lengthen races at Fontana and Michigan International Speedway--both
two-mile speedways--from 400 to 500 miles to complement the
Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   CART</TE>
<TE>   New Zealander Scott Dixon, rookie of the year in CART last season
with an eighth-place series finish, has left PWR Championship Racing
to join Ganassi's team, giving Ganassi a three-car stable beginning
with this weekend's race in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   If PWR owner Bruce McCaw fields a single car, which he apparently
decided on when he suspended operation of the car driven by Oriol
Servia on May 17, while retaining Dixon, then CART will be able to
maintain a 20-car field to meet contractual obligations with
promoters.</TE>
<TE>   Off Road</TE>
<TE>   More than 240 racers are expected this weekend at the 34th SCORE
Tecate Baja 500, which will start and end in Ensenada, Mexico.
Motorcycles begin racing at 6 a.m. Saturday when Keith Mayes of
Fresno takes the green flag, and trophy trucks lead the four-wheel
contingent at 8 a.m. when Jesse Jones of Litchfield Park, Ariz., gets
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Late models, super stocks, legends, super trucks and Figure 8s
will be on the card Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway....
Freestyle motorcycle jumping, as well as speedway and sidecar bikes,
will be featured Saturday night at Costa Mesa Speedway.... Children
12 and under will be admitted free at Perris Auto Speedway for
regular Saturday night events in June, beginning this weekend, with

<HD>Langham Leads by Two After Course-Record 63</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Franklin Langham came within a putt of setting a course record
Thursday in the Kemper Open at Potomac, Md.</LD>
<LD>   After his birdie putt rolled past the hole by an inch or two,
Langham tapped in and settled for tying the course mark with an
eight-under-par 63 that gave him a two-stroke lead after the opening
round.</LD>
<LD>   "It was one of those days you dream about," said Langham, who is
seeking to become the Kemper's fourth consecutive first-time PGA Tour
winner. "I drove it good, as good as I've ever driven it. My iron
game complemented my driving the ball, and I made enough putts to
shoot eight under."</LD>
<TE>   Bob Estes shot a 65. Chris DiMarco, Brian Watts, Jay Williamson,
Willie Wood and Brian Gay were another shot back. Greg Norman was
four off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Langham fits the typical Kemper winner's profile. Not only has he
never won on the tour, but he had to play the first part of this year
on a medical exemption after major elbow surgery that had him in
rehab from October through February.</TE>
<TE>   Langham said his elbow muscles got so small during his layoff that
he "could see all the bones" sticking out.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times I was scared," Langham said. "I never got to the
point where I said, 'I'm not playing again,' but I was definitely
scared. It hurt so bad from the stuff I did, like, 'How am I ever
going to grip a club again?' But I was real determined to do it."</TE>
<TE>   DiMarco, the only player in the field ranked in the world's top
10, had an efficient but unspectacular round. He made four of his
five birdies on the easiest holes on the course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie, playing despite a back injury, shot a two-under
70 in windy conditions and was five shots off the lead after the
first round of the British Masters at Woburn, England.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago Luna of Spain and Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands
shared the first-round lead at five-under 67.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Price, defending champion Thomas Levet, Raymond Russell,
Ian Poulter and Soren Hansen were one off the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   With a Los Angeles group making a bid for an NFL team, Louisiana
Gov. Mike Foster said that a new deal to keep the Saints in New
Orleans is dependent only on paperwork from "some lawyers who are
dragging their feet."</TE>
<TE>   On his statewide radio program, Foster said he expected the
agreement, approved by the legislature earlier this year, to be
signed soon.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been lawyered too much," the governor said. "Sometimes,
you have to explain to lawyers that they just have to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Saints' owner Tom Benson, who threatened to move the team out of
New Orleans last year, said his office was swamped with calls
Thursday, asking whether the team still had a deal with the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke with the governor today and he and I both agree that we
have a deal in place," Benson said in a prepared statement. "A deal
is a deal and I eagerly anticipate signing our new lease with the
state and only wish we could have signed it sooner."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uhuru Hamiter, a defensive end who spent last season with the
Philadelphia Eagles, signed with the expansion Houston Texans.... The
New England Patriots signed former Pittsburgh Steeler guard Rich
Tylski to a one-year contract for $525,000 and waived former
University of Texas quarterback Major Applewhite, an undrafted rookie
who signed with New England last month.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Former Michigan basketball guard Jalen Rose, now with the Chicago
Bulls, said he took some money from a former school booster who
pleaded guilty earlier this week to a federal conspiracy charge.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who was drafted in 1994, told Fox Sports Net that Ed Martin
had given him pocket money.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Martin, 68, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder
monetary instruments. As part of his plea, he agreed to cooperate
with the government and the university in their investigations of
improper benefits to basketball players.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me money before, but it wasn't in excess of--you
know--trying to allow me to be rich," Rose said. "You know, it was
allowing me to have a couple of dollars in my pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Martin was accused of illegally lending $600,000 to four former
Wolverine players. Martin said he paid $280,000 to Chris Webber,
$160,000 to Robert Traylor, $105,000 to Maurice Taylor and $71,000 to
Louis Bullock.</TE>
<TE>   Rose didn't say how much he was given.</TE>

<TE>   The Southern Conference voted to grant Virginia Military
Institute's request for an early departure from the 12-team league,
and agreed to invite Elon to replace it. VMI, which is joining the
Big South Conference, will leave the Southern Conference in June,
2003.</TE>

<TE>   Rick Crawford took the pole position for the first time in 132
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races, turning a lap at 150.414 mph at
Dover International Speedway at Dover, Del.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford, who scored his only series victory in March 1998 at
Miami-Homestead Speedway, edged Ted Musgrave and Jason Leffler for
the top spot in the MBNA America 200.</TE>
<TE>   Musgrave qualified second at 149.483, and Leffler took the No. 3
spot at 149.099.</TE>

<TE>   Cliff Levingston, the former NBA player who coaches the United
States Basketball League's Dodge City Legend, was arrested for owing
more than $100,000 in child support, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Levingston, who played on two NBA championship teams with the
Chicago Bulls, was arrested in Dodge City, Kan., on a warrant issued
by a federal judge in San Diego, where the support is owed to a woman
who has custody of Levingston's daughter.</TE>

<HD>NFL Stays Away From Terrorist Movie</HD>
<DH>Football: In 'The Sum of All Fears,' the Super Bowl is
blown up by nuclear weapon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite its long-standing relationship with Hollywood, the NFL wants
no part of the blockbuster movie being released today in which
terrorists blow up the Super Bowl with a nuclear weapon.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the championship game in "The Sum of All Fears" is not
called the Super Bowl, no authentic team names or color schemes are
used, and the NFL is doing everything it can to distance itself from
the project.</LD>
<LD>   "We declined to participate in the movie," said Brian McCarthy,
the league's director of corporate communications. "We felt the way
in which the NFL marks would be portrayed are not in our best
interest. We would have declined to participate even before Sept.
11."</LD>
<TE>   The film is an adaptation of a 1991 Tom Clancy novel in which
terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb at a Super Bowl in Denver between
the Minnesota Vikings and San Diego Chargers. In the book, most of
Denver was destroyed. The movie version is set in Baltimore--although
the game action was shot at Olympic Stadium in Montreal--and the
blast kills thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the filmmakers say the rough cut was assembled before
Sept. 11, many people consider the subject matter all too real.</TE>
<TE>   The specter of terrorism caused the NFL to take unprecedented
measures at this year's Super Bowl in New Orleans. Fans, vendors,
media, VIPs, and even players had to pass through metal detectors and
were subject to pat-downs. Concrete barriers and eight-foot-high
fences were erected around the Superdome, and streets were closed
around the venue. A no-fly zone was in effect over the stadium, and
nearly 2,000 police and security personnel were in attendance. There
were no incidents of note.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has not always adhered to strict standards in its dealings
with Hollywood. In the mid-1970s, the league allowed footage from
Super Bowl X to be used in "Black Sunday," in which a terrorist
threatens to kill fans at a stadium with a blimp loaded with
thousands of darts. That plot might have been outlandish in years
past, but many threats seem more realistic in light of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The league allowed its images to be used in movies such as "Little
Giants," "Heaven Can Wait" and "Everybody's All American"; and
steered clear of less flattering depictions in "Any Given Sunday,"
"The Replacements" and "North Dallas Forty."</TE>
<TE>   Unsettling as "The Sum of All Fears" might be, actor Ben Affleck,
who plays protagonist Jack Ryan, said it would not discourage him
from attending a Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "If I want to go see a Super Bowl, I'm going to go," he said. "I'm
not going to sweat it. 'Whoa. What if there's a bomb at the Super
Bowl? What if there's a bomb at the L.A. Convention Center?'</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk yourself into staying under a table at home, and
then the carbon monoxide will get you."</TE>

<LD>In hockey, it doesn't get any better than this.</LD>
<LD>   A Game 7 to determine which is better, Detroit or Colorado, the
NHL's top two teams during the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   A Game 7 to determine who is the best clutch goaltender in the
world in a showdown between the Red Wings' Dominik Hasek and the
Avalanche's Patrick Roy.</LD>
<TE>   "Both goalies are [dominating]. We've got 15 [goals] and they've
got 13 after six games," said Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman, whose Red
Wings will play host to Game 7 of the Western Conference finals
tonight at Joe Louis Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "You got to be lucky or really in a zone to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   The last time Hasek and Roy faced each other in a game of such
winner-take-all magnitude was in the semifinals of the 1998 Nagano
Olympics. After playing to a 1-1 tie for 70 minutes, Hasek led Czech
Republic to a shootout victory over Canada. Hasek stopped all five
Canada shooters (Theo Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric
Lindros and current Red Wing teammate Brendan Shanahan).</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when it's all over, you can think about [how big a game it
is]," Hasek said about going up against Roy. "Right now, all I'm
focused about is to win the next game. Of course, I face one of the
best goalies in the history of the playoffs, and it's great, I enjoy
it, but my goal is to do anything I can to help win the series."</TE>
<TE>   Roy was not on top of his game Wednesday, and Hasek showed why
Detroit was so eager to sign him as a free agent last summer with a
dominating performance in a 2-0 Game 6 victory by the Red Wings at
Colorado's Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hasek's fourth shutout of the playoffs, tying him with
Clint Benedict and 13 others for the NHL record in one season. It was
Hasek's 10th career playoff shutout.</TE>
<TE>   He made several great saves in the first period, including an
impressive stop on Colorado's Chris Drury and then, after Detroit
opened up a 2-0 lead in the second period, he robbed Drury and Milan
Hejduk while the Avalanche still had time to get back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge pressure but nothing has changed for me. It's going to
be exactly the same [tonight]," said Hasek, who has never played on a
Stanley Cup championship team. "Playing with this pressure is tough,
but it's what makes you feel so good after you win a game like [Game
6]."</TE>
<TE>   Hasek bounced back with a strong performance Wednesday after being
outplayed by Roy in Games 4 and 5, both Colorado victories. Roy may
have looked a little shaky in the first two games of the series, but
he's regained his form over the last four games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really [surprised]," Bowman said about the series
reaching seven games. "We had tight games with Colorado. They beat us
three times, and they have great teams. They won the Cup in '96, and
the other times they've always been strong. They have been strong in
the net since they got Patrick, and he's been a huge factor in most
games."</TE>
<TE>   With so many future Hall of Famers on both rosters, the series has
been a dream matchup for NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. Visiting
teams have won four of the six games and only two have been decided
by more than one goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Like we said before the start of this round, it's simply
unbelievable the amount of skills, the quality of the leadership on
both teams," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said. "That's why this
[series] is even."</TE>
<TE>   Not only has the play lived up to expectations, there's also been
some added drama involving grandstanding and accusations of an
illegal stick.</TE>
<TE>   Roy, who has a reputation for stick-handling mistakes in big
games, had only himself to blame for giving up a bad opening goal on
Wednesday. After making a brilliant save on Steve Yzerman, Roy was so
busy trying to taunt the Red Wings that he dropped the puck. Brendan
Shanahan jumped on it and scored Detroit's first opening goal of the
series.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had the puck," said Roy, who is looking to become the
NHL's first goaltender to win three Game 7s in one playoff season. "I
made a great save on Yzerman and I thought I had it in my glove. I
was looking for the puck. I guess it just rolled under me and they
put it in."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the game, Hasek was scrutinized when Hartley called for a
measurement of the goaltender's stick. It turned out that Hasek's
blade width was fine, falling below the maximum width of 3 1/2
inches. Because he was wrong, Hartley gave up his team's man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We had information that Hasek was playing with an illegal stick
and we were down [2-0] with 1:20 on a power play," Hartley said. "We
thought the timing was right. Sometimes in games you try some things
that work. And unfortunately for us, you know, that one didn't, so
that's life."</TE>

<HD>Albacore Arrive Early and Often</HD>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What does a marine biologist do on vacation? If it's Steve Crooke, he
goes fishing for albacore.</LD>
<LD>   The Southland's most popular saltwater game fish moved within
range of San Diego's day fleet last weekend, signaling an early start
to the season. And Crooke, a Department of Fish and Game biologist
who last season teamed with his son to catch more than 100 of the
prized tuna, was among the first on the scene.</LD>
<LD>   Fishing last Saturday aboard the Cortez out of Seaforth
Sportfishing, Crooke and his fellow anglers--his son is sidelined
with an injury--scored easy five-fish limits on a day when the boat
stopped more than 20 times after jig strikes.</LD>
<TE>   "Prospects for this season are phenomenal," Crooke said, reporting
purplish water at an ideal 61 degrees, and a somewhat unusual
northeasterly current that might be facilitating the northerly
movement of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the albacore are being caught 70-plus miles south of Point
Loma, although some catches this week have been much closer, some
even in U.S. waters.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not experiencing fishing up here like we had down there,
but they're catching some fish and seeing a lot of fish," Crooke
said. "So it could be only a matter of time."</TE>
<TE>   Not Hooked Yet</TE>
<TE>   As Capt. Bill Cavanaugh prepared the Pacific Queen for a Wednesday
night run to the fishing grounds, he said that one of the drawbacks
of having an albacore season start six weeks earlier than normal is
that fishermen aren't ready for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The craze hasn't started yet; I'm really surprised," Cavanaugh
said. "For the Monday trip, which was Memorial Day, I literally had
to get on the phone to drum up people to go fishing."</TE>
<TE>   Cavanaugh drummed up 16 passengers, who enjoyed July-style
albacore fishing, with each jig-strike stop producing up to 25 fish.
They finished with 80, or limits for all.</TE>
<TE>   At the fishing grounds Thursday afternoon, Cavanaugh, who runs
from Fisherman's Landing, reported via satellite phone that his 26
passengers were closing in on limits, with more than 120 albacore and
16 yellowtail on the deck.</TE>
<TE>   The albacore were averaging 15-18 pounds, with some pushing 25,
Cavanaugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Island Hopping</TE>
<TE>   It will take a more substantial influx of albacore locally to get
the L.A. and Orange County skippers to shift their attention from the
islands, where white seabass remain schooled along their shores.</TE>
<TE>   The seabass bite is far from predictable, however. In fact, part
of the game is finding the right island at the right time. After a
week-long lull at Catalina, the focus turned to Santa Barbara Island.
The fish surfaced there Monday and again Wednesday and Thursday, with
one-fish limits the rule.</TE>
<TE>   However, they popped up again Thursday at Catalina. Capt. John
Woodrum of the Pursuit, out of 22nd St. Landing, was all but alone on
the island's back side when the fish rose to the surface in a frenzy.
His 45 customers had to stop fishing when each had put a hefty
seabass in a gunnysack. The fish ranged from 15 to about 40 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The bag limit increases to three a day June 16.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Blast</TE>
<TE>   The season's first hurricane, Alma, swept to the southwest of Cabo
San Lucas this week, bringing high humidity and large swells but
causing no damage and doing little to disrupt the fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "[Wednesday] it was really hot and on the humid side but you could
tell by the afternoon that the hurricane was already passing by,"
said Tracy Ehrenberg, owner of the Pisces fleet. "The air got cooler
and the clouds looked streaky. There were some big swells Wednesday
afternoon but it was much calmer [Thursday]."</TE>
<TE>   Ehrenberg said boats were averaging one to two marlin releases a
day this week, and that anglers were keeping busy between marlin
strikes by catching dorado. Inshore, a 65-pound roosterfish was
landed aboard the Adriana.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Exposure</TE>
<TE>   Their aching bodies screaming for rest and their precious food
supply dwindling, Tom and Tina Sjogren reached the North Pole in
snowy, foggy, below-freezing conditions Wednesday, 101/2 weeks after
they'd begun their unsupported, 483-mile trek from Ward Hunt Island,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Married 18 years, the Sjogrens (pronounced SHO-gren), of New York,
are only the fourth and fifth people to complete the so-called
"Triple Crown" of adventuring, having scaled Mt. Everest in 1999 and
crossed the South Pole on Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Tina, who turned 43 Sunday, is the first woman to complete the hat
trick. She is also the first woman to reach the North Pole without
the aid of dogs, sails or air drops.</TE>
<TE>   In a race against the clock, amid fears that an ocean drift could
push them too far south to reach their goal before their food ran
out, the couple skied 17 hours a day over the last four days of their
journey, stopping only to eat and sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Doubt was a constant companion.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't talk about it," said Tom, 42, "but I know that Tina was
doubting. I was doubting, because it has been so difficult, just
incredibly difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The pole brought relief, but also a new concern. Only one day's
food supply remained and they might have to make it last a week
before the weather clears, enabling an airplane to land on the ice
and take them back to civilization.</TE>
<TE>   The Sjogrens, however, already were looking ahead. Their ultimate
adventure, both have said, would be a trip to outer space.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to do," Tom says, "is go to other solar systems."</TE>
<TE>   No Tea Party</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Mathy of Fullerton had to retreat from an expedition to scale
Mt. Everest last week. The climb was part of Mathy's ultimate quest
to become the youngest mountaineer to conquer "the seven summits," or
the highest peak on each continent.</TE>
<TE>   Mathy, 23, who was part of an Alpine Ascents team that was
successful this week in reaching the 29,035-foot summit of Everest,
was left behind in a village below base camp after coming down with a
severe stomach virus he believes he caught by drinking a glass of
tainted lemonade.</TE>
<TE>   The news couldn't have made his sponsor very happy, that sponsor
being Lipton tea.</TE>
<TE>   Mathy, who has nearly three years to set the record, has three
summits remaining. This summer and fall he'll try Russia's Mt. Elbrus
(Europe's highest peak) and Indonesia's Carstensz Pyramid (the
highest in Oceania/Australia). He'll try Everest again next year.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Pass Tough Test by Beating Sol</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>There were lessons the Sparks had to learn to become WNBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night, the Sparks learned a lesson about being champions.</LD>
<LD>   As in never worry about what an opponent does before or after they
play you. Just expect your game against them to be the best one they
will play.</LD>
<TE>   Miami looked average and disjointed in losing its season opener to
Minnesota on Tuesday. But the Sol, looking much improved, took the
Sparks to the limit Thursday before Los Angeles pulled out a 69-65
victory before 7,320 at American Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika led the Sparks (3-0) with 17 points and saved her
last two points for the most crucial time, scoring a layup with 26
seconds to break a 65-65 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Nikki Teasley had only three points, but she had the game's key
defensive play, intercepting a pass by Sol guard Sandy Brondello with
five seconds to play. After getting fouled by Sheri Sam, Teasley made
two free throws to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Brondello scored 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they would go to [Brondello] at the end," Teasley said.
"She's pretty good at going to her right, but I was aware of that. I
was just trying to read what she was trying to do, and luckily I got
there and made the play."</TE>
<TE>   While Coach Michael Cooper will take the victory, he understands
how much the Sparks had to overcome, including Miami's 37-31 halftime
lead.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the game, the Sparks were caught up in Miami's style
of play, which can best be described as chaotic.</TE>
<TE>   The Sol (0-2) pressed the Sparks at every opportunity. The
pressure caused the bulk of the Sparks' 13 turnovers. "We didn't
think they would do it that much and weren't ready for it," Mabika
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie got in early foul trouble and was a nonfactor. She
played only 23 minutes and had eight points and seven rebounds before
fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime Cooper loudly told the Sparks to "stop panicking" and
slow the pace. The Sparks were calmer in the second half and
eventually built a 54-45 lead with 9:13 to play. But Miami made a
14-3 run to get back in front, 59-57, with four minutes left. The
teams went back and forth until the Sparks nosed ahead in the final
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our ability to work under pressure, offensively and
defensively, was the key to the game," Cooper said. "You've gotta tip
your hat to Miami. We knew they were going to be good but they're
better than that. Once they get [their injured players back] they're
going to be a team to deal with in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 78, Seattle 61--Crystal Robinson scored 17 points at
Seattle as the Liberty (2-1) spoiled Sue Bird's debut with the Storm.</TE>
<TE>   Bird, the top pick in the WNBA draft after leading Connecticut to
the NCAA title, scored 11 of her 18 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 69, Portland 64--Adrienne Goodson and Marie Ferdinand each
scored 19 points to lead the Starzz (2-0) over the Fire (0-2) at Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 80, Detroit 66--Shannon Johnson scored 17 of her 22 points
in the opening 10 minutes at Orlando, Fla., and Dee Brown won his
WNBA coaching debut.</TE>

<LD>As Mike Bibby keeps slicing through the Lakers and keeps making one
big shot after another, one thing many people in Los Angeles are
probably thinking about, besides how to stop this guy, is how he and
his father are getting along.</LD>
<LD>   When the Sacramento King point guard was starring for Arizona and
helping the Wildcats defeat his father's team at USC, the story was
these two were estranged.</LD>
<LD>   All the while, Henry Bibby chose not to talk about his
relationship with his son. But Wednesday he opened up to Fred Roggin
on his KMPC (1540) radio show.</LD>
<TE>   Bibby said the assumption was that he and Mike were estranged, but
that was never the case. He said he didn't want to respond to rumors.</TE>
<TE>   "My son has been in my life the whole time," Bibby said. "He
hasn't stopped loving me and I haven't stopped loving him. That's the
bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   He said they now talk daily, and the relationship is as good as it
has ever been.</TE>
<TE>   As for how he would defend his son, the USC coach said he'd start
a bigger Laker lineup that would include Devean George instead of
Derek Fisher and he'd put Kobe Bryant on him.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike can save up a lot of energy guarding Fisher because he's not
hitting his shots," Bibby said. "The problem with putting Kobe on
Mike is that Kobe would have to expend a lot of energy chasing down
Mike.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't leave him open. He has to be the center of your
attention. I've never seen a better shooter when he's open, other
than Jerry West."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of West, he was on with Chris Myers and Bob Golic on KMPC
later Wednesday. He said it's very different watching the Lakers now.
"But I still can't relax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Walton Picks Lakers</TE>
<TE>   An NBA Finals featuring Boston and Los Angeles would be easy for
NBC to sell. An NBA Finals featuring Sacramento and New Jersey, which
seems more likely, would be harder to sell. The Nets are about as
gray as their road uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton, on a conference call with reporters Thursday, thought
talk about a Net-King finals was premature.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not count the Lakers out, whatsoever," he bellowed. "I still
think they're going to win this series. The one thing championships
teach you is how hard it is. The Lakers know exactly what they have
to do. Sacramento will have to play better."</TE>
<TE>   Let's Play Two</TE>
<TE>   Because NBC did not want to preempt its Thursday night prime-time
lineup, we get an NBA doubleheader tonight. And if both home teams
win, there will be another doubleheader Sunday, beginning at 2:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   If there is only one game Sunday, it will begin at 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's coverage begins from Boston at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   New Host for Finals</TE>
<TE>   NBC announced Thursday that Bob Costas will serve as the main host
during the finals, which would begin Wednesday in Sacramento or Los
Angeles. To make room for Costas, Hannah Storm was moved to the
postgame shows on CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to go off the same way we came on the air with the NBA 12
years ago--with Marv Albert and Bob Costas," NBC Sports chairman Dick
Ebersol said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings Success</TE>
<TE>   Game 5 of the Laker-Sacramento series got a whooping 28.5 rating
with a 43 share in Los Angeles. The share means 43% of the people
watching television at the time were tuned into the Lakers. The L.A.
share for Sunday's game was a 42.</TE>
<TE>   The series is also doing well nationally. The four games televised
by NBC have averaged a 7.4, which is a 9% increase over the same four
games NBC televised during the 2000 Western Conference finals between
the Lakers and Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Western Conference finals between the Lakers and San
Antonio lasted only four games, and only three were televised by NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, NBC is averaging a 5.0 with a 12 share through 29 playoff
telecasts. At the same juncture last year, the numbers were 4.7/12.
Wednesday's New Jersey-Boston game drew a 7.3/13, but didn't win the
night. The Miss Universe Pageant on CBS drew a 9.1/13.</TE>
<TE>   Saying Goodbye</TE>
<TE>   Ken Venturi, CBS' lead golf analyst for 35 years, will retire
after this weekend's Kemper Open. No other broadcaster has been a
lead network analyst on one sport as long. The only person who comes
close is John Madden, who has been a lead analyst on pro football for
21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi's long run at CBS is amazing. But even more amazing is
that he worked as a broadcaster at all.</TE>
<TE>   It's well known that Walton overcame a speech impediment to go on
to become a broadcasting star. It's not as well known that Venturi
did the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   When Venturi, 71, was growing up in San Francisco, he couldn't
talk. He could only stammer.</TE>
<TE>   "I always dreamed one day that I would win the U.S. Open," said
Venturi, who won the Open in 1964. "But I never dreamed that I'd be
able to speak. I still stammer. I'm always aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing was, when I was growing up, everyone thought I was a
very cocky young man. The reason was, I gave one-word answers because
I was afraid to embarrass myself. They would ask, 'Who is going to
win?' It was easier to say me than embarrass myself."</TE>
<TE>   Speech therapists initially told Venturi he'd never be able to
even pronounce his own name. But he was able to overcome his speech
impediment by learning certain exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi says he plans to move from Florida to the Palm Springs
area, where his son Tim and his family live. Venturi's other son,
Matt, lives in the Bay Area. Venturi's wife, Beau, died of cancer in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering Mamo</TE>
<TE>   Mamo Wolde, who became a hero in Ethiopia when he won the marathon
at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, died last weekend. He suffered from
bronchitis and liver problems. His age was believed to be 71.</TE>
<TE>   Wolde spent most the 1990s in prison on charges he murdered a
15-year-old boy in the 1970s while an army officer during a time of
widespread killings and atrocities in his country.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Bud Greenspan knew Wolde well. Wolde was featured in a
segment of Greenspan's "Olympiad" series on PBS in the 1970s, and
Greenspan has only fond memories of Wolde.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mamo Wolde I knew could never have murdered anyone,"
Greenspan said.</TE>
<TE>   Steroid Mania</TE>
<TE>   With Fox beginning its Saturday baseball telecasts this
weekend--one of the regional telecasts will be Arizona at the Dodgers
with Thom Brennaman and Steve Lyons calling the action--Fox's Joe
Buck took part in a conference call with reporters this week. Of
course, the topic of steroids came up.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all known it has been sitting out there a for a long time,
like a black cloud on the horizon," Buck said. "You just wondered
when it will break."</TE>
<TE>   HBO's "Real Sports" addressed the topic in October 2000. In the
piece, Gary Sheffield said six or seven players per team were using
steroids. But for some reason it has taken Jose Canseco and Ken
Caminiti to bring the problem to the forefront.</TE>
<TE>   Caminiti, who talked about steroid use during an interview with
Sports Illustrated, spoke for the first time since on Thursday, first
appearing on Jim Rome's radio show, then Dan Patrick's.</TE>
<TE>   Caminiti told Rome he was simply going to talk about life after
baseball in the interview with SI.</TE>
<TE>   "And they turned it into this whole steroid thing," said Caminiti,
who backed away from his assertion that 50% of major league players
use steroids. "I never knew the interview was going to go like that.
It just got ugly."</TE>

<HD>Portugal Will Present New Experience for Defenders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The United States opens against Portugal on Wednesday and the
American players are gradually coming to grips that they will be
facing a team that has an outside chance of winning the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Defender Eddie Pope said Thursday that the U.S. players will have
to cover for each other if they are to contain the likes of Pauleta,
Luis Figo, Rui Costa and Sergio Conceicao.</LD>
<LD>   "We know Portugal has a lot of great players," he said. "We know
Pauleta plays well with his back to the goal, and he obviously is a
good finisher. So we know it's going to be difficult and that they
are a great team.</LD>
<TE>   "As a defender going into games like these, you know things are
going to happen that you aren't normally used to and it's how you
deal with those things that can determine how you do in the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. coaches have been scouting Portugal for months and
studying videotape by the hour. So far, they haven't found any cracks
in the armor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you observe a team of Portugal's quality, you aren't going
to see too many weaknesses," said Coach Bruce Arena. "There are a lot
of strengths. We are well aware of that.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we will prepare our team accordingly. They have a
great team and I know they have aspirations of winning this World
Cup, so it will be interesting to see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In its final warm-up game, the U.S. was defeated by the
Netherlands, a team that failed to qualify for the World Cup when it
finished behind Portugal and Ireland in its qualifying group.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. winger Earnie Stewart, who has played in the Dutch league for
more than a dozen years, knows what it took for the Portuguese to
oust the Dutch.</TE>
<TE>   "They beat them once and tied them the second time," he said.
"They have an overall good team. It's probably one of the easiest
games we play, though, because they are the favorites [and] we are
the underdogs, and anything can happen from there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An MRI test done on goalkeeper Kasey Keller's left elbow Thursday
was negative and the injury he suffered in training Wednesday has
been described as a bruise.</TE>
<TE>   Arena said it might affect his choice of starting goalkeeper,
however, with Brad Friedel perhaps getting the nod.</TE>
<TE>   "If one is injured and less than 100% and the other is not, then,
yes, it would have an impact on the selection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. players had no plans, as a team, to watch today's opening
game between defending champion France and Senegal, and Arena said it
was up to them to decide which matches, if any, they would watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have control over that," he said. "Sometimes the other
games conflict with what we're doing. But I think a lot of our
players are very interested to see how the other groups fare and
they'll be watching a lot of soccer over the coming weeks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eleven U.S. players and Arena visited the demilitarized zone
between South Korea and North Korea at Panmunjom, Korea.</TE>
<TE>   A traveling party of 23 landed by helicopter on a baseball field
at U.S. Army Camp Liberty Bell, where 300 American soldiers are
stationed, a short distance from the DMZ. Some of the soldiers said
they planned to attend first-round games involving the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Fisher's Play Leaves Lakers on the Floor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It used to be that Derek Fisher hitting the floor was a good thing
for the Lakers. It meant he had drawn another charge, or come up with
another loose ball. It inspired his teammates.</LD>
<LD>   As he lay there on the Arco Arena court Tuesday night,
body-checked by a screening Chris Webber, it was a symbol of all
that's gone wrong for the Lakers. Mike Bibby, the most regal of the
Sacramento Kings, was wide open for a game-winning jump shot. Fisher
was helpless to do anything about it.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were suddenly down, trailing, 3-2, in the Western
Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   Fisher has provided minimal help to the Lakers' cause. The guy
driving the team bus has been more valuable.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Fisher will be the most important player on the court
in Game 6 tonight. (And when we say "on the court" we're talking
figuratively.)</TE>
<TE>   If he can stay in front of Bibby, Bibby won't be able to attack
the basket and draw fouls on Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   If he can guard Bibby, Kobe Bryant won't have to assume those
duties and put himself at risk of foul trouble and/or fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   And if Fisher can knock down shots he'll provide the extra scoring
punch the Lakers desperately need, besides making space for O'Neal
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Despite whatever toe, ankle or stomach problems afflict O'Neal and
Bryant, they're still going to find a way to score 50 points between
them. That's what they've done on average in the playoffs, and that's
why they aren't Coach Phil Jackson's primary concern.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm expecting team play," Jackson said. "I don't care whether
Shaq gets 30 or Kobe gets 30. We have to play with a team attitude
out there. If [the Kings are] clogging the lane against Shaq, we need
to have players step up and hit shots."</TE>
<TE>   That means Devean George and Lindsey Hunter and anybody else
Jackson sends in from the bench. But more than anything else, it
means Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   He is shooting 26% (13 for 50) in the series, 16.7% (four for 24)
from three-point range, continuing a trend that began in the second
round against San Antonio. Bibby, who is primarily Fisher's defensive
responsibility, has outscored him, 107-36.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like if I'm playing even halfway better than I have at
this point, we probably would have won a couple of these games that
we lost," Fisher said. "I'm extremely disappointed that I haven't
been able to do more to help us win. I'm going out there and I'm
trying my hardest. It's just not coming together right now."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Fisher looks straight ahead or directly at the reporter
when he answers questions. His eyes darted all over the place as he
talked in the Laker locker room after Game 5. Nothing about him looks
the same as the guy who made 15 of 20 three-point shots in the
conference finals against San Antonio last year.</TE>
<TE>   The fashionable thing to say a year ago was that Fisher's return
from foot surgery on March 13 ignited the Lakers' championship run.
He returned their focus to defense, and he provided another outside
shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's success is actually a big reason for this year's
disappointment. Teams respect his shot and aren't willing to give him
the open looks anymore. They'll run at him, forcing him to rush the
shot or dribble and pull up or drive to the basket. Those aren't his
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been different," Fisher said. "I've tried to make the
adjustment. It's been tough. It's definitely been something that has
been a big-time learning experience for me, figuring out ways to get
shots off."</TE>
<TE>   Another surgery on the right foot forced him to sit through the
summer and the first 12 games of the 2001-02 season. The NBA catches
up to players' strengths and exposes their weaknesses quickly, and
without that extra practice time he hasn't been able to stay ahead.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates haven't abandoned Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   "We still talk to him," forward Rick Fox said, laughing, as if
that might not be an option.</TE>
<TE>   They tell him to keep on shooting. They encourage him to work
Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "Just don't let [Bibby] go left," Fox said. "That's his comfort
zone."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher also gets advice from his older brother, former NBA player
Duane Washington. Washington played in Germany this year, but caught
most of Derek's games on satellite and has seen every game since he
returned to the United States two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Washington taught Fisher how to play when little Derek insisted on
following him around when they were kids in Little Rock, Ark. Even
though Fisher went on to greater success in the NBA--Washington
played briefly with the Clippers and the New Jersey Nets--he still
listens to his older brother's advice.</TE>
<TE>   Washington said his message to Fisher was: "Stay within yourself
and just stay positive. You know what it took to get you to this
point, don't waver now. Keep working. We've been workers all our
life."</TE>
<TE>   So there was Fisher, the last man on the court after Laker
practice Wednesday. While O'Neal and Fox sat on giant plastic
exercise balls and talked to reporters, as Bryant strolled through in
his yellow shades, Fisher shot free throws and tried to regain his
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still confident I can help this team win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He and his brother have said they are eager to finally have a
surgery-free summer with a chance to work on his game. If Fisher
can't get something done right now, they'll get their chance next
week.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Capitalize on Opportunity, 5-4</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having already erased a four-run deficit, the Baltimore Orioles came
tantalizingly close to taking the lead in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   Given the same opportunity in the ninth, the Seattle Mariners
cashed in.</LD>
<LD>   Desi Relaford scored the tiebreaking run on a double by Jeff
Cirillo, giving the Mariners a 5-4 victory Thursday night at
Baltimore.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle went up 4-0 in the second inning against Scott Erickson,
but Baltimore used home runs by Jeff Conine and Brook Fordyce to draw
even.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners then earned their 18th win in 20 games against the
Orioles by scoring a run in the ninth off Jorge Julio (2-3). Relaford
led off with a single, took second on a sacrifice and stole third
before Cirillo lined a double to left.</TE>
<TE>   "We can beat you with the long ball, we can beat you with the
stolen base, we can beat you with strong pitching," Relaford said.
"Tonight we did the little things in the last inning to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles failed to convert a similar opportunity a half-inning
earlier, and it cost them.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 4-all, Brian Roberts opened the Baltimore eighth
with double and took third on a sacrifice. But Shigetoshi Hasegawa
struck out Tony Batista and Arthur Rhodes (3-1) retired Jay Gibbons
on a grounder.</TE>
<TE>   "They executed in the ninth and we didn't. That's the story of the
game," Oriole Manager Mike Hargrove said. "We just didn't put the
ball in play when we should have."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Oakland 3--Greg Vaughn hit a game-winning double in
the 13th inning at St. Petersburg, Fla., as the Devil Rays ended a
seven-game losing streak against the Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Johnson doubled off Chad Bradford leading off the 13th.
Vaughn--who began the game hitting .120, lowest among major-league
regulars--followed with his second run-scoring hit of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 11, Detroit 7--Ellis Burks and Jim Thome each homered
twice and drove in four runs at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 20th career two-homer game for Burks and Thome, who hit
the Indians' first consecutive homers of the season in the second
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Thome hit his 13th homer in the fourth. The 463-foot, three-run
shot off Jose Lima (1-3) gave the Indians a 10-6 lead.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Scouts Targeting Talent, Not Need</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels' minor league system is stocked with pitching prospects,
thin in hitting prospects and almost devoid of power-hitting
prospects. However, of the six players the Angels have identified as
targets for their first-round selection in Tuesday's draft, scouting
director Donny Rowland said four are pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, any club that drafts for need in the first round runs the
risk of not taking a quality player. That can be dangerous," Rowland
said. "While we would love to have a position player there ready for
us, we're still going to approach it in the first round as taking the
best available player. Need is something we can address after the
first round."</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have the 13th pick, so any or all of their targets
could be taken before they make their selection. Rowland confirmed
that Cypress High infielder Scott Moore is one of the players under
consideration but declined to identify the others.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels are believed to have worked out University of British
Columbia left-hander Jeff Francis. They might also consider Rancho
Bernardo High left-hander Cole Hamels, right-hander Chris Gruler of
Liberty High in the San Francisco Bay Area, University of North
Carolina infielder Russ Adams and two Florida high school players,
right-hander Zack Greinke and third baseman-outfielder Matt Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' longest trip of the season could get a little longer.
The most likely dates to make up the recent rainout in Detroit appear
to be June 17 and Aug. 5. If the makeup date is June 17, the Angels
would play 15 games on a 14-day trip, including games on three
consecutive days at Dodger Stadium, at Detroit and at St. Louis. If
the makeup date is Aug. 5, the Angels would play on three consecutive
days in Anaheim, in Detroit and in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The teams have discussed making up the game when the Tigers visit
Anaheim Aug. 12-15, but major league officials are reluctant to allow
the Angels the competitive advantage of an extra home game in a year
they could contend for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Benji Gil rejoined the Angels after hitting .412 on a
six-game rehabilitation assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gil: "I'm a better triple-A hitter than I thought."</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Could Be Next on Firing Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It appears the Tampa Bay Devil Rays might be next on Commissioner Bud
Selig's hit list.</LD>
<LD>   During Wednesday's meeting of baseball owners in Chicago, some
owners wondered where the sport's contraction plan was headed after
Selig's decision to attempt to settle a lawsuit by guaranteeing the
Minnesota Twins' existence through the 2003 season.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota and Montreal were the two teams Selig attempted to
eliminate last winter, only to be blocked by a court order that
forced the Twins to honor their lease at the Metrodome.</LD>
<TE>   Several owners, among them Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White
Sox, John Moores of the San Diego Padres and Stan Kasten of the
Atlanta Braves, spoke during the meeting and asked what was next,
according to two high-ranking officials in baseball who attended the
session and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to find a new partner," one of the officials
quoted Selig as saying.</TE>
<TE>   During his April 9 testimony in the grievance against contraction
by the players' association, Selig was asked what team would replace
the Twins on his contraction list, one of the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said that the Devil Rays were next.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger and Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton, a broadcaster
for the Atlanta Braves, will have surgery next week to remove a
growth on his left kidney. Doctors will not be able to determine if
it is malignant until a biopsy after its removal. Sutton, 57, will
miss at least three weeks of broadcasting.... Reliever Jeff Shaw and
the Cincinnati Reds have ended discussions without reaching
agreement, meaning the former Dodger closer will remain retired.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Roberts Will Be Left Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona's Randy Johnson will open a three-game series against the
Dodgers tonight, which means center fielder Dave Roberts will be
right where he's been the previous 12 times a left-hander has started
against the Dodgers this season: On the bench.</LD>
<LD>   The leadoff batter is hitting .320 with a .415 on-base percentage,
23 runs, 20 walks and a team-leading 14 stolen bases in 39 games,
infusing the Dodgers with a top-of-the-order energy they've lacked
for several years, but Manager Jim Tracy is not about to break up his
center-field platoon of Roberts and Marquis Grissom.</LD>
<LD>   Not when Grissom is batting .300 with six homers--two of them
against Johnson in Bank One Ballpark on Sunday--seven doubles and 20
runs batted in, and the Dodgers are 10-2 against left-handed
starters.</LD>
<TE>   And not when a shared center-field position has produced a .319
average, seven homers, 29 RBIs, 16 stolen bases, a .393 on-base
percentage, 26 walks and only 30 strikeouts in 52 games.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Dodger center fielders--primarily Grissom and Tom
Goodwin--hit .236 with 19 homers, 70 RBIs, 27 stolen bases, a .282
on-base percentage, 39 walks and 145 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like what we have in center field," Tracy said. "We're
not sacrificing anything defensively [when Grissom starts], we're
keeping the outfield rotation sharp, and with the stroke Roberts is
having, all it takes is to get carried away, play him against a lefty
with a nasty slider, and all of a sudden he's jumping at pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had a .205 career average (8 for 39) against left-handers
before this season and has four hits in nine at-bats (.444) against
lefties in 2002. He thinks he can hit left-handers and would like to
be a full-time player, but having been slowed by a sore quadriceps
for much of May, he admits the current arrangement is best.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, if given the opportunity [to start against left-handers],
I'll be ready, but this keeps you fresh," Roberts said. "As much as
I'd like to be in the lineup every day, I kind of get a reprieve
because my quad is still not 100%. The day a lefty throws is a day to
recover. Plus, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Marquis deserves his
at-bats, and he's played well."</TE>
<TE>   Could Roberts evolve into a full-time player?</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'd be OK at it," Tracy said, "but I also think it
doesn't hurt to give this guy a day to recharge his battery. His game
is his legs, his energy, that's the special entity he brings to the
club, and to give him a chance to recharge is good for the team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After opening the season with only nine wins in their first 19
home games, the Dodgers have won six of their last seven in Dodger
Stadium. Their success can be attributed at least in part to the
competition--the last seven home games have been against Montreal and
Milwaukee--but Roberts believes the Dodgers have elevated their play
at home too.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team, we realized what the problem was--we didn't have much
energy or intensity at home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Jesse Orosco was activated off the disabled list
Wednesday after missing 15 days because of a strained left rib-cage
muscle, but the left-hander will no longer participate in one of his
favorite daily activities--batting practice. Orosco, 45, hurt himself
hitting three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To commemorate the 61st anniversary of his death, Lou Gehrig's
farewell speech will be read by entertainer Chris Rock during pregame
ceremonies in Dodger Stadium on Saturday. Major League Baseball has
designated June 1 as Project ALS Day, and to raise awareness of
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's
Disease, celebrities will recite the famous words of Gehrig's
"luckiest man on the face of the earth" address in stadiums around
the country.... Left-hander Terry Mulholland, out since May 4 because
of back spasms, will throw a simulated game today and hopes to be
activated by early next week.</TE>

<HD>Solomon Proves a Wise Choice in 800</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turns out James Trettin has an eye for talent.</LD>
<LD>   Trettin, a junior distance runner at Northern Colorado, was a
two-time Los Padres League champion in the boys' 800 and 1,600 meters
at Lompoc Cabrillo High.</LD>
<LD>   It was during his senior season that he told Cabrillo Coach Jesse
Davis that freshman Duane Solomon was capable of becoming a superb
800 runner.</LD>
<TE>   "He said, 'Coach, this is a guy who can run with me [in
practice],'" Davis said. "'You should think about having him run the
800.'"</TE>
<TE>   Solomon had been competing in the long jump, triple jump and high
jump, but clocked a promising 2 minutes 5 seconds in the 800 by
season's end.</TE>
<TE>   He lowered his career best to 1:55.6 last year and placed second
in the Southern Section Division III final. But few people would have
predicted him to be among the favorites entering this year's state
championships, which begin today at Cerritos College.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goals this season were to get to the [Southern Section]
Masters Meet and to run 1:53," Davis said of the smooth-striding
6-foot-2, 152-pound Solomon. "But when he ran [1:52.38] a couple of
weeks ago, that got [us] to focus on the state championships."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon had a season best of 1:55.87 entering the Southern Section
divisional championships at Cerritos College on May 18, but became a
state-title contender when he won the Division III title in 1:52.38.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Masters Meet at Cerritos College last Friday when he
broke away from a high-quality field with 200 meters left and held
off a late charge by senior Kyle Sunderland of Etiwanda to win in
1:52.84.</TE>
<TE>   "That was gigantic," Davis said. "There were a lot of questions
asked about him after he ran 1:52 [at the Division III final]. He
basically did that on his own. He was running against the clock. So
there were some questions about how he would handle things in a race
the caliber of the Masters Meet."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, who is undefeated this season, did just fine. He
maintained contact with the leaders for the first lap, moved up on
the backstretch of the second lap and surged into the lead entering
the final turn.</TE>
<TE>   The unassuming Solomon lacks the big-race experience of fellow
competitors such as Sunderland, senior Beau Bettinger of Castro
Valley, the state leader at 1:52.34, and senior Eric Gifford of
Exeter. But he likes his chances entering the state meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to it," he said. "I just want to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The boys' team championship could be decided in the 1,600 relay,
the final event of the meet, as contenders Bakersfield, Woodland
Hills Taft and Long Beach Poly each have strong entrants in that
race.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield will be led by junior Thomas Mack, the favorite in the
110 high hurdles and 300 intermediates. Taft tops the state list in
the 400 relay and is second in the 1,600 relay. Long Beach Poly is
second in the 400 relay and first in the 1,600 relay.</TE>
<TE>   In the girls' meet, Long Beach Poly is favored to win its second
consecutive title with its strongest challenge expected to come from
Riverside North.</TE>
<TE>   Senior hurdler Tunisia Johnson and sophomore sprinter Shalonda
Solomon are expected to lead Poly.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Chaunte Howard of North is favored to win her second
consecutive title in the high jump and contend for championships in
the long jump and triple jump.</TE>

<LD>Those who enjoyed Thursday's scintillating California Sire Stakes,
won by favored Gobi Dan, are in luck.</LD>
<LD>   After the 3-year-old boys had their day in the sun at Hollywood
Park, the filly version of the same stakes will be run tonight.</LD>
<LD>   A field of six California-breds, including two maidens, will run
for a $100,000 purse, probably more than any of them are worth.</LD>
<TE>   The favorite will be Super High, a daughter of High Brite who has
been 1-2-3 in five of six for owner John Harris and trainer Carla
Gaines.</TE>
<TE>   Second as the 7-5 favorite in the $200,000 Melair Stakes to
longshot Ladylore, Super High, who will be ridden by Chris McCarron,
will be making her first start on turf in the 1 1/16-mile race, which
is the second on this evening's card.</TE>
<TE>   Kingdom Bound is the only entrant in the field coming off a
victory. Owned by a partnership that includes the Hat Ranch, the In
Excess filly beat maidens by 3 1/2 lengths on May 25.</TE>
<TE>   She gets the hot rider in Patrick Valenzuela and is the one to
catch as she tries turf for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the field are Shalini, who was fourth in her only other
race on the grass, Bob's Lady and maidens Mad River Magic and
Sharsanna.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the program, Fit For A King will try for his 16th win in
his 30th start when he takes on nine opponents in the seventh, a
$51,000 optional claimer at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bluesthestandard, who has won six of nine, will
try to end a two-race losing streak in the fifth at Hollywood Park.
Trained by Mark Glatt, the 5-year-old gelding has won three of four
in Inglewood and is one for one with Laffit Pincay, who will be
aboard in the $20,000 claimer at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Wesley Ward. The trainer began the week a combined 18
for 64 at Hollywood Park and Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: James Li. The Bay Meadows-based trainer is winless in
22 tries in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Special Matter and Pool
Music in the first, Shalini and Super High in the second and Secret
Spot, Benderosa and Chill In Paris in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/71. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7/$411.80. Total money bet: $466.</TE>

<LD>The Kings tried to say the right things Thursday, doing their best to
temper their bubbling enthusiasm on the eve of the biggest game for
the franchise in more than 50 years, since it was located in
Rochester, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Needing one victory to end the Lakers' season, the Kings spoke in
confident terms. The Kings made it clear they want to end the series
tonight in Game 6 at Staples Center and await the winner of the
Eastern Conference finals between the New Jersey Nets and Boston
Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   "Our confidence level, our belief in ourselves all along has put
us in a situation where we think we can beat them," center Vlade
Divac said. "It's no different going down there for Game 6."</LD>
<TE>   Added swingman Hedo Turkoglu: "We're going to get it done down
there in front of their fans, in front of their people. It's going to
be fun."</TE>
<TE>   Backup center Scot Pollard put it this way: "If we play Kings
basketball, that's going to be good enough to beat the Lakers. If we
continue to attack them offensively and defensively, I think we'll
win."</TE>
<TE>   The last thing the Kings want is to perform a belly flop tonight
and be forced to fend off the Lakers in a winner-takes-all Game 7 on
Sunday at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to try to win this one," Coach Rick Adelman said. "You
have to win. You have to beat them [the Lakers]. I think this team
[the Kings] has that mentality. You can't assume that because you've
got another game at home that it's a lock."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what preparations he might make for a Game 7, Adelman began
to answer, then cut himself off.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even want to think about a seventh game," he said.
"There's no momentum for a seventh game. There's no momentum right
now. The teams are too close. When you get to a seventh game, you
throw it all out there."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Mike Bibby said he believes the Kings have a slight
advantage over the Lakers entering Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence in ourselves," he said. "I think
we've played better on the road than we have at home. We've played

<TE>   Adelman has twice in his NBA coaching career had a chance to knock
off the defending champions. Twice he has been denied, both while
with the Portland Trail Blazers. The Detroit Pistons defeated
Adelman's Trail Blazers in 1990 and Michael Jordan and the Chicago
Bulls got him in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "In Game 6, we were up by 15 points going into the fourth
quarter," Adelman recalled of facing the Bulls at Chicago. "Michael
was on the bench. All of a sudden, they started hitting threes." The
Bulls rallied and won the game and the series.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing that Adelman can count on tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to expect that Kobe and Shaq are going to be involved a
lot, just like they were in Game 5," he said, referring to Kobe
Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. "It's important to stay in the game and
give ourselves a chance to win in the fourth quarter. The pressure is
on them, but we don't want to fall behind. Who knows what's going to
happen if we're right there at the end of the game?"</TE>

<HD>Players Stay Calm, Thanks to Jackson</HD>

<LD>If the Lakers seem almost blase about their current predicament, it's
probably a reflection of their coach. Phil Jackson, through six
championships with the Chicago Bulls and two with the Lakers,
maintains an unflappable air.</LD>
<LD>   "His experience trickles down through us because he's not getting
emotional about what's going on," Derek Fisher said. "He's not doing
a lot of screaming and stomping and yelling and making us feel we
have to do certain things.</LD>
<LD>   "He's treating us like men and that's the reason why we feel like
we've always been able to respond in these types of situations."</LD>
<TE>   Said Shaquille O'Neal: "If you don't see your president worry and
your general doesn't worry, then usually the troops don't worry.
We're not worried."</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson's record counts for only so much, Rick Fox warned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all paperwork," Fox said. "It looks good on paper, it looks
nice across the screen when you're reading it. But as players you
still have to go out and put his plans to work. But he does come up
with pretty good game plans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Badly outplayed by the Kings' Mike Bibby, who has repeatedly
exposed him on the defensive end, Fisher also has struggled to find
his shooting touch in the series. The Laker point guard has made only
26% of his shots, 16.7% from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of talk about percentage-wise what I'm
shooting," Fisher said, "but making shots is not always [about
percentages]. Robert Horry had only made one shot before he made
three shots in the fourth quarter to help us win Game 4....</TE>
<TE>   "That's why Robert has always been a crucial player to our
championship thing. He's always been able to kind of step up when we
needed him to step up. So, for me, it might not be improving from
[26%] to 50% [that is most important]. It's just being able to knock
shots down ... when we really need a basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I've felt good at the start of the games, but I haven't been able
to stay in the rhythm in the second, third and fourth quarters. There
are all sorts of reasons why a guy doesn't shoot the basketball the
way he normally does."</TE>
<TE>   Chasing a guy like Bibby, he implied, is one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's foul trouble was an obvious factor in Tuesday night's
loss. He played only 32 minutes, scoring 28 points before fouling out
with 3:22 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But he plans no adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to stay aggressive," O'Neal said. "I'm just going to
play my game. If they call the ... fouls like they've been calling,
then so be it, but I'm going to stay aggressive. I'll never change my
game, ever, ever, ever."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been called for 18 more fouls and shot 37 fewer
free throws than the Kings, who have outscored them, 100-74, at the
line.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm a fan and I'm not biased," Laker reserve guard Brian Shaw
said, "it would seem like the officiating in this series has given a
black eye to the sport. It's like boxing. When all is said and done,
someone has to police the referees. Someone has to police the
police."</TE>

Kindergarten Futurity, and Check Him Out, a Grade I winner.</TE>
<TE>   The field for the Town Policy also includes Tiny Rocket Dash, who
has won eight of 10 for owner-trainer Roberto Dominguez. The
Oregon-bred had an eight-race winning streak ended when he was second
at 1-2 odds in the Old Habits on May 11.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Forever Jan. 2. Sweet Mama Gene. 3. Frolic's Flash.
4. Justa Dance. 5. Bobbin Lee. 6. Lucky Red Hot. 7. Jake Blues. 8.

<HD>Arellano Has His Suspension Reduced to Only One Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Mexico earned a half-victory Thursday when FIFA, international
soccer's governing body, decided to reduce midfielder Jesus
Arellano's World Cup match suspension from two games to one.</LD>
<LD>   Arellano, the closest thing Mexico has to a playmaker, was
initially suspended by FIFA for three games for his part in a shoving
incident during a qualification match against Costa Rica last
October. With Arellano sitting out Mexico's last qualifier, against
Honduras in November, the Mexican soccer federation appealed to
reduce the ban, calling it too harsh.</LD>
<LD>   Three days before Mexico's World Cup opener against Croatia, FIFA
agreed to cut Arellano's remaining suspension in half, meaning
Arellano will be eligible to play against Ecuador on June 9 and Italy
on June 13.</LD>
<TE>   "We never lost hope and we are very happy," Mexico Coach Javier
Aguirre said.</TE>
<TE>   Arellano said the decision "changes all my prospects. I'm very
happy. I could barely sleep while I waited for the ruling. But now
it's official."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico will play Croatia without two of its regular midfielders.
Joahan Rodriguez, the team's right-sided defensive midfielder, is
serving a one-game suspension for a red card he received during the
Honduras match.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic remains bewildered over Aguirre's recent
criticism of his team, responding again to Aguirre's comments in a
Thursday interview session with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see why they don't respect us," Jozic said. "It's not
like we barely squeezed through the World Cup in our last qualifying
match like they did."</TE>
<TE>   Croatia went undefeated in a qualification group that included
Scotland and Belgium, yielding only two goals in eight matches.
Mexico, which opened 1-3-2 in qualification, earned its trip to the
World Cup only after a 3-0 victory over Honduras in its last
qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre irked Jozic when he said earlier this week that Croatia is
an aging team, not very strong, one that has slipped in quality since
Croatia's third-place finish at the 1998 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "The last Mexican generation was also more talented and now they
are a lot older," Jozic noted. "Some have even retired from
international soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a small advantage [in Monday's match]. But we
have to take Mexico as a serious contender."</TE>

<LD>Jason Kidd's family might not attend Game 6 of the Eastern Conference
finals tonight in Boston because of security concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Despite assurances by the Celtics that they would provide as much
security as needed, Kidd said Thursday that he was not sure whether
his family would attend the game that could send New Jersey to its
first NBA Finals.</LD>
<LD>   Rowdy fans caused the Nets' point guard to become concerned about
the safety of his wife, Joumana, and his son, T.J., after Game 4 in
Boston.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not all the fans," Kidd said. "We've kind of lost the
perspective. It's a couple. But the big thing is we don't know."</TE>

own merit," Carr said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Norton hit a grand slam in the first inning Thursday at San
Diego that carried the Colorado Rockies to a 4-2 victory over the
Padres, who also lost first baseman Phil Nevin for at least six weeks
because of a broken arm.</LD>
<LD>   Denny Neagle won for the first time in five starts and the
Rockies, who are 8-2 in a stretch of 16 games against National League
West rivals, salvaged a split of the four-game series.</LD>
<LD>   Nevin was hurt Wednesday night diving for a grounder in the
Padres' win over Colorado, and the original diagnosis was a bruised
rotator cuff.</LD>
<TE>   Nevin had an MRI on Thursday and doctors thought they saw a
fracture, trainer Todd Hutcheson said. They did a CT scan, which
confirmed the break.</TE>
<TE>   Nevin had been back just three games from a stint on the disabled
list with a strained left elbow when he was hurt again.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got him back," fellow slugger Ryan Klesko said. "This is
a pretty tough blow. It's going to be a big blow to our offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also put Sean Burroughs on the disabled list. He has
been bothered by a sore right shoulder since mid-April and was
hitting .221.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 1, San Francisco 0--Luis Gonzalez's home run into McCovey
Cove sent Rick Helling and the Diamondbacks to a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez homered in the fourth inning, and that was enough to give
the Diamondbacks a split of the four-game series between NL West
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, Florida 1--Barry Larkin and Adam Dunn homered and
the Reds completed a three-game sweep at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins have lost 12 of their last 17 games to fall from first
to fourth in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Montreal 2--Jason Marquis gave up only four hits in
seven innings and Chipper Jones had three hits in his return to the
Brave lineup at Atlanta. Marquis (4-3) won for the third time in four
starts since coming off the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Pittsburgh 8--Mark Bellhorn hit his first grand slam
and Alex Gonzalez followed with a solo shot in a five-run Cub third
inning at Pittsburgh.</TE>

<LD>   After two errors allowed one run to score in the first, Chase
Kroll followed with a run-scoring single to give the Lancers a 2-0
lead.</LD>
<LD>   Scott (4-2) surrendered a run-scoring single to Charlie Munzig in
the bottom of the first, but only allowed one Thacher baserunner to
advance into scoring position after that. He struck out five with no

<HD>Scott Seems to Have Coaching Down Pat</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Byron Scott had the best time of his life when he played for Coach
Pat Riley's Showtime Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   So it makes sense that Scott mentions Riley nearly every day
during the NBA Eastern Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   It is not Showtime that Scott has brought to the New Jersey Nets,
but it is a good time. The Nets are one win away from the NBA Finals.
One victory--tonight against the Boston Celtics at their FleetCenter
or home Sunday at Continental Airlines Arena--and the Nets get to the
NBA Finals for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   There is no Magic on this team, but there is magic.</TE>
<TE>   Scott can tell Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, Kerry Kittles and
Keith Van Horn what it was like to win titles, play with Magic and
Kareem, how it was to listen to a basketball fanatic such as Riley
every day.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Coach George Karl had told a magazine writer this year
that too many African Americans with more playing experience than
coaching experience were getting NBA head coaching jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Scott got the Net job with only two years of coaching
apprenticeship under Rick Adelman with the Sacramento Kings. The
trouble with making blanket statements is that a blanket covers
everybody. And nobody. Sure Scott coached only two years. But every
day that he played, especially when he played for Riley in Los
Angeles and Larry Brown in Indianapolis, Scott was learning about
coaching.</TE>
<TE>   He was learning about the Xs and O's, sure. New Jersey General
Manager Rod Thorn said that he hired Scott two years ago because he
sat for five hours in a hotel room and was hypnotized while Scott
diagramed plays on a magnetic board.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott was also learning more. He was learning how to be the
coach, how to be the man who instigates, irritates, humbles, praises,
raises shattered confidence and bruised egos and dampened spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Scott says it is the memories of Riley's intense, positive
attitude that he called upon when he had to prop up a demoralized Net
team after Game 3. It was there, in Boston, when the Nets had given
away the biggest fourth-quarter lead in NBA playoff history and the
world had the Nets consigned to the swampland they play on.</TE>
<TE>   Practice was canceled the day after the collapse. After a film
session and a long talk, Scott told his players to go see a movie,
take a walk, have a nice meal, spend time with family. He told them
to talk about tomorrow instead of yesterday. He spoke sternly about
accomplishment and not failure, about toughness and not misery, about
being mean and not being dejected wimps struck down by a bad quarter
even if that bad quarter was the worst ever and was watched by the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about what Coach Riley would say," Scott said, "because
I've put a lot of him in me."</TE>
<TE>   The credit for New Jersey's journey from cursed, injury-prone
losers a year ago to a powerful team needing one win in two chances
to advance to the NBA Finals has gone mostly to Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   It is Kidd's arrival, conventional wisdom says, in place of moody,
egotistic Stephon Marbury, that has gotten the Nets to become a
running, up-tempo, happy, accomplished team. Kidd was runner-up as
NBA most valuable player and conventional wisdom-makers have been
saying Kidd should have won the award over Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   That man sitting on the bench, the one in the sharply pressed suit
and expression of agony, distaste, anguish, excitement, joy, pain,
anger, exhilaration, the one the players gather around at timeouts,
he's just the guy who has to call the timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Coach Scott gets enough credit," Van Horn said.
"He's got a great mind for the game and a great way of getting the
best out of different players in different ways."</TE>
<TE>   Scott always says what he thinks. When Detroit's Rick Carlisle was
named coach of the year this season, Scott said, "That's not right."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe it wasn't. The Nets won 26 games last year. They doubled
that in the regular season this year. The Nets have no tradition
except as buffoons and losers. The Nets entered the NBA from the ABA
as supplicants who had to sell Julius Erving to Philadelphia so they
could pay a rights' fee to the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets play in the swamp where Jimmy Hoffa is supposed to be
buried, in a building of no atmosphere. They represent nothing more
than a turnpike exit, 16W. They are the team that featured Derrick
Coleman, who uttered perhaps the best quote ever when he was
disciplined for missing practice. "Whoop de damn do," Coleman said,
forever illuminating the image of a Net player as a spoiled,
pampered, bratty loser.</TE>
<TE>   Scott doesn't think that way. He wants to hear none of the
legendary losing and mistakes, bad draft picks and bad coaches. It is
none of his business that Coach John Calipari could have chosen Kobe
Bryant but picked Kittles instead because Calipari was too afraid to
start his NBA coaching career with a high school player.</TE>
<TE>   That is none of Scott's business.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's business is to brashly believe the Nets are winners.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a good team and we've had a good season," Scott said.
"Why would I think we wouldn't go to the finals?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott said that when it was pointed out to him that many experts
had made the Celtics the trendy, underdog pick. And after the Nets
lost a 26-point third-quarter lead in Game 3, Scott said it was the
best thing that could have happened to the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody laughed. But Scott was right. He said what he thought
and he was right. Just like he knew he would be. Just like Coach
Riley always seemed to be.</TE>

<LD>Fluke is an appropriate word to describe a freakish, strange
occurrence. Just don't use it to explain Reseda Cleveland High
beating West Valley League rival Chatsworth for a fourth time this
season to earn a spot in the City Championship game at Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 15-seeded Cavaliers' 4-0 victory over the defending
champions on Thursday in the City semifinals at Pierce College was
convincing and unequivocal.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Grubman, a 5-foot-10, 165-pound senior right-hander, threw a
five-hitter and didn't allow a Chatsworth runner past first base.
Three times the Cavaliers turned double plays on assists from
All-City shortstop Robert Marcial.</LD>
<TE>   Cleveland (20-11), the fourth-place finisher in the West Valley
League, will meet top-seeded Sylmar (27-4) Tuesday night at Dodger
Stadium on the 20th anniversary of the Cavaliers' last City title
victory. Bret Saberhagen threw a no-hitter to defeat Palisades that
night.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman is Cleveland's newest version of Saberhagen. Last season,
he had a perfect game at Dodger Stadium for 52/3 innings in the City
Invitational final won, 5-1, by the Cavaliers. But his win Thursday,
with the temperature soaring into the 90s, was more impressive
because of the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "To be the best you have to go through the best and Chatsworth has
been that for so long," Cleveland Coach Joe Cascione said.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth was ranked No. 1 in the nation after a 19-0 start. Then
the Chancellors lost five of their next nine games, including three
to Cleveland. It was mind boggling and exasperating for the
Chancellors (25-6), who couldn't figure out what was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chancellors always believed they'd regain their winning
ways in the playoffs and get revenge against Cleveland. Except they
never came close to victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We always play our 'A' game against Chatsworth," right fielder
Adam Olbrychowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Cascione, 31, is a big reason Cleveland rises to the challenge
when facing four-time City champion Chatsworth. He's a fiery
third-year coach who was nicknamed "Mashcione" when he was hitting
home runs as a tiny second baseman for Pierce College and Cal
Lutheran. He requires his players to get their uniforms dirty.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how I played the game and I try to get the kids to follow
that lead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's an intriguing cast of characters that has Cleveland trying to
duplicate the feat of North Hills Monroe, which finished fourth in
league in 1988, entered as the No. 15-seeded team and won the title.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman (8-3) has won 21 games during his career but hitters still
don't know how he gets them out.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned early on I wasn't going to be big or overpowering,"
Grubman said. "I make guys ground out and pop out."</TE>
<TE>   Marcial is one of the best defensive shortstops in Southern
California. He has signed with Nevada and is a pitcher's dream.</TE>
<TE>   "I take a sigh of relief when the ball is hit to him," Grubman
said.</TE>
<TE>   For six years, Marcial's grandparents have been in a coma because
of an automobile accident. He speaks to them often even though they
don't react and he doesn't know if they can hear him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they were here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olbrychowski is a 6-2, 170-pound sophomore with a magical arm who
could be throwing 90 mph fastballs by next season. His father came to
America from Poland. He made two acrobatic catches on the run in
Cleveland's first-round upset of second-seeded Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   Against Chatsworth, Olbrychowski missed a squeeze bunt in the
fourth inning. He fought back in the at-bat to hit a two-run single.
He takes yoga lessons from Alan Jaeger, who instructs Oakland A's
pitcher Barry Zito.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of getting mad after the missed bunt, Olbrychowski
remembered that yoga taught him to stay focused.</TE>
<TE>   "I stayed calm and drove the ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Olbrychowski was trying to comprehend what it will mean
to start in right field at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," he said. "I've waited to play there all my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman center fielder Trevor Arroyo will become the third family
member to reach Dodger Stadium. Arroyo was so nervous that he was
discovered walking the hallways at home in the early morning hours
Wednesday by his older brother. But he'll be ready for Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best feeling ever," he said. "It's my dream."</TE>

<LD>The Sylmar High baseball team had little trouble beating San Fernando
for a fourth time this season as ace right-hander Jamie Mah (7-0)
pitched a six-hitter in the Spartans' 7-1 City Championship semifinal
victory Thursday afternoon at Lake Balboa Birmingham High. That
earned Sylmar its first trip to Dodger Stadium since losing to
Chatsworth in 1983.</LD>
<LD>   "We came out mentally prepared to play and I don't think it
would've mattered who we were up against," said Mah, who struck out
six and allowed two walks in his fifth complete game of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Three errors led to five runs in the bottom of the third inning
for top-seeded Sylmar (27-4).</LD>
<TE>   Fausto Reyes doubled in John Sandoval for the Tigers' run. No. 12
San Fernando (16-14-1) lost to Sylmar by 4-2, 2-0 and 6-1 scores in
Valley Mission League play.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento's Chris Webber still shoots too many jump shots and
commits ill-advised fouls at times, but the King forward has a chance
to answer some of his critics tonight.</LD>
<LD>   After Webber re-signed with the Kings last summer, some detractors
did not believe him when he said that he returned to Sacramento to
win a championship and not because of the money.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Webber is one major step away from backing his words up with
the Kings, who lead the best-of-seven matchup in the Western
Conference finals, 3-2, heading into tonight's Game 6 at Staples
Center.</LD>
<TE>   But before Webber and his teammates celebrate, they will have to
deal with a determined Laker team, which gained confidence with its
play in a one-point Game 5 loss at Arco Arena on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown of tonight's Game 6:</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Shaquille O'Neal has to find a way to stay out of
foul trouble because when he's on the court and not shying away from
contact, the Lakers are a difficult team to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   By flopping every time O'Neal touches them, the Kings have done an
awesome job of drawing the Laker center into fouls, but he definitely
helped them out Tuesday by picking up a couple of questionable fouls
away from the basket.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal needs his teammates to play better on-the-ball defense and
he has to have more of a presence when the Kings use a pick-and-roll
with Mike Bibby. Samaki Walker, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher should also
set more off-the-ball screens for O'Neal on the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher also has to allow the game to come to him and not force his
play at bad times. He's been through too many wars not to step up
when the Lakers need him most, especially on the defensive end.
Fisher should never go underneath a screen against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers also have to find a way to turn around the disparity of
calls going against them in the series. During the regular season,
the Kings and Lakers shot nearly the same number of free throws. But
after five games in the series, the Kings have attempted 37 more
shots from the line.</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--Coach Rick Adelman has to make sure that his players
keep doing what they do best, and that's shoot and pass the ball with
efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has been a warrior for the Kings, and Kobe Bryant is the
only Laker who has had success against him. If Laker Coach Phil
Jackson assigns Bryant to Bibby more, the Kings have to make sure
that he remains involved in the team's offense.</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic, who returned in Game 5 after sitting out nearly
two weeks because of an ankle injury, should be more effective after
playing a little bit Tuesday. With Stojakovic and Hedo Turkoglu, the
Kings can do something they haven't done yet this series, and that's
go big at small forward and shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can only help themselves if they start making their free
throws. They miss way too many from the line for such a good shooting
team.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--In last season's championship run, the Lakers' role
players were a dominating force with their timely outside shooting.
But Ron Harper is gone and Fisher, Fox, Robert Horry and the Lakers'
bench players have been inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers are going to go down, Jackson should at least give
reserves Mitch Richmond, Brian Shaw and Slava Medvedenko more run.
Jackson teased Richmond and Medvedenko with a few minutes in Game 5
and gave Shaw playing time early in the series, but he has pretty
much stuck with an eight-man rotation lately.</TE>
<TE>   Considering how poorly the Lakers are shooting three-pointers,
Jackson's toughest decision will be how long he waits. He's known as
a coach with a quick hook when things get tight and a player is not
producing. But more times than not, the struggling players stepped up
in the crunch.</TE>

<LD>The palace coup.</LD>
<LD>   Are they ready?</LD>
<LD>   Tonight will be unlike any the Kings have experienced, or even
imagined. While the plan remains brutally basic--storm Staples Center
and dethrone the two-time defending NBA champions in Game 6 of the
best-of-seven Western Conference finals--this is an enormously
daunting task for so many reasons.</LD>
<TE>   These are the Lakers of Shaq, Kobe, Phil.</TE>
<TE>   These are the Lakers at home.</TE>
<TE>   These are also trying times for the young and the rebels,
particularly this late in the game. In the last 15 years, six
defending NBA champions have been extended beyond five games in
conference finals, and each came back to triumph, including Boston's
memorable win over Detroit in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "That [the Pistons] was my team, and after [Larry] Bird stole the
ball, I remember my mother saying to me and my brothers afterward,
'Don't you tear up my house,'" Chris Webber recalled Wednesday,
referring to Bird's dramatic steal in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "My brothers were crying, feeling like it was the end of the
world. I was kicking things. It's funny, but the other night [after
Game 4], I was out to dinner with my mom and my brothers, and she
brought that up. She said, 'I wonder if in Sacramento, there were any
little kids crying like we were back then?'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course there were. Little kids cried, and big kids cried. An
entire city heaved a collective sob when Robert Horry's three-pointer
struck down the local basketball team--also known as Sacramento's
civic treasure--in a finale that was eerily reminiscent of Game 5 of
that Celtic-Piston classic. One fluke play led to one traumatic
steal. One careless second led to one deciding moment. One series led
to another.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can learn from this, simply by turning back the pages or
flipping channels on the remote. "I actually watched that series on
ESPN Classic," said Vlade Divac, a youngster in Yugoslavia at the
time. "That was a series you cannot forget."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics that season were not unlike these Lakers--far from
healthy but not to be underestimated. Kevin McHale had a broken foot.
Bill Walton had a broken foot. Robert Parish played on sprained
ankles. And with injuries already beginning to diminish his mobility,
Bird was hampered by bone chips in his elbows and his feet.</TE>
<TE>   And yet they persisted.</TE>
<TE>   And, again, they moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Bird stole the inbound pass from Isiah Thomas in the final
seconds, fed Dennis Johnson for the layup, and the Celtics swiped
Game 5. After the Pistons evened the series, 3-3, the Celtics rode
the swell of emotion inside steamy old Boston Garden.</TE>
<TE>   They capitalized on Vinnie Johnson's concussion and scored a
critical field goal after one staggering, five-offensive-rebound
sequence that, more than anything else, was a testament to their
remarkable resilience.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what the Kings are going to face in L.A.," said Walton,
also a member of the Celtics' last championship squad in 1985-86.
"The question is, 'Can the Kings put the nail in?'"</TE>
<TE>   The Church of Phil awaits. Staples will not be so silent, the
Lakers not so forgiving. Tonight will not be about cowbells, about
the refs, about an intra-state rivalry, but rather, all about the
game. The Kings have to be selfish, be greedy and take what they
want.</TE>

<HD>Zen-Ruffinen Agrees to Leave His Post July 4</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter succeeded today in removing his
most dangerous critic and forced the withdrawal of legal action
against him by members of his executive committee.</LD>
<LD>   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who accused Blatter of corruption, financial
mismanagement and steering FIFA toward bankruptcy, agreed to quit as
FIFA general secretary on July 4. He'll continue in the job through
the end of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Blatter, reelected for a second four-year term Wednesday despite a
scandal-plagued campaign, also won a crucial battle for control of
the executive committee at Friday's emergency meeting.</LD>
<TE>   He blunted the prospect of criminal action against him as some of
the 11 committee members who initiated legal action in a Swiss court
earlier this month agreed to drop the charges immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Matarrese of Italy, one of the complainants, has already
resigned from the executive committee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players will undergo blood tests for the first time at the World
Cup in a bid to find banned drugs in their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Any player who refuses to undergo the tests will not be allowed to
play, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the 72-year history of the tournament,
players who receive red or yellow cards may be fined as much as
$1,300 as part of a crackdown on foul play and cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to win a free kick or penalty by simulating a foul or
pulling an opponent's shirt will result in the maximum sanction.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FIFA officials said they are still deliberating over whether to
allow Ireland to replace midfield star Roy Keane, who left the team
training camp last week after an argument with Coach Mick McCarthy.
Normally, players can only be replaced because of an injury....
Senegal midfielder Khalilou Fadiga was allowed to play in today's
opener against France despite admitting he stole a $230 gold necklace
from a Korean jewelry store. Police were not planning to arrest
Fadiga.</TE>

<DL>ALGIERS</DL>
<LD>Under the shadow of a massacre, Algerians voted Thursday in
parliamentary elections boycotted by opposition parties and ethnic
Berbers.</LD>
<LD>   Hours before the vote, suspected Islamic guerrillas slaughtered 25
civilians, including 14 children, in the village of Sendjas in Chlef
province, about 125 miles west of Algiers, the capital.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest in a series of massacres and bomb attacks in an
undeclared civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the
last decade.</LD>
<TE>   Political analysts predicted a large win by the current government
coalition in the election to choose 389 members of the lower house of
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Berber opposition forces had called for a boycott, saying
military-backed authorities were illegitimate and planned massive
fraud. Results were not expected before today.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia</DL>
<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and U2 frontman Bono wound up
a 10-day tour Thursday aimed at focusing world attention--and aid--on
Africa's fiscal and health woes.</LD>
<LD>   After traveling through Ghana, South Africa, Uganda and Ethiopia,
the business-minded Treasury chief and the casually clad rock star
said they believe that a better life is possible on the continent.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill insisted that there must be results for aid spending and
that more information is needed to decide how to spend aid dollars.
He resisted Bono's position that aid should increased immediately.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to figure it out from the bottom up, I want to figure out
what is it we need to do. I want to cost it out, and then I'm ready
to advocate it," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Bono said, "We're going to lose millions of lives unless there's a
significant jump in aid from the United States and Europe, and I
think the only reason that people won't be prepared to make that jump
with us is that they need to believe that the money will get to the
people."</TE>

<HD>Canada Defense Spending Called Low</HD>
<DH>Military: Lawmakers across the spectrum endorse report
calling for significant boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Canada should dramatically boost its military budget, ruling and
opposition lawmakers said in a report released Thursday, agreeing
with calls from the U.S. and other NATO members for a greater
Canadian commitment to the alliance.</LD>
<LD>   The report said Canada needs another $3 billion to upgrade its
aging helicopter fleet, and should increase overall military spending
to 1.5% of gross domestic product, up from 1.1%--the second-lowest
level in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</LD>
<LD>   "It would allow us to hold our heads a little higher around the
NATO table, by not being next to Luxembourg in defense spending,"
said David Pratt, a Liberal Party member and chairman of the House of
Commons Defense Committee, which released the report in Ottawa.</LD>
<TE>   The report said spending on Canada's armed forces has dropped in
real terms by almost a third since 1988, and it recommended a steep
and swift correction: a 50% jump over three years, reaching the goal
of 1.5% of GDP by 2006. This would raise the military budget to
approximately $12 billion--tiny by American standards but a
substantial investment for Canada's much smaller economy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as committee members noted Thursday, this would put Canada
at only about the median defense-spending level for NATO countries.</TE>
<TE>   George Robertson, the alliance's secretary-general, has called on
Canada and other lower spenders to increase their commitments to the
collective defense pact, a request echoed by Pentagon officials and
members of the U.S. Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The strongly worded Canadian report marks an unusual display of
unanimity in the normally fractious Parliament. The findings were
backed not only by the governing Liberals on the committee, but by
representatives of the leftist New Democrats and right-wing Canadian
Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties. The only dissenters
were the Bloc Quebecois, which has long opposed big defense outlays.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to get government MPs [members of Parliament] to sign
on to a report calling for such difficult and substantive matters,
and I give them credit for doing that," said Leon Benoit, a committee
member and chief spokesman for the Canadian Alliance on defense
issues.</TE>
<TE>   But Prime Minister Jean Chretien must still weigh the proposal,
and his initial reaction was curtly skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone would like us to spend more money," he told reporters
outside Parliament on Thursday, noting demands this week for aid to
Canadian farmers who say they will be hurt by subsidies recently
approved for their U.S. competitors. There also were calls for
Parliament to fund more foreign assistance, with the New Democrats
noting that the Chretien government has devoted progressively less of
its budget to overseas aid grants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have provided a big increase in the budget for defense over
the past few years, and we will increase it next year too," Chretien
said, without specifying amounts.</TE>
<TE>   By opposition accounting, though, a hike in military spending
since Sept. 11 represented the first real increase in core defense
appropriations since Chretien took office nine years ago. The
government also has provided more funds for intelligence agencies and
border security since last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Some defense experts questioned the committee's call for a revival
of Canada's moribund naval shipyards, a proposal several members
embraced Thursday as a job-creation program for economically
depressed Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.</TE>
<TE>   But the new pan-ideological consensus that Canada needs to expand
and modernize its armed forces is a reflection of the changed climate
here since Sept. 11, which precipitated the first overseas commitment
of Canadian combat troops since the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that the Canadian military maintains
combat-capable forces ready to join coalitions and make a meaningful
contribution," the committee report said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Pentagon proposing closer coordination with Canadian
forces under a newly organized North American command, critics here
have voiced concerns that overwhelming U.S. superiority in technology
and troop strength could preclude genuine collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to be ready for our dominant partner and ally?"
Desmond Morton, a prominent Canadian military analyst, asked
Thursday. "That's the real issue here, not self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   The parliamentary report comes at a time of turmoil in the upper
echelons of Canada's Defense Ministry, making a swift response more
difficult. Art Eggleton, Chretien's longtime defense minister,
resigned Sunday for an ethical breach only tangentially related to
military affairs; he gave a former girlfriend a $24,000 contract for
a 14-page report on the physical and mental health impact of combat
service.</TE>
<TE>   But Eggleton had come under fire earlier this month when he
announced that Canada was withdrawing 800 elite infantry troops from
Afghanistan because the armed forces were "stretched too thin." He
acknowledged that the Pentagon asked Canada to keep the battalion in
place, but said U.S. commanders "understood that we couldn't stay,
that we needed time to rest and regroup."</TE>
<TE>   Canada is keeping another 1,300 naval and air force personnel in
and around Afghanistan as part of the coalition. The country's
biggest overseas military commitment is to the U.N. force in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where it has 1,700 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Some legislators have said Canadian forces should reduce their
engagement in international peacekeeping operations and rebuild more
traditional combat capabilities. However, the Commons committee
argues that Canada could and should do both--provided that the
government appropriates the needed resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Our foreign policy has been writing checks that our defense
policy can't cash," said Pratt, the committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   John McCallum, a novice legislator unexpectedly named to replace
Eggleton, said that he is far from mastering his new portfolio and
declined to comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   "I will read it attentively, and at the appropriate time I will
respond," he said.</TE>

<HD>Rivers of Fear Run Through Malawi as Crocodiles Stage a Big
Comeback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NSANJE DISTRICT, Malawi</DL>
<LD>Dipping his arms into the murky river, Collins Skiper expected to
grasp a healthy bunch of water lilies. Instead, he found both hands
in the clutches of a crocodile's ravenous jaws.</LD>
<LD>   The predator dragged Skiper out of his shallow dug-out canoe and
into the water. Memories of what followed that day in early January
are sketchy. But Skiper does recall the terror, the pain and the
violent struggle as six fellow fishermen clobbered the crocodile with
their paddles.</LD>
<LD>   Miraculously, they managed to free Skiper from the reptile's grip
and drag him to safety--his hands ripped and bloody.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to die," said Skiper, 21, whose wounds took
almost a month to heal. "I shiver now each time I see a crocodile."</TE>
<TE>   The young fisherman was lucky. Few victims of the numerous
crocodile attacks in this southern region of Malawi survive to tell
their tale--much less with all their limbs intact.</TE>
<TE>   Crocodiles "are a big problem," said Dennis Chokolo, chief of the
village where Skiper lives along the Shire River, an outlet of Lake
Malawi. "Nobody can go and even take a bath in the river; not even
the animals can go near. When they go to the river to drink, they are
killed."</TE>
<TE>   Nile crocodiles are terrorizing communities along the Shire. Two
people in Skiper's village have been killed since January, and nearby
settlements have experienced at least a dozen attacks since the
beginning of the year. Depletion of the crocodiles' natural prey,
primarily caused by overfishing, has led to the surge in attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Humans who fish, wash in and draw water from the crocodile-
infested river, along with livestock grazing along its shoreline, are
easy prey, wildlife specialists said. Some local fishermen have been
literally plucked out of their makeshift canoes, many of which have
less than six inches of clearance from the water.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Taylor, chairman of the Blantyre branch of the Wildlife and
Environmental Society of Malawi, said attacks are "more a problem of
the human population than the crocodile population. As the [human]
population gets bigger, more and more people are moving into areas
where the crocodiles exist. So the chances of a crocodile encounter
are larger."</TE>
<TE>   Figures on crocodile attacks here are unavailable. But some
hunters believe that at least one Malawian is killed or maimed by a
crocodile every day and that as many as two victims fall prey daily
during the warm season from October to April.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the cases are not reported; people just go missing," said
Wisdom Mwanza, director of planning and development for the District
Assembly in Chikwawa, one of the areas hit hardest by crocodile
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rall Schmidt, a surgeon, treated more than 60 patients with
crocodile-caused injuries between 1998 and mid-2001, when he worked
at a remote hospital near Nsanje district's swamps and elephant
marshes. But that figure, he said, represents a fraction of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have 20 victims coming to the hospital, you have to
estimate that 4 or 5 others have died," said Schmidt. Among his
patients, 80% had lost a limb and 25% had both a leg and an arm
missing. All suffered extensive bites and fractures.</TE>
<TE>   Nile crocodiles, which can grow to more than 14 feet and weigh up
to a ton, were declared endangered in 1976 by the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, an agreement designed to
protect threatened wildlife. Ruthless hunting for its skin in the
early 20th century had pushed the reptile to the verge of extinction
in Malawi.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears to have greatly recovered in recent years, the
Nile crocodile was among the species recommended for additional
protection during a review in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Malawi is officially allowed to cull only 200 crocodiles a year,
even though the government estimates the population to be between
5,000 and 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made things worse, naturally," said commercial hunter Khalid
Hassen, who used to kill about 800 crocodiles a year.</TE>
<TE>   The increasing rate of attacks has led the government to defy the
treaty and hire commercial hunters. Lenard Sefu, director of Malawi's
Ministry of Tourism, Parks and Wildlife, said 20 to 25 additional
crocodiles are killed each year by hired hands.</TE>
<TE>   Hassen, who now runs a tannery and exports his skins to fashion
houses in Europe, estimates that at least 500 crocodiles would need
to be culled each year in Malawi to keep the population under
control.</TE>
<TE>   Many villagers believe that witchcraft is behind the proliferation
of attacks and that only certain unfortunate souls are targeted.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to reduce the number of attacks, local conservation
groups backed by the government and foreign donors have launched a
public awareness campaign aimed at promoting "sensible behavior"
among riverside communities.</TE>
<TE>   People are being asked to use larger fishing boats with high water
clearance. Upland irrigation is being encouraged to keep people from
planting crops in wetlands, which are crocodile havens, and bore
holes have been dug in several settlements to deter people from
drawing water from the river.</TE>
<TE>   Some wildlife lovers are keen to enhance the reputation of
crocodiles while exploiting the reptile's assets for economic gain.</TE>
<TE>   Reg Carvalho, a local businessman, is developing a crocodile ranch
on the shores of Lake Malawi, primarily to farm the tail meat,
considered a delicacy by some Malawians, and to export the skins for
the manufacture of shoes and handbags.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that has been put on earth at some time or the other
is of benefit to us," said Carvalho, who bought an existing crocodile
farm two years ago and hopes to farm between 6,000 and 10,000 animals
a year.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he owns 2,500 reptiles, including dozens of 8-inch
hatchlings along with 8-foot breeders. The best size for culling
crocodiles is between 2 and 3 feet, Carvalho said. The lucrative
belly skin, if stripped without piercing and correctly tanned, can
fetch $140 to $210.</TE>
<TE>   Once construction of several new crocodile pens, an egg incubator
and a fish dam are complete by year's end, Carvalho hopes to turn the
farm into a tourist attraction that will create jobs and help teach
residents about the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Sefu, the wildlife official, said the government supports the idea
of community-based crocodile farms that would allow villagers to help
rear crocodiles and make a profit from the sale of their meat and
skins.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to demonstrate to people that crocodiles are not
only a problem, [they] are an asset," he added. "That would change
the community's perception of them."</TE>
<TE>   But one would be hard pressed these days to find villagers living
along the Shire River who believe that crocodiles should be reared
for any reason--even money. Many argue that looking after crocodiles
in a community setting would be like welcoming serial killers into a
neighborhood to play with the kids.</TE>
<TE>   Sukweya Douglas Donkeya, 56, whose bandaged, mangled right hand
and torn foot and thigh are a reminder of an attack he survived last
month while bathing in the river, said, "It's a dangerous [animal],
and we should make sure we kill all of them."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Signs Basic Rights Law</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The 5-year-old legislation grants freedoms to
Palestinians, regulates government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>RAMALLAH, West Bank -- Under pressure from Palestinians and Western
governments, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat approved a
law he had put off signing for five years that will form the basis
for a Palestinian constitution, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Israel continued with its roundup of suspected
militants, with the first reported arrest of an Israeli Jew on
charges of knowingly aiding a suicide bomber.</LD>
<LD>   The government said security agents had arrested a Palestinian man
and his Israeli wife, who allegedly drove the bomber to his target
May 22. The attacker blew himself up in the Israeli city of Rishon Le
Zion, killing two Israeli bystanders and injuring three dozen people.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects were identified as Ibrahim Sarachne, 33, from the
Dahaisha refugee camp next to the West Bank town of Bethlehem, and
Russian-born Medina Pinsky, 26, who immigrated to Israel 11 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Military movements continued, with Israeli forces announcing that
they had pulled out of Bethlehem after arresting 42 Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The four-day operation there was an exception to the latest
Israeli practice of almost nightly incursions into Palestinian towns
and villages in the West Bank, most lasting only a few hours. In such
a raid before daybreak in Hebron, Israel arrested four
Palestinians.Witnesses said Israeli tanks also reentered the West
Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin. In Nablus, dozens of armored
vehicles took up positions around the Balata refugee camp, a base for
the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which claimed responsibility for recent
suicide bombings. No casualties were immediately reported.</TE>
<TE>   A curfew was imposed in Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   The Basic Law was signed by Arafat on Tuesday, but Palestinian
officials did not confirm the action until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among its main points are regular presidential elections, and a
procedure to dismiss a president for wrongdoing; a ban on censorship
or intimidation of news media; an independent judicial system; and a
separation of powers among the executive, legislative and judicial
branches.</TE>
<TE>   It also declares Islam the official religion, bases Palestinian
law on Islamic law and obligates the Palestinian Authority to provide
for the families of "martyrs," a reference to Palestinians killed in
the conflict with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Arafat has ruled Palestinian areas almost
autocratically, ignoring laws passed by the legislature and convening
security courts that sometimes try, convict and sentence Palestinians
in a single day.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat signed the law amid increasing pressure. The Palestinian
public has been expressing its dissatisfaction with his regime, and
the United States and Europe have been calling for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   A parade of diplomats headed to Ramallah on Thursday to press
those concerns. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns was the
first to see Arafat. Afterward, Burns expressed support for
negotiations that would result in a Palestinian state and backed
"Palestinian efforts to build strong institutions," a reference to
the call for reforms.</TE>

<HD>Shipwreck Hunter Says JFK's WWII Boat Found</HD>
<DH>Search: The remains of the PT-109 are on the seabed in the
Solomon Islands, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Shipwreck hunter Robert Ballard said Wednesday that he has found the
World War II patrol boat commanded by John F. Kennedy in the Pacific
Ocean off the Solomon Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The remains of the wooden boat, PT-109, were lying on the seabed
in the Blanket Strait near Gizo in the New Georgia group of islands,
Ballard told Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corp. radio.</LD>
<LD>   Gizo is 235 miles northwest of Honiara, the Solomons' capital.</LD>
<TE>   "What they have found is a couple of torpedo tubes," a source in
Gizo told the Reuters news agency.</TE>
<TE>   "They were looking for three engines in a row or anything like
that. But the torpedo tubes, that's reasonably significant.... There
were no other PT boats lost in that vicinity and there wouldn't be
any other torpedo tubes like that anywhere else in the region from
any other vessel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard, who led a team that found the Titanic shipwreck in 1985,
said he located the wreckage of Kennedy's boat last week after
searching for about a week. He did not provide further details of the
discovery, citing contractual obligations on film and magazine rights
to the search.</TE>
<TE>   The radio report said a National Geographic documentary will be
released in November. National Geographic issued a statement saying
that its expedition to the Solomon Islands to search for the remains
of PT-109 had concluded and that Ballard was making his way home.</TE>
<TE>   The PT-109 sank in August 1943 after it was hit by a Japanese
warship.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown how much of the boat remains besides the engines.
Water is expected to have caused extensive damage to the hull.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard had planned to use remote cameras in the search.</TE>
<TE>   The late president's daughter, Caroline, and his brother, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), agreed to the expedition after being
assured that the site would not be disturbed. Two members of
Kennedy's crew died when the boat was hit.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 interview, Ballard said the PT-109 is "not lost, just
misplaced." But he added that searching for the vessel in an area
full of unexploded ordnance would be "no fun."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was commanding a patrol Aug. 2, 1943, when the boat was
hit and cut in two by a Japanese destroyer.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy and 10 other survivors swam 15 hours to reach a nearby
island. He towed one injured survivor, engineer Patrick Henry
McMahon, by swimming with a strap from McMahon's lifejacket in his
teeth.</TE>
<TE>   They later swam to another island where there were coconuts to
eat. Kennedy carved a message into one coconut and gave it to a
native to take to rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol torpedo boats, such as the PT-109, had mahogany hulls.
Plywood was used for the internal structures, chart houses and gun
turrets. They were 80 feet long and powered by 12-cylinder gasoline
engines.</TE>

<HD>Recipe for Victory: Hard Work and Pigeon Blood</HD>
<DH>Sports: African soccer teams rely on medicine men to ward
off evil spirits and enemy shots, to the dismay of some game
administrators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>When the four soccer teams from sub-Saharan Africa take the field for
their World Cup matches starting today, they will receive the usual
support from coaches, trainers and, in all likelihood, "team
advisors" who are actually traditional healers known as juju men.</LD>
<LD>   The juju men won't be offering tips on game strategy. Their job
will be to facilitate a win by discreetly scattering charms on the
field, putting hexes on opponents and smearing their teams' goalposts
with magic potions to keep the ball out.</LD>
<LD>   Although juju men are commonplace at African soccer matches, their
presence--and influence--has been such an embarrassment that the
sport's governing body in Africa recently banned such "team advisors"
from being part of a squad's official entourage.</LD>
<TE>   "Image is everything," stated the Cairo-based Confederation of
African Football before the African Nations Cup in January in Mali.
The group said it instituted the ban to avoid presenting "a Third
World image" during the continent's premier sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   "We are no more willing to see witch doctors on the [field] than
cannibals at the concession stands," the CAF declared in a statement
that caused juju men from Senegal to South Africa to howl in protest.</TE>
<TE>   "They are throwing out the baby with the bathwater just because
some soccer administrators wish to appease the white man more than
honor African culture," one traditional healer from Swaziland
responded.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only the South African Football Assn. has announced that
no traditional healers would "officially" accompany its World Cup
squad to Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But soccer commentators doubt that South Africa and the three
other African countries--Nigeria, Senegal and Cameroon--would leave
their juju men home.</TE>
<TE>   "To depart for an international competition without consulting or
including sorcerers is akin to going to an exam without a pencil,"
the authoritative African Soccer magazine said in a recent issue.</TE>
<TE>   The CAF and, indeed, many Africans frown on juju, saying it has no
role in modern soccer. Since the CAF ban, columnists, soccer analysts
and fans have been debating in newspapers, Web sites and chat rooms
about the efficacy of juju and its history in African soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Many fans agree that for the teams to be successful, they need to
combine skill and rigorous training with soccer savvy. But those who
discount soccer sorcery do so at their own peril. Just ask the
Elephants.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Ivory Coast, whose soccer team is nicknamed the
Elephants, won the African Nations Cup in a nail-biting penalty
shootout against Ghana. Many Ivorians credited the victory to a band
of juju men enlisted by the sports minister to give the national side
an extra advantage.</TE>
<TE>   When the minister reneged on promises to pay the juju men, they
promptly slapped a hex on their national team. The result: a dismal
10-year slide for the Elephants.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, Defense Minister Moise Lida Kouassi went to the
juju men's village to beg forgiveness and make amends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm offering a bottle of liquor and the sum of" $2,000, he said,
"so that the village, through the perceptiveness of its wise men,
will continue to help the republic and, in particular, the minister
of sport." Africans are quick to point out that players from Western
nations practice their own form of juju when they wear lucky charms,
pray before an important match, cross themselves after the national
anthem or form a ritual huddle.</TE>
<TE>   Even basketball superstar Michael Jordan could be accused of
practicing a little juju for wearing his old University of North
Carolina shorts under his NBA uniform.</TE>
<TE>   But in Africa, there is little subtlety when it comes to
superstitions.</TE>
<TE>   In a 10-page special report, African Soccer magazine recently
documented how teams splatter pigeons' blood around the dressing room
to ward off evil spirits, bury the remains of animals in their
opponents' half of the field, and sacrifice cows, goats and other
animals to collect blood for players to bathe in.</TE>
<TE>   Some teams even slash their own players' bodies with razor blades
to rub a "magic dust" into their bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to get cut so much I was just like a ventilator," a former
South African player said. "They used to cut us everywhere.... They
would use the same razor blade on everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Another former Ivory Coast star recounted how at a previous
African Nations Cup, about 150 juju men set up camp in their hotel
rooms, making players take baths in large pots filled with various
concoctions. Despite the elaborate juju rituals, the Ivorians were
kicked out in the first round, losing to Egypt and Cameroon.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of soccer sorcery say that juju men merely psych up
players. They are no different from the sport psychologists that many
U.S. professional teams maintain on their staff.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson Ambani claims to have motivated some of the best players
in East Africa during his 40-year career as a juju man.</TE>
<TE>   The chalkboard tacked up to the front door of his one-room shack
in the sprawling Kangemi slum outside Nairobi, Kenya's capital,
advertises Ambani's day job as one of the hundreds of thousands of
faith healers throughout Africa. They use herbs and prayer to
ancestral spirits to cure malaria, gonorrhea, even lovesickness.</TE>
<TE>   During the soccer season, Ambani is in high demand. The top soccer
clubs in Kenya and even coaches from the national team come calling,
supplying Ambani with the names of the opposing teams' players.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the 74-year-old Ambani demonstrated how he puts the
names in a small terra-cotta urn, pours in the blood of chickens,
goats and other animals, and sprinkles in some of his special magic
dust, which he keeps in a plastic Skippy peanut butter container.
After plugging the holes in the urn with some goat horns, Ambani
fires up the brew on a kerosene stove.</TE>
<TE>   "When I do this, even though the other team may have good players,
they will never perform well," he said, breaking out in broad grin.</TE>
<TE>   "They will miss the ball and see things that are not on the field.
I am a spoiler."</TE>
<TE>   On some occasions, Ambani slips into soccer stadiums at dawn to
plant bones and parts of animals at "essential places" in the field.</TE>
<TE>   For his services, Ambani charges from about $20 to as much as
$2,000--depending on the level of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Ambani, who said he wore No. 7 when he played for his village
soccer team in western Kenya, said he enjoyed working and talking
sports with soccer players. But since he purchased a cellular phone,
his business has become a virtual Dial-a-Juju. His clients now simply
telephone in their order. When they don't pay, he reverses the hex on
them.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Musonye, secretary-general of the Council of East and
Central Africa Football Assns., which runs soccer in 13 countries,
said he has urged his members to stay away from Ambani many times, to
no avail.</TE>
<TE>   Across Africa, Musonye said, football associations use their
sizable "research budgets" to hire witch doctors and keep them happy.
Musonye lamented that the same groups pay their players small
stipends and fail to correct their poor diet or replace their ragged
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Juju doesn't work," Musonye said. "The road to success lies in
hard work, hard work and more hard work."</TE>
<TE>   He chuckled, then said: "If juju worked, then African teams would
win the World Cup every four years, but that still hasn't happened
once."</TE>

<HD>General Sees Cause to Keep Coalition Size</HD>
<DH>Military: Incoming chief of allied forces says the Afghan
mission is entering a more complex phase. He hints at a wider role
with Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The incoming commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan said
Thursday that remnants of Al Qaeda and Taliban leadership are still
in the country and that he doesn't believe the allied presence should
be scaled back.</LD>
<LD>   Rejecting the notion that the military mission in Afghanistan is
nearing completion, Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill said the war effort in many
ways is entering a more complex and difficult phase that will require
an ongoing commitment of substantial resources from the United States
and its allies.</LD>
<LD>   "We have scattered the enemy, we have given the enemy a good
chance to see what our capabilities are," the U.S. Army three-star
general said in an interview with The Times. "He'll work hard to
avoid our strength" and not become an easy target for coalition
forces.</LD>
<TE>   "That will compel us to work considerably harder to do the basic
things you have to do in this fight," McNeill said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the size of the coalition deployment in
Afghanistan--about 13,000 troops--is out of proportion to the demands
of the small border skirmishes that have characterized the war in
recent months, McNeill said flatly, "I don't think we have too much."</TE>
<TE>   McNeill, who was scheduled to assume control of the war effort
today, expressed concern that increasing tensions between Pakistan
and India could hamper the war effort against the Al Qaeda terrorism
network and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   But he also suggested that his tenure could mark growing
cooperation with Pakistan in an effort to apprehend Al Qaeda fighters
seeking refuge there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not out of the realm of possibility that we could work
outside the Afghan border," McNeill said of the coalition forces,
though he added that such decisions are a diplomatic matter "beyond
my purview." In recent weeks, small groups of coalition soldiers have
joined government troops in Pakistan searching for Al Qaeda
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said one of his first orders of business will be to
determine whether the coalition has "the right pieces and parts" for
a war that increasingly centers on guerrilla tactics rather than
conventional battles.</TE>
<TE>   But his remarks represent a clear signal that the U.S. is not
contemplating even a partial pullback from a country that has been
rid of all but fragments of Al Qaeda and the deposed Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said he does not know the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden
and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar or whether they are alive.
But the general said other Al Qaeda and Taliban figures remain in
Afghanistan, eager to regroup.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, McNeill said he expects key allies to continue
contributing large numbers of troops to the coalition. The U.S. plans
to rotate troops into and out of the region without significantly
reducing the size of its force.</TE>
<TE>   "My expectation would be that coalition forces would want to do
the same thing," he said of U.S. allies. "I think that's important
for a global war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, McNeill said he is hopeful that Britain will
replace nearly 1,600 troops scheduled to leave the region at the end
of June. The British government has not yet indicated whether it will
do so, but many expect its decision to hinge on whether the U.S.
presses for Britain's continued involvement.</TE>
<TE>   British troops have played a leading role in several recent
operations. For instance, hundreds of British troops were deployed
this week to patrol the Khowst region near the Pakistani border. But
there also has been some opposition within Britain to extending the
nation's commitment to the war.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of Britain's defense staff, Adm. Michael Boyce, visited
Bagram air base, north of Kabul, the Afghan capital, on Thursday and
said the Khowst deployment "may well turn out to be the last" mission
for the current contingent of British troops. But he did not say
whether they would be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill takes command at a fragile moment in Afghanistan. The
country is preparing for a loya jirga, or grand council, that will
meet in less than two weeks to select a new transitional government.
U.S. officials have expressed concern that Al Qaeda or Taliban
loyalists will try to disrupt the process with terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said that he is not aware of specific threats and that the
U.S. will play no formal role in providing security for the loya
jirga, which convenes June 10. But he said coalition forces will
continue to conduct operations around the country and patrol
Afghanistan's border with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rising tensions in the Kashmir region "could cause some
difficulties" for allied efforts as Pakistan moves soldiers from the
Afghan border toward the frontier with India, McNeill said. But he
stressed that Pakistan continues to be a key and cooperative partner
in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Ft. Bragg, N.C.,
is the first U.S. military leader in the region with authority over
virtually all elements of the operation. He reports to Gen. Tommy
Franks, who heads the Central Command in Tampa, Fla.</TE>

<HD>14 Al Qaeda Suspects in Pakistan Handed to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Fourteen suspected Al Qaeda militants, most of them Arabs, have been
arrested in Pakistan and others are under strict surveillance,
Pakistani government officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The English-language newspaper Dawn said that FBI agents took part
in the arrests and that the suspects were in U.S. custody.</LD>
<LD>   "The detainees were immediately handed over to the American
officials who took them to an undisclosed destination for
interrogation," Dawn newspaper said.</LD>
<TE>   The arrests were made Wednesday night in the northwestern city of
Peshawar near the Afghan border, an Interior Ministry official told
Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   "They are Sudanese, Algerians and Egyptians and a few others," he
said. "We are interrogating them and will decide their future
accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the U.S.-led
war on terrorism, said that small bands of Al Qaeda militants could
have crossed into the country from Afghanistan this week and vowed to
do his utmost to track them down with U.S. help.</TE>
<TE>   A law enforcement official in the port city of Karachi said some
suspected members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network had been living
in Pakistan's urban areas and were being closely watched.</TE>
<TE>   He said most of them were living in Afghan refugee camps on the
outskirts of Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   "They are under vigilance, and if we get some concrete information
about their involvement in illegal activities we will take action,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Afghanistan on Thursday, U.S. forces released 50
villagers captured in a midnight raid last week that they said was
aimed at rounding up leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Band Taimore, site of the May 24 operation, 50 miles
west of Kandahar, claimed that five people detained in the raid
remained in American custody. U.S. officials had no immediate comment
on the release or any detainees they still might be holding.</TE>

<HD>In China, Private Schools Give It the Old College Try</HD>
<DH>Asia: Sparse government support makes fledgling
universities a promising but risky investment, for educators and
students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>XIAN, China</DL>
<LD>They should be back home farming, or working in a factory.</LD>
<LD>   But instead they're chilling out on a college campus, chatting
about computers and international business.</LD>
<LD>   Chai Chao and He Yanping belong to a new generation of Chinese
university students: They had failed the country's rigorous college
entrance exam, but they're still getting a college education.</LD>
<TE>   Disappointment is a way of life in a country where only about 10%
of college-age students get a higher education. There simply aren't
enough public universities in the world's most populous country.</TE>
<TE>   An education revolution, however, has been sweeping the land.</TE>
<TE>   Private universities, decimated along with every other form of
private enterprise after the Communists took over in 1949, are back
in business. Millions of high school students like Chai and He now
have a second chance to change their destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "My father is a factory worker. He said if I could go to college,
it doesn't matter what kind it is. I must learn something to make
myself more marketable," said Chai, 22, a computer major at Xian
International University here in central China's Shaanxi province.</TE>
<TE>   Yet so far, China's fledgling private universities fall far short
of the status symbols they are in the West. Instead, they are dogged
by image problems, accused of being money-grubbing and substandard.</TE>
<TE>   In a society where public schools still rule, lukewarm government
support has helped make private higher education a promising but
risky investment, both for the educators and their students.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I feel the stigma," He said. "Lots of employers won't
even consider graduates from private colleges. That's why a lot of
people would rather go to a mediocre state school than a good private
school."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the last five decades, education has been a Communist
monopoly. Breakneck economic growth in the last 20 years, however,
forced Beijing to relax its grip so more youngsters could be better
prepared for the competitive global economy.</TE>
<TE>   In principle, the party still considers academia a training ground
for the elite. Indoctrinating young minds is a lofty job suitable
only for the state. In reality, private schools fill a critical gap
in the public education system.</TE>
<TE>   In less than 20 years, China's private schools have grown from
zero to about 1,300, surpassing the 1,000 state universities and
accounting for about 36% of total enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   But Beijing keeps the schools on a tight leash: Private colleges
are permitted to recruit only students rejected by public
universities, and the majority of the private institutions are barred
from conferring degrees and not allowed to operate for profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Running a private university is an enormous challenge," said Gao
Ling, head of the Xian Village and Township Enterprises University,
also based here. "Every one of us has had to fight just to stay
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Although the education market is shrinking in many developed
countries, it is exploding in China, with about 230 million
school-age children--practically the entire population in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   China's public universities are notoriously out of reach,
especially for youngsters from the poorer inland provinces. That
should leave plenty of wiggle room for China's burgeoning private
schools. Yet less than 7% of them are allowed to offer bachelor's
degrees. For now, most Chinese private universities function like
adult schools or community colleges in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Since their peak in the mid-1990s, droves of private schools have
shut down, victims of management and funding troubles. But others are
flourishing, especially those who manage to gobble up smaller
competitors, secure solid investors and elevate academic reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Xian International University is one of the success stories.
Founded 10 years ago by a former farmer, the school initially had
only 200 students and some rented high school classrooms. The school
drifted from temporary shelter to shelter--a barracks on a shooting
range, rooms in a veterans retirement home. Finally, it got lucky.</TE>
<TE>   An amusement park built by a rural entrepreneur was skirting
bankruptcy and searching for a partner. A deal was cut, and today the
college's sprawling campus is home to more than 16,000 students, one
of the largest private universities in the country and one of only
five in the province allowed to offer a bachelor's degree.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the first one in my family to go to college," said a proud
He, a cotton farmer's son studying international business. "Sometimes
I feel embarrassed and defensive because I didn't get into a public
school. But society is changing so much, it's up to us to change our
lives."</TE>
<TE>   That underdog feeling motivates good private schools to try to
outperform their public rivals. They strive to be less bureaucratic
and more democratic. If students don't like a professor, they can get
him removed. If job placement is poor in a certain department, it may
be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "To survive in this business, we can't afford to think of
ourselves only as educators. We also need to be businessmen and
politicians," said Li Ruochi, an administrator at the Xian
International University. "This is why many schools fold. They don't
have the combination of skills."</TE>
<TE>   That's what's killing Gao, the head of the struggling Village and
Township Enterprises University just across town.</TE>
<TE>   Because China's private schools lack the wealth of endowment that
enables private institutions to thrive in the West, they rely heavily
on business partnerships to raise funds.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old wine exporter with no education experience outbid
a dozen other entrepreneurs last year to invest in the 14-year-old
technical college.</TE>
<TE>   Then everything that could go wrong did. A power struggle with the
school's aging but well-connected founders left Gao in a legal
quagmire. She's been tossed into jail and hit with debts. She sank
millions into a new building that never got off the ground. Worst of
all, the students fled. The onetime 3,000-strong campus now can
barely hold on to 100 stragglers.</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew what I was getting myself into, I would have never done
it," Gao said from her office on the nearly deserted campus.</TE>
<TE>   Private universities also lack resources to cultivate their
teaching staff. They settle instead for retired public school
professors or inexperienced young graduates. No matter how good life
is on campus, students complain of second-class treatment on the
outside. The most obvious disadvantage is that they can't qualify for
student loans or buy half-price train tickets, privileges enjoyed by
their peers in public universities.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely feel a head shorter than students from public
schools," Liu Chunlan, 23, an English major, said from her dorm at
Xian International University.</TE>
<TE>   The state is working on a law to give private schools and their
investors better legal protection. For many struggling schools, it
might be too little too late. Desperate for survival, they are
pulling all the stops--TV ads, billboards, train and bus station
recruitment stalls--to win students.</TE>
<TE>   But that strategy has sometimes backfired, reinforcing the
negative stereotype that private colleges are in it only for the
money</TE>
<TE>   "This school is easy to get in but hard to get out of," said Liu
Lu, a student at the Shaanxi Sanzi Enterprises Institute, a
medium-sized technical college in Xian. She complained that the
school is nothing like it was advertised and she wants out.</TE>
<TE>   But despite her pleas, officials have yet to return her tuition
money. "They sees us as income, not students."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel totally cheated," said Jin Zhe, another recent dropout
from the school. "What we got here is college-level courses, high
school-level facilities and elementary school-level management."</TE>
<TE>   Mu Jinguo, the former farmer who founded the school, admits that
it has a long way to go to meet public school standards. But he begs
his students to be patient.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the same resources," he said. "We may not produce
rocket scientists. But we offer young people a way to escape the life
of a manual laborer. To become a stronger nation, China needs more
schools like us."</TE>

<HD>Ancient Secrets to Success</HD>
<DH>'The Art of War,' written 2,400 years ago, retains its
relevance as a treatise on winning. Its author has cult status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Legions of followers swear by his advice. His disciples include CEOs,
celebrity agents, sports coaches and TV mob boss Tony Soprano.
Hollywood has turned his how-to book into a movie, and fans on the
Internet parse his every word.</LD>
<LD>   Deepak Chopra? L. Ron Hubbard?</LD>
<LD>   Try Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese military strategist who's been
dead for 2,400 years.</LD>
<TE>   Sun was the author of "The Art of War," a basic but canny guide to
outwitting and conquering the enemy in battle. The treatise, a
classic in military annals, was written for a beleaguered Chinese
warlord at the same time the pharaohs ruled Egypt and the Greeks
worshiped Zeus.</TE>
<TE>   Over the centuries, Sun's insights have made him a household name
in China, despite his murky historical origins. But two millenniums
have also transmogrified Sun and his work into something no one could
have foreseen: an international cottage industry that touts him as a
self-help guru and his book as a must-read for anyone wanting to
succeed in politics, the boardroom, even the boxing ring.</TE>
<TE>   Its lessons in combat tactics and troop management have made "The
Art of War" a standard text in business school classes from Malaysia
to Massachusetts in recent years. For inspiration in waging election
campaigns, the late Lee Atwater, a cunning political consultant,
always kept handy his marked-up copy of the book, which he called
"the most succinct strategy document ever written."</TE>
<TE>   Other adherents include super-agent Michael Ovitz and boxing
promoter Don King. Former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby
Knight, now at Texas Tech, was fond of intoning passages from "The
Art of War" during interviews.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Internet was abuzz with
conversation among fans who combed the treatise for clues to the
terrorists' mind-set and tactics and to how the U.S. might respond.</TE>
<TE>   The book is a slender volume peppered with vivid metaphors and
memorable one-liners perfect for today's sound-bite era. Devotees
quote from it the way literature lovers cite Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   Want to beat your competition at its own game? Then "know your
enemy and know yourself, and in a hundred battles you will never face
defeat," as one of Sun's most famous proverbs goes. Another
well-known aphorism reminds aggressors that the ablest leaders know
how to win fights without fighting. Good preparation is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "War is a deceitful game," Sun wrote. Therefore, espionage,
disinformation, mind games and stealth are all legitimate weapons in
a skillful warrior's armory.</TE>
<TE>   Exploit your enemy's weaknesses, Sun counseled. Sow confusion in
his ranks. Be flexible. And remember: "Speed is everything.... An
army should move as fast as a gale ... [and] act as suddenly as a
thunderclap."</TE>
<TE>   Such pithy pearls of wisdom have turned Sun into arguably the
best-known ancient Chinese thinker in the West after Confucius, who
was roughly one of his contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   That Sun continues to captivate so many people from around the
world, in so many walks of life, is a point of pride in the land of
his birth.</TE>
<TE>   "This book has spanned both time and space. Two thousand years
later, it's still popular and shows a lot of vitality," said Xie
Guoliang, past president of the Sun Tzu Research Society in China.
"It's China's treasure--and the world's treasure too."</TE>
<TE>   Many of his ideas are now figures of everyday speech in China,
such as "Yi yi dai lao," a loose equivalent of "Pick your battles."
Teachers commonly use the phrase to admonish students to conserve
their strength for their college-entrance exams.</TE>
<TE>   One of Beijing's biggest bookstores stocks more than 100 titles
applying Sun's precepts to everything from business deals to romantic
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Amazon.com offers dozens of books that expound or expand
on Sun's principles. One translation of his book recently ranked
among the Web site's 100 bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales got a big boost last year when Tony Soprano, the
navel-gazing Mafia don on the hit show "The Sopranos," confessed his
admiration of "The Art of War" to his therapist. A paperback version
put out by Oxford University Press jumped from selling fewer than
1,000 copies a month to 16,000 in the month after the episode aired,
with an extra printing of 25,000 to meet demand, said Sara Leopold,
Oxford's U.S. spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The publishing house followed up with an ad campaign aimed at
business executives ("Tony Soprano fears no enemy. Sun Tzu taught him
how.") and another marketing push around Father's Day ("For the head
of your family").</TE>
<TE>   "It's always one of our top sellers. Even currently it's the No. 2
book we sell to Barnes &amp; Noble," Leopold said. "You can sort of dip
into it. It's a classic, and people recommend it to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all his enduring popularity centuries after he led
soldiers with crossbows and chariots into battle, very little is
known about Sun--only stray facts and stories passed down in legends
and some ancient historical records.</TE>
<TE>   Tradition holds that Sun lived around the 6th to 5th century BC,
the "Spring and Autumn" period in China when the land was carved up
among feuding regional states.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Sun Wu to an aristocratic family with a military
background. (Sun Tzu, as he is now universally known, means "Master
Sun.") As a young man, he attached himself to the lord of the state
of Wu, who was looking nervously over his shoulder at a bigger,
stronger neighboring kingdom, the Chu.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Sun was apparently a neophyte when it came to battle,
but he had a brilliant mind able to summarize and synthesize the
military philosophy he'd absorbed from his family. According to
tradition, he presented his patron with a 13-chapter volume on how to
wage war effectively, covering such topics as troop deployment,
fake-out techniques, the use of spies, political support back home
and the vagaries of terrain and weather.</TE>
<TE>   "War is a matter of vital importance to a state, involving life or
death, survival or doom," the book begins solemnly, "so it calls for
serious study."</TE>
<TE>   Records say that Sun's first foray into combat proved wildly
successful. Through cunning stratagems, which involved crying
"wolf"--or "war"--enough times to lull the Chu forces into
complacency, the lord of Wu was able to defeat his more powerful
rival.</TE>
<TE>   After that, details about Sun virtually disappear from historical
archives.</TE>
<TE>   His war manual lived on, added to by scores of Chinese
commentators through the ages with their own musings and
interpretations of Sun's thought. The earliest known copy is one
discovered in Shandong province, written on bamboo strips sometime
during the Western Han period (approximately 202 BC to AD 9).</TE>
<TE>   Whether "The Art of War" was actually penned by Sun, or put
together later by his heirs and apprentices, has become subject to
debate among scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its true authorship, the influence of the book on modern
warfare is astonishing. Napoleon is reputed to have read it. After
World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm allegedly moaned that Germany wouldn't
have lost if he had known of Sun's teachings beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   Mao Tse-tung used it to bring the Communists to power in China. To
this day, officers of the People's Liberation Army, the world's
largest standing military force, study Sun's doctrines.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, "The Art of War" surfaced during the Persian Gulf
War. Copies of the book traveled with U.S. Marines to Saudi Arabia;
the Marine Corps even sent out versions of the book on tape for
troops to listen to on their Walkmans.</TE>
<TE>   Retired U.S. Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, a former ambassador to China,
has been a fan since he read the book as a cadet.</TE>
<TE>   Prueher says he drew on Sun for guidance while serving in Vietnam
and the Middle East, and later back in the U.S. while helping the
Navy develop strike tactics, especially the use of surprise and
deception. "I haven't ever found things he's said to be wrong, which
is pretty good," Prueher said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the Chinese government detained 24 crew members of
a U.S. spy plane that made an emergency landing in southern China, "I
dragged out Sun Tzu again and said, 'How are they [Chinese officials]
thinking about this?'" recalled Prueher, who was in his final month
as U.S. ambassador at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's aggressive attitude made Prueher think of an injunction
by Sun about dissembling: Act strong when you're weak, and act weak
when you're strong.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone's overbearing, you think, OK, where's their weak
point here? What are they trying to cover up?" Prueher said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Prueher and other U.S. officials were able to devise a
strategy to win release of the crew. Part of it, insiders say, played
off Beijing's apparent desire to quickly publicize U.S. statements of
regret over the death of a Chinese fighter pilot in the collision
that brought down the American craft and over the spy plane's
landing.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's eagerness to broadcast its "victory" gave the U.S. some
leverage, echoing Sun's injunction to "wrest from [the enemy] what he
cherishes most, and he will have to comply with your wishes."</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, however, Sun's theories are more likely to be applied to
more mundane activities, such as making money.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred by the book's complete lack of a plot, Hollywood
released a film two years ago loosely based on "The Art of War," a
thriller of the same name starring Wesley Snipes that took in $30.2
million at the box office amid mixed reviews and a confusing story
line. Another cinematic adaptation, starring Jackie Chan, is in the
works by a Hong Kong production company.</TE>
<TE>   Off screen, Sun's work is regularly cited by CEOs as the book that
has had the most impact on the way they do business. They follow his
cues on good leadership and try to find ways to outflank their
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   For Dorothy Famiano of DigitalBay.net, a small Web development
company based in Florida, one of the most helpful lessons she took
away from "The Art of War" was the need to be flexible, to modify
battle plans as conditions shift.</TE>
<TE>   "I compete with some of the largest development companies in the
world. I've gone in with a best-laid plan, and my competitors have
blown me away," she said. But after regrouping, proposing new ideas
and pointing out her company's strengths and her competition's
weaknesses, Famiano has beaten out bigger rivals for contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be constantly ready for change," she said. "And you
have to be ready to counterattack from all angles."</TE>
<TE>   The capitalist graveyard is littered with the corpses of companies
that failed to follow principles outlined by Sun, argues Mark
McNeilly, a marketing strategist for IBM and the author of "Sun Tzu
and the Art of Business."</TE>
<TE>   Take faltering discount chain Kmart. It "tried to out-Wal-Mart
Wal-Mart." McNeilly said. "They attacked Wal-Mart on its biggest
strength, which is its cost model. Well, no one out-Wal-Marts
Wal-Mart. It failed."</TE>
<TE>   In the West, generals and tacticians often think of matching
strength against strength and trying to overpower an opponent that
way. "Sun Tzu is more about finding where my opponent's weakness is,"
McNeilly said, adding, "In the West, that might be considered
somewhat unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Others might consider it common sense.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one of the biggest criticisms of "The Art of War" is that
it simply states the obvious, that it contains nothing a 12-year-old
wouldn't instinctively know going into a fight against a schoolyard
bully: Size up your strength and his weakness. Fool him if you can.
Strike fast. Retreat if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But Sun Tzu was the first to integrate these ideas and lay them
out in systematic, logical and vivid fashion, his acolytes contend.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say a lot of the things in the book should be common
sense. But evidently they're not," said DigitalBay's Famiano,
"because the people who use the book religiously seem to be the most
successful."</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>An appeals court in the western Mexican state of Jalisco on Thursday
overturned the acquittal of two Huichol Indians in the 1998 killing
of U.S. journalist Philip True and sentenced them to 13 years in
prison, the minimum for intentional homicide.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous ruling by the three-judge Jalisco State Superior
Tribunal followed years of struggle by True's widow, Martha, and his
employer, the San Antonio Express-News.</LD>

<HD>Spielberg to Add B.A. to His Resume</HD>
<DH>Graduation: Director is finishing what he started 37 years
ago at Cal State Long Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So here's Steven Spielberg, the man who defined blockbuster, the man
with three Oscars, not to mention Emmys, Golden Globes and lifetime
achievement awards. He's even got five honorary doctorates, the last
one on Monday from Yale.</LD>
<LD>   But during the fall semester of 2001, Spielberg wrote a term paper
for his Natural Science 492 class at Cal State Long Beach, fulfilling
a general education requirement to earn the one credential missing
from his astonishing resume: Bachelor of arts, with an option in
film/video production.</LD>
<LD>   "He turned in his term paper just like everyone else," said
professor Donald J. Riesh. "It was longer than most, well-written and
no grammatical errors."</LD>
<TE>   Today, 34 years after he dropped out, Spielberg plans to wear a
$40 cap and gown his staff rented from the campus bookstore, sit
among some 500 graduates of the College of Arts, and when his name is
called, walk across the stage to receive his diploma.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to accomplish this for many years as a thank-you to my
parents for giving me the opportunity for an education and a career,"
Spielberg said in a statement. "And as a personal note for my own
family--and young people everywhere--about the importance of
achieving their college education goals."</TE>
<TE>   When he flips his mortarboard tassel from right to left, the
little film school at Cal State Long Beach will never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "People have told me, 'Oh, I didn't know Cal State Long Beach has
a film program.' And now people in Paris and Tokyo are hearing about
us," said Sharyn Blumenthal, director of the Film and Electronic Arts
Department. "We were already climbing, and this is going to put us on
the map. This raises the credibility of our degree."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when Blumenthal chats with folks from the American Film
Institute, when she's promoting student films at festivals, she, too,
will have a name to throw around, just as USC has George Lucas and
UCLA, Francis Ford Coppola. And finally, one of the top three
executives at DreamWorks SKG has a college degree. Neither David
Geffen nor Jeffrey Katzenberg has one.</TE>
<TE>   Not since Steve Martin put a fake arrow through his head during
the 1989 commencement speech has Cal State Long Beach gotten so much
media attention, said President Robert C. Maxson. Savvy enough to see
a public relations bonanza at hand, Maxson wove in his favorite
university facts during interviews this week, which included CBS News
and the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know that there are 350 valedictorians on full
scholarships attending Cal State Long Beach? .... Did you know that
other celebrities came here? Karen and Richard Carpenter .... Do you
know that there were 41,000 applicants for 7,000 freshman slots?"</TE>
<TE>   But the most asked question at Cal State Long Beach this week is:
Did Spielberg really earn his degree?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he wrote term papers. Yes, he had to take a few general
education courses. No, he never sat in a classroom and took notes,
completing all the requirements through independent studies.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, he passed out of FEA 309, the advanced filmmaking class.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, he got credit" for "Schindler's List," which not only
earned Spielberg Academy Awards for best director and best film, but
also satisfied his most important film school requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that counts as an advanced, 12-minute, polished film,"
Blumenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant film school professor Rory Kelley, who never met with
Spielberg, wrote a brief critique of two films--"Close Encounters of
the Third Kind" and "Jaws"--to determine whether this returning
student had a firm grasp of lighting, sound, editing and script
management. He did.</TE>
<TE>   Federal privacy laws guarding student records, not a
confidentiality contract with Spielberg, prohibited Kelley and others
from revealing his grade or details of his work.</TE>
<TE>   But let's just say that Kelley described Spielberg as the "star
student" of his teaching career. "It would have been ridiculous to
ask him to come back and make another film."</TE>
<TE>   It took Spielberg about two semesters to complete the
requirements, but talks over how to accommodate his special needs
began about 18 months ago, when Spielberg first contacted the film
school.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason that he gave is that he wanted to do it for his
children," Maxson said. "It's obvious his motive is not financial or
career-driven."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg, 55, first enrolled at Cal State Long Beach in 1965, but
dropped out three years later, just shy of his degree. The following
year, his 22-minute "Amblin"--about a young man and a young woman who
meet in the desert and decide to travel together, becoming friends
and lovers--was shown at the Atlanta Film Festival. That led to a
contract with a Hollywood studio.</TE>
<TE>   For his return to college, Spielberg was allowed to register under
a pseudonym to protect his privacy. Only a handful of administrators
and professors handling his courses knew who the man behind the false
name really was.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Riesh, a zoologist and expert in ocean pollution
off the Southern California coast. Riesh supervises upper-division
science-related interns, who receive 3 units for working in the field
and submitting a one-page resume.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see," he said. "I had two students at the Long Beach
Aquarium, one with the Army Corps of Engineers, one at Vector Control
and one at Amblin ... Entertainment, you know."</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the semester, Riesh met at least once in
Spielberg's office, and the two talked biology for hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed quite a bit about the demise of dinosaurs--'Jurassic
Park' stuff," Riesh said. "He told me about all the books he had
read, and how he had watched hundreds of hours of footage of running
elephants and giraffes to make the film."</TE>
<TE>   They talked about astronomy--"E.T."--and marine
biology--"Jaws"--and Riesh said he advised his student to continue to
show respect for the environment in future films.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very courteous, very humble," Riesh said. "He had his leg
up on his desk when I came in, but explained that he had been riding
his son's scooter and fell."</TE>
<TE>   Students in Natural Science 492 are typically required to write a
term paper about their on-the-job experiences, which Spielberg did.
Their final grade also includes a supervisor's evaluation for
dependability and the student's ability to follow instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Because Spielberg does not have a boss, Riesh said, "I did talk to
colleagues about his working relationships," but declined to name
names. "And his office staff was certainly friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Riesh also made another exception for Spielberg, allowing his
resume to run longer than one page.</TE>
<TE>   Upon completing his courses, Spielberg's degree check, like all
students', was processed anonymously through administration.
Spielberg's, along with about 6,000 others, received the seal of
approval for the Class of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, right before the big screening of student
films, Blumenthal went public with their surprise graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a joke," said student Tamara Roberts, 28,
director of the 12-minute "Silent Awakening," about the relationship
between a doctor and a patient. "Every time we would talk about
graduation, we would say, 'Oh yeah, we're going to walk with Steven
Spielberg,' and everyone would laugh, 'Yeah, right.'"</TE>
<TE>   Then the official university press release went out.</TE>
<TE>   The student store took a reservation for his cap and gown. "We
just finished steaming it out. I think it's going to be delivered to
him," a clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Maxson, only half-joking, suggested that perhaps Spielberg will
donate the gown to the school, "so we hang it up like a football
jersey."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily 49er newspaper editorialized about student concerns over
the media onslaught, warning administration that the hoopla "is doing
nothing more than taking quite a bit away from every other senior
that is graduating."</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. The media will be corralled, the photographers
confined to a special two-level platform.</TE>
<TE>   Film school graduates, meanwhile, have been told to behave

<HD>Colorado Teen Letter Perfect in 1st Try at National
Spelling Bee</HD>
<DH>Contest: Pratyush Buddiga, 13, is the first public school
student in three years to finish first, enduring 11 rounds and
beating 249 competitors. His final word on the matter:
'prospicience.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After slowly and deliberately working his way through a mountain of
words, a Colorado seventh-grader spelled "prospicience"--meaning
foresight--to win the 75th Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee.</LD>
<LD>   Pratyush Buddiga, 13, survived 11 rounds, outlasting 249 other
contestants who began the competition Wednesday. He took home an
engraved trophy and $12,000.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think I really had a chance to win," he said. "I just
wanted to be in the top five."</LD>
<TE>   The first public school student to win the competition since 1999,
Pratyush attends Mountain Ridge Middle School in Colorado Springs.
His family hails from India, but Pratyush was born in New Zealand,
and the family came to the United States in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   A first-time competitor in the national bee, he went head-to-head
in the final rounds with Steven Nalley, 14, of Starkville, Miss.
Steven was returning for his second try at the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety spellers began the day onstage, having survived a 25-word
written test Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the final day of competition, contestants successfully worked
their way through words including "kakemono," "stultiloquence,"
"hermeneutics," "soavemente" and "toreutics."</TE>
<TE>   The final rounds featured sudden exits by several contestants who
seemed almost invincible.</TE>
<TE>   The capacity crowd gasped when Michael Hessenauer, 14, of Dublin,
Ohio, bowed out in Round 5, misspelling "verticil," which means a
circular arrangement, as with flowers or hairs, around a central
point. Michael was the highest-ranked speller returning from the 2001
competition. He tied for third last year, and was in the finals for
the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Erik M. Bolt, 14, of South Bend, Ind., one of two finalists making
their fourth trip to the competition, was among the final nine
contestants. He was eliminated in Round 7 on "badigeon," a cement
used to cover holes in wood or stone.</TE>
<TE>   Also eliminated was Mallika Thampy of St. Louis, younger sister of
the 2000 champ. She tripped up on "batture," a French word meaning an
elevated riverbed or seabed.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Cole, 14, of Boiceville, N.Y., another speller making her
fourth trip to the bee, correctly spelled "pugilist," a boxer, on
Wednesday, but was eliminated in the written test.</TE>
<TE>   Other finalists stumbled on these tough nuts: "throstle,"
"roriferous," "objicient" and "icteric," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's finals were broadcast live on ESPN, the cable sports
network. First Lady Laura Bush opened the broadcast with taped
comments, telling the contestants, "I am very proud of you. I hope
you'll always work hard at spelling and at reading. The more you
read, the better your spelling will become and the more your
vocabulary will grow."</TE>
<TE>   Among the guests of honor watching the competition Thursday was
Frank Neuhauser, 88, winner of the first National Spelling Bee in
1925. After he won, Neuhauser got to shake hands with President
Calvin Coolidge and received a hero's welcome in his hometown of
Louisville, Ky.</TE>

<HD>Mad Cow Scare Inspires Blood Donor Limits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>New U.S. limits on blood donations from some people who have spent
time in Europe take effect today to protect against mad cow disease,
and blood banks say they could face shortages.</LD>
<LD>   The restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration are a
precaution meant to keep the blood supply safe from the disease.
Scientists do not know whether the human form of the deadly illness
can spread through blood.</LD>
<LD>   Starting today, people will be banned from donating blood in the
United States if they have lived in France for five years or more
from 1980 to the present or have visited or lived in Britain for a
total of three months or more from 1980 to 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Also barred from donating is anyone who received a blood
transfusion in Britain from 1980 to the present, and current or
former military personnel and their dependents who spent six months
or more on military bases in northern Europe from 1980 to 1990 or in
southern Europe from 1980 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe people contract the human form of mad cow disease,
known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, by eating infected meat.
More than 100 people, most of them in Britain, have developed the
brain-wasting illness. No cases of the human or cattle disease have
been found in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   America's Blood Centers, which collects about half of the blood in
the United States, said it may lose more than 300,000 donations after
the new blood donor rules take effect.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to assure that blood will be available when it's needed,
regular donors need to give blood more often, and new donors must
replace those lost from the deferrals," Jeanne Dariotis, president of
America's Blood Centers, said in a statement.</TE>

<LD>   A college class devoted to Bill Clinton's presidency will be
offered in his native state next year, and a Republican will teach
it.</LD>
<LD>   University of Arkansas at Little Rock political science professor
Margaret Scranton is developing the curriculum and will teach the
class, set to serve as the prototype for the planned Clinton School
of Public Service at the Clinton Presidential Library. It will begin
in January.</LD>
<TE>   "The Clinton Presidency" will touch on the achievements and
travails of Clinton's political life--and the scandals and
controversies that dogged his private life.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Republican, it pains me to say we're talking about one of
the most effective campaigners that the country has ever seen,"
Scranton said.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to attract guest speakers such as Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich.</TE>

should be tried for heckling, a court in Austin ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Markovich was a university student in 1998 when he stood up
in the House gallery and yelled at Bush, who was speaking as part of
the Texas Book Festival. Markovich's attorney, Kenneth Houp, said the
outburst was prompted by a reference to Nicaragua Bush had made in
his speech.</LD>

<HD>Accidents on Mt. Rainier, Mt. Hood Kill 6 Climbers</HD>
<DH>Rescue: Air Force copter crashes on Oregon peak. The crew
and six other people are lifted to safety.</DH>

<DL>TIMBERLINE LODGE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Three climbers plunged to their deaths Thursday in a yawning glacial
crevasse atop Mt. Hood, setting up a dramatic rescue effort in which
an Air Force Reserve helicopter slammed into the icy summit and
rolled 1,000 feet down the mountain.</LD>
<LD>   All six helicopter crew members survived the crash, and six other
climbers trapped in the crevasse were safely lifted off the mountain
by the end of the day, though some were seriously injured.</LD>
<LD>   On Seattle's Mt. Rainier, meanwhile, rescuers recovered the bodies
of three climbers who died early Wednesday--a devastating debut to a
climbing season that typically draws tens of thousands of climbers to
the two Cascade peaks that loom above the Pacific Northwest's two
biggest metropolises.</LD>
<TE>   Dramatic images of the rescue on the 11,235-foot Mt.
Hood--Oregon's highest peak and one of the most frequently climbed
mountains in the world--were playing live on television when, shortly
before 2 p.m., a 20,000-pound Pave Hawk helicopter poised to pick up
the injured seemed to lose lift in the thin mountain air. It struck
the side of the mountain, then rolled to rest upside down on an icy
berm.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the six crew members were hurt. The news was worse for
nine climbers who earlier in the day lost their footing and plunged
down a 65-degree slope into a crevasse: Three were dead inside the
10- to 40-foot-deep chasm. Six others, including Thomas Hillman, 45,
a pastor at United Methodist Church in Windsor, Calif., were admitted
to Portland hospitals, four of them with serious injuries. Hillman
was listed in serious condition with a head injury and possible
hypothermia. His friend and climbing partner John Biggs, a former
United Airlines pilot also from Sonoma County, was not listed among
the injured.</TE>
<TE>   As dark fell, only two of the three bodies on Mt. Hood had been
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred on a relatively balmy morning, as a team of
six firefighters and their companions from the Tualatin Valley Fire
and Rescue Department moved toward the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Fire Marshal Cleve Joiner, who had brought his
14-year-old son, Cole, along on the climb, said his group was about
800 feet short of the summit, climbing below two teams of six other
people.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the team at the top lost their footing, plowing down
into the groups below them, taking a total of nine climbers into the
crevasse, Joiner said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just happened within a matter of 20 or 30 seconds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Joiner's son was one of the nine trapped in the crevasse. Joiner
used his cell phone to call 911, summoning rescuers, though he was
still unsure of the fate of his son.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through all kinds of emotions," he said. "A lot of people
in my family said, 'This is kind of a dangerous thing, are you sure
you want to do this?' I was worried about having to answer that kind
of call. And then when I found out he was alive, I just fought back
the tears and carried on.... At that point, you just have to kind of
turn it off and then say, 'OK, we're in rescue mode.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force Reserve's 935th Rescue Wing and the Oregon Army Air
National Guard immediately dispatched helicopters to the scene.
Rescue crews landed and dug out positions on the icy, 35-degree slope
and set up pulleys to haul the most seriously injured out of the
crevasse, aided by firefighters and Joiner's son below.</TE>
<TE>   They had pulled out one or more victims when the HH-60 Pave Hawk,
a special version of the military Black Hawk helicopter, seemed to
founder, then dipped, then rolled down the slope in a cascade of
snow. "Oh, if only this was a movie," the Northwest Cable News anchor
said as the incident unfolded live on television.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Livic, a rescuer with Timberline Ski Patrol, said the doomed
Pave Hawk was about to lift a victim when it began to lose control,
and an alert crew member quickly severed the cable that was attached
to the stretcher on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "The flight engineer knew, I think, that the bird was going down
and he severed the cable, or he would have dragged the patient,
myself, and three other guys that were holding onto the thing" down
the mountain, Livic said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of preservation of us, and sacrifice of themselves,"
Livic told reporters at the command post.</TE>
<TE>   As the helicopter rolled down the slope, crew members were being
thrown out by the centrifugal force, he said. Livic skied down to the
new accident scene and began to help.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopter pilots still on the ground at a command post set up at
Timberline Lodge ran to their machines and took off, and crew members
were pulled from the wreckage in relatively short order.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all alert and orientated, but some of them had some
potentially life-threatening injuries, so we just packaged them up,
got them the heck off the mountain," Livic said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Mull, a paramedic with American Mountain Rescue, said he
helped two people on the mountainside, both of them conscious. ''I
took care of one gentleman primarily,'' he said. ''He was in
disbelief. He knew others were hurt. He was scared, cold and wanted
to get down.''</TE>
<TE>   Storm Smith, community liaison officer for Tualatin Valley Fire
and Rescue, said there were two firefighters in the crevasse in
addition to Joiner's son. He said one firefighter had serious but not
life-threatening injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the firefighters who fell in the crevasse was a paramedic,
and he was attempting to provide some patient care at the scene, from
inside the crevasse, is my understanding," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Hillman's wife, Holly, said her husband--an avid athlete and
climber who has attempted 46 of the nation's 50 highest points--was
climbing with a friend from his parish as part of a group from
Oregon. She last talked to her husband Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He assured me that everything was under control," Hillman said.
"Evidently with the crevasse there, it was not."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, a Culver City native and father of three, also was a
long-distance bicyclist who has taken jaunts across Canada, Mexico
and the U.S. His risk-taking worries his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure it just goes with the territory to be married to an
adventurer," she said. "It's one of his passions, and I try not to
rain on his parade. But I'm not thrilled. No matter what you say,
that's the way he is. So you might as well go with the flow."</TE>
<TE>   On Mt. Rainer, what had begun as a rescue mission Wednesday became
a body recovery operation by Thursday, when the remains of three
climbers who died Tuesday night were brought down off the 14,411-foot
peak.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth climber survived the party's harrowing encounter with
70-mph winds and blowing snow atop Rainier's most treacherous summit
route, along Liberty Ridge. It was his phone call to authorities that
set up Wednesday's initial rescue attempt, which was postponed until
Thursday because of bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said three of the four climbers involved in the
accident were students at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Three
were German nationals, while an American woman, Keeta Owens--also an
Oregon State student--was among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   The party appeared to have good equipment and some climbing
experience when they were issued a permit by a park ranger and headed
out Saturday morning, said Lee Taylor, spokeswoman for Mt. Rainier
National Park.</TE>
<TE>   They planned to climb to the top of the mountain along the
difficult Liberty Ridge route within three days, but deep snow slowed
them down, and they were two days behind schedule by the time they
finally set out for the peak's secondary summit, Liberty Cap.</TE>
<TE>   "They encountered very severe weather, winds of up to 70 mph,
blowing snow, just nasty, nasty weather," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   When the group attempted to pitch their tents Tuesday night, the
wind snapped them in two. They split into two groups and began to dig
snow caves. One couple were successful and crouched inside, but the
other had trouble. "They would dig a hole, and no sooner would they
dig it than it would be filled with blowing snow. So it was very
tough," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men working on the second cave lost his footing and
fell down the slope, disappearing from view. His female companion,
her glasses fogged over and numb with cold, set out to find the
others and stumbled onto their ice cave, causing it to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really a terrible moment, I'm sure, because now they had
no tent, no shelter, and they were exposed to the snow and freezing
rain," she said. The man in the cave took what was left of the two
tents and wrapped it around the two women, but when he went to look
for the other man, he ended up falling down the same slope, coming to
rest just next to his friend's body.</TE>
<TE>   With one of his boots forced off his foot during the fall, the man
was unable to get back up to the women, and instead began climbing
down in the hope of summoning help. He encountered another party at
the 7,000-foot level by 11 a.m. Wednesday and was able to make a
phone call, but by the time help arrived, both women were dead.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of all three Germans were being withheld pending
notification of their families.</TE>
<TE>   About 11,000 climbers attempt Mt. Rainier each year, and about
half make it to the top. About 10,000 try Mt. Hood.</TE>
<TE>   While Thursday's accident had an unusually large number of
fatalities, authorities said falls and rescues near that crevasse are
relatively common. There is about one fatality a year on the peak,
the most recent of which was a week ago, when a climber attempted to
snowboard down the northeast side of the mountain, fell a long way
and died.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hornbein, one of several world-class mountaineers who hails
from Seattle, said Rainier is often underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's also the fact that even very skilled climbers doing
everything right in a high-risk environment will get nailed because
they are playing a game in a world that is not always predictable,"
he said. "I guess you could say their mistake is they shouldn't have
been there in the first place. But most of us don't sit home on our
couches watching TV all the time."</TE>

<HD>11 to Be Disciplined for Actions in Fatal Fire</HD>
<DH>Punishment: Forest Service workers may be fired after four
died in the Thirty Mile blaze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YAKIMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Eleven U.S. Forest Service employees should be disciplined for their
actions during the deadly Thirty Mile fire last summer in the North
Cascades, a multi-agency review team recommended Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed punishments range from losing their jobs with the
Forest Service, to being placed on leave without pay, to a letter of
reprimand in their personnel files.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow. You can blow me over with a feather," said Ken Weaver of
Yakima, whose son, Devin, was one of four firefighters killed July
10. "I assumed they would do nothing. I assumed they would do the
very minimum. I'm delighted they're doing something that seems like
the appropriate action."</LD>
<TE>   The Forest Service would not identify the 11 employees, and a
public posting of the report on the agency Web site has all names
blacked out. The agency also would not say how many of the 11 might
be fired.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 employees have three weeks to review and respond to the
proposed punishments, and the response would be taken into account
when a final decision is made.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service takes the safety of its employees and the
public seriously, and when rules aren't followed, we must redeem our
responsibility and take appropriate personnel actions," said Harv
Forsgren, the regional forester in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Also killed in the fire in the Okanogan National Forest were Tom
L. Craven of Ellensburg, Wash., Jessica L. Johnson of Yakima and
Karen L. FitzPatrick of Yakima. They were trapped with 10 other
firefighters and two campers in the narrow Chewuch River canyon when
the fire blew up.</TE>
<TE>   A Forest Service investigation after the fire concluded that fire
bosses and managers broke basic safety rules of firefighting and
disregarded numerous signs of danger.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration found that the Forest Service "willfully disregarded"
the safety of its employees at the Thirty Mile fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I still very firmly believe that the level of negligence that
occurred was criminal," Weaver said. "And I still believe that there
should be some sort of investigation and some sort of criminal case
brought."</TE>
<TE>   The multi-agency team that recommended the disciplinary action was
composed of a Forest Service employee from Montana, a Bureau of Land
Management employee from California and a senior investigator from a
private investigation team in Maryland. The names of the team members
are also blacked out in the public posting of the report and will not
be released.</TE>
<TE>   In further reviewing the performance of employees working the
Thirty Mile fire, the team found that there were inadequate fire and
safety briefings; the potential for extreme fire behavior was not
accurately assessed; firefighters disregarded basic safety rules and
warning signs; fire tactics were not reassessed once problems arose
during the fire, and there was inadequate preparation for deployment
of fire shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The four firefighters who died all deployed their emergency
shelters on a rocky slope and were killed by breathing superheated
air. A fifth firefighter, Jason Emhoff of Yakima, was seriously
burned when he abandoned his shelter on the slope and ran to a Forest
Service van.</TE>
<TE>   The Thirty Mile wildfire was the nation's deadliest since 1994.</TE>

<HD>FBI Given Broad Authority to Monitor Public Activities</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Ashcroft empowers agents to use the Web and
enter other restricted areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department on Thursday gave FBI agents sweeping new
powers to monitor the Internet, mosques, rallies and other
once-restricted areas in search of terrorists, sparking immediate
debate and condemnation from groups that say the changes hark back to
an era of civil rights abuses at the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, announcing the most radical rewrite of
the Justice Department's investigative code since the 1970s, said the
changes should unshackle the hands of thousands of FBI agents who
have been subject to overly burdensome regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Civil rights groups and Arab American advocates said the FBI's
expanded power to initiate investigations and spy on citizens without
evidence of a crime smacked of a "Big Brother" mind-set. But Ashcroft
and President Bush said no one should fear any infringement of their
civil liberties because of the revamped guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   "We intend to honor our Constitution and respect the freedoms that
we hold so dear," Bush told reporters. But at the same time, he said,
"We want to make sure that we do everything we can to prevent a
further attack--to protect America."</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, who just a day earlier
announced a broad reorganization of the bureau in the face of
mounting criticism over its failure to pursue pre-Sept. 11 terrorist
warnings, said the changes reflect "important steps to help remove
unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles to the effective investigation of
terrorist cases."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's more than 11,000 agents have been generally prohibited,
for instance, from surfing the Internet to look for bomb-making sites
or attending public rallies where a suspect might be present unless
it was part of a specific criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Those restrictions grew out of civil rights abuses in the 1960s
and 1970s when then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used investigators
to conduct domestic surveillance on controversial figures such as
Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft said the previous restrictions have given terrorists
a "competitive advantage" in outfoxing federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he issued guidelines Thursday--effective
immediately--that significantly loosen the reins on federal agents
and give them broader discretion to initiate investigations and track
down leads.</TE>
<TE>   Among other reforms, FBI agents in the bureau's 56 field offices
around the country will now be able to surf the Web in search of
terrorist material, use commercial data-mining services on the
Internet, attend any event open to the public and extend preliminary
investigations for up to a year without approval from Washington,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a top-to-bottom [overhaul]. The changes are
dramatic, not only in terms of substance but in terms of tone," said
a senior Justice Department official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charged that the guidelines mark a significant curtailment
of civil rights for law-abiding Americans, allowing the FBI to go on
fishing expeditions with little or no evidence. Some critics accused
the Bush administration of using the issue to divert attention from
the FBI's Sept. 11 intelligence failures.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, Atty. Gen. Ashcroft wants to get the FBI back in the
business of spying on religious and political organizations," said
Margaret Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision "threatens
core civil liberties guaranteed under the Constitution and Bill of
Rights."</TE>
<TE>   And Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security
Studies, a civil liberties group, said the FBI already had the
ability to conduct extensive monitoring activities given reasonable
suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of this [order] seems to me to simply eliminate all
of the existing review requirements, which were put in place to avoid
the political spying abuses of the past," Martin said. "The attorney
general seems to be saying, 'Make a list of anyone attending a
particular mosque in the name of preventing terrorism.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Southern California
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, asked: "Where
are the checks and balances?</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly in support of any effort to undermine terrorist
activities in this country," he said. "But we feel the approach of
those efforts have been directed toward law-abiding U.S. citizens who
happen to be of Arab or Muslim backgrounds, and if history is any
indication, based on the almost unlimited powers given to the FBI
back in the '60s, this won't be pleasant."</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines may also increase months of tensions between the
Justice Department and FBI detractors in Congress, particularly
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers promised that the changes--which do not require
congressional approval--will be closely scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   A Senate aide who asked not to be identified said some members are
irked that while Mueller gave them a closed-door briefing last week
previewing his plans for the FBI reorganization, Congress got no
advance warning about Ashcroft's overhaul of the investigative
guidelines. "That's par for the course with this attorney general,"
the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, which the Justice Department first began
considering last fall after the Sept. 11 attacks, come after weeks of
mounting criticism over the FBI's handling of terrorist
investigations. Criticism has focused largely on FBI headquarters'
failure to heed the warnings of field agents in Phoenix and
Minneapolis last summer concerning their suspicions about terrorists
studying at local flight training schools.</TE>
<TE>   New allegations surfaced Thursday from an FBI agent who worked in
counter-terrorism in Chicago in the 1990s. The agent, Robert G.
Wright Jr., charged at a news conference in Washington that FBI
officials "repeatedly thwarted and obstructed" his efforts to track
Islamic terrorist fund-raising in the United States and then demoted
him to a desk job.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI declined to comment on Wright's specific allegations but
noted that the bureau had spent "many thousands of investigative
hours" before and after Sept. 11 tracking terrorist financing in
Chicago, and that the probe drew no direct links to the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines apply primarily to FBI terrorist
investigations, but there are also provisions that give agents in
other federal agencies in the Justice Department and across the
federal government broadened discretion to use confidential
informants and consensual monitoring of conversations, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said they were seeking to "clarify"
previous department guidelines that offered sometimes murky
restrictions and were interpreted in practice as blanket prohibitions
on such things as surfing the Internet or attending public events.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines on FBI conduct specifically authorize "visiting
places and events which are open to the public for the purpose of
detecting or preventing terrorist activity."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, asked how that regulation would apply to mosques and
other religious institutions, said that "if a place is a place to
which the public is invited and in which the public is welcome, it is
a place in which the FBI is welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials stressed, however, that the FBI would
retain records of such visits only if they generated information
relating to criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   "The abuses that once have been alleged about the FBI decades ago,
about the keeping of files or records about prominent figures in this
country, would not be allowed either under the guidelines or under
the statutes regarding privacy, which are incorporated in the
guidelines," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials in Los Angeles declined to comment on the new
procedures. But agents elsewhere said the changes are likely to be
met enthusiastically by investigators in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Previous guidelines were "unreasonably artificial and
impractical," said a veteran agent who asked not to be identified.</TE>

<HD>Terror-Response Drugs Put on a Faster Track</HD>
<DH>Health: The FDA, in rare cases, will require only animal
tests when weighing approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Responding to the threat of anthrax and other forms of
chemical and biological terrorism, the Food and Drug Administration
adopted rules Thursday that will speed the approval of drugs that
could protect people from attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said that in some cases it would allow companies to
base applications on animal testing alone when assessing whether a
drug is effective. Previously, a drug's effectiveness had to be
tested on humans before the FDA would allow it onto the market.</LD>
<LD>   "The terrorist attacks of last fall underscored the acute need for
this new regulation," said Lester Crawford, the FDA's deputy
commissioner. "Today's action will help make certain essential new
pharmaceutical products available much sooner--those products that
because of the very nature of what they are designed to treat cannot
be safely or ethically tested for effectiveness in humans."</LD>
<TE>   The new rule, which was proposed in 1999 and took on a new urgency
last fall, was likened Thursday to the FDA's landmark decision a
decade ago to approve AIDS drugs that had not been fully tested by
previous standards. At that time, the FDA concluded that its standard
review process was impeding the manufacture of potentially lifesaving
drugs for people with AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Some consumer advocates said Thursday that they are wary of the
animal-testing rule, contending that its use could expand to other
less pressing concerns--just as the FDA's "fast track" approval
process for AIDS drugs was later used for many other medications.</TE>
<TE>   But Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, said use of the new rule, which the agency
considers "urgently needed," would be very limited.</TE>
<TE>   Woodcock said the FDA has "been struggling in a number of cases to
persuade applicants to go forward" with drugs to treat biological,
chemical and nuclear attacks. "When they couldn't ethically do human
trials, it has been very difficult to move forward," she said. "This
rule addresses that obstacle."</TE>
<TE>   She said that it would still take a year or more for companies to
design, undertake and complete their animal studies and that she
"would not expect a flood of products based on the rule."</TE>
<TE>   Woodcock called the new rule "narrowly drawn," saying that it
would usually require two or more animal tests, and that it could be
invoked only when all FDA testing standards are inappropriate. The
agency estimates that the new rule will be applied infrequently,
probably less than once a year.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Itching to Get Into the Battle</HD>
<DH>Crisis: Hundreds from across the country are on standby at
a staging center in Albuquerque, as the threat of fires grows in the
Southwest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of antsy firefighters from across the country are killing
time here at a large, dusty camp, playing cribbage and rummy,
watching movies or napping on stiff cots beneath Russian olive trees
in the still of the afternoon heat.</LD>
<LD>   They would rather be roiling in the adrenaline rush of a forest
fire--coughing acrid smoke, wiping their eyes clear of tears, wincing
at the stinging blisters caused by pounding hoes, rakes and axes into
rocky soil to clear dry brush ahead of oncoming flames.</LD>
<LD>   But for now, even as fires roar near Tucson and Santa Fe, N.M.,
these men and women must wait on standby at this onetime government
nursery, a sprawling 222 acres of soft sand and crumbling asphalt.</LD>
<TE>   With daybreak, they stir from their cots, lined up like dominoes
beneath massive blue, green and red-striped tents. Cooks in a
kitchen-equipped truck serve breakfast--chicken-fried steak, eggs,
biscuits and gravy, hash browns and plenty of salsa. In another
corner of the camp, they wait for their turn at truck trailers
equipped with showers and disposable towels.</TE>
<TE>   As fire camps go, this is as comfortable as any, but it's not
where these firefighters want to be. Their backpacks are cinched
tight, stuffed with clothes, paperback books, pictures of family,
boxes of raisins. They are waiting for the announcement across the
public address system, to cue up for a ride into the fire zone aboard
a turquoise school bus painted with the words, "Firefighters
Express."</TE>
<TE>   "The best part of this is, at least we're here and not back home,"
said Jessy Thurman, 20, one of a handful of seasonal firefighters
employed by the Mendocino National Forest in Northern California who
arrived here Monday after a hard, 2 1/2-day drive. "But the bad part
of this is, we're still here in this staging camp and not out there
working."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Willardson, 36, who drives a fire engine for the Montana
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, knows his patience
here will pay off.</TE>
<TE>   "Staging is a necessary evil. Nobody likes to sit around in
90-degree heat, doing nothing," said Willardson, who raises horses
and builds homes back in Coram, Mont. "But you have to, until it's
your turn to go out."</TE>
<TE>   This holding camp is testimony to how nervous officials are about
this fire season, which is growing more volatile in brittle-dry
Arizona and New Mexico with every passing week. Already, nearly a
quarter-million acres have burned this year in the Southwest and
Rocky Mountain states, and government forecasters say
hotter-than-normal temperatures are expected here this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Never before have so many firefighters been positioned in the
Southwest as a contingency. Their presence here--versus remaining at
their home camps two or three days away--can be critical in defeating
a blaze that can grow exponentially in its first few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the strategy may save lives, homes and tens of
thousands of acres of pines, junipers and desert brush.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the worst conditions I've ever seen, but at least we've
got fire crews here, in hand, ready to send out, and we'll be
bringing in more," said Brian Lee, who heads the multi-agency
Southwest Area Coordination Center.</TE>
<TE>   At the command center, housed at the National Forest Service
headquarters a few miles from the staging camp, a handful of men and
women coordinate the ebb and flow of firefighters, bulldozers,
airplanes--and food caterers, shower facilities and other supplies
and services--needed to battle fires in Arizona, New Mexico, western
Oklahoma and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   An overhead computer monitor displays weather fronts, lightning
strikes, even live "Web cam" video of ongoing fires.</TE>
<TE>   Down a hallway, meteorologist Chuck Maxwell charts the various
factors--humidity, precipitation deficit, fuel types, temperatures
and other criteria--that together create a fire-danger index.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as high as it's been in the past 30 years," he said. A
co-worker chimes in: "Parts of Arizona had the driest winter in 70
years."</TE>
<TE>   Such assessments last week prompted managers of various
firefighting agencies--the forest service, park service, Bureau of
Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and a host of state
agencies--to ask the national wildland firefighting headquarters in
Boise, Idaho, for 400 firefighters to be assigned to the staging camp
here.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't want to take chances: A dry weather front spewing
lightning was expected to sweep across northern Arizona and New
Mexico earlier this week, and scores of fires were anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters began arriving over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The dry storms failed to materialize, but the fire crews were kept
here anyway because the fire potential remains extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the firefighters are sent daily to nearby forests, to cut
fire lines and clear brush. Others have relieved tired crews near
Santa Fe and Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here was a release for me," said Denver Holder, 42, who
also works at a Canton, N.C., paper mill. "My job at the mill is done
in a 10-foot space, which is pretty confining. This job lets me get
out. And besides, all of us in the fire service are drug addicts.
We're adrenaline junkies."</TE>
<TE>   Kristina Okonski, a 22-year-old chemistry student from Libby,
Mont., normally works on a quick-response firetruck, extinguishing
small fires sparked by lightning before they grow out of control.
"I've never been on a big fire," she said. "I have no idea what to
expect. I'm excited to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Levon Loncassion, 22, a fine arts student, was biding his time in
camp this week drawing brightly colored, Southwest-flavored sketches
thick with Indian imagery.</TE>
<TE>   A Zuni Indian, he came here after hearing his pueblo's fire siren
last Friday, setting off a town of barking dogs and signaling Zuni's
firefighters to get in line--first-come, first-serve--to help form
another 20-man BIA fire crew. More than 25 crews already have gone
out this year.</TE>
<TE>   "With overtime, I can make almost $2,000 in 14 days," Loncassion
said. "I can't make that anywhere else. But if there's no fire, we're
only getting paid for eight hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one reason we want to go out on a fire. The money. But
we're restless," he said. "We want go to out to a fire. We're here to
do a job."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it would spend
$20.6 million to enable laboratories in 15 states, including
California, to assist the government in case of a major animal
disease outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   The money was part of a $43-million package allotted to states to
strengthen food and farm security. Most of the remaining money will
be used to help states improve how they detect and respond to an
animal disease outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   Top USDA officials, including Agriculture Secretary Ann M.
Veneman, traveled throughout the country to announce the funding.</LD>
<TE>   "States and local communities, along with academia and the private
sector, are critical partners in making sure we are prepared in the
event of an emergency," said Veneman, in Detroit for the
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   USDA said it wanted state animal research facilities to be able to
help federal labs should they be overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent government and private assessments have criticized
USDA labs for lax security and dilapidated facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The funds are part of $328 million appropriated by Congress to
improve agriculture security.</TE>

<HD>Guard Sentenced for Lying to FBI</HD>
<DH>Court: A hotel worker falsely linked an Egyptian to a pilot
radio after Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A security guard was sentenced Thursday to weekends in jail for six
months for lying to the FBI about the location of a pilot radio found
in a hotel room near the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   An Egyptian student was jailed for a month after the hotel guard,
Ronald Ferry, said the pilot radio was in a locked safe in the
student's room overlooking the trade center.</LD>
<LD>   Ferry, 48, a former Newark, N.J., police officer, apologized
Thursday. U.S. District Judge George Daniels told him, "We can only
protect ourselves if we protect each other."</LD>
<TE>   The student, Abdallah Higazy, 31, had insisted he knew nothing
about the hand-held device, called a transceiver, which enables
pilots to communicate with other pilots or to monitor pilot
conversations. The radio was found after the hotel was evacuated
because of the Sept. 11 attack.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy, the son of an Egyptian diplomat, was charged with making
false statements to investigators. Prosecutors dropped the charges
against him after a private pilot, another hotel guest, went to claim
his belongings on Jan. 14 and said the radio was his.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators went back to Ferry, who changed his story to say the
radio had been found on a table in the room rather than in a locked
safe, raising the possibility that someone had put the radio in
Higazy's room after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy watched the sentencing Thursday from a courtroom bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm upset that the punishment is so lame," he said.</TE>

<HD>Boston Cardinal Reassigned 3rd Accused Priest, Documents
Say</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>As recently as 1998, Cardinal Bernard Law assigned a priest accused
of pedophilia to work as a hospital chaplain, new documents from the
sex scandal roiling the Roman Catholic Church show.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald H. Paquin, 59, who was stripped of his rights as a priest
in 2000, is the third cleric this year whose history as a child
abuser was described in Boston archdiocese personnel records. Paquin,
like Father Paul Shanley and former priest John J. Geoghan, was
reassigned rather than removed from duties in the face of complaints.</LD>
<LD>   All three received psychiatric treatment for sexual problems, and
in each case, Law--the senior U.S. prelate--appears to have approved
new jobs for the priests in which they might have contact with
children.</LD>
<TE>   Paquin was indicted May 15 on three counts of child rape. He is
being held on $500,000 bail in a Massachusetts jail.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, 71, was extradited from San Diego on May 2. He has
pleaded not guilty to child rape and also is in jail, with bail set
at $300,000. He has been named in a series of civil suits against Law
and the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan, 63, was sentenced in January to nine to 10 years in
prison for fondling a child. More than 200 people have accused
Geoghan of sexual abuse; 86 alleged Geoghan victims have filed a
civil lawsuit against Law and the archdiocese, and many others are
expected to join the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment on the Paquin matter, archdiocese spokeswoman
Donna M. Morrissey issued a written statement Thursday that said,
"Due to ongoing litigation, there are many documents in the public
domain.... Under the advice of legal counsel we will not be
commenting on the specifics of those cases." Attorney Jeffrey A.
Newman, who represents several alleged Paquin victims, said Thursday
that he would not comment on the new documents because depositions
are in progress in suits against the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   The rash of complaints involving Paquin are detailed in documents
released to the Boston Globe. The newspaper in January helped ignite
the church sex abuse scandal by publishing previously confidential
church records that demonstrated a pattern of protecting Geoghan at
the expense of parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   Excerpts from the Paquin documents, published Thursday in the
Boston Globe, show that Paquin was assigned to ministerial duties in
parishes north of Boston despite 13 complaints from 1990 to 1996 that
alleged sexual problems over the previous 20 years. According to the
Globe, the archdiocese made substantial payments to several of
Paquin's accusers.</TE>
<TE>   The records contain accusations Paquin gave young boys gifts and
served liquor before molesting them. They also refer to reports
Paquin sometimes took boys to his rectory bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   A church review board and a top lieutenant to Law recommended that
Paquin be removed from the priesthood. Later, the records show, the
advisor and review board had a change of heart and allowed Paquin to
stay on.</TE>
<TE>   The records also show that in 1981, while driving four teenage
boys to a New Hampshire ski chalet, Paquin lost control of his car,
and one of the youths died in the accident. Paquin was treated in
1990 and 1991 at a residential facility for pedophile priests in
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   In assigning Paquin in 1998 to work as a chaplain at the Youville
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Cambridge, Law wrote, "I know
that there have been some very difficult moments for you. I trust
that your own continued vigilance and support of competent
professionals will allow you to begin a new phase of ministry in the
archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   Paquin was stripped of his rights as a priest two years later
after Law wrote the Vatican.</TE>

<HD>Courts Likely to Endorse FBI Policy, Experts Say</HD>
<DH>The law: A government spying on its people in public is not
seen as a violation of the 4th Amendment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An FBI newly freed to spy on Americans may arouse alarm among civil
libertarians, but it is not likely to run afoul of the federal
courts.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is urging FBI agents to
gather information that is widely available or can be obtained
through searches of public places.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th Amendment forbids "unreasonable searches and seizures" by
government agents, and the Supreme Court has said that this right is
triggered only when and where individuals have a "reasonable
expectation of privacy."</LD>
<TE>   As such, agents may not break into a home or tap a telephone
unless they first obtain evidence of a "probable" cause and use it to
get a search warrant. But a government agent spying on people in
public places, even churches or mosques, or entering an Internet
"chat room" does not violate the 4th Amendment, legal experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no right to privacy when you are in public," said
Georgetown University law professor David D. Cole, who has battled
the government on behalf of Palestinian activists in Los Angeles and
others who say they were unfairly singled out for prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's announcement Thursday changed the government's
guidelines to encourage agents to gather more information, even when
they have no evidence of a crime in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI must draw proactively on all lawful sources of
information to identify terrorist threats," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Agents who learn that someone is trying to "acquire, without
apparent reason, toxic chemicals, radiological or nuclear materials"
should investigate without waiting for proof of a possible crime, the
guidelines say.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft is not alone in thinking that the attacks of Sept. 11
call for a new, more aggressive approach by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have terrorists inside your borders, you don't have the
luxury anymore of separating law enforcement from the need to gather
intelligence," said Stewart A. Baker, former general counsel for the
National Security Agency. "Before 9/11, the risk to our security
seemed theoretical and remote. Now it seems concrete. We would be
foolish not to reconsider the balance" between privacy and security.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what Ashcroft is proposing simply takes into account
modern information technology, Baker added. "In the 1970s,
maintaining a clip file on someone was a big deal. Now, Google does
it for you," he said, referring to the popular Internet search
engine.</TE>
<TE>   But the new guidelines also free the FBI from its own history, a
point that civil libertarians stressed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, revelations that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
ordered agents to spy on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Vietnam War
protesters and a long list of celebrities and political activists
prompted the Justice Department to rein in the bureau's operations.</TE>
<TE>   Under then-Atty. Gen. Edward Levi, the department adopted
guidelines saying that agents were to investigate real crimes, not
spy on people or groups who were deemed suspicious. Agents were told
to launch investigations only where they had a "reasonable
indication" of a crime. And they were not to gather files on
individuals, even if the information itself had appeared in
newspapers or magazines.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided as a country it was inappropriate to spy on people who
are merely exercising their 1st Amendment rights," said Gregory T.
Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
national office in Washington. "This allows them to investigate with
no evidence of a crime. FBI agents should not be lurking in chat
rooms or scanning the Internet to find someone doing something wrong.
It conjures up the vision of Big Brother watching you, and we don't
need to go down this road to prevent terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Cole, the Georgetown law professor, said the new guidelines would
encourage FBI agents to target Muslims and Middle Easterners for
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI has had a proclivity for a guilt-by-association
philosophy. They have a history of abusing their powers when it comes
to dissident political groups," he said. Although the investigations
may not violate the 4th Amendment, they might violate the 1st
Amendment, he said, adding that this "imposes a chilling effect on
legitimate political activity."</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court has been none too friendly to such claims.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the justices, by an 8-1 vote, rejected a claim of
selective prosecution brought by eight Palestinian activists in the
Los Angeles area who said they had been secretly investigated and
slated for deportation because they held a fund-raising dinner for
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The government
described the PFLP as a terrorist group, but the men said they were
raising money to support hospitals and youth clubs on the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ashcroft nor FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III directly
addressed the issue of searches and warrants.</TE>
<TE>   In her well-publicized "whistle-blower" letter to Mueller last
week, Coleen Rowley, general counsel in the bureau's Minneapolis
office, sharply criticized what she called "an excessively high
standard of probable cause in terrorism cases."</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft deferred a comment on that issue Thursday, focusing
instead on the procedures for gathering information that is
essentially public in nature.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating criticism from civil libertarians, Ashcroft said
agents would be told to respect 1st Amendment rights. The purpose of
a probe is to "detect and deter terrorism," he noted, not to gather
information on immigrants or political groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that such investigations not be based solely on
activities protected by the 1st Amendment or on the lawful exercise
of any other rights secured by the Constitution or the laws of the
United States," the guidelines say.</TE>

<HD>Glitz Reflects Liberace Legacy</HD>
<DH>Exhibit: The Las Vegas museum expands to showcase more of
the late pianist's glamour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--In keeping with Liberace's flair for flamboyancy, an
oversized neon pink piano and a giant rendition of the late pianist's
signature grace the entrance to his museum.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the triple-digit heat, hundreds of residents and tourists
turned out Thursday for the expansion of the nonprofit Liberace
Museum. In keeping with his over-the-top tastes, the newly
refurbished museum houses a collection of the Las Vegas entertainer's
cars, pianos, costumes and jewelry.</LD>
<LD>   Magicians Siegfried and Roy, holding a 7-week-old white Siberian
male tiger, arrived in Liberace's pink Volks-Royce convertible to cut
a rhinestone-encrusted ribbon.</LD>
<TE>   "He really was the king of the showman," said Siegfried
Fischbacher.</TE>
<TE>   Among Liberace's other friends attending the opening were
entertainer Charo and Lt. Gov. Lorraine Hunt, who had performed with
the pianist in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberace is part of Las Vegas culture," Hunt said. "This museum
will make sure we never forget our history."</TE>
<TE>   The two-year, $1-million facelift, which includes a tile wall
featuring the notes for "The Beer Barrel Polka," reflects Mr.
Showmanship's love of music, according to architect Francis Xavier
Dumont. The new look is Dumont's design in conjunction with the Leo A
Daly engineering firm.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has a new exhibit gallery featuring Liberace's costume
designers, a cafe and an expanded gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   Liberace died of complications from AIDS in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is owned and operated by the Liberace Foundation for
the Performing and Creative Arts, which has given $4.5 million in
scholarship grants since 1976. The museum opened in 1979.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Files Complaint on Insurer</HD>
<DH>Medicine: As rates price doctors out of practice, state
attorney general alleges that St. Paul Cos. unlawfully cancels
malpractice policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARSON CITY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>The state attorney general has submitted a complaint against insurer
St. Paul Cos., alleging unlawful business practices in yanking
medical malpractice insurance policies held by Nevada doctors.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint requires St. Paul to tell a hearing officer named by
the state Insurance Division why the company shouldn't face
disciplinary action.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint provided to Insurance Commissioner Alice A.
Molasky-Arman also alleges unauthorized policy changes, commission
payments to unlicensed agents and illegal policy nonrenewals.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to do everything we can to ensure that this crisis is
resolved and that violations are addressed so that it never happens
again," Atty. Gen. Frankie Sue Del Papa said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul representatives say the insurer began canceling its
policies because it could not afford high jury awards in malpractice
cases.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul spokeswoman Andrea Wood said the company hasn't received
the complaint, but she added that rates charged by St. Paul were
"consistent with Nevada law and were reviewed and approved by the
staff of the insurance division."</TE>
<TE>   The malpractice crisis prompted Gov. Kenny Guinn in March to
authorize spending $250,000 to form a state fund to underwrite
malpractice insurance for doctors being priced out of their
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn on Wednesday announced he was authorizing the association to
offer prior act insurance to all physicians in the state.</TE>
<TE>   He said the intent was to eliminate large "tail" insurance
payments charged by new insurers for protection from claims made by
patients that doctors had before their new policies go into effect.
State officials have said those one-time payments can reach $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn said the association would reduce by 18% the rates it
charges surgeons and obstetricians and also eliminate tiered premiums
charged to obstetricians based on the number of babies they deliver.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tiered structure, doctors are discouraged from
delivering more than 125 babies a year.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn acted under authority he claimed in March when the state
insurance commissioner declared a malpractice insurance crisis. She
cited the decision by St. Paul--the biggest medical malpractice
insurer in the state--to stop offering malpractice insurance.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sues Pipeline Companies</HD>
<DH>Law: Three died in a 1999 gasoline leak blamed on the
operators' 'gross negligence.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The federal government sued a pipeline company Thursday over a 1999
gasoline leak and explosion that killed three people, the Justice
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit against Olympic Pipeline Co. alleges the explosion was
the result of "gross negligence in the operation and maintenance of
the pipeline."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit also names Shell Pipeline LP, which owns a third of
Olympic. At the time of the accident, Shell Pipeline's corporate
predecessor, Equilon Pipeline Co., along with Arco and GATX, owned
Olympic. Equilon managed the pipeline under an operating agreement
with Olympic.</LD>
<TE>   The government is seeking about $18.6 million in damages from each
company, based on the amount of gasoline discharged. The lawsuit was
filed in U.S. District Court in Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   "The lawsuit took us a little bit by surprise," Olympic Pipeline
spokesman Dan Larson said. The company would not comment on the
lawsuit's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   On June 10, 1999, a rupture in the 400-mile pipeline system
spilled 229,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek and park in
Bellingham. A fisherman died after being overcome by fumes, and two
10-year-old boys died after being badly burned when the gasoline
exploded in a fireball that burned 26 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't bring the boys back," said L. John Iani, EPA regional
administrator in Seattle. "Nor can we adequately salve the wounds
suffered by the community. But by enforcing the law we can send a
clear and strong message to pipeline owners and operators."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also seeks to impose pipeline management, maintenance
and repair requirements on Olympic to minimize future spills.</TE>

<HD>2 Get Probation in Fatal Mass. Warehouse Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WORCESTER, Mass.</DL>
<LD>A formerly homeless couple who accidentally started a warehouse blaze
that killed six firefighters will serve no jail time under an
agreement reached Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Levesque, 39, and Julie King, 22, were sentenced to five
years of probation on involuntary manslaughter charges. The couple
maintained their innocence. If they stay out of trouble during that
time, the charges will be dropped from their record.</LD>
<LD>   "They're marginally retarded, which would make it just about
impossible to try the case," Dist. Atty. John Conte said.</LD>
<TE>   King and Levesque started the December 1999 fire when they knocked
over a candle while fighting in the abandoned warehouse where they
were living, authorities said. The couple allegedly tried to put out
the fire before fleeing the building without reporting it.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters died as they searched the building for homeless
they thought were trapped.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against the couple were initially dismissed for lack
of evidence, but in March the state's highest court reinstated the
case, saying there was evidence that the couple's failure to report
the fire "was intentional and reckless."</TE>

<HD>Shuttle Mission Postponed as Storm Clouds Move In</HD>
<DH>Space: A flight to repair the station's robot arm will
await better weather. The crew aloft may set an endurance record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Storm clouds forced NASA to call off Thursday's launch of space
shuttle Endeavour on a mission to deliver a new crew to the
international space station and fix the orbiting outpost's robot arm.</LD>
<LD>   Launch managers said they may try again as early as this evening,
even though the weather was expected to worsen.</LD>
<LD>   The delay means yet another day in orbit--and a record-breaking
stay--for Americans Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz and Russian Yuri
Onufrienko, who have been living aboard the space station since
December.</LD>
<TE>   Their mission, already at the 176-day mark, will reach at least
189 days by the time they return to Earth. The U.S. space endurance
record stands at 188 days; Shannon Lucid posted that aboard Russia's
Mir space station in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The delay came as no surprise to the seven astronauts and
cosmonauts aboard Endeavour. Approaching thunderstorms had threatened
to force postponement of the flight all day.</TE>
<TE>   The launch team also had to deal with a brief problem with one of
Endeavour's orbital-maneuvering systems that cropped up late in the
countdown.</TE>
<TE>   The countdown was halted at the nine-minute mark.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the afternoon and evening, fighter jets enforced a
no-fly zone around the launch pad, and the surrounding waters were
off-limits. The crew departed for the pad in secrecy as part of the
anti-terrorism precautions adopted after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour will bring a new crew to relieve Bursch, Walz and
Onufrienko. Their replacements, American Peggy Whitson and Russians
Valery Korzun and Sergei Treschev, will spend four months aboard.</TE>
<TE>   During the eight days that Endeavour is docked to the space
station, the shuttle crew will conduct three spacewalks to fix the
robot arm and do other exterior work.</TE>
<TE>   The 58-foot arm--Canada's main space station
contribution--requires repair because one of its joints seized up.
Engineers have worked around the problem but want to fix it before
the arm is needed for major construction later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The two spacewalkers--one American, one Frenchman--also will
install a base that will enable the robot arm to move across the
space station.</TE>

<HD>'Tough, Sad Day' in New York</HD>
<DH>Mourning: Ceremony marks end of search for remains in
rubble at trade center site. Bodies of over 1,700 people were never
recovered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Marking a painful but necessary transition, New York officially ended
the search Thursday for bodies and human remains at the World Trade
Center. On a warm, sunny morning, much like Sept. 11, the city said
goodbye to 1,721 people who have never been found.</LD>
<LD>   The solemn ceremony, which included victims' families, rescue
workers and thousands of others still grieving, featured an honor
guard carrying an empty stretcher out of the site, symbolically
saluting the missing.</LD>
<LD>   Then bagpipes wailed and a truck ferried out the last piece of
wreckage standing--a 58-ton steel beam draped in bunting and an
American flag. There were no speeches during the hushed 20-minute
service.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a tough, sad day," said Jimmy Nolan, a carpenter and
recovery worker who raced to the World Trade Center site minutes
after the terrorist attacks and has been working there ever since.
"Nobody wants to admit that we'll never find these people, but we
have to turn a corner. We have to go on."</TE>
<TE>   Of 2,823 people killed in the attacks here, 1,102 victims have
been identified and 291 intact bodies were recovered. While efforts
to clean up the area have accelerated, the discovery of new remains
has slowed to a trickle in recent weeks, with little more than piles
of ash left behind.</TE>
<TE>   It was time, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg noted recently, "to
move on and rebuild, to start the next phase." But it is far from
clear what the new site will look like. Fierce debates have erupted
over how much of the 16-acre area in lower Manhattan should be
rebuilt, and how much should be a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   There was even a clash over the timing of Thursday's event, with
some families planning to hold a separate observance Sunday near the
World Trade Center site. They said Bloomberg and other city officials
who planned the ceremony should have chosen another date, because
work and other conflicts made it impossible for them to attend a
weekday memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all these differences appeared to subside on a somber day when
New York quietly acknowledged the passing--and disappearance--of so
many. Although Thursday's event signaled a shifting of focus, the
search for remains will continue in truckloads of twisted steel and
other debris that have yet to be sifted at the Fresh Kills Landfill
on Staten Island. And the city's medical examiner continues to
conduct DNA tests on thousands of body parts, a task that will take
eight more months.</TE>
<TE>   "We always knew that this day, the end of the search, was coming,"
said Marian Fontana, whose husband, Dave, died here along with 11
other members of Squad One, an elite Fire Department rescue unit.
"And I was truly lucky, because they found my husband's body. We have
a place to go now where his spirit still lives on. But it's
heartbreaking to look at the site and realize that, for other
families, it will always be a mass graveyard."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony began at 10:59 a.m., the exact moment the second
tower collapsed. As the crowd fell silent, a fire department bell
began ringing to commemorate the 343 firefighters who perished at
ground zero, the site of the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   As the event concluded, a line of rescue workers filed out of the
vast, seven-story pit, following the stretcher and steel girder. They
were followed by a host of dignitaries, including Bloomberg, former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and the state's junior
U.S. senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the sight of departing rescue workers brought a finality
that was too much to bear. Yet others broke the silence with
emotional cheers, applauding the workers who had labored for more
than eight months to retrieve the dead, remove more than 1.8 billion
tons of rubble and clean up the site.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sacred ground and America must not forget that. It's more
important to memorialize this area than throw up a big office
building in a hurry," said Monika Iken, whose husband, Michael, died
at the site. "This is a human burial ground. We have to treat it with
special care."</TE>
<TE>   But for others, like Nolan, the empty lot is an affront--a vacuum
that must be filled. When he learned of the attacks, the hulking
young carpenter volunteered to help. He spent three days and nights
burning steel with a blowtorch. He was desperate for sleep, but
couldn't tear himself away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've broken down emotionally a lot, and I've found things in the
debris, like coffee cups with lipstick on them and men's shoes," he
said, his voice trailing off. "I've seen bodies and body parts, the
kind of things you'd never really expect to see. At night, I hug my
kids more than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Some participants had to console their children, who were weeping
as the ceremony drew to a close. Mary Dolan, whose son Brendan was
killed in the attacks but his body never found, gazed sadly at a line
of police officers leaving the dusty site. She dabbed her eyes with a
white handkerchief and looked into the hazy, blue sky, where jets
streaked over Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't really believe it," Dolan said. Then she put her
arms around her daughter Ann. "We feel all of this so deeply."</TE>
<TE>   For all their grief, however, many participants felt they had
become part of a large, heartfelt family. One block away, at St.
Paul's Chapel, Elsie Lloyd prepared to say goodbye to recovery
workers she has been helping since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The small church became a refuge for them, offering solitude,
ministry, massages and other aid when the recovery work became too
grim.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd, an insurance official, drove 200 miles round-trip from her
Pennsylvania home to the church four times a week. She wanted to do
more than send care packages after the attacks. "I think I know more
about this city and what makes it so great than a lot of people who
live here," she said. "It's changed me forever."</TE>
<TE>   When the ceremony ended, hordes of tourists gathered in front of
St. Paul's to catch a glimpse of the site. Some scrawled messages on
the plywood walls leading up to a viewing platform for the former
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "From England to New York, with love," read one message. "Daddy,
it's your first birthday in heaven," read another, from a child to a
missing father. And on a wall near the site: "To all the souls lost
in the falling of the towers--may your souls stand as tall as the
towers in heaven."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A man was executed by injection Thursday evening for fatally shooting
a video store clerk eight years ago in College Station.</LD>
<LD>   When the warden asked whether he had a last statement, Stanley
Baker said he was "just sorry" about what he did.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Baker, dressed in green fatigues, walked into the
adult video store Sept. 28, 1994, carrying a 12-gauge shotgun. He
shot the clerk, Wayne Walters, in the back of the head as the clerk
was lying on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   Baker was driving the victim's truck and had about $50 taken from
the store when he was arrested a few hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he was at a loss to explain what set him off. "I ask
myself that too," he said during a recent interview on death row.</TE>
<TE>   At least five executions are scheduled for June, putting Texas on
a pace for the year to nearly equal the record 40 executions in 2000.
Baker was the state's 15th this year.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What makes a man different from a mouse? Genetically, it is pretty
hard to tell, according to researchers.</LD>
<LD>   An initial comparison of one mouse chromosome to a human
chromosome shows the genes they carry are highly similar, a team at
the genome company Celera Genomics reports in today's issue of the
journal Science.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Mural and a team of colleagues at Celera compared
chromosome 16 in the mouse to human chromosome 21, which it closely
resembles.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, the thing that I found the most interesting is just how
similar the mouse and the human are in respect to genes, and gene
content and DNA sequences," said Neal Copeland, an expert in genetics
and genomics at the National Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The Celera researchers found that mice have about 10% less DNA
than humans, mostly because the human genome has a great deal of
repetitive sequences, once called "junk DNA."</TE>
<TE>   Celera is publishing the information about chromosome 16 in the
public GenBank, but holding back the rest of the mouse genome data
for paying clients. They found what look like 731 genes on the mouse
chromosome.</TE>
<TE>   "Fourteen genes have no known human homologs [counterparts],
whereas 21 human genes in the compared regions are unique to humans,"
Copeland and colleagues Nancy Jenkins and Stephen O'Brien at the
National Cancer Institute said in a commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The 14 genes may be unique to mice, or their human counterparts
may lie elsewhere, Mural's team said. Based on this, it could be
predicted that about 2% of mouse genes are unique to mice, and about
2.9% are unique to humans, the researchers said.</TE>

<HD>Organic Farms Viable Despite Lower Yields, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Better soil and energy savings are among the
benefits, a 21-year experiment discovers. Modern methods were
ignored, the industry says.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year Swiss study of organic and conventional farming systems is
providing new evidence that large-scale organic farming is
economically viable and environmentally sustainable over the long
haul, although crop yields still fall short of conventional methods.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in today's issue of Science, reported that
organic farming methods used 50% less energy, 97% less pesticide and
as much as 51% less fertilizer than conventional methods.</LD>
<LD>   After two decades of cultivation, the soil in the study's test
plots was still rich in nutrients, resistant to erosion and readily
water absorbent.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, organic crop yields averaged about 20% less than
conventionally farmed crops, although the differences covered a wide
range. Potato yields, for example, were 58% to 66% of those produced
by conventional means. The production of wheat reached 90% of a
conventional harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981, only a handful of major scientific studies have
compared the two farming systems. The Swiss study is the longest
running farming project conducted to date.</TE>
<TE>   John Reganold, a soil scientist at Washington State University at
Pullman and a leading investigator of organic farming methods,
applauded the Swiss group's tenacity and praised the breadth of their
study.</TE>
<TE>   "To run a study for 21 years, to measure yields, look at soil,
look at weeds, look at insects, it takes a lot of scientists," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Alex Avery, director of global food issues for the Hudson
Institute, an industry-funded think tank based in Indianapolis, said
the Swiss report only validates what was previously known about a
niche form of agriculture, and that the experiment ignores the latest
conventional farming techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "Organic farmers are wonderful people, but I think they way
oversell their product and their process," Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   The study, co-sponsored by the Swiss government, began in 1978 as
a bid to bring scientific methodology to what had been a largely
philosophical argument over which type of agriculture was the more
sustainable.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional farming, the type practiced most widely around the
world since World War II, relies on synthetic fertilizers and
pesticides, mainly derived from fossil fuels.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, organic farming, which has been popularized by
environmentalists, relies on fertilizers derived from composted
animal manure and the practice of crop rotation with nitrogen-fixing
cover crops such as clover.</TE>
<TE>   When the study began, "it was a time of skepticism," said
agronomist Andreas Fliessbach, one of six authors on the study. "It
was a time when nobody really believed broad scale organic farming
would be feasible."</TE>
<TE>   To measure the benefits and drawbacks of each system, the
researchers set up 96 small plots on a site near Basel, Switzerland
where they grew wheat and potatoes on a seven-year crop rotation
cycle.</TE>
<TE>   After three cycles, Fliessbach said that the advantages conferred
by the organic system could be divided into "below ground benefits"
and "above ground benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Below-ground benefits included a rich diversity of microorganisms,
which in turn led to better soil structure, more efficient plant
growth and superior water absorbency. Higher counts of beneficial
insects such as earthworms contributed to soil fertility and reduced
fertilizer requirements by half.</TE>
<TE>   Above ground, organic farming proved resistant to the classical
scourges of farming crops : drought and erosion. It also eliminated
the problems of pesticide and nitrogen fertilizer pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The study is the second comparison between organic and
conventional systems to be published in a leading science journal in
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, Washington State's Reganold published a six-year
study in the magazine Nature, concluding that organic apple farming
was not only better for the soil and the environment than its
conventional counterpart but had comparable yields, higher profits
and greater energy efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the Swiss study, Reganold was struck by what he called the
"differentials." "Organic wheat yields were about 90% of
conventional. That's incredible," he said. "To get that kind of a
yield with half the fertilizer is pretty impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Defending conventional production, Avery said: "What's interesting
about the Swiss paper is what's not in it." A new conventional system
avoids erosion by eliminating plowing to dislodge weeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of tilling, you use herbicides," he said. Avery also
contended that crop rotations and reduced yields of 15% to 40% would
devastate American farmers.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Liebhardt, director of research and training at the
Rodale Institute Research Center in Kutztown, Pa., has analyzed most
of the U.S. comparative studies of the two systems and found organic
yields are even higher than those found in the Swiss study--as high
as 95% of conventional methods.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss study did not include an economic comparison of the two
systems. On the face of it, said Fliessbach, conventionally farmed
food is cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   However, a true figure would be hard to calculate. "Costs like
soil erosion, or pollution of ground water or climate change, these
costs are not covered when you run comparisons between organic and
conventional products," Fliessbach said. "Society is paying these
costs."</TE>

<HD>Bush Warns S. Asia Rivals</HD>
<DH>Conflict: As India and Pakistan move closer to war, the
president announces he is sending Defense Secretary Rumsfeld to the
region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In blunt language, President Bush called on Pakistan and India on
Thursday to pull back from the brink of war as the United States
flexed its diplomatic muscle and mobilized international support to
prevent a full-scale conflict between the two nuclear neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The danger of war grew as India moved to load conventional
warheads on its missiles and Pakistan announced that it might
redeploy troops from the border with Afghanistan to its eastern
frontier--both signs of their escalating hostilities.</LD>
<LD>   Bush announced that he was dispatching Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld to the volatile region to try to help defuse tensions. The
visit will follow a tour by Deputy Secretary of State Richard L.
Armitage, the Bush administration's most experienced diplomat on
South Asian issues. Armitage is scheduled to arrive in the region
next Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials also said the State Department might evacuate U.S.
personnel in India and warn the more than 60,000 American civilians
there to leave. "It could come any day now," said a senior department
official, who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   These developments signaled the alarm in Washington about the
deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan over the disputed
region of Kashmir. Along with concern about the damage the two
countries could inflict on each other, U.S. officials worry about the
potential impact of the conflict on the unfinished war in
Afghanistan, the campaign to stem the tide of Islamic extremism and a
host of other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making it very clear to both Pakistan and India that war
will not serve their interests," Bush said Thursday. "We are part of
an international coalition applying pressure to both parties."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is pressing Pakistan the hardest to take
steps to end the cycle of violence. Bush specifically warned
President Pervez Musharraf to "live up to his word" and halt
extremists from attacking the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The predominantly Muslim region is divided between India and
Pakistan by the Line of Control, which was established after a 1971
war between the countries. In recent months, India and Pakistan have
been massing troops in the area, and the situation worsened May 14
when suspected Islamic militants killed more than 30 people,
including the wives and children of soldiers, in an Indian army camp.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf "must stop the incursions across the Line of Control,"
Bush said. "He must do so. He said he would do so. We and others are
making it clear to him that he must live up to his word."</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 military coup, told a
news conference Thursday in Islamabad, the capital, that Pakistan's
"security comes first. We will use all our resources to protect our
security."</TE>
<TE>   He said his government is "seriously contemplating" moving troops
from the Afghan border, where they are searching for Al Qaeda forces
as part of the U.S.-led war on terrorism, to the eastern frontier
with India "if tensions remain as high as they are now."</TE>
<TE>   The words from Bush and Musharraf showed that the conflict in
Kashmir could strain a relationship that has grown close since Sept.
11. Cooperation from Pakistan has been essential to the U.S. military
operation in Afghanistan, and for many months Bush made a point of
singling out Musharraf for praise.</TE>
<TE>   There was no apparent letup Thursday in attacks across the
cease-fire line in Kashmir. Reuters news service reported that two
suspected Muslim militants who killed three officers at an Indian
police camp were shot dead after a standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Shelling between Pakistani and Indian troops deployed along the
Line of Control also continued; unconfirmed reports from both sides
of the border put deaths from the attacks at more than a dozen each.</TE>
<TE>   The new crisis comes at a time when the administration is
increasingly spread thin while attending to the world's hot spots.
Top officials and policymakers remain engrossed in battling the
remnants of Al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan and trying to
make peace between Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States steps up its involvement in the
India-Pakistan conflict, it is collaborating with allies such as
Russia and the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin is hoping to meet with
Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee at an Asian
security summit in Kazakhstan early next week.</TE>
<TE>   Putin was authorized by the newly established Russia-NATO Council
to try to establish a face-to-face dialogue between the two leaders
in a session hosted by Putin, according to Russian officials quoted
in the Moscow media.</TE>
<TE>   The summit of Asian leaders is to be held Monday through
Wednesday; Armitage's visit to South Asia then is to follow.</TE>
<TE>   In its effort to calm the region's tensions, the Bush
administration is developing other strategies. These include offers
of sharing U.S. intelligence to reduce the danger of miscalculations,
as well as stressing the devastating impact of a nuclear war to both
India and Pakistan, American officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've given a lot of thought to their use [of nuclear weapons]
and what the effects are--what the immediate effects are, what the
lingering effects are and what the ... second effects can be with
respect to other problems," Rumsfeld said Thursday at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the millions and millions and millions of people who live in
those two countries who would be damaged by a conflict," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The shared intelligence might include confirmation of what type of
warheads either country is loading on its missiles, U.S. officials
say. One of the most feared scenarios is that India loads
conventional warheads on its missiles but Pakistan misreads them as
nuclear warheads, leading Islamabad to gear up or launch a nuclear
response.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage and other U.S. envoys already are in discussions with
officials from both countries, promoting ways to ease the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pressing President Musharraf very hard to cease all
infiltration activities on the part of terrorist organizations across
the Line of Control, and we are asking the Indians to show restraint
until we can determine whether or not that infiltration activity has
ceased," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Thursday on the PBS
"NewsHour" program.</TE>
<TE>   "And if it has ceased," he added, "there will be a basis for the
Indians to reciprocate by starting to de-escalate ... and then
hopefully other actions and other steps can be taken after that."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been disappointed so far with the Musharraf
government's failure to rein in extremists who want either
independence for Kashmir or the area's union with Pakistan, which
also is mainly Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation has not improved in the last month or so," Powell
said. "We were receiving assurances from President Musharraf that
infiltration activity across the Line of Control would be ended. But
unfortunately, we can still see evidence that it was continuing."</TE>
<TE>   Powell added that Musharraf has offered new assurances that appear
"more positive," and the U.S. is waiting to see whether the Pakistani
leader issues the "necessary orders" to stop the cross-border
movement of militants.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is convinced that Al Qaeda forces have
played a role, either directly or indirectly, in stirring up the
long-standing hostilities between India and Pakistan for several
reasons, including to divert U.S. attention and to undermine
Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are particularly concerned that a redeployment of
Pakistani troops would impede the drive to finish the Al Qaeda
network, much of it now believed to be concentrated along the
Afghanistan-Pakistan border.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is pressing Musharraf not to move his forces.</TE>
<TE>   "If troops are diverted from working with us to capture Al Qaeda
and Taliban remnants back to the border with India ... it takes away
from our own world campaign against terrorism," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. diplomatic response to the India-Pakistan conflict
contrasts with the administration's current role in the Middle East.
Bush is trying to negotiate a political settlement in the
half-century-old dispute between Israel and the Arabs. In its talks
with India and Pakistan, the U.S. effort is designed largely to
prevent war.</TE>
<TE>   Both Republican and Democratic administrations have long held that
the two nations, which were a single British colony until
independence following World War II, had to come up with their own
agreement about what to do with Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no desire to make ourselves the mediator," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the current conflict, Defense Department officials had
been concerned that both India and Pakistan were increasing their
arsenals of nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Esther Schrader in Washington and John
Daniszewski in Moscow contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Gave Early Warning to Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. was aware of possible criminal liability for its trading
ploys in the deregulated California energy market in late October
2000, more than a month earlier than previously disclosed, according
to a newly obtained memo.</LD>
<LD>   The document, written by outside lawyers for Enron, is far more
specific than previously released memos about the kinds of state and
federal laws Enron could have violated. Enron apparently continued to
use some of the questionable practices for several weeks after
receiving the legal advice.</LD>
<LD>   The previously undisclosed Oct. 30, 2000, memo explored concerns
that Enron's trading strategies could result in charges including
wire fraud, markets fraud and racketeering.</LD>
<TE>   The eight-page memo warned that it was "imperative" that Enron
understood what evidence existed concerning its California conduct as
well as the intent of participants "and whether there were any
redeeming purposes for the conduct in question."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego lawyer Michael Aguirre, who has filed two lawsuits
against generators and traders seeking at least $41 billion, said the
memo showed "that the company was fully advised" and that could make
it harder for Enron to defend itself against potential litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations of how Enron and possibly others conducted
themselves in the shadowy and lucrative world that was California's
power market during the depths of its energy crisis have intensified
since May 6, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released
memos that discussed how Enron's traders boosted profit in
California.</TE>
<TE>   California politicians have pointed to the memos as proof that
Enron illegally manipulated the market, but experts said it was
unclear to what degree the company's actions violated federal law or
market rules.</TE>
<TE>   One memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, discussed trading schemes that
included bypassing in-state price caps by sending power outside the
state and then reselling it back into the California market, creating
congestion on transmission lines so the company could be paid to
relieve it.</TE>
<TE>   Another ploy involved submitting inflated schedules of power needs
to the California Independent System Operator so that the company
could reap payments when it suddenly was able to supply extra power.</TE>
<TE>   The December memo also listed potential violations of market
rules, and the outside lawyers who wrote it warned Enron that month
that the practices might be deceptive or even illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Enron lawyer Richard B. Sanders testified before a congressional
panel May 15 that after he received that memo and warning in
December, the practices were terminated. But the newly obtained Oct.
30 memo indicates that Enron was warned well before Dec. 6 and
continued its trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   The Oct. 30 memo cites specific legal cases that could be used
against Enron but also notes that "if the company has profited solely
because of its skill, by accident or the result of a regulatory
scheme created by others, it is unlikely that these legal theories
will be successful ultimately."</TE>
<TE>   The legal memo was written by Gary Fergus and Peter Meringolo,
lawyers who at that time worked for Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison in
San Francisco and were part of a legal team assembled by Enron to
respond to investigations and lawsuits arising from its California
trading activities.</TE>
<TE>   Fergus also penned a memo in early 2001, which was recently
released by federal regulators, that sought to explain and defend
Enron's California trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the Oct. 30 memo, which was
turned over to federal and state investigators, was a broad
discussion of legal issues and not a commentary on any specific
trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a legal analysis that the company requested in light of
a number of inquiries," Denne said. Fergus and Meringolo, who have
left Brobeck Phleger, did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have is a gang of people ganging up on California, and
you have lawyers telling them that it is illegal," said Aguirre, the
San Diego lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, other internal Enron electricity trading memos from
2000 showed that several California municipal utilities--including
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power--may have cooperated
with Enron and profited financially from strategies dubbed by Enron
traders as Fat Boy and Death Star, according to a state senator
investigating manipulation of California's electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove) said he had obtained through
subpoena Enron documents that showed that four municipal California
utilities served as "counterparties" in Enron strategies that were
made public in memos released May 6 by federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Using the strategies, Enron exploited the price differences for
moving electricity on different transmission lines and for
electricity sold a day or mere hours in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "From our review of the documents," Dunn said, "I can't help but
conclude that the municipal utilities were knowing participants in
some of the Enron strategies."</TE>
<TE>   A source who has read the memos but asked not to be identified
said two of the utilities are the Los Angeles DWP and the Glendale
Public Service Department.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP denied any collusion with Enron, and a representative of
the Glendale utility did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said the Enron memos referred to the involvement of the
municipal utilities in a "profit-sharing agreement" and mentioned
various ratios of splitting profit, such as 75% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said the memos were written in the period from early to
mid-2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the unnamed source, at least one memo mentions the
DWP and Fat Boy, a strategy in which Enron took advantage of prices
that were higher in California's "real-time" market, when grid
operators anxiously sought electricity to avoid disrupting power
flow.</TE>
<TE>   DWP spokeswoman Darlene Battle denied that the utility shared any
profit with Enron. Battle said the DWP simply allowed the company to
buy space on its transmission lines just as it would any other power
seller.</TE>
<TE>   Former DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who now heads the
California Power Authority, said the utility had no knowledge of
Enron's schemes and treated it as any other customer.</TE>
<TE>   "The lines are open to anybody who wants to use them," Freeman
said. "The fact that they ran power over our lines and faked running
over someone else's lines, L.A. had no idea about that."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, chairman of the select committee to investigate price
manipulation of the wholesale energy market, was expected to release
the memos Wednesday before a hearing in Sacramento that will examine
the behavior of municipal utilities during the energy crisis.</TE>

<HD>The Times Faulted for Downplaying Secession</HD>
<DH>Media: Coverage is seen as sparse, often derisive. Editors
concede treating it as just a 'Valley story.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Second of two parts</LD>
<LD>   John Arthur was editor of the San Fernando Valley Edition of the
Los Angeles Times from 1993 to 1998, and he's still unhappy about how
difficult it was to interest his editors downtown in covering the
Valley's secession movement.</LD>
<LD>   "Reporting to a boss in distant downtown, I could certainly
identify with the complaints and perceptions of people who lived in
the Valley about answering to City Hall on the other side of the
hill," says Arthur, now an assistant managing editor at The Times.
"We covered secession in the Valley section, but it was very hard to
get editors in Los Angeles to put it on their radar ... and put it in
the newspaper that was distributed outside the Valley."</LD>
<TE>   Secession has been discussed intermittently since the 1920s and
has been gaining momentum inexorably since 1997. Nevertheless, most
top Times editors didn't seem terribly interested in it until very
recently. Indeed, the growing controversy over secession has
triggered a related controversy over newspaper coverage of secession.</TE>
<TE>   If editors at the Daily News in the Valley are widely perceived as
trying to advance the cause of secession, their counterparts at The
Times are widely perceived as having largely neglected it.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Wolinsky, deputy managing editor of The Times, blames the
Times' shortcomings on "a faulty system" that "Balkanized" the
paper's local coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the Valley section--like our other suburban
sections--operated pretty autonomously, secession wound up being cast
as a Valley story," he says. "And instead of covering it as a Los
Angeles story, we wound up with two journalistic bureaucracies
fighting each other."</TE>
<TE>   Even Valley Edition</TE>
<TE>   Inconsistent on Issue</TE>
<TE>   Despite a number of good secession stories over the years, even
the Valley Edition of The Times didn't cover the issue consistently
or comprehensively.</TE>
<TE>   Many editors downtown, meanwhile, saw secession as "a pipedream,
something that would never be on the ballot, never happen," says John
Spano, formerly an editor in the Valley, now an assistant city editor
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Many Times staffers say editors downtown badly misjudged the
secession movement. They saw the proposed withdrawal from Los Angeles
of 1.35 million people and 222 square miles--about a third of the
city's population and almost half its area--as a small outgrowth of
anti-busing sentiment in the Valley dating from the 1970s. To those
editors, it was a fringe movement unworthy of serious attention.</TE>
<TE>   The tone of Times coverage was sometimes derisive, as when a
veterinarian serving on the Local Agency Formation Commission, the
entity charged with determining whether to put secession on the
ballot, was described in a 1999 story as "a horse doctor." Secession
proponents are still outraged by the tone of many Valley Edition
editorials and by the writings of Scott Harris, a Valley Edition
columnist in the '90s, who called secession advocates "Valleyistas"
and likened elements of the secession process to a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan
operetta.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public
Policy at Pepperdine University, says Times journalists have a
cultural mind-set that puts them at odds with what he calls "the
middle-class rebellion of the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   That movement, he says, is "led by people not sociologically
similar to reporters at The Times and other big news organizations,
so there's not a lot of understanding or natural sympathy for the
secession movement there."</TE>
<TE>   In conversations with Times staff members in recent months,
Managing Editor Dean Baquet has warned against covering secession the
way the religious right is sometimes covered, with its leaders
treated like cartoon characters.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted us to avoid that--to take the secession movement
seriously," says Sharon Bernstein, a Valley resident who is part of a
five-reporter team created this month to increase secession coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime reporters and editors at the paper say there has been far
more interest in secession downtown since the arrival in the last two
years of Baquet, who came from the New York Times; John Carroll, the
editor of the paper, who came from the Baltimore Sun; and Miriam
Pawel, assistant managing editor for state and local news, who came
from Newsday, in the suburbs of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of Times coverage say it sometimes still trivializes the
secession movement and continues to favor anti-secession forces. They
say The Times demonstrated anew its bias last Friday, two days after
LAFCO put the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot, by playing on Page One a
story about the strategy of secession opponents while playing on Page
28 a story on the strategy of secession supporters. The Daily News
dealt with the two campaigns in one Page One story. Even some Times
reporters were troubled by how their paper handled the stories.</TE>
<TE>   Times editors deny any bias, and it's clear that, whatever the
perceived shortcomings of the paper's current coverage, new editors
from the other side of the country have brought fresh eyes to the
secession issue.</TE>
<TE>   Even some critics say Times coverage of secession has improved,
especially in recent weeks and months--if only because there is more
of it. Much of that increase is event-driven; LAFCO reports and votes
have transformed what was once seen as a longshot into a ballot
measure with a very real chance to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein says she noticed a significant shift in the attitude of
editors downtown when a Times Poll in March showed that Valley voters
favored secession, 55% to 36%, and voters in the city as a whole
favored it, 46% to 38%. (A majority of the voters both in the Valley
and in the city as a whole must approve secession for the measure to
pass.)</TE>
<TE>   Critics Say Times Just</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't Get the Valley</TE>
<TE>   Critics of The Times can tick off any number of secession stories
through the years that they think the paper intentionally ignored,
distorted or underplayed. They say The Times simply doesn't
understand the Valley and was, for example, late in acknowledging its
growing diversity. Just last year, a Times story referred to the
Valley as "largely white," even though Latinos, with 43% of the
population, are the largest single ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   But neither bias nor ignorance is the most common complaint about
Times coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the major criticism of Daily News secession coverage is
not the alleged bias of any particular story but the overall tone of
the paper's headlines, editorials, story selection and placement, so
the major criticism of Times coverage is not bias but neglect and
disdain.</TE>
<TE>   Because The Times often sets the agenda for other local
media--especially TV and radio--that meant other news outlets tended
to give the movement short shrift too.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Valley say The Times has gradually abandoned it--first
by reducing the Valley staff considerably in 1995 and then, last
year, by replacing the separate Valley section with a new California
section that added regional coverage and reduced the Valley emphasis.
The change eliminated the separate Valley editorials, op-ed articles
and some local features. Carroll says The Times was not abandoning
the Valley, but rather trying to serve its readers better.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll lives in Pasadena, and he says he wasn't getting much
coverage of secession in the paper delivered to his home every day.
"When I found out those stories were being zoned out of the rest of
the city, except for the Valley, that made no sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said his desire for more such coverage was one reason the
paper decided last year to reduce geographically zoned coverage and
emphasize a regional approach to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We think Valley readers have interests that go far beyond the
Valley, so our section is designed to give them news of the Valley,
of the rest of the county, of Southern California and of the rest of
the state in one section," he said. "The section is predicated on
their being sophisticated readers, not one-subject readers."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say The Times has a financial stake in opposing secession.
The Times, with a daily circulation of almost 1 million overall,
outsells the Daily News by more than 10,000 copies each day in the
Daily News' primary market. If the Valley secedes and the Daily News
successfully positions itself as the hometown newspaper of record for
the new city--which would be the sixth-largest in the nation--The
Times could conceivably lose that edge.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times doesn't want to be in another situation like they have
against the Register in Orange County, where they're marginalized as
an out-of-town paper," says Richard Close, chairman of Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment (Valley VOTE). "They want to protect
their circulation in the San Fernando Valley."</TE>
<TE>   The Times and the Daily News are rivals, but the situation is much
different than in Orange County. The Times is more established in the
Valley, which has been part of Los Angeles since 1915, than it ever
was in Orange County. Moreover, when The Times began its Orange
County Edition in 1968, the Register's parent company--Freedom
Newspapers--spent money to improve the paper. In contrast, the parent
company of the Daily News, MediaNews Group of Denver, is known more
for cutting costs than improving journalism at its papers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Times Mirror, The Times' corporate parent until Tribune
Co. of Chicago acquired the company two years ago, secretly loaned
$50 million to MediaNews to help finance its $130-million purchase of
the Daily News in 1998 precisely because it wanted to prevent
potentially stronger rivals from taking over the Daily News. (The
deal gave The Times an option to buy the Daily News, though the
Justice Department would likely block such a transaction on antitrust
grounds.)</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News had been cutting its staff before MediaNews took
over, and the staff is now considerably smaller than it was in the
early to mid-1990s. Times executives do not seem deeply concerned
that secession would reverse that trend. Even if they did think that
the Daily News, enriched by new advertising dollars in a new city,
would substantially improve its journalistic performance, they say,
that would not affect Times coverage of secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what secession would mean to us financially," says
John Puerner, publisher of The Times. "But our coverage is not
influenced in any way by any financial considerations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our success in the Valley is dependent on the
Valley being part of the city," Puerner says. "If the Valley does
secede, we will adjust our coverage and our marketing strategy
accordingly to maintain our aggressive leadership there."</TE>
<TE>   Some media and advertising analysts say that though the Daily News
would probably gain new advertising revenue if secession passed, that
revenue would probably not come at the expense of The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertisers would then look at the San Fernando Valley as an
independent, self-sustaining market, and it not only wouldn't hurt
The Times, it might help The Times because it would create less
competition in the remaining L.A. market," says Jack Myers, editor of
an advertising industry newsletter in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Paper Still a Part of</TE>
<TE>   City's Power Structure</TE>
<TE>   But though The Times may have diminished concerns about the Daily
News as a business competitor, The Times continues to be part of the
downtown power structure, and many critics say that's the primary
reason the paper opposes secession.</TE>
<TE>   The early publishers of The Times literally helped create Los
Angeles, and the paper has been an integral part of the downtown
business/political establishment ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of The Times by Tribune Co. of Chicago two years
ago has diminished those ties somewhat, but the paper still
"considers itself the heart and soul of downtown Los Angeles," says
Larry Calemine, executive officer of LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   David Fleming, chairman of the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley and a leader of the City Charter reform movement,
says The Times and the city's leadership continue to have "kind of a
love relationship. The Times helps the bureaucracy run the city and
it considers itself the voice of the city."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, not long after Times inquiries forced disclosure of a
controversial $60,000 Daily News contribution to Valley VOTE in 1998,
the Daily News reported that The Times' then-corporate parent, Times
Mirror, had paid a $40,000 membership fee in the Los Angeles Business
Advisors, a powerful downtown business and civic coalition, for Mark
H. Willes, then Times publisher and Times Mirror chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Willes said the contribution amounted to less than 5% of the
group's funding and had no impact on Times coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Although The Times has editorialized vigorously against secession,
Times editors say that is not because of any commercial or political
self-interest but because "we feel secession would be destructive of
the life of the city, which the Valley is part of," says Janet
Clayton, editor of the editorial pages.</TE>
<TE>   Like their counterparts at the Daily News, Times editors insist
their news coverage has been evenhanded.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics say that even with its recent upgraded coverage,
The Times still isn't doing the kind of big-picture secession stories
that a newspaper of its size and stature should undertake.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times hasn't told the narrative of our common experience,"
says D.J. Waldie, a Lakewood city official and the author of "Holy
Land: A Suburban Memoir" and "Real City: Downtown Los Angeles
Inside/Out." "It hasn't provided a narrative or even a cartoon
outline, the roughest schematic, of how things actually work here and
how anything would change and what it would all mean to the soul of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "As one of the few institutions that influences the entire region,
The Times should have done more to tie that region together," Waldie
says, "to provide a sense of loyalty to place that might have
counteracted secessionist sentiment."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Gritzner, chief of staff for Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski,
says The Times has covered "the numbers and the nuts and bolts of who
would control which services and how much alimony the Valley would
pay to the city, but they haven't done many in-depth stories on what
secession would really mean to the average citizen who lives in
Silver Lake or San Pedro or Van Nuys."</TE>
<TE>   Since one of the main arguments of secession supporters is that a
new Valley city would be smaller and more responsive than Los
Angeles, critics ask why The Times hasn't seriously examined
government efficiency and responsiveness in cities approximately the
size of the Valley's projected 1.3-million population--cities such as
Phoenix, San Diego and Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Still others say that with all the controversy over the financial
impact of secession on both the Valley and the rest of Los Angeles,
The Times should hire independent analysts and do its own study.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Beth Barrett, a veteran Daily News reporter, spent
four months examining whether the Valley gets a fair share of city
services and produced a story that took six full pages in the paper
and concluded that there was about a 5% gap between what Valley
residents paid to the city in taxes and what they received in
services.</TE>
<TE>   "Where was the L.A. Times on that?" Barrett asks. "Why weren't
they looking at discrepancies throughout the city?"</TE>
<TE>   Editors say they are considering an independent financial
analysis, among many other stories on secession. Carroll cites a
story last Sunday, which tried to paint a portrait of what a new
Valley city would be like, as an example of the kind of reporting The
Times will do over the next several months.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time the citizens are asked to cast a vote on this," he
says, "we will have provided vast information, and I hope it will be
lucid information."</TE>
<TE>   But critics say they still see stories in The Times that "mock the
cause and mock the people involved," in the words of Jeff Brain,
president of Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times' coverage has gotten more balanced" in recent weeks,
Brain says, but he cites as an example of this "mocking attitude" a
story last Saturday about confusion over the secession proposal among
people in a Sherman Oaks strip mall "in the shadow of the Valley VOTE
office."</TE>
<TE>   The story quoted one person as asking if LAFCO was "a comedy store
in Hollywood" and quoted another as saying he would move to Los
Angeles rather than live in a city called Camelot, one of five
choices on the ballot for the name of the proposed new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of The Times have also complained that Steve Lopez columns
on secession have ridiculed and patronized the Valley and that a May
19 Times editorial likening secession to a separatist struggle in the
latest "Star Wars" movie was typical of the paper's long-standing
"trivialization" of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   Times editors say that is not their intent. They insist they now
take secession very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   They have six months before the Nov. 5 election to demonstrate
that.</TE>

<HD>Angels Falter in Long Run</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim blows five-run lead before losing to the
Twins on a sacrifice fly in the 10th, 7-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>If the Angels lose out on a playoff spot by one game, this might be
the one game that pains them most.</LD>
<LD>   On a night that the Minnesota Twins all but ceded victory, the
Angels blew a five-run lead and collapsed Thursday. Their offense
ground to a halt, their starting pitcher gave back a bunch of runs in
a big inning and their bullpen failed to preserve a two-run lead with
six outs to go. The end was almost anticlimactic but fitting
nonetheless, a 7-6 defeat concluded on a sacrifice fly in the 10th
inning.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like we let this one slip away," Angel center fielder
Darin Erstad said.</LD>
<TE>   The Twins scored the tying run in the eighth inning against closer
Troy Percival, who entered a game before the ninth inning for the
first time this season. But the Angels ought to have pummeled the
Twins to such a degree that Percival never would have bothered
warming up.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins used five relievers Wednesday, when a stiff neck and
headache forced starter Rick Reed to depart in the second inning.
They activated ace Brad Radke Thursday, but after getting one out he
aggravated the strained groin that had forced him onto the disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   So, for the second consecutive night, the Minnesota bullpen would
patch and pitch virtually all of the game. And, after scoring in each
of the first three innings, the Angels led, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   "This one hurts," catcher Jorge Fabregas said. "We have a five-run
lead, their best pitcher went down, and they used up their bullpen
the night before.</TE>
<TE>   "You figure you could chalk one up. But those guys are feisty, and
they're tough."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, who said his trademark sinker was out of order
Thursday, shut out the Twins for the first four innings. But, despite
that five-run lead, Schoeneweis could not escape the fifth inning
before the Angels had the bullpen warming up and the Twins scored
four times.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the offense turned dormant. As the Twins used
five relievers for the second consecutive night, the Angels scored
once in the final seven innings, on a sacrifice fly. They stranded 12
runners, six in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   "We scored enough runs to win," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"I don't think you can point to our offense and say that was the
reason for the loss."</TE>
<TE>   The relievers did not shine. Schoeneweis got the first two outs in
the seventh inning and Ben Weber the third, and the Angels handed a
6-4 lead to Dennis Cook in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Cook faced one batter, David Ortiz, who doubled. Al Levine
replaced Cook and faced four batters. The first two hit about 800
feet worth of fly balls, each to the deepest of center field. Ortiz
took third base on the first fly ball and scored on the second.
Levine then gave up successive singles.</TE>
<TE>   With the tying and go-ahead runs on base, Scioscia made the rare
call of summoning Percival in the eighth inning. In 57 games last
season, Percival pitched more than one inning six times.</TE>
<TE>   Percival finished the eighth and worked a scoreless ninth, but
hardly with ease. He threw a season-high 41 pitches, 21 of them
balls. He walked three, nearly hit three and threw a wild pitch. He
gave up a game-tying single to Cristian Guzman in the eighth inning
and walked the potential winning run into scoring position in the
ninth, then got Ortiz and Jacque Jones to pop up and struck out Corey
Koskie.</TE>
<TE>   With his curve missing the strike zone, and with Percival looking
for a strikeout, he threw fastballs on 16 of his final 17 pitches,
clocked from 94 to 97 mph.</TE>
<TE>   As Ortiz walked in the hallway adjacent to the Angel clubhouse, he
shook his head and muttered in disbelief about Percival. "He don't
need no breaking ball," Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, he and the rest of the Angel relievers simply
needed a break. Lou Pote, the sixth Angel pitcher, took the loss.
Minnesota closer Eddie Guardado, the sixth Twin pitcher, worked two
scoreless innings for the victory.</TE>

<DH>With three-peat on ropes, Lakers must win tonight just to
get chance to play again</DH>

<LD>The Lakers play tonight at Staples Center to save their season, a
routinely ponderous affair threatening now to end without a
championship.</LD>
<LD>   It once was unthinkable.</LD>
<LD>   By nearly all impressions, both educated and hysterical, there
would be a championship three-peat, then a victory parade through
downtown, followed immediately by the blessing of Shaquille O'Neal's
and Kobe Bryant's gym shoes.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the Lakers play to avoid their playoff elimination at the
hands of the Sacramento Kings, whose fans fancy cowbells and detest
L.A. All a victory would get the Lakers is a Game 7 on Sunday in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels strange to think that, maybe, this is the last home
game, and then saying goodbye to everybody and not seeing anybody
again until October," said Jeanie Buss, a team vice president and the
owner's daughter. "I'm not ready for that yet. I look at my calendar,
it's blank for the next couple weeks. I try not to take it for
granted, but we're spoiled."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, they will play on the edge of a city's car flag-flapping
anxiety, the Lakers two championships into what many figured would
mature into a dynasty in the cast of the legendary Boston Celtic
teams of 40 years ago, or at minimum the Chicago Bulls of the last
decade. While that still can come, the team of O'Neal, Bryant and
Phil Jackson instead appears vulnerable, given over suddenly to the
rigors of enormous expectations and physical distraction.</TE>
<TE>   It was only getting better, too.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson regrew his soul patch going into the playoffs. O'Neal and
Bryant weren't just speaking, they were carrying on together, playing
together, using nicknames. Nice nicknames. O'Neal called him
"Kobe-ster" the other day, as if they'd carpooled to prep school for
these past six years.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers weren't ever going to lose again, not the big games
anyway, not as long as Phil spoke and Shaq and Kobe listened and
played and Staples Center sold out.</TE>
<TE>   So, what, exactly, are they doing here, seemingly so near to
failure? Staples Center could lose more than $100,000 per game, and
the businesses around the arena would be hit as well. Parade plans
were underway, rentals made.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts at a toe," one Laker observer said.</TE>
<TE>   And worked its way up.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a trying spring, all things considered. The Lakers did
not play particularly well in earlier series against the Portland
Trail Blazers and San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West, who came to the organization four decades ago and
became franchise "royalty," according to one team official, as
player, coach and management, resigned between playoff rounds to run
the Memphis Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   And a small part on the biggest man, a toe on O'Neal's right foot,
changed the way the Lakers won. O'Neal has an arthritic big toe that
sapped his mobility and, in one way or another, limited him to 67
games in an 82-game season. The big wins became difficult, and the
difficult wins became excruciating. And some weren't wins at all.</TE>
<TE>   They practiced at their facility on Nash Street in El Segundo on
Thursday afternoon, crowded by reporters seeking explanations, many
the same ones who had handed the Lakers titles as long as Jackson had
Bryant and O'Neal, and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the consequences of a loss tonight, forward Rick Fox
shook his head and said, "I don't know. I can't bring myself to think
about that.... My mind doesn't work that way."</TE>
<TE>   It was not supposed to be this uncertain, not after Jackson fired
up the Porsche one morning and drove away from his lakeside place in
Montana. He found love and coaching renewal and basketball
championships in Los Angeles, which hadn't won a title in those dozen
years before he arrived with his triangle offense and Zen
philosophies.</TE>
<TE>   He's won eight of the last 11 NBA titles, six of them with the
Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan, the last two with the Lakers and
their superstars. The Lakers have won 13 titles in all, only three
behind the Celtics, who are playing for the Eastern Conference
championship.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lakers, he has a team built for the playoffs. While Bryant
is a warrior on every night, O'Neal has neither the body nor the
spirit for the regular season, when the games come fast and,
relatively speaking, meaningless. After losing six games to
last-place teams in the course of that regular season, the Lakers did
not win the Pacific Division championship. The Kings did, and
therefore will host Game 7, assuming it is necessary, on Sunday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about three-peat," Jackson said Thursday. "Of
all the things we have talked about since day one, though, it's
difficult to get this thing. We're just talking about the challenge
we have."</TE>
<TE>   It has not ended yet, of course. But the most dominant team of the
past two seasons has played itself to the threshold of that, to a
delicate place where a referee's call or a hot shooter or an
unfortunate bounce won't be overcome.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers last played an elimination game two years ago, in Game
7 of the Western Conference finals against the Trail Blazers, when
they found themselves behind by 15 points in the fourth quarter. They
won that game with uncommon effort, won the championship in the next
round against the Indiana Pacers, and discovered a fight within
themselves they talk about still.</TE>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be decided in Game 7," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   That assumes a Laker win tonight against the Kings, who hold a
three-games-to-two lead in the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are clear," Derek Fisher said Thursday. "You have to win
or your season is over. There isn't any room for complacency or,
'We'll get them next time.' It all comes down to one game at this
point.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're always battling to stay focused or keep your mind on
one thing, there isn't anything clearer than the position we're in.
That kind of brings a different type of energy, where you know you
have to win. You don't have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   They say they won't back away from that challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not feeling any pressure," O'Neal said. "I think we're
right where we want to be. We have to win two games and then we can
move on and start all over. We're capable of putting two great games
together."</TE>
<TE>   They'll have the chance to prove it. O'Neal and Bryant have lifted
them to great heights against the Kings at times, but the Lakers have
displayed only occasionally the sort of flawless play that led many
to believe a third consecutive championship was theirs for the
taking.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the Lakers' out-of-sync appearance is the Kings,
whose depth and resolve have appeared superior thus far.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's hungry," King guard Mike Bibby said. "We've had one
goal since the beginning of the season and that was to get to the
finals. Now we're one win away from the finals and [five] wins away
from the championship."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the center position, where O'Neal has been better than
Vlade Divac, and shooting guard, where Bryant has trumped Doug
Christie, the Kings have been winning the individual matchups.</TE>
<TE>   The unavoidable conclusion to be drawn from the first five games
is that the Lakers have the two best players in O'Neal and Bryant,
but the Kings are getting significantly more from players three
through seven.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has run rings around Fisher at point guard. Bryant muzzled
him for the latter portion of Game 4, but Jackson determined that
Fisher, not Bryant, should check Bibby for Game 5. It was Fisher's
failure to get past Chris Webber's pick that freed Bibby for his
game-winning 22-foot jumper from the right wing.</TE>
<TE>   Hedo Turkoglu, after a slow opening, has gained the upper hand on
Fox at small forward. Webber has proved to be a handful for Robert
Horry.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have had no answer for Bobby Jackson, a reserve guard
who won a last-second matchup with Bryant, denying him the winning
bucket in the Kings' one-point victory Tuesday at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Lakers now have to contend with the added burden of
matching up with Peja Stojakovic, who sat out the first four games
because of a sprained right ankle before returning to play limited
minutes in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Rick Adelman declined to say if he would alter his
starting lineup tonight, but did say Stojakovic's ankle is much
improved.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the last one is going to be the toughest," Adelman said
of trying to close out the Lakers and end their championship run. "We
know it's going to be difficult. They still have those two guys
[Bryant and O'Neal]. We're not going to wait for a seventh game, but
at least we have two shots at it."</TE>

<LD>An NBA title may have been won Tuesday when a bearded coach diagramed
a cool play that his team ran to perfection.</LD>
<LD>   That coach was not Phil Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   A conference finals series is being led by a team so focused and
prepared, it has been ahead by at least 15 points in three of the
five games.</LD>
<TE>   That team's coach is not Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how Jackson once coaxed such excitement into the playoffs
his star was moved to bump and grind on the press table?</TE>
<TE>   When it happened again Tuesday, the star was from the other team.</TE>
<TE>   There is much at stake tonight at Staples Center as the Lakers
attempt to smoke a three-hour cigarette while looking down the barrel
of the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   A loss in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals would end a
three-peat, stall a three-vival, slow a three-incarnation.</TE>
<TE>   The three-percussions alone would stretch from Figueroa to El
Segundo, touching not only those who wear the uniforms, but those who
wash them, and sell them, and buy them, and love them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nobody stands to lose as much as the one who doesn't wear one.</TE>
<TE>   With one loss, Phil Jackson could go from invincible to
vulnerable, from untouchable to unmasked, from Zen Master to
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Fair or not, from the start, Jackson's success with a haughty
Laker bunch that ignored less-accomplished bosses was based on the
notion that the guy with six world championships knows best.</TE>
<TE>   Fair or not, a loss to the Kings either tonight or Sunday would
bring that notion into doubt.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the first time in Jackson's illustrious career that
his team lost a series it was expected to win. It would be the first
time that the guy with all the rings would have to share some of the
blame.</TE>
<TE>   A loss would be difficult enough in the record books, by ruining
Jackson's chances to pass Pat Riley (all-time playoff wins) and tie
Red Auerbach (championships).</TE>
<TE>   It could, however, be much harder in the locker room, where the
players respond not to numbers but nuances. A place where Jackson has
walked like a king would suddenly become a place where he simply
worked as an equal.</TE>
<TE>   And where he will be surely questioned like one.</TE>
<TE>   Those publicized scoldings of players? Suddenly they're not so
cute, and the players aren't so patient.</TE>
<TE>   Those celebrated stretches during games where he never even stands
up? Thoughtful becomes uninterested, and motivation becomes
eccentricity.</TE>
<TE>   Would Jackson still be a great coach? Of course. The facts are
still the facts. His record of 22 consecutive playoff series
victories will probably never be broken.</TE>
<TE>   But as the fallen Riley can attest, much of the modern game is
about perception. One loss this weekend, besides engendering much
celebration from a league that thinks he is already too big for his
designer britches, could subtly alter that perception in the manner
that a downhill nudge alters a boulder.</TE>
<TE>   The "heated discussions" with Shaquille O'Neal could become wars.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called agreements with Kobe Bryant about defensive
assignments could become feuds.</TE>
<TE>   The referees won't pay him as much homage. The fans won't cut him
as much slack. We're assuming the boss' daughter will still be in
love, but everything else will be in play.</TE>
<TE>   Already in this postseason, Jackson's rich Laker landscape has
suffered the withering effects of several tiny fires.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when he publicly called out O'Neal in the middle of the
second round against San Antonio? O'Neal responded with good effort,
but also with attitude, waving off Jackson during one timeout, then
offering this memorable explanation for an important late rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to hear Phil's mouth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was also during the Spur series that Bryant appeared to wave
off Jackson while leaving the floor, moving his hands as if imitating
someone talking too much. The motions were never quite explained, but
Bryant's disgusted expression might be construed as a hint.</TE>
<TE>   Are the players starting to treat Jackson as all players
eventually treat the greatest NBA coaches?</TE>
<TE>   In other words, are they starting to tune him out?</TE>
<TE>   This question arose again last Friday when, faced with one of
Jackson's trademark throat-grabbing games, his team cowered.</TE>
<TE>   Falling behind by 17 points in the first quarter of Game 3 did not
imply focus.</TE>
<TE>   Falling behind by 20 points in the first quarter of Game 4 did not
announce preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Off the court, it has become just as messy. Jackson revealed that
O'Neal didn't want the ball in the first quarter, then became mired
in a semantics discussion with Bryant about who was going to guard
Mike Bibby at the end of Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like he's saying anything to the newspapers that he
hasn't already said to our faces," Rick Fox said. "We understand it.
We accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's still way out there, those techniques that have included
leaving O'Neal in one playoff game to pick up his fourth foul late in
the first half, and completely ignoring guard Mitch Richmond for 11
playoff games before throwing him into a pressure situation Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how one playoff elimination can shake that tightrope.</TE>
<TE>   Amazing as it would have seemed a month ago, the calmer, sharper
coach this week has appeared to be the Kings' Rick Adelman.</TE>
<TE>   It is Adelman who has designed the pick-and-rolls that the Lakers
cannot decipher. It is Adelman who has adjusted his offense without
the team's second-leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   It is Adelman who figured out that Mike Bibby should take that
last shot Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   It is Jackson who did not order Bryant to guard him.</TE>
<TE>   And here comes the annual parade of colleague critics, from the
ridiculous (Bob Huggins) to the sublime (Auerbach), all of them
claiming Jackson doesn't manage games and doesn't teach and doesn't
deserve such respect.</TE>
<TE>   That's so silly. The Lakers could not have won the first two
championships of this new era without Jackson, and even Jerry West
knows it.</TE>
<TE>   But now they are expected to win a third, and good enough to win a
third, with a coach who is being paid $6 million annually to make it
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot about coaching," Jackson acknowledged Thursday, one
day before a game that could be a lot about him.</TE>

<HD>Serious Flight Risk</HD>
<DH>Three deaths this year raise concerns about pole-vaulting
dangers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Competitors blast full bore down runways and lean hard into
fiberglass poles, propelling themselves in an arc over a bar set as
high as two stories above the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Is it any wonder that the pole vault has always been a favorite
event of track and field fans?</LD>
<LD>   Vaulters are fancied as quintessential athletes, relying on
sprinter's speed, a body builder's strength and the agility of a
lithe gymnast as they soar ever higher into the sky and the record
books.</LD>
<TE>   And, increasingly it seems, they require one more characteristic:
The nerve of a daredevil.</TE>
<TE>   The pole vault is the most dangerous of school-sanctioned athletic
events, according to statistics compiled by the National Center for
Catastrophic Sports Injury Research in Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   This year, three teenagers have died from injuries sustained while
vaulting. Jesus Quesada, 16, of Clewiston (Fla.) High; Kevin Dare,
19, of Penn State; and Samoa Fili II, 17, of Wichita (Kan.) Southeast
High are the 18th, 19th and 20th vaulters to die since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   At meets like the NCAA championships, which started Wednesday in
Baton Rouge, La., and the state high school championships, which are
today and Saturday at Cerritos College, pole vaulters will attempt to
reach record heights.</TE>
<TE>   As the bar climbs, so do calls for more stringent safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Those accidents are a reminder for all of us that we [participate
in] a serious sport and we need to be careful," said Paul Litchfield,
who set a Big Sky Conference record of 17 feet 8 inches for Idaho
State this month. "We need to do everything we can to make the event
as safe as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The National Federation of State High School Assn. (NFHS) is
considering several proposals to make the popular event more safe.
Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the size of the foam-rubber landing mat.</TE>
<TE>   Marking an ideal landing area on the mat to make it obvious if
vaulters are landing wrong and need to make an adjustment in a
technical aspect of their jump.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring that the edges of the metal "box"--in which vaulters
plant the tips of their poles--to be covered by a padded collar.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring vaulters to wear protective helmets like those worn by
skateboarders and inline skaters.</TE>
<TE>   But one prominent coach says the event would be far less dangerous
if event organizers, coaches and athletes would adhere to the safety
measures already in place.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules we currently have on the books are not that bad," said
Jan Johnson, the 1972 Olympic bronze medal winner and chairman of USA
Track &amp; Field's pole vault safety committee. "But of the nine
catastrophic [vaulting] injuries that occurred [from 1995-2001], all
came at facilities that were out of compliance [with the safety
standards established in 1995]. And of the [24] catastrophic injuries
that occurred in the seven years before that, every one of them came
at facilities that would not have met the safety standards adopted in
1995."</TE>
<TE>   "Catastrophic" accidents are those that lead to the death of a
vaulter or to a serious injury such as coma, paralysis, severe
concussion, skull fracture or broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, there have been two deaths. In 1980, Cliff Snyder, 23,
died in a vaulting accident at San Diego State when he flipped off
the back of the landing mat and hit his head on asphalt. In 1997,
Heath Taylor, 16, was killed in similar circumstances during a
practice at Newhall Hart High.</TE>
<TE>   News reports on Taylor's death said Hart's 20-foot-by-22-foot
landing mat exceeded national safety recommendations, but the hard
surfaces around the pit were not covered by padding in accordance
with standards adopted two years earlier by the NFHS.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's parents sued the William S. Hart Union High School
District for wrongful death in December 1997, a case that was settled
out of court in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Madonna Taylor, Heath's stepmother, said the suit was filed, in
part, to publicize that some schools weren't adhering to all the
safety standards. "We wanted to send a message to any high school or
college that they shouldn't be doing this if they weren't going to
follow the rules," she said. "But in the end, it just would have been
too painful to relive the whole thing again in court."</TE>
<TE>   The NFHS adopted several new safety measures for the pole vault in
1995--the requirement for additional padding around the landing pit
among them. Other guidelines were instituted preventing vaulters from
holding the pole at a height above a line deemed safe by the
manufacturer and from jumping on poles that were recommended for
athletes who weighed less.</TE>
<TE>   The rule limiting how high a vaulter can grip a pole is designed
to increase the chances of competitors maintaining control of their
direction. Experts say younger and less experienced vaulters were
getting in trouble by trying to emulate world-class athletes who were
using longer poles and gripping them unconventionally higher.</TE>
<TE>   The rush to reach greater heights similarly prompted some vaulters
to use poles that were marked for use by lighter athletes, figuring
the more they could bend the poles the more strongly they would be
propelled. Some poles snapped, or launched vaulters in dangerous
angles.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the rule changes seemed to work.</TE>
<TE>   The number of catastrophic injuries dropped 60% compared to the
seven-year span before the 1995 rule changes, according to a study
conducted by Johnson and doctors Paul Pilla and Barry Boden of
Landover, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Critics attribute the sudden rash of deaths to some high schools
still not adhering to all the safety measures established in 1995,
particularly that of covering hard surfaces with padding. And some
colleges don't cover all exposed hard surfaces because collegiate
rules don't require it.</TE>
<TE>   Quesada and Fili died of injuries sustained when their heads hit
uncovered hard surfaces after they had either slid off the landing
pit or hit the pad with their bodies but struck their head on an
uncovered hard surface.</TE>
<TE>   Dare died after hitting his head on the metal box where vaulters
plant the tips of their poles to create the bend that springs them
toward the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos College, which hosted the Southern Section Masters Meet
last Friday, and Van Nuys Birmingham High, which hosted the City
Section championships on May 23, have vaulting facilities that meet
the safety standards passed in 1995. But when Bakersfield College
hosted the Central Section high school championships on May 16, the
base of the metal standards that hold up the bar were left exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "For something as simple as that to be left out at a facility of
that caliber was surprising," said David Costa, who has helped coach
his daughter, Kira, during her first season of pole vaulting for
Lemoore High. "We were at several high schools this season that
didn't have all the padding, but I was surprised to see that at a
place like [Bakersfield College]."</TE>
<TE>   Costa was not aware that Bakersfield is not required to cover hard
surfaces in order to compete at the community college level. Nor are
there rules prohibiting college vaulters from gripping a pole above
the maximum hold line or from jumping on poles that are recommended
for lighter athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the feeling has always been that college coaches are
dealing with kids with higher skill levels," Johnson said about the
lack of strict college safety standards. "That might be a mirage."</TE>
<TE>   The size of the landing pad is one area where colleges and high
schools have identical safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   Both the NCAA and NFHS require the minimum width of the landing
pad to be 16 feet 6 inches and the minimum length to be 12 feet from
the back of the vaulting box to the back of the pad. But those
dimensions are expected to be increased to six meters (to 19-8) by
five meters (to 16-5) when an NFHS rules review committee meets in
Indianapolis next month.</TE>
<TE>   The NFHS might wait a year to implement the change if it feels
that a large number of schools will have difficulty paying for the
modular sections that would attach to the current landing pits and
help them meet the new specifications.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated cost of the modular sections is $1,500, compared to
the $7,000-$8,000 needed to purchase a new pit.</TE>
<TE>   One change that is not likely to occur soon is the mandated use of
helmets by vaulters.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which adopted its rule shortly after Dare's death at
the Big Ten Conference Indoor championships in Minneapolis, and North
Dakota are the only states that require vaulters wear helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation was proposed this year to make helmets mandatory in
New York, but has been stalled by concerns that the New York State
High School Athletic Assn. could be liable if it forces vaulters to
wear helmets that are not designed specifically for the pole vault
and there is an injury that gets blamed on the helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Since his son's death, Ed Dare has become a proponent for a
mandatory helmet rule, saying it would significantly decrease the
number of catastrophic injuries. Not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsey Koty, the only female in the U.S. to have suffered a
catastrophic injury while vaulting, was in a coma for nearly two
weeks last year after being injured while competing for Eastern
Washington University in an indoor meet.</TE>
<TE>   Koty hit her head on the field-house floor at Eastern Washington
after flipping off the side of the landing mat, but says she might
have suffered a more serious injury had she been wearing a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "[Doctors and some coaches who saw what happened] said that
because of the way I landed and the angle I came down, I could have
snapped my neck had I been wearing a helmet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Toby Stevenson, a six-time All-American vaulter at Stanford from
1997-2000, scoffs at the notion that wearing a helmet could increase
his chances of sustaining a severe head injury.</TE>
<TE>   "There hasn't been anybody hurt [in a vaulting accident] while
wearing a helmet," said Stevenson, who cleared a career-best 18-10 on
Sunday in the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore. "It's just another
measure you can take to protect yourself in case of an accident."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson began vaulting when he was 12 and started wearing a
helmet at his parents' insistence during his senior season at Odessa
(Texas) Permian High in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   He at first opposed wearing a helmet because it didn't look "cool"
and he was concerned it would have a negative impact on his
performances. But it hasn't hindered his vaulting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm proof that that's not the case," Stevenson said. "I'm
not a great vaulter, but I am pretty good. I was a 17-foot vaulter in
high school, an 18-foot vaulter in college, an Olympic trials
finalist [in 2000] and I hope soon to be a 19-foot vaulter."</TE>
<TE>   Still, vaulters such as Johnson's daughter, Chelsea, a senior at
Atascadero High, aren't sold on helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a dangerous vaulter, then you should wear one," said
Johnson, the top girls' vaulter in the nation with a best of 13-6.
"But if you're a safe vaulter who doesn't take unnecessary chances,
you don't need to wear one."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Nielsen, the men's and women's track coach at Idaho State and
the women's pole vault development coordinator for USA Track &amp; Field,
says a helmet probably would not have saved Dare's life because he
fell from a height of about 16 feet. But he started making his two
sons in high school and his vaulters at Idaho State wear helmets
shortly after Fili's death.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I've never been real big on the helmet thing,"
Nielsen said. "But after those three accidents, I felt like [our
vaulters at Idaho State] could set an example for high school kids.
That we could show we were aware of the risks involved in vaulting."</TE>
<TE>   Litchfield, who competes in a green, black and white camouflage
helmet he has decorated with pliable spikes made out of black
electrical tape, says it's crucial that inexperienced vaulters wear
helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "If coaches made kids wear helmets when they first started
vaulting, it'd be like second nature to them and they wouldn't have a
problem with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Johnson isn't sold on the safety benefits of helmets, but he
is convinced the pole vault must become safer if it is going to
survive at the high school level in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to [make safety improvements] or we're going to lose the
sport," he said.</TE>

<HD>Beckham Ready to Foot the Bill</HD>
<DH>World Cup: His injury healed, English midfielder wants to
erase bitter memory of red card in 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>The foot that adorned the front page of the English tabloid the Sun,
which beseeched readers to use it as a prayer mat, has healed.</LD>
<LD>   The figure that appears on the cover of the current British GQ,
bare chest oiled, arms stretched out like a martyr's in front of the
Cross of St. George, now wears an England uniform again.</LD>
<LD>   The soccer star who is treated like a deity in the Far East, where
a Buddhist temple has erected a gold statue in his likeness, where
his appearance at a shopping mall caused such hysteria the mall had
to be closed, has arrived in Japan, given medical clearance to return
to his stage.</LD>
<TE>   BECKS IS BACK!</TE>
<TE>   BECKS IS BACK!</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he is, and in the history of international soccer, there has
never been a comeback quite like the one David Beckham has just
pulled off.</TE>
<TE>   The broken foot? Oh, right, that was a bit of a nuisance for a
while. Kept Beckham off the field for six weeks, kept all of England
on pins and needles waiting for the next medical update as the World
Cup opener approached, fearing that the captain and the world's best
free-kick specialist would be lost for the first round, making the
second round a moot point.</TE>
<TE>   But last weekend, Beckham was training with the England team
again. In case you missed it, England's tabloids didn't. Monday's
Daily Mirror ran one full-page photo and three smaller ones of
Beckham kicking a ball, along with a bold headline, to provide
further reassurance: "The Foot kicks the ball."</TE>
<TE>   And the subhead: "Sight All England Fans Wanted To See."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday at a news conference in Higashiura, Beckham told a
relieved nation that he was ready to play 90 minutes against Sweden
Sunday if needed because "being in a World Cup, you've got to be sure
you can last a game, and all the games."</TE>
<TE>   He said he felt "a lot better than I did four or five days ago"
and reported that "my fitness is good" and that "I always had it in
my mind to be back for the Sweden game, so hopefully it will be OK."</TE>
<TE>   But then, Beckham has dealt with worse. The broken foot was
nothing compared to the damage done to Beckham, by Beckham, in the
1998 World Cup and the amazing recovery he devised in the four years
that followed.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of '98, Beckham was the most hated man in England.
His 47th-minute red card against Argentina--a petulant flick of the
foot at the shins of the opponent who had just fouled him, Diego
Simeone, committed right in front of the referee--was seen as about
the highest crime a British athlete could commit: letting the side
down at the crucial moment.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham's ill-timed retaliation, however slight, meant England
would have to play the rest of its second-round match against the
dreaded Argentines shorthanded. Only 10 men left to clean up the
spill little-brat Beckham had created, playing on for 73 more minutes
before the overtime whistle blew and England was eliminated on
penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten Heroic Lions And One Stupid Boy" spat the headline in the
next day's London Mirror.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Telegraph took the outrage several steps further,
lashing out at everything Beckham, from his romance to Spice Girl
Victoria (Posh Spice) Adams to his fey and flashy off-the-field
lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "Beckham's silly little, smart little kick at his Argentinian
opponent was what's wrong with the national character," the paper
ranted. "This Gaultier-saronged, Posh Spiced, Cooled Brittannia,
look-at-me, what-a-lad, loadsamoney, sex-and-shopping, fame-schooled,
daytime-TV, over-coiffed twerp did not, of course, mean any harm.
Like almost everything stupid that makes English life less fun than
it could be and should be, it was only 'messing about.' As always,
other people have to clear up the mess."</TE>
<TE>   That captured the national mood fairly well.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Beckham had returned to England after the World Cup,
he had been hung in effigy in the streets of London. He needed a
police escort to join his Manchester United teammates at their
preseason training camp. A church in Nottingham put up a sign that
reminded all the sinners who passed by, "God Forgives Even David
Beckham."</TE>
<TE>   Beckham was greeted by hostile, obscene chants at road games
throughout the 1998-99 season, one that ended in Beckham leading
United to three championships--the European Champions League and
English Premier League and F.A. Cup titles. The fans were still after
him, taunting him so crudely after a loss to Portugal at the 2000
European Championship, that Beckham responded, famously and
controversially, by flipping off the hecklers.</TE>
<TE>   It took a foreigner, a Swede named Sven-Goran Eriksson, to provide
some perspective and give Beckham the break he needed to salvage his
reputation. In so doing, Eriksson gave himself a needed break as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Hired in late 2000 to coach the England national team, the first
non-Englishman to carry the title, Eriksson was an unpopular choice.
What was a Scandinavian doing in charge of England, the country that
invented soccer, holding down the most important job in the land?
Worse still, what was he doing entrusting the captaincy of England's
2002 World Cup qualification campaign to Beckham, the scourge of the
1998 World Cup?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because he wasn't English, Eriksson could keep his field
of vision trained on, and only on, this one essential: Beckham was
not only the best player England had, not only the best English
player since Paul Gascoigne, but also a young man--then 25--who had
endured the wrath of the entire country, stood up to the adversity
and continued to produce championships for Manchester United when he
easily could have fled to Italy or Spain for sanctuary's and sanity's
sake.</TE>
<TE>   Eriksson saw leadership potential amid the expensive cars and
pop-star marriage. England was last in its qualification group when
Eriksson and Beckham began the overhaul in early 2001. By October,
they had dragged England all the way to first place--Beckham
clinching the trip to the World Cup with a spectacular, equalizing
free kick in injury time against Greece.</TE>
<TE>   Replays of that incredible goal, along with postgame scenes of a
beaming Beckham celebrating with a red, white and blue England banner
tucked inside his waistband, completed the makeover. Image isn't
everything, but in England's ever-fickle pop culture, it comes
awfully close. From pariah to messiah--Beckham had completed a holy,
wholly unexpected transformation.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of his next encounter with a hard Argentine tackle,
the one that sent him to the disabled list in April, Beckham's
popularity in England had spilled over the top. Aldo Duscher, an
Argentine defender who plays for Deportivo La Coruna, leveled Beckham
with a two-footed challenge that broke a bone in Beckham's left foot.</TE>
<TE>   The initial medical prognosis: Beckham would be out six to eight
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   England's World Cup prognosis: If Beckham's out, God save the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair and the queen both weighed in on the
matter, offering their hope that Beckham would be healed in time for
the World Cup. Fearing that might not quite do the job, the Sun put a
photo of Beckham's bare foot on its cover and told readers to use it
as a prayer mat, rubbing it "at high noon on Sunday and pray."</TE>
<TE>   For Beckham, it has been a seven-week hurricane of insanity
surrounding seclusion and boredom. While the country hyperventilated,
Beckham was spending quiet nights inside an oxygen tent, a strategy
intended to expedite the healing process. While a sporting goods
company plastered Beckham's face, 65 feet wide and 65 feet high, on a
massive billboard in Birmingham, England, with the words, "Cometh The
Hour," Beckham was readying for that hour by jogging countless miles
on a treadmill and kicking a soccer ball on a small trampoline.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first did the injury, I did think I would miss out,"
Beckham said. "My first question to the surgeon was whether I was
going to be fit for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "But time has moved on and in the past seven weeks I have worked
harder than I probably ever have."</TE>
<TE>   Time heals many different things, Beckham has found. If England
has managed to finally forgive him for the red card of '98, he
believes he can do the same with Duscher and his bone-breaking
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to forgive," he said. "I always forgive people, most
of the time. It's not a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the most demanding task belongs to the security force
assigned to Sunday's England-Sweden match in Saitama. One week
earlier, as England arrived in Kobe for a warmup match against
Cameroon, police strained to control a crowd of almost 600 Japanese
fans--many of them wearing Beckham jerseys, many of them women--who
showed up at the airport to welcome the man they call, in reverent
tones, "Bekuhamu."</TE>
<TE>   Bekuhamu is back. England doesn't have to play shorthanded
anymore.</TE>

<HD>Bush Must Avoid Shortcuts on Road to War</HD>
<DH>President should not try to sidestep Congress in any action
against Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE ACKERMAN</AU>
<BD>Bruce Ackerman, a professor of constitutional law at
Yale, participated as a friend of the court in the lawsuit described
in this article.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has been busy reassuring Europeans that he "has no war
plans" on his desk for an invasion of Iraq. Such statements can only
evoke concern at home. Even when the president receives his plans
from the military, he lacks the authority to execute them. The
Constitution makes him commander in chief, but only Congress can
declare war.</LD>
<LD>   We have been here before.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after the congressional elections of 1990, the first
President Bush ordered a massive increase of American troops for an
offensive against Iraq. Dick Cheney, then Defense secretary, publicly
announced that the president did not "require any additional
authorization from the Congress before committing U.S. forces to
achieve our objectives."</LD>
<TE>   Fifty-four members of Congress responded by going to court and
demanding an injunction against military action until both houses
gave their explicit approval. The administration was unimpressed by
the lawsuit. It told the court to stay out and treat the matter as a
"political question."</TE>
<TE>   The case speedily came to trial in federal district court, where
Judge Harold Greene roundly rejected the president's claims.</TE>
<TE>   While handing Congress a victory on the merits, Greene was more
cautious when it came to a remedy. In his view, the time was not yet
ripe for decisive judicial intervention. As far as he could tell, a
peaceful settlement with Iraq was still possible, and it wasn't clear
whether a majority of Congress would oppose the war if negotiations
broke down. So why intervene when the whole issue might dissolve and
make judicial intrusion unnecessary?</TE>
<TE>   The next move was up to the elder President Bush: He might press
on unilaterally and challenge Congress to return to Greene's court
for an injunction once war was clearly in the cards. Or he could call
a halt to the escalating institutional battle and ask both houses
explicitly to authorize the war.</TE>
<TE>   This was an easy choice for the public: Polls showed that more
than 70% favored explicit congressional authorization.</TE>
<TE>   After mulling over the matter, the president bowed to the
combination of law and public opinion. In January 1991, he dropped
his unilateralist claim and formally requested both houses to approve
the attack against Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The first shot was fired only after Congress gave its consent.</TE>
<TE>   The argument for legislative authorization is more compelling the
second time around. In 1991, the country was responding to a clear
act of aggression. Nobody could doubt that Iraq had invaded Kuwait.
And a lengthy congressional debate might have cost American lives
because Hussein's soldiers would have had more time to prepare for
the invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The second President Bush can't take advantage of either
extenuating factor.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than pointing to a clear boundary-crossing, he will be
offering circumstantial evidence of Iraq's atomic and biological
weapons program. If this evidence is truly persuasive, he should have
no trouble convincing a majority of Congress. But if the president
attempts to skirt Congress, it will cast doubt on whether his claims
can survive a fair test in the court of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is time of the essence. We aren't dealing with a situation
where Iraqi troops can dig in while Congress dithers.</TE>
<TE>   A second American invasion would, at most, prevent a future threat
to national security. Nobody seriously suggests that a debate of a
week or a month would cause permanent damage.</TE>
<TE>   There is no good reason for Bush to deviate from the precedent set
by his father in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But aren't we already embarked on a "war against terrorism"? In
invading Iraq, isn't the president simply opening another front in an
ongoing struggle? This might serve as a TV sound bite, but it is
nonsense as a matter of law.</TE>
<TE>   Up until now, Congress authorized "necessary and appropriate
force" only against those who "aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on Sept. 11." The Bush administration has failed to
implicate Hussein in those attacks. If a second invasion of Iraq is
justified, it is because of a future threat.</TE>
<TE>   The real question is how the administration meets its
constitutional responsibilities. The first President Bush did not
abandon unilateralism without a fight. Will his son also escalate the
institutional confrontation at home as he accelerates war
preparations abroad?</TE>
<TE>   This is no time for constitutional brinkmanship. The president
should take the first opportunity to say that he respects the
constitutional precedents established during the Gulf War. It will be
tough enough to confront the prospect of a major war soberly without
attempting an end run around the people's representatives.</TE>

<HD>Skid Rowers Don't Deserve the Boot</HD>
<DH>L.A. plan would oust thousands from hotels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALICE CALLAGHAN</AU>
<BD>Alice Callaghan, an Episcopal priest, directs Las
Familias del Pueblo, a nonprofit community center in downtown Los
Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The poor of skid row are down and soon to be out. The city has cast
its lot with developers and bankers who want to reclaim skid row for
the rich.</LD>
<LD>   How is it in anyone's interest for a handful of developers to reap
huge financial windfalls by purchasing old buildings on skid row's 50
blocks? With little down, often borrowing off inflated prices,
pockets full of public tax and financial incentives, these
opportunists will inflict lasting pain and financial burden on the
rest of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Skid row's 65 single-room-occupancy hotels are home to nearly
8,000 of the area's 11,000 elderly, handicapped and single poor. If
Los Angeles had a surplus of affordable housing for skid rowers,
whose income often is a $223 monthly relief check, demolishing many
of skid row's SRO hotels might be sound public policy. But Los
Angeles does not.</LD>
<TE>   Loss of the existing 6,500 rooms would leave the city facing the
massive and costly task of providing ongoing emergency shelter for
the 8,000 poor who right now pay their own rent.</TE>
<TE>   The city's elite once lived in estates on Main and Los Angeles
streets. Construction of rail lines at Central between 4th and 6th
streets spurred the building of rooming houses, tenements, saloons
and commercial businesses along 5th Street. By the time of the
Depression, the city's poorest had moved in to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by deteriorating physical conditions on skid row in the
late 1950s, the city demolished 5,500 hotel rooms and apartments and
then complained that the homeless took to sleeping on city sidewalks.
This shortsighted policy was wisely reversed when the Central City
Community Plan in 1974 and the Central Business District
Redevelopment Project of 1975 were adopted. The highest priority
became a comprehensive solution to the skid row problem--attention
was turned to the human dimension and decent housing through
rehabilitation and new construction. Every community redevelopment
plan over the past 25 years has reaffirmed this commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in its new plan, the city seems not to think of skid row's
human dimension. Indeed, it does not even mention skid row. Instead,
as though struck by a collective short-term memory loss, the city
divides Main Street in half and no longer regards three major hotels
there as SROs. Instead, the three hotels can be turned into
mixed-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   For City Hall to abandon 30 years of planning and several hundred
million dollars already invested in implementing those plans is
economically as well as socially irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1974, the city concluded that dispersing skid row
residents would cause horrific economic and social harm to everyone
in the city. Skid rowers have to live somewhere. If the large SROs on
Main Street are not protected, the homeless of skid row will spread
throughout the city, sleeping in whatever parks and neighborhood
lawns they can find.</TE>
<TE>   More than one-third of all skid row housing is in the Main Street
area. The new plan must be directed toward retention and
rehabilitation of this irreplaceable housing for skid rowers. The
affluent, on whose behalf skid row's dwindling SROs are being
converted to lofts, can live 15 minutes away in Pasadena or Santa
Monica. They have options.</TE>
<TE>   Skid row is the last place where a community's poorest can find
free or cheap housing, free food and free clothing. The new plan is
written as though skid row and its human misery are not a concern of
economic and social importance.</TE>
<TE>   A city is a great city not because its poor cannot be seen but
because its poor can be seen living in places of dignity.</TE>

<HD>How Big a Corporate Disaster Is Needed?</HD>
<DH>Washington, musing about a trigger for reform, barely
remembers Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hindsight--it's all the rage in Washington. But though the story of
the missed terrorism warning signals is eating up all the headlines,
there is another story of warning signs being ignored by our elected
officials that's getting hardly any ink.</LD>
<LD>   Here are a few of those signs: In the last two years, more than
400 public companies--including Enron, Global Crossing and
Kmart--have declared bankruptcy. Two million Americans have lost
their jobs. Four trillion dollars in market value has been lost on
Wall Street. And each day brings a fresh, stomach-turning revelation
of the rampant corruption infecting corporate America. Despite these
ominous flashing red lights, it now appears almost certain that no
real reform legislation will come out of Congress before the November
elections. And that means fresh disasters down the road.</LD>
<LD>   It's a textbook case of special interests triumphing over the
public interest. The biggest winners are those veteran Washington
arm-twisters, the powerful--and well-funded--accounting and financial
services lobbies. That's right, the same folks who helped bring us
this mess by relentlessly chipping away at the rules and regulations
governing their industries are now ensuring that any efforts to clean
things up will be thwarted.</LD>
<TE>   The latest example of their sinister handiwork is the sudden
shelving of Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S. Sarbanes'
accounting reform bill, a muscular measure that would have
strengthened the Securities and Exchange Commission, restricted
accounting firms' ability to double-dip as consultants and auditors
for the same client and imposed stringent conflict-of-interest rules
on the investment banking world.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the bill is in a deep coma and not expected to survive,
having been pummeled to within an inch of its legislative life by a
goon squad of finance lobbyists and their No. 1 Senate enforcer, Phil
Gramm (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   First, the lobbyists brought out the rhetorical brass knuckles,
issuing an "action alert" that Sarbanes' bill "could result in
serious, harmful consequences for capital markets and American
business." The warning on a pack of cigarettes is less alarmist. Then
Gramm pulled out his copy of Robert's Rules of Parliamentary
Obstruction and went to work--pressing Chairman Sarbanes (D-Md.) to
hold more hearings on the bill, even though the Banking Committee had
already held 10 since Feb. 12, and offering scores of last-minute
amendments. It was democracy at its worst.</TE>
<TE>   It should come as no surprise that, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, the accounting industry has already doled out
$5.2million in 2002 campaign contributions--with $293,196 of that
going to 16 of the 21 members of the Senate Banking Committee,
including $37,500 to Gramm.</TE>
<TE>   It was this generous spreading of financial manure that doomed an
earlier effort, led by then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, to bar
accounting firms from serving as both incorruptible auditor and
smarmy sales help for the same company. And it was the same financial
industry lobbying muscle that over the last decade pushed through
legislation gutting so many of the regulations designed to bring
accountability to our complex free market system.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the White House seems less than eager to put a reform
bill on the president's desk. Apparently, the post-Enron panic that
inspired the president to propose a 10-point plan that included a
reform of accounting standards has subsided.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the administration's current do-nothing posture has
something to do with the revelation this week that the SEC is
investigating whether Halliburton Co., which had Vice President Dick
Cheney as its chief executive from 1995 to 2000, used questionable
accounting practices to pump up its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely," Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), a Banking Committee
member championing reform, said this week, "that we will get strong
reform unless there is a new event that captures the [public]
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   You mean the largest corporate bankruptcy in history and the
parade of corruption that has followed weren't big enough?</TE>
<TE>   That's like saying the events of Sept. 11 were not enough, that we
have to wait for the next horrific attack before we get serious about
taking on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Do we have to wait for another 400 companies to go belly up and
2million more Americans to lose their jobs before our leaders heed
the warning signals and make passing the post-Enron reforms a top
priority? How about a little foresight to go along with the heaping
helping of hindsight that Washington is serving up?</TE>

<AU>ARTHUR J. MAGIDA</AU>
<BD>Arthur J. Magida, the writer-in-residence at the
University of Baltimore, is writing a book on a New Jersey rabbi
accused of hiring two hit men to kill his wife. HarperCollins is due
to publish it in 2003.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pipers played, the politicians stood (silently, for a change),
the buglers sounded taps and the steel beam and the empty stretcher
were removed from what has become known as ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters and police officers--the tough guys--cried last
September; they cried again Thursday morning, as many of us did on
both days and many other days in between. And as we may continue to
for a good balance of our lives as we try to digest and understand
and come to terms with what this new void, this abyss, in our hearts
is all about.</LD>
<LD>   Yet some people already are talking about "closure," as if the
trucking of a 58-ton steel beam from a bulldozed ground zero would
heal our hearts.</LD>
<TE>   But this isn't the kind of pain that can be contained by
ceremonies and rituals. Life isn't that orderly. Or tidy. Clearing
the site (and soon, it appears, building something on it: a memorial?
an office building? another skyscraper?) will not fill up the
emptiness left by the attacks of last September and the incineration
of so many good people and the shattering of our security and our
comforts. These losses cannot, will not, should not be brushed away
that easily and that swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   Suffering does not follow a neat timetable; there is no term limit
on grief. It cannot be placed on a shelf or packed away in a drawer
or sent out into the vestibule where we can visit it at our
convenience. Over time it might lessen, but it will not be forgotten
or dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   People might shift from living within their sadness to living with
it, but that will not necessarily brighten the shadow that has
darkened the life of everyone acquainted with what happened on that
day in September.</TE>
<TE>   William Butler Yeats wrote that actors in a tragedy "do not break
up their lines to weep." He was right, in his own narrow way. But we
have not been living a play since Sept. 11, however much we may wish
we had been. By now, pain has seeped into so many corners of so many
lives that it is hard to escape. An eventual "resolution" may assure
police officers and firefighters and soldiers and bureaucrats that
they've done their job and done it well. But such an official manner
of dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks will not end
the sorrow, and we should not pretend that it will.</TE>
<TE>   Words have failed us since September, and words will continue to
fail us, as have--and will--rites and rituals and memorials. Each of
us is left with filling the silence and the void as best we can, and
for that there are really no answers and no rituals and no rites.</TE>
<TE>   So we remain with the silence and the sorrows and the void, which
have enveloped us for much too long now. And to which we had better
become accustomed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Japan, millions of consumers are using hand-held phones with a
screen the size of a business card to communicate on the Internet. In
Europe, by contrast, a buying frenzy for government licenses for
so-called third-generation wireless mobile networks has nearly
bankrupted the telecom industry. The U.S. can profit from both
situations. But first the Federal Communications Commission has to
make available frequency spectrums that are caught between
broadcasters and the wireless industry.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1994, the FCC has been auctioning off parts of the broadcast
spectrum, but the disputed upper band of the 700-megahertz spectrum
is particularly suited for wireless carriers. Chairman Michael Powell
has repeatedly delayed auctioning this part of the spectrum, most
recently until January 2003.</LD>
<LD>   He needs to get the licenses sold, to push the wireless industry
into global competitiveness and get a fair price for the taxpayers.
In doing so, he should also not allow broadcasters to receive an
undeserved windfall.</LD>
<TE>   Congress temporarily granted broadcasters the rights to extra
spectrum in 1996, in return for developing digital high-definition
television while still offering analog signals. They're supposed to
relinquish their older spectrum holdings when 85% of U.S. households
have a digital-ready television set; at the moment, that goal looks a
long way off. But in the meantime, the broadcasters are allowed to
cut their own deals to give up the part of the spectrum most valuable
to wireless uses.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters are demanding that wireless carriers pay them
hundreds of millions of dollars in fees--on top of the more than $2
billion the FCC has set for its auction price. The wireless carriers,
however, are balking at what would amount to paying twice--once to
the FCC to buy the license; the second time to the broadcasters to
use it.</TE>
<TE>   The wireless carriers favor delay. They figure that the longer the
auction is put off, the greater the chance the commission will act to
stop the broadcasters from making a windfall off public airwaves.
They have a point. Powell should certainly limit or ban side fees to
broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   European carriers fear that U.S. companies are poised to exploit
their mistakes. As Business Week reports in its June 3 issue, firms
like Britain's Vodafone and Germany's Deutsche Telekom are awash in
debt after spending half a trillion dollars on licenses and networks,
only to discover they weren't selling the data services that
consumers wanted. They fear that corporations like Microsoft have the
smarts to build on Japan's success, designing and marketing
user-friendly devices. By freeing the airwaves, the FCC can speed up
U.S. wireless dominance at home and abroad.</TE>

<HD>Value of Standardized Tests</HD>

<LD>No standardized test is perfect. That includes the Stanford 9, the
statewide test used to measure and compare California schools'
progress in teaching language and math. It may test a subject before
it is taught. The calibrations may be based on a national sampling
that lacks the kaleidoscopic diversity of this state's public school
enrollment.</LD>
<LD>   Those flaws are not good reasons to end standardized testing,
which is the most accurate way California has to compare one school
with another, one year with another, one teacher with another. An
approved motion by the Los Angeles school board to consider
alternative forms of evaluation for children who speak limited
English won't halt the Stanford 9 in any case, because the state
requires it.</LD>
<LD>   Genethia Hudley Hayes and Jose Huizar, the school board members
who proposed the motion, say they question whether a national
standardized test like the Stanford 9, on which many low-income black
and Latino children do poorly, is the best measure. Four board
members this week approved the proposal, and the San Francisco school
board is scheduled to vote on a similar motion in June.</LD>
<TE>   The critics of the Stanford 9 are shooting the messenger. Allowing
a variety of evaluations could yield scores that resist comparison.
Accountability would be lost. Look at the progress in early grades
across the state in recent years, lifting rich and poor, native
speaker and not. Without standardized testing, who would deliver that
good news?</TE>
<TE>   A test linked specifically to academic content in the classroom
would provide the most accurate measure of how students are doing.
Until California can approve a customized content-based test,
however, an off-the-shelf standardized test is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government also insists on regular testing in school
districts that receive federal funds for disadvantaged children.
Otherwise, school districts could continue to blow millions of
dollars on untrained teachers' aides, unproven programs and
ineffective consultants. When poor and immigrant children get low
scores on standardized tests, the results point to areas where they
need the most help. Their parents and teachers need a baseline to
measure improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The board members also say in their motion that they believe their
low-income and immigrant students would do better if they had the
best teachers and facilities instead of the most inexperienced
teachers, the worst campuses and the most convoluted and disrupted
year-round school calendar. Of course. But those conditions would not
be affected by a new test.</TE>
<TE>   It is also unfair to lower expectations for poor, minority
children by suggesting they can't get high scores. First-graders in
Los Angeles public schools scored above the national average last
year. Thousands of children beat stereotypes at schools like Bright
Elementary, Martin Luther King Elementary and Barrett Elementary,
where standardized test scores are high and rising. Chronic failure
at other L.A. schools shouldn't be blamed on the test.</TE>

<LD>Any sport sounds stupid on paper. Sitting in a boat dangling a string
in the water while waiting for a fish? Shooting defenseless animals
running away? Ten overgrown men dropping sweat on a gym floor and
trying to get a ball through a hoop twice a minute? Waiting for hours
until a man with a bat hits a little rubber-core ball into stands
where people are eating hot dogs and drinking beer? Hitting a little
white ball into holes in the grass? A team of huge men armored with
helmets and shoulder pads crashing full-speed into others like them?</LD>
<LD>   Or how about chasing an inflated sphere back and forth across a
big, grassy field, infrequently kicking it into a net guarded by a
grown man wearing gloves and shorts?</LD>
<LD>   But the excitement of sports is in the playing, the having played,
the might have played and the talking and yelling about the play you
are watching. And that's what the world (outside of Sacramento and
Los Angeles or New Jersey and Boston) is now doing: watching the
quadrennial international score-settler, the World Cup, which opened
today at 4:30 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, when France played Senegal
in Seoul.</LD>
<TE>   Today's match marks the beginning of the monthlong final phase of
a competition between teams from more than 180 nations that began
March 4, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. national soccer team plays Portugal on Wednesday, then
South Korea and Poland later. Given how lightly most Americans regard
soccer, making the second round would be a considerable achievement.</TE>
<TE>   While the rest of the world goes crazy, Nielsen Media Research,
which regularly breaks out ratings for such sports bottom dwellers as
horse racing and hockey, does not even list soccer. The sport does
not make the cut of the 100 best-watched programs in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Yet soccer has inspired Irish fans to petition the prime minister
to move clocks ahead nine hours to be in sync with Japan. And some
churches in England will show telecasts of the Cup on Sunday morning
and allow parishioners to bring in beer and their breakfast. It's
part of an effort to compete with pubs and restaurants, which have
been granted permission to open and sell beer at 7 a.m. during the
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, games will be televised live at 11:30 p.m., 2 a.m.
and 4:30 a.m. At those hours, most U.S. kids won't be able to see the
magic of France's Zinedine Zidane, the best player in the world and
the son of an Algerian janitor.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the millions of Americans who have kicked around a
soccer ball in youth competitions, it's a puzzlement that the sport
doesn't make television big-time. But until it does, we've got Shaq.</TE>

<LD>Re "War Is Likely if Musharraf Stays," Commentary, May 29: Benazir
Bhutto, in her futile but voracious quest for power, thinks the
panacea to all political and security problems of the subcontinent
lies in the exit of the Pakistani military junta of Gen. Pervez
Musharraf. Until the Pakistani military's intervention, the country
was going through a political and institutional malaise. Bhutto was
twice entrusted with the responsibilities of prime minister, and both
times she was a total disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The military junta is trying to implement some correctives so the
problems that created national turmoil--corruption, extremism and
feudalistic political and bureaucratic institutions--can be remedied.
No wonder there had been vociferous opposition to Musharraf's
governance. He is assiduously trying to steer the country toward
moderation and democratization.</LD>
<LD>   India, which has been hoodwinking the world for the last 40 years,
claiming to hold "free and fair" elections in its part of Kashmir, is
presently playing a chauvinistic tune to placate its fringe elements.
In contrast, the Pakistani leader has shown remarkable restraint.
Kashmir is a subject of international dispute that requires an
international response. Both India and Pakistan need to sit down and
make some painful compromises.</LD>
<TE>   Nadia Naqvi</TE>
<TE>   Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I do not understand why Bhutto does not plainly state that
Pakistan supports Islamic terrorists in Kashmir. Islamic people, in
general, live peacefully elsewhere in Hindu-dominated India.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. alliance with Pakistan has the same problem as that with
Saudi Arabia. Both countries are hotbeds of Islamic fundamentalism, a
major breeding ground of terrorism. These terrorists have hijacked an
extreme form of Islam that espouses Islam-governed states and
encourages its young people to die as martyrs while committing these
terrorist acts against the infidel. The poor respond to this call,
since they have little to lose.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should withdraw support from Pakistan until it seriously
comes to grip with its terrorist training camps. We should support
only those Islamic states that support pluralism and active programs
to find employment for the poor.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Baby Registry of Choice," May 25: It has been common
knowledge for some time that a pregnant woman who can cross the
border and have her child on United States territory can legally
claim American citizenship for the baby. Now it seems that women from
Korea and Taiwan are doing the same thing. Illegal immigrants whose
children are born in the United States are also automatically
citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the history of the United States, our leaders felt it
was important to have a larger population. To facilitate this idea, a
clause was put into the Constitution that anyone born on U.S.
territory would automatically be a citizen of this country.</LD>
<LD>   Since American citizenship has become an increasingly valuable
item in today's world, foreigners have been taking advantage of our
large borders and easy tourist visas to have their children here.</LD>
<TE>   Australia and Britain had a similar provision in their laws, but
some 20 years ago they changed their laws; perhaps it's time we did
likewise.</TE>
<TE>   I believe the Constitution should be amended to read that any
child born of American citizens is automatically a citizen. I further
believe that this rule should apply whether the parents are living in
the United States or abroad; the determining factor should be the
citizenship of the parents, not the location of the birth. From the
sentiments I have read and heard expressed, I believe this would be a
popular revision to the Constitution.</TE>

<LD>Re the L.A. Convention Center: Why are we struggling to enhance the
moribund Convention Center with a football stadium to be used perhaps
one-sixth of the year? Why are we trying to compound the mistake by
building a hotel to service this white elephant? I suggest that L.A.
tear down the failed Convention Center and build a school on the
site. There might even be room for two schools.</LD>

<TE>   I was interested in the letter regarding rent control should the
Valley split from Los Angeles to form a new city (May 24). This is a
prime issue to those who cannot afford rent increases. Another point:
As a retiree I read a great deal. Usually I have five to eight books
checked out of the main L.A. library. This library is the finest I
have ever encountered, and to be denied its use or charged a fee for
its use would be a great hardship for me. Why try to fix something
which is not broken?</TE>

have to endure the excessive heat in the summer? Will the hot air
blow south to L.A.? Will Valley traffic congestion disappear and go
south too? And will I be assured that Valley tax dollars never
benefit those "poor" people in L.A.? God forbid!</TE>
<TE>   My career in sales required that I travel all over the L.A. Basin.
What fun it was, because each area had its own personality and charm.
I met energetic, gracious people and enjoyed the diversity. How

<HD>McJobs Are OK During Recessions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "For Some Grads, It's Back to School or Get a McJob," May 28: When
I graduated college in 1991, with a BA in organizational psychology,
I became a self-employed cleaning lady, seamstress and--the worst job
of all--a TV/movie extra. These gigs, of course, were not my dream
jobs, nor did they have anything to do with my field of study.</LD>
<LD>   But they did offer three very important services: flexible hours,
allowing me to look for a real job and volunteer at organizations
where I could use my education; something to put on my resume, both
the jobs and the volunteer work; and income. I did this for about two
years, until the last recession lifted and I was able to find work in
my field. I have been employed in the social service field ever
since, including three years in management positions.</LD>
<LD>   So all you new grads, this recession, as do all recessions, shall
pass. But when it does, prospective employers will want to know what
you did during the downturn. A McJob is a job, and it shows you are
productive. And employers like employees who are productive.</LD>

<LD>Re "Schools Challenge Mandatory Testing," May 29:</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps I just don't understand. When, according to the vice
president of the L.A. Board of Education, testing reveals and
identifies a lack of resources in schools, the corrective measure is
to eliminate the testing? Does this mean that classroom tests should
also be eliminated because some students do poorly on them? Isn't the
purpose of testing to reveal and identify areas of weakness that can
then be strengthened?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Tailor Teaching to the Child," editorial, May 26: As a special
education teacher and father of a special ed student, I inform The
Times it's in special ed that struggling students receive the
personalized attention for which you editorialize. And the standard
for services is precisely the one for which you cry: an aptitude out
of sync with performance.</TE>
<TE>   It's ignorant to criticize attention-deficit diagnosis, a topic of
voluminous and advanced research. In fact, attention-deficit disorder
is recognized in the DSM-IV, the clinical bible of psychological
health providers, as having three pathologies: hyperactivity,
inattentiveness and impulsivity.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us in the "at-risk" education trenches, as parents,
teachers or both, the wisdom of Dr. Mel Levine and the generosity of
the family foundation of Michael Eisner are appreciated. What's not
appreciated are uninformed swipes against the special ed program that
has served millions of children. And that, thankfully, includes my
son.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Throwing Good Money After Poor Education," by Roger Lewis,
Voices, May 25: Lucent Technologies, where Lewis worked, had a stock
price of more than $80 at one point in December 1999. Lucent is now
at less than $5. Following his thinking, can we blame him for the
poor results of Lucent? Lewis has many suggestions for the LAUSD; did
he also advise Lucent? Let's not blame our hard-working teachers for
everything that is wrong with our public education system.</TE>

<LD>Re "UC Nurses Drop Strike," May 25: Don't get me wrong. I share
everyone's love for nurses, those angels who ease our suffering,
manage our sick bodies and never complain about our whining. But the
recent union contract just negotiated with the UC system's hospitals,
which would grant across-the-board annual pay increases to nurses
based strictly on seniority, is plain wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that it replaces and does away with the current
merit-based reward system. Yes, merit-based. Little things like
performance against healthy clinical guidelines, giving the right
medications; yes, even friendliness and compassion with patients.
Welcome back, Nurse Ratched!</LD>

<TE>   Re "Religious Bias Fueled Firing, Jury Decides" (May 29), on the
Riverside County nurse who refused to give "morning-after" pills to
her patients: There is a severe nursing shortage and jobs are
available everywhere, so there is no excuse for this person to work
somewhere that interferes with her religious beliefs. Refusing to
provide appropriate care for your patients who are accessing family
planning services is tantamount to a Hindu working at McDonald's.
Freedom of religion is a right, and so is freedom of choice.</TE>

<LD>Re "MOCA's Fame Game," editorial, May 24: I don't believe that the
Andy Warhol retrospective is such a "daring test for MOCA," as you
say. On the contrary, Warhol's work is relatively accessible, more so
than the now-beloved Impressionists were in their day, and even more
so than Van Gogh was in his.</LD>
<LD>   No, indeed, Warhol is no Van Gogh, as you point out. The latter
sold almost none of his work in his lifetime, and just about the only
one who appreciated his talent was his brother. Warhol was a popular
figure, a popular artist in his lifetime, and he made a few bucks as
well. And if time is the arbiter of fame, he might just outlast Van
Gogh and the Impressionists in the fame game.</LD>

<HD>Josephine Abady, 52; Innovative Director at Noted Regional
Theaters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josephine "Josie" Abady, an innovative artistic director of
prestigious regional theaters who was adept at improving their
financial health, has died at age 52.</LD>
<LD>   Abady, who died Saturday at her home in New York City, had
continued to direct challenging plays despite a battle with breast
cancer that spread to her bones and brain.</LD>
<LD>   With characteristic spunk, she agreed to direct Margaret Edson's
Pulitzer-Prize-winning play "Wit" earlier this year at Theatre
Virginia in her native Richmond even though she had neither read nor
seen the play. It features a woman with terminal ovarian cancer.</LD>
<TE>   "I would say, 'I live "Wit"; I don't need to see it,'" she told
the Richmond Times-Dispatch when the play opened Jan. 11. "I wasn't
afraid to see it. I just--I know what it is about."</TE>
<TE>   Despite continuing chemotherapy, Abady's final six months might
have been the most productive of her career.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Wit," she directed a new version of "Abyssinia" at
the Lyric Theater in Texas--a black-cast musical she had premiered in
Cleveland in 1991--and "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" at the
Asolo Theater in Sarasota, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   She also conducted Food for Thought, a lunchtime play-reading
series, in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "Josie's leadership in the not-for-profit theater in the 1980s and
1990s was remarkable," said Ben Cameron, executive director of the
Theater Communications Group. "She is known for the sharpness of her
mind [and] her ability for working with actors ... "</TE>
<TE>   With a bachelor's degree from Syracuse University and a master of
fine arts from Florida State, Abady taught theater at Bennington
College in Vermont and then headed the theater department at
Hampshire College in Massachusetts from 1976 to 1979.</TE>
<TE>   She then turned professional, rescuing from bankruptcy the
Berkshire Theatre Festival in Stockbridge, Mass., and building its
reputation during her nine years there. Her production of "The Boys
Next Door" moved to off-Broadway and earned her a best director
nomination for an Outer Circle Critics Award.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a successful and sometimes controversial six years--from
1988 until her surprise ouster in 1994--at the Cleveland Playhouse.
Her first production, a high-profile staging of "Born Yesterday"
starring Edward Asner and Madeline Kahn, moved on to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Abady set up a remarkable theater exchange with Russia
and became the first American woman to direct a Russian theater
company on its home turf: "A Streetcar Named Desire" in Volgograd
(formerly Stalingrad). Not only was she treated as "virtually
worthless" because she was a woman traveling alone, and a Jewish
woman at that, she said, but the Russians insisted that she change
the ending of Tennessee Williams' classic play.</TE>
<TE>   "Because political dissidents in that country were often taken to
mental asylums, the Soviets would not allow the real ending of
'Streetcar' to be performed," she said in 1995. "Rather than having
Blanche committed to a mental hospital, she was lifted up by Mitch
[her gentleman friend] and taken off, maybe to heaven or who knows
where. Talk about censorship!"</TE>
<TE>   Abady brought the Russian company to the Cleveland Playhouse for a
sold-out run of the play, with the audience using headphones to
listen to the Russian actors in translated English.</TE>
<TE>   During her tenure in Cleveland, Abady produced 22 world and
American premieres, sent two plays to Broadway and then to Hollywood
for filming, and sent two others to off-Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   She also developed an actor training program and reached out to
minority communities to expand the Playhouse audience. In addition,
she increased earned and contributed income by 60%.</TE>
<TE>   When she was dismissed by a board demanding plays with less
controversy and more happy endings, she described herself as
"devastated ... sideswiped by a bus."</TE>
<TE>   The financially troubled Circle in the Square in Manhattan quickly
grabbed her. The Broadway nonprofit theater had been dark for two
years, and she resurrected it with considerable success from 1994
through 1996.</TE>
<TE>   She directed a hit revival of "Bus Stop" starring Mary-Louise
Parker and Billy Crudup, and was nominated for a Tony as producer of
"The Rose Tattoo." She also brought in enough revenue to begin paying
off the theater company's debts.</TE>
<TE>   But that board replaced the outspoken Abady in a squabble early in
1996, and the theater sank deeper into bankruptcy, soon closing.</TE>
<TE>   Abady served on the President's Commission on Scholarships in the
Arts, was on the national advisory board of the Drama League and in
1994 earned a grant to make a short movie, "To Catch a Tiger," about
her mother's work as a civil rights activist. The screenplay was
written by her husband, Michael Krawitz, and the film starred her
sister, Caroline Aaron.</TE>
<TE>   The director is survived by Krawitz, Aaron and a brother, Samuel
Abady.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions can be sent to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York City for breast cancer research.</TE>

<HD>Huntington's Power Plant Remains Idle</HD>
<DH>Energy: Retrofit project has run into delays. One generator
will go on line in July, but with the state's electricity crunch
over, AES questions restarting the second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a year ago, the state gave energy giant AES "fast-track"
approval to restart two mothballed generators in Huntington Beach,
allowing the company to streamline lengthy environmental reviews.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, AES predicted that the plants would begin providing
electricity by last summer--just when officials thought California's
energy crisis would be most severe.</LD>
<LD>   But today, both generators remain idle.</LD>
<TE>   The refurbishing project that was supposed to take a few months
has run into a string of delays, in part because the generators
needed far more extensive repairs than the company had expected.</TE>
<TE>   AES officials now say that one of the generators will go on line
in July. But with California's power shortages solved for now, they
question whether the second generator should be restarted.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think there will be a demand for the power," said Ed
Blackford, a special-project manager for AES. "Right now, we don't
see it possible to get that [second unit] on line this summer."</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, California's energy shortage has eased
considerably. Nine additional plants have fired up, producing more
than 1,800 megawatts of power since the crisis peaked last summer. At
the same time, price caps and other regulations have reduced the
ability of energy companies to manipulate the market.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach residents strongly opposed AES' fast-track
approval, arguing that environmental and health studies on the
effects of restarting the generators should be done before the plants
resume operating.</TE>
<TE>   But state regulators granted permission to AES to restart the
generators as soon as possible while completing a $1.5-million study
of environmental impacts.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said the situation shows that government
regulations aren't the only factor in delaying new power sources.</TE>
<TE>   "AES didn't live up to their part of the bargain," said John
Scott, a resident of southeast Huntington Beach, where the plant is
located. "The whole reason to give them this fast track was so they
could meet the energy needs of California."</TE>
<TE>   AES officials said their original plans for the generators were
ambitious but realistic. "It was an aggressive schedule, no doubt
about it," Blackford said. "We were looking at a best-case scenario
for just about everything."</TE>
<TE>   But the project was immediately beset by problems.</TE>
<TE>   The boilers were the biggest setback because they needed far more
work than the engineers had originally thought. "Even though this was
a retrofit," Blackford said, "you have to remember this was a
1960s-vintage [boiler], and an entire new instrumentation and control
panel had to be installed."</TE>
<TE>   AES used some nonunion workers for the project, a move that
sparked criticism from officials of organized labor who contended the
company was accepting substandard work.</TE>
<TE>   The general contractor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March,
prompting dozens of liens totaling about $50 million to be filed
against AES.</TE>
<TE>   The contractor, PMSI, contends that AES still owes the company $62
million. But Blackford disputes this: "We've paid in full for the
contracted work ... as well as approved change orders."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, AES estimated the work on the two generators would
cost about $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the project is now about $40 million over budget, Blackford
said.</TE>

<HD>Desert Heat Prompts an Energy Alert in California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since August, California energy officials declared
an alert Thursday because of tight electricity supplies, but they
said there is no reason to believe it is a harbinger of statewide
blackouts this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The alert was called when desert heat in the Southwest caused
out-of-state suppliers to divert some energy that otherwise would
have gone to California, said Gregg Fishman, a spokesman for the
agency that runs the state power grid, the California Independent
System Operator.</LD>
<LD>   The heat wave occurred while units at two large nuclear power
plants, Diablo Canyon and San Onofre, were down for routine
maintenance. There also was a disruption in a north-south
transmission line, Fishman said.</LD>
<TE>   Cal-ISO predicted last month that there would be enough power this
summer to avoid the rotating blackouts that some Californians
experienced in 2000 and 2001. Fishman said the alert issued Thursday
did not change that, although it also could serve as a reminder that
consumers still need to conserve.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we ever said we're completely out of the woods," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The alert was the lowest level of warning used by the agency. It
called on power generators to avoid unnecessary outages.</TE>

<HD>Remorseful Bank Robber Gets 9 Years</HD>
<DH>Courts: The 'Kangaroo Bandit,' who surrendered to the FBI,
is believed to have robbed two dozen banks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expressing remorse and promising to turn his life around, one of
Southern California's most notorious bank robbers was sentenced to
nine years in prison Thursday by a federal judge in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Cain Vincent Dyer, 31, a decorated Marine veteran turned drug
addict, was believed responsible for as many as 24 bank robberies
throughout Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Nicknamed the Kangaroo Bandit because he stuffed his loot into a
backpack strapped to his chest, Dyer surrendered to the FBI a year
ago and, in a deal with prosecutors, pleaded guilty to six robberies.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess, who handed down the sentence,
ordered Dyer to pay $476,093 in restitution and placed him on five
years of supervised release.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer, who is married and has three children, said he began robbing
banks in 1999 not just to satisfy his drug habit but because he owed
a large amount of money to criminals who were threatening to kill him
and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that doesn't justify what I did," he told Feess. "But I
was put in a horrible situation."</TE>
<TE>   Over a 19-month period, Dyer hit about two dozen banks in Los
Angeles, Orange, Ventura and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a handgun, he would order customers to lie on the floor
and then went from teller to teller, scooping cash across the counter
into his backpack.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a lone robber will slip a demand note to a teller or
ask for money quietly to attract as little attention as possible. The
Kangaroo Bandit was brazenly aggressive, however. Flashing his gun
and shouting obscenities, he struck fear into customers and tellers
alike.</TE>
<TE>   Although security cameras caught the robber on videotape, he was
not easy to identify.</TE>
<TE>   He usually wore dark glasses and a baseball cap to shield his
face. Witnesses could not agree on whether he was black, white or
Latino. Dyer is of mixed race.</TE>
<TE>   After months of investigation, the FBI appealed to the public for
help, offering a $15,000 reward and arranging for the case to be
publicized on television's "America's Most Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, it was Dyer who turned himself in at the FBI's
field office in Westwood with the assistance of criminal defense
lawyer Winston K. McKesson.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by his attorney Thursday, Dyer told Feess that he once
rationalized robbing banks as a "victimless crime." Since then, he
said, he has come to realize that he traumatized many innocent bank
employees and customers. He said he wished he could contact them and
apologize face to face.</TE>
<TE>   Feess and Assistant U.S. Atty. Cheryl Murphy both commended the
defendant for his expression of remorse.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike a lot of people who appear before me for sentencing," said
the judge, "I think he is sincere."</TE>
<TE>   Feess invited Dyer to stop by his chambers for a chat after his
release.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Set Stage for Budget Talks to Begin</HD>
<DH>Finances: Assembly and Senate OK token spending plans as a
required step to launch negotiations. GOP opposes tax hikes to close
a $23.6-billion deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Legislature passed skeletal budgets Thursday to begin the true
negotiations on the state's next spending plan, a process that could
drag on for weeks as lawmakers wrangle over how to bridge a
$23.6-billion gap.</LD>
<LD>   Each year the Senate and Assembly approve pro-forma budgets
fashioned by their respective members--a traditionally low-key
procedure necessary for a legislative conference committee to begin
work on a compromise plan. This year, however, with Democrats seeking
tax increases to help balance the budget, Republicans voiced
objections and briefly stalled the plan in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Further complicating this year's budget politics, an appeals court
ruled this week that if the budget isn't approved by the June 30
deadline the state cannot distribute money to schools or pay full
salaries to more than 200,000 state workers. The Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. filed the original suit in 1998 to stop the
controller from making payments without a budget, a common occurrence
because the Legislature does not always approve budgets on time.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's very dismaying and a major setback to the state,"
said state Controller Kathleen Connell, who issues the state's
checks. "It certainly changes the political dynamics of the budget if
we don't get one on time."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of judges, state workers could expect only to
receive the federal minimum wage of $6.75 an hour, according to the
California Court of Appeal ruling. Schools could lose as much as
$3billion in July alone, said Connell, who plans to appeal part of
the ruling and seek an injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Fine, the Beverly Hills lawyer for the taxpayer group,
described Connell's plan to appeal as "a waste of taxpayers' money."</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose in bringing this suit is to stop the craziness that
has occurred for years on end with the politicians continuously
avoiding the constitutional responsibility for approving a budget on
time and thereby creating havoc on the state of California," Fine
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric also heated up inside the Capitol on Thursday as
Democratic leaders of each house sought to get negotiations moving by
approving preliminary spending plans for the 2002-03 fiscal year. The
plans in many ways mirror the revised budget floated by Davis, which
relies on a combination of spending cuts, tax hikes, borrowing and
other budget changes to close a $23.6-billion hole.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have taken issue with the tax hikes, borrowing and
loans. But Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) warned
lawmakers that funding for schools, prison guards and California
Highway Patrol officers would be at risk if the Legislature failed to
pass the budget proposals and allow negotiations to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) recalled that when House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and congressional Republicans blocked President Clinton's
budget in 1995 and shut down the federal government for several days,
the GOP suffered heavy losses in the next election.</TE>
<TE>   The same punishment may await legislative Republicans, Perata
warned the GOP lawmakers. He said the voters would "find out who is
responsible" and "they will be remembered" adversely at the polls
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine took offense.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not partisanship," Johnson said. "Republicans have been
telling you for years that we are on a course for a fiscal train
wreck. The day of reckoning has come."</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe we have a fundamental disagreement with the
governor on why we have a budget deficit," said Senate Republican
Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "We think it's because we took
money we didn't have on a permanent basis and spent it as far as the
eye can see."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans put up the two votes needed to approve the
spending plan only after tax increases and other revenue raisers
totaling $3.5 billion were stripped from the proposal, with an
agreement that the budget conference committee will decide how to
fill a gap of that size. The plan cleared the Senate on a 27-11 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Steve Peace, the El Cajon Democrat who chairs the Senate
Budget Committee, said he expects the conference committee to begin
meeting Tuesday. He said Democrats will go into the negotiations
supporting $3.5 billion in tax hikes, and it will be up to
Republicans to identify an equal amount of cuts if that is how they
prefer to balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, lawmakers approved their version of the budget on
a 49-28 party-line vote, but not before the minority Republicans
unleashed a barrage outlining their positions in the coming fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem we face is an addiction to spending," said Assembly
Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks), evoking 12-step lingo to
suggest the majority party needed to overcome denial and embrace the
seriousness of the problem. "We have an addiction."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I wonder whether you members, when you drive to work"
in the state Capitol, "think you are going to a big, white ATM
machine," said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats did not fire back. Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long
Beach), the Budget Committee chairwoman, calmly responded that this
was the start of the budget process, and acknowledged that many tough
decisions still need to be made.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that this budget does not feel good to
anybody," she said. "But we have a duty."</TE>

<HD>Voracious Grape Pest Now Suspect in Citrus Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agricultural researchers have launched a four-year study to determine
whether a voracious bug that has wreaked havoc on California's wine
industry could also be harming the state's citrus groves.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists with the California Citrus Research Board will soon
begin scouring orchards in Ventura and Riverside counties for links
between the glassy-winged sharpshooter and a host of emerging
problems affecting fruit and trees.</LD>
<LD>   The needle-nosed insect, which spreads a disease that has
devastated Temecula Valley vineyards and poses a major threat to
other grape-growing regions, has made its home in California's citrus
groves for more than a decade.</LD>
<TE>   But other than causing trees to go thirsty--the yellow-eyed bug
drains fluids as it feeds--it wasn't thought to be an immediate
danger until recently, when pest populations began to explode and
fruit scarring and other problems began appearing in citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Batkin, president of the Visalia-based citrus board, said
researchers will try to determine whether the bug is responsible for
those problems and, if so, what growers can do to keep sharpshooter
populations in check.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know whether the kinds of problems we are seeing are
caused by the sharpshooter or not," Batkin said. "We just know we
have a problem, and we've got to find the answer to it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 research projects are underway across California to
battle the half-inch insect, an exotic pest accidentally brought into
the state from Mexico and discovered in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs water-carrying vessels in plants--starving them of
nutrients--and causing them to dry up.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent the insect from moving into winemaking regions such as
Napa and Sonoma, state regulators have invoked a range of
restrictions on shipments of nursery stock and other agricultural
products.</TE>
<TE>   Although grapevines are particularly susceptible to Pierce's
disease, the bacterium does not have the same lethal effect on citrus
trees. However, the bug has spread a related strain of the bacterium
that has devastated citrus groves in Brazil and other South American
countries.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, many growers are having to spend additional
money to water trees that are being dehydrated by large numbers of
the sucking insects, said Chris Taylor, senior vice president of
farming for the Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co., Ventura County's
largest farming enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor said it's possible that trees are being stressed by the
sharpshooter to the point where they are producing smaller,
low-quality fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could eradicate it I would, but I don't think that's ever
going to happen," Taylor said. "Our best hope is to try to control
their numbers. But it's pretty precocious. It doesn't have too many
enemies. It's kind of near the top of the food chain for bugs."</TE>

<HD>Addition to Water Park Is Opposed</HD>
<DH>Lake Casitas: Critics say $1-million expansion could
endanger wildlife and increase traffic. Water district cites its
responsibility to promote recreation.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed $1-million water park expansion at Lake Casitas could
endanger wildlife and contribute to traffic congestion at the popular
reservoir near Ojai, environmentalists said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Casitas Municipal Water District wants to build a waterway,
called Lazy River, near an existing one-acre children's water
playground at the entrance to the lake, which is off-limits to
swimmers.</LD>
<LD>   "This concrete channel would wind around the kids' water park and
attract even more visitors and vehicles to the crowded roads of
Ojai," said Jack Gillooly, a director of the Ventura Audubon Society.</LD>
<TE>   He was among about two dozen people who attended a public hearing
on the proposal Wednesday night. The session was sponsored by the
water district, which manages the lake for the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   While responsible for providing clean water to towns and orchards
in the Ojai Valley, the water agency is also charged with promoting
recreational activities for the 750,000 visitors who flock to the
lake each year.</TE>
<TE>   Gillooly and other critics said the area's popularity among local
residents and tourists is creating dirty air and contributing to
gridlock on two-lane California 33, which connects to Ventura, 13
miles to the south. Environmentalists also expressed concern about
night lights and the project's effect on wildlife and water quality.
The water district's board of directors seemed receptive, said John
Buse, a Ventura attorney for the Environmental Defense Center in
Santa Barbara. "It's not that we're against the project, but we want
to reverse the course they're presently on, which doesn't provide
adequate environmental safeguards."</TE>
<TE>   But John Johnson, general manager of the Casitas Water District,
said that, based on the minimal effect the children's water
playground had on traffic when it opened four years ago, he does not
expect the next phase to lead to more cars. "There's no reason to
believe it will increase attendance," Johnson said, adding that Lazy
River would likely serve adults already visiting the reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   As for wildlife, Johnson noted that aside from the developed north
shore, most of the other 9,700 acres around the reservoir are closed
to people. Because the lake is man-made, he said, any allure it holds
for creatures is a result of human intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's not natural, if the birds and animals like it, it's
because of what we've put in there and maintained," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the public's concerns are addressed, the proposal will go to
the five-member water board for consideration.</TE>
<TE>   If it is adopted this summer, construction could begin in the fall
and the expanded park could be open for business next year, Johnson
said.</TE>

<HD>District Eases Teacher Demands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials Thursday dropped a demand that teachers
at seven low-performing schools sign forms committing themselves to
academic reforms intended to raise test scores.</LD>
<LD>   At three other campuses, however, teachers will still have to sign
the document and abide by a strict dress code.</LD>
<LD>   The signings, which provoked sharp protests, were going to be a
requirement for teachers to remain at all 10 campuses. Some teachers
likened the forms to insulting loyalty oaths and refused to sign.</LD>
<TE>   But Supt. Roy Romer, concerned that resistance could derail
reforms at the schools, backed off the plan at seven campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "To improve these schools, we need everyone involved," Romer told
a news conference Thursday. "We're not trying to get on the backs of
teachers."</TE>
<TE>   The forms were proposed earlier this year as one of several
measures to reinvigorate the campuses, which were singled out by
state officials for poor performance, low expectations and weak
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Although excused from the signings, teachers at these schools
still must attend extra training and abide by new educational
methods. Those schools are Gompers and Sun Valley middle schools and
Fremont, Jefferson, Locke, Roosevelt and Wilson high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Los Angeles teachers union applauded the district's
decision but complained that teachers at the three other targeted
campuses will still have to sign the commitment forms.</TE>
<TE>   Those three schools--Avalon Gardens Elementary, and Mount Vernon
and Mann middle schools--have been placed in a separate reform
program that provides extensive resources--including four weeks of
annual training--in exchange for teachers agreeing in writing to the
changes at their schools, including dress codes banning jeans and
requiring ties for males and stockings for women.</TE>
<TE>   "The district is going to force good people out of those schools,"
said John Perez, president-elect of United Teachers-Los Angeles.
"What goes on between a teacher and a student is more important than
whether a teacher wears hose or a tie."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at the three schools who refuse to sign the forms will be
allowed to transfer to other district campuses, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers union was planning demonstrations at all 10 schools
today to protest what its leaders said is the district's
condescending attitude toward members.</TE>
<TE>   "These teachers have been treated like tall children rather than
professionals," Perez said.</TE>

<HD>Alfred Fleishman, 96; Partner in Top Public Relations Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alfred Fleishman, co-founder of one of the world's largest public
relations firms, Fleishman-Hillard, and an advocate for the state of
Israel and European Jews displaced by World War II, has died after a
brief illness. He was 96.</LD>
<LD>   Fleishman died Tuesday at his home in the St. Louis suburb of
Creve Coeur, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   Working with his longtime friend Robert Hillard, Fleishman created
the firm in 1946 in a rented room above a Woolworth's store.</LD>
<TE>   The company soon recruited a client list that included some of St.
Louis' biggest firms--Anheuser-Busch, Emerson Electric Co. and May
Department Stores.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman-Hillard is now the world's second-largest public
relations company, behind Weber Shandwick Worldwide, with 2,300
employees in 83 offices around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hillard, who retired in 1982, and Fleishman, who retired in 1975,
credited their company's success to their contrasting individual
styles. Hillard, who died in 2000 at age 83, was the cautious,
precise wordsmith worrying about each tree, while Fleishman was the
instinctive and experienced public relations expert considering the
forest at large.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman lectured widely and wrote numerous articles and columns
on public relations and three books on semantics, "Sense and
Nonsense," "Troubled Talk" and "Dialogue With Street Fighters." He
also published the book "Common Sense Management" after his
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Born in St. Louis on June 16, 1905, Fleishman worked as a
pharmacist until he joined his father and brother-in-law in the
family business, Fleishman Pickle Co.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman got involved in Democratic city politics in 1933, first
as superintendent of recreation and then as deputy circuit court
clerk, a position he held until World War II. He served as a major in
the Army Air Forces, primarily as a public information officer at the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, he went to Germany for the military and American Jewish
Congress to interview Jewish refugees in Yiddish. He spent three
months in the displaced persons camps, and after returning to the
U.S., made a three-month coast-to-coast, 60-city speaking tour,
soliciting aid for the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman personally rated heading the delegation to Germany as
his greatest accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   The public relations magnate, a close advisor to August A. Busch
Jr. and other powerful businessmen, said that if he ever wrote his
memoirs, "they'll tell the story of my experiences with displaced
Jews."</TE>
<TE>   After Israel declared independence in 1948, Fleishman became one
of its most ardent supporters. He made 57 visits to the country
between 1955 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Fleishman's wife of 58 years, Lucylle Magid Fleishman, died in
1987. They had no children. He is survived by his sister, Dorothy
Schucart of Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Developer's Actions Involving Rare Flower Probed</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Fish and Game Department officers are investigating whether
developers destroyed habitats in north Los Angeles County where an
endangered flower may have grown, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   In a search warrant affidavit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court
last week, Fish and Game Lt. Penelope Liotta said she believed
Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. was growing agave plants on the site of a
planned subdivision "as a ruse to justify the systematic destruction
of habitat" that may contain the San Fernando Valley spineflower.</LD>
<LD>   Liotta said she believed Newhall Land used other means to destroy
possible habitats on the property in the Santa Clarita Valley and
only recently put up barriers to protect the spineflowers that were
found there two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The affidavit said the land would be searched for evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Game spokesman Steve Martarano said Thursday that
officials searched the 12,000-acre site several days last week. He
declined further comment because the investigation is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer could not be reached late
Thursday. In an interview last week, she said the company had not
destroyed the land where the spineflower was found in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The spineflower was believed extinct until found in 1999 at the
planned 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch in southeast Ventura County. A
recent Fish and Game report said the Ahmanson developers' plan to
protect the flower does not meet state requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The planned 22,000-home Newhall Ranch project was initially
approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in late 1998,
but environmental groups and others challenged the action in court.</TE>

<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn is inviting the residents of Los Angeles to swing
by for a chat, one on one.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn announced Thursday that he will hold monthly office hours
during which 20 people will be randomly selected to sit down with him
for individual 10-minute talks.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be about whatever anyone wants to talk about," Hahn said
during an appearance Thursday morning on the Spanish-language radio
station KLVE-FM.</LD>
<TE>   "Meet the Mayor" days are part of what Hahn called his effort to
make city residents feel more connected to local government. He
already appears on a monthly radio call-in show, "Ask the Mayor," on
KFWB-AM (980), and he will begin doing the same format in Spanish on
KLVE-FM (107.5) with a bilingual aide on hand to translate.</TE>
<TE>   But residents will be able to sit down with him in person during
the "Meet the Mayor" days.</TE>
<TE>   The first session will be held June 13 at Van Nuys City Hall from
4 to 8 p.m. The deadline to sign up for the first round of meetings
is June 7 at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Those interested in meeting with Hahn can sign up over the
Internet at www.lacity.org/mayor or fill out a form available at the
mayor's City Hall office and five field offices throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty people will be picked, and representatives from his office
will be available to talk with those who are not selected.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Post-9/11 Hate Crime</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Huntington Beach resident is accused of
threatening to kill his neighbors, an elderly Iranian couple.
Officials say he forced the pair to cross a busy street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors on Thursday filed hate-crime charges
related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, accusing a former Marine
from Huntington Beach of taunting and threatening to kill an elderly
Iranian couple he passed on the street.</LD>
<LD>   The incident received much attention when it occurred two weeks
after Sept. 11, with Arab American activists pointing to it as a
prime example of the harassment the community faced.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities allege that Steven James McManus, 44, encountered the
victims, who are 77 and 74, during their routine morning walk.
McManus was driving on Bushard Street when he spotted the couple,
made a U-turn and demanded to know where they were from. McManus
parked his car, approached the pair and told them he would kill them
if they didn't cross the busy street, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Fearing for their lives, the couple stepped into the roadway, even
though there were no lights or crosswalk. As they moved across the
street, a passing motorist and neighbor recognized them, stopped,
waved them into the car and drove them to their son's home nearby,
according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have declined to identify the victims, saying they are
still traumatized by the experience. Prosecutors also declined to say
precisely what McManus said. Residents in the area said the couple
were well-known for their morning walks and that the woman often wore
a veil.</TE>
<TE>   Although McManus and the victims were neighbors, prosecutors said
they had no prior conflicts. Police were alerted to the incident when
another neighbor witnessed the exchange and called 911.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor then directed police to McManus' then-home.</TE>
<TE>   Neither McManus nor his lawyer would comment on the charges
Thursday. However, in an interview in September, McManus said he was
defending his property.</TE>
<TE>   "I just asked them where they were from," McManus said. "They were
on the side of my house. I saw two Arabs, one with a bell on his
head....You don't know what Charlie looks like, and I just wanted to
know where they're from."</TE>
<TE>   McManus said he told the couple to walk in front of his house. "I
got arrested for speaking and trying to protect my safety," he said.
McManus is to be arraigned June 7.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is one of 87 Orange County incidents in the wake of
Sept. 11 that authorities investigated as possible hate crimes. It's
the second one to result in criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   McManus has been charged with two felony counts of making a
criminal threat, with hate enhancements; two misdemeanor civil-rights
violations; two misdemeanor counts of elder abuse; and one
misdemeanor count of obstructing a police officer. If convicted on
all counts, he faces a maximum of eight years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the Orange County-based Alliance for Iranian
Americans said he was pleased with the decision.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Are Expected to Get Masry Case Today</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Former employee says he made repeated sexual
advances toward her. The Thousand Oaks mayor has denied allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors are expected to begin deliberations today in the sexual
harassment lawsuit brought against Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry by a
former employee.</LD>
<LD>   During closing arguments Thursday, the jury heard the lawyer for
plaintiff Kissandra Cohen describe Masry as a boss who made repeated
sexual advances during the eight months Cohen worked at Masry's
Westlake Village law firm.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen's lawyer, Dan Marino, said Masry had told Cohen he would
make her a star trial attorney if they had a personal relationship.</LD>
<TE>   But Masry's lawyer, Norm Watkins, told jurors that Cohen's claims
are fabrications. No one at the firm heard or saw any improper
behavior by Masry, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, 23, contends Masry fired her from the Masry&amp;Vittitoe law
firm in December 1999 after she refused his sexual advances.
According to Cohen's lawsuit, constant foul, sexually suggestive
language by Masry, by Erin Brockovich, who works as Masry's research
director, and by others created a hostile environment.</TE>
<TE>   Masry, 69, has denied all allegations and said he fired Cohen
because she misrepresented her academic credentials.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that when he hired Cohen out of law school, her
resume was so impressive that he believed he could make her a star
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   During closing statements, Marino criticized Masry's admission
that no anti-harassment policy was ever distributed to employees.
Marino played a video clip from a deposition in the case in which
Masry angrily told Marino: "You're trying to get $15 million out of
me and you're not going to get a dime. You're gonna have nothing but
grief out of this when this is over. I can guarantee you that."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins denied Marino's claim that Masry is a vindictive employer.
Citing the video, Watkins said his client expressed anger "because
his law firm is being trashed" by Cohen's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who is seeking $6.6 million in damages, said she has not
found work since Masry fired her. Watkins argued that Cohen has been
unable to get a job matching the $120,000-a-year position Masry paid
her because she applied only to firms that hire from the upper 10% of
law school classes.</TE>

<HD>Girl Missing After Father's Apparent Suicide</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Authorities search for 11-year-old after man's
body is found in Northern California. Rescuers find no trace of her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are puzzled by the apparent suicide of a Downey man on a
desolate, wooded road in Northern California and the disappearance of
his 11-year-old daughter, who was supposed to be with him.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies on Wednesday found the body of Joaquin Garcia, 35, in his
pickup along sparsely traveled California 32 near the tiny town of
Butte Meadows, about 100 miles north of Sacramento. He had a gun in
his right hand and appeared to have been dead a few days, said Cheryl
Broom, a Butte County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman. Garcia had no
known connection to Butte County, relatives said.</LD>
<LD>   But his daughter, Jeanene Bonner, was nowhere to be found. In the
truck, authorities found items identified as belonging to her. But
search-and-rescue teams, helicopters and scent dogs could not find
the girl, Broom said.</LD>
<TE>   Blood in the truck was sent to a Justice Department facility in
Chico for DNA analysis, Broom said. In fact, authorities said it is
possible that Jeanene, who was set to return last Friday to Loma Alta
Elementary School in Altadena, never made it to the site where her
father's body was found. The passenger-side door of the pickup was
locked, and Garcia's body blocked the driver's side--leading
investigators to believe that the girl was elsewhere when her father
died.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia picked up Jeanene on May 21 and was to spend a couple of
days with her, said Kim Almodovar, 34, the girl's mother. Garcia and
Almodovar have joint custody of Jeanene, a sixth-grade honor student
and member of the drill team.</TE>
<TE>   Father and daughter were to return to Almodovar's Altadena home
May 23. Instead, receipts found in Garcia's Nissan Frontier suggest
that they stayed at Las Vegas' Luxor hotel and checked out the day
Garcia was to return the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Almodovar said she was in Las Vegas at the same time on business
but had no idea Garcia and her daughter were there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked and very concerned about what may have happened to my
daughter," she said. Almodovar said that there were tensions between
her and Garcia, who fought over custody of the girl but that she
could not imagine him harming her.</TE>
<TE>   She filed a missing persons report with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department on Monday. Almodovar said she waited a few days
because she thought Garcia might have taken their daughter to Lake
Havasu--something he had discussed in the past.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear where Garcia and Jeanene traveled after they left Las
Vegas, although authorities know the father's trek ended about 20
miles northeast of Chico.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeanene's part of the puzzle. She can answer questions we have,"
said Lily Peters, 31, Garcia's sister. "I'm hoping we find her. We
love Jeanene very much."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives described Garcia as an outdoors type who was very close
to his parents and siblings and who doted on his daughter. He lived
with his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't comprehend that he'd do such a thing, especially if he
left his little girl so far from home," said his mother, Ana Garcia,
58. "His girl was his life.... He was an exemplary son, very
affectionate and loving. He loved himself, and he loved his daughter.
I don't believe he would kill himself and leave her."</TE>

<HD>For Mothers in Prison, a Bittersweet Family Day</HD>
<DH>Support: Inmates' rights advocates take children for a
visit. For Angelique, like many prisoners' kids, it's a rare chance
to connect with mom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHOWCHILLA</DL>
<LD>Ten-year-old Angelique Robinson understands that her mother once used
drugs and is serving a life sentence as a three-strikes offender.</LD>
<LD>   "She's kind of a bad person," she says of her mother, Sheri
Robinson. In the next breath, though, she says she misses Robinson's
laugh, how she picks her up every time they see each other.</LD>
<LD>   When Angelique was 11 months old, Robinson dozed off, drunk on
alcohol and high on cocaine, and the infant fell from a fourth-story
apartment window. She broke her legs and fractured her hip. Robinson
was given five years' probation for the incident, and Angelique was
sent to live with a foster parent.</LD>
<TE>   Still, when she learned that she could take a four-hour trip to
the state prison in Chowchilla this year to visit Robinson, who is
serving time for receiving stolen property, Angelique was ecstatic.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what might have happened, it's still Mom," said Natalie
Keese, a juvenile diversion counselor with the Torrance Police
Department and Angelique's therapist.</TE>
<TE>   They are just one daughter and one mother, but the story of
Angelique and Sheri Robinson, 31, embodies the bittersweet emotions,
and the tensions, experienced by thousands of mothers and children
across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Families Face Strain From Incarceration</TE>
<TE>   When mothers are incarcerated, advocates say, their children serve
time with them. Many of the children experience emotional, behavioral
and academic problems, experts say. And up to half of boys with a
parent in jail or prison are in turn incarcerated at some point in
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Suzanne Steffen, of the Detention Ministry with the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said the situation becomes much more
difficult when mothers don't see their children for the duration of
their incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-five percent of California's 9,400 female inmates are
mothers, according to state officials. Half of those women do not see
their children until they are released.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Steffen and several prisoners' rights advocates,
who call themselves Justice Partners, began chartering coach buses to
the Central California Women's Facility and Valley State Prison for
Women in the San Joaquin Valley, to give children and their
caregivers throughout the state an opportunity to visit mothers on
Mother's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an exciting event for the inmates," said Greg Schoonard,
a women's facility spokesman. "It has tremendous benefits for the
inmates to see their children. To be a successful parolee, we
recognize the importance of these women maintaining their family
ties."</TE>
<TE>   Angelique has dealt with her mother's incarceration better than
many children, says Keese. "She handles it very well and makes the
best of every situation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the memories sting.</TE>
<TE>   When Angelique was 2, she was already in foster care but would
visit her mother on weekends. She would wake up some nights and find
herself alone in an apartment. She'd run to the neighbor's house and
tell them her mother had left her alone.</TE>
<TE>   A few times, she said, her mother took her to strangers' houses,
and disappeared. "I wouldn't even know who those people are," said
Angelique, who first participated in Justice Partner's bus trip two
years ago. "She'd just leave me."</TE>
<TE>   The memories are all vague. "It's like I was dreaming when I think
about those things," Angelique said.</TE>
<TE>   Angelique, who lives in Torrance with her guardian, Bonnie Cowan,
has seen her mother only sporadically since she fell out of the
bedroom window in 1993, though they occasionally talk by telephone.
Recently, Angelique said Robinson asked her to ship her birthday
money to the prison so she could buy cigarettes. Angelique didn't
send the money.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before Mother's Day, 136 children from 67 families took
the trip to Chowchilla. The children arrived at the Central
California Women's Facility shortly after 11 a.m. They took their
shoes off to pass through metal detectors, then were led through
barbed wire fences, and past a guard tower.</TE>
<TE>   Renewing Relationships Under Guard</TE>
<TE>   Some children, like 12-year-old Johnathon Stallings of Santa
Monica, barely know their mothers. It was the first time Johnathon
had visited his mother in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Shalonna Meadows, 13, of Los Angeles, still have
difficulty understanding why their mothers are in prison. Shalonna
hadn't seen her mother in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Angelique, wearing a red sweater and black
sundress. She was nervous that morning, because she knew her mother
would ask her to sing. Angelique has a lovely voice and loves to
sing. But not this day.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is going to look at me," she said. "I don't want to
sing."</TE>
<TE>   "Her mother really wanted her to sing a song," Cowan said. "Isn't
that what she said, Annie?"</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't want to. Everybody is going to be doing their own
thing, then they're going to stop and stare at me. It's embarrassing,
Nana."</TE>
<TE>   The inmate mothers began trickling into the 5,200-square-foot
visitor area at 1:30 p.m. Some are serving time for drug offenses and
burglary, others for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was among the first group to enter the crowded room.
She's a stout woman, with a face full of freckles and dark brown
hair, straightened with a hot comb and a curling iron.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting between mother and daughter was awkward at first.
While Shalonna hugged her mother, Michann Meadows, for what seemed an
eternity before crumbling in her chair in tears, Angelique walked up
to Robinson and asked, "Do you have to check in?"</TE>
<TE>   Robinson didn't respond. Instead, she picked Angelique up, hugged
her and kissed her. After greeting Cowan, the three sat at a table
and talked about Robinson's nails, her freckles, her weight.</TE>
<TE>   She showed Angelique her tattoos. "Pantera," the nickname of an
old drug dealer, is scrawled across her jaw. "Annie" is etched into
her forearm.</TE>
<TE>   And as expected, Robinson asked Angelique to sing. Without
protest, she sang the first verse of "Amazing Grace" just loud enough
for Robinson to hear her, but too soft for others to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me
/ I once was lost but now am found / Was blind, but now, I see."</TE>
<TE>   Six years in state prison have given Robinson a lot of time to
reflect on what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "If I ever lose her ... she's my life," she said, crying. "That's
my daughter, my only child. If I could have seen it when I was not in
here, I wouldn't be sitting where I'm sitting."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is up for parole in 2021. She was convicted as a
three-strikes offender in 1996 in Riverside. Police found stolen
credit cards in a car she was riding in. Her prior convictions were
for robbery and burglary.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Cowan's temporary power of attorney and legal
guardianship expires. Robinson said she will update the documents
from prison. "Bonnie and Angelique are the only people I have," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She told Angelique that she wants to someday have more children,
that when she gets out, the two will get a place and start all over
again. Angelique nodded and leaned on her mother's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   After four hours, the prison guards made their way around the
room, tapping on tables and telling the mothers that their time was
up.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson hugged Angelique one last time. She appeared on the verge
of hyperventilating and the neat makeup around her eyes was smearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want you to go," Angelique whispered, hugging her mother.
She stood up and waved as a guard led her mother to a corridor back
to the cells.</TE>

<LD>   The beige 1987 Honda Accord was found abandoned in a Long Beach
parking lot. The Orange County crime lab is examining it for
evidence, said Capt. Todd Mattern, a spokesman for the Los Alamitos
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The car was stolen May 11 from a resident of the Royal Oak Mobile
Home Park on Oak Street by a man suspected in the rape of another
resident of the park a short time before.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they believe the assailant was the Belmont Shore
rapist, suspected in at least 10 attacks in Long Beach and Orange
County since 1997.</TE>

<LD>The Planning Commission considered Thursday a plan to annex 3,600
acres of vacant land and bean fields.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next 20 years, the Irvine Co. wants to build 12,350 homes
and 7 million square feet of business and research facilities on the
land, which borders the closed El Toro Marine base. The annexation
would increase the city's size by about a third.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would have to go to the City Council for final approval.</LD>
<TE>   Some residents and city officials have expressed concern about
traffic congestion, school crowding and other problems the homes
might create.</TE>

<LD>Orange County's recruitment of grand jurors has failed to find
residents who reflect the county's demographics, especially when age
and gender are considered, a grand jury report said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Those under 44 are underrepresented, while those over 60 are
overrepresented, the grand jury found. Women are also
underrepresented, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury's outreach activities should be examined and

<LD>Fire officials Thursday cautioned citizens to beware of telephone
solicitors fraudulently seeking donations on behalf of the Fullerton
Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had several calls this week," said Sylvia Palmer Mudrick, a
spokeswoman for the city.</LD>
<LD>   "What they do is claim to be representing the department or an
organization like the Foundation for Disabled Firefighters, which
doesn't exist. People have received calls that were suspicious, and
some decided to do the right thing--check it out with the Fire
Department first."</LD>
<TE>   The Fullerton Fire Department does not authorize outside agencies
to collect funds on its behalf, Mudrick said. Anyone receiving a
suspicious call should report it to police, she said.</TE>

<HD>Police Reports Show a Cast of Colorful Characters Washed Up
on Seal Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seal Beach seems to have more than its share of colorful characters,
judging from the police blotter in the local Sun newspaper. The
latest issue recorded these incidents:</LD>
<LD>   * "A party with loud music and breaking bottles was reported but
it turned out to be a female having a party with herself."</LD>
<LD>   * "A man called to make a report but said he spoke Spanish not
English. When spoken to in Spanish, he said he spoke English and not
Spanish."</LD>
<TE>   * "A citizen reported that a male and female were having sexual
relations in a vehicle in front of a supermarket before loading their
groceries."</TE>
<TE>   Have to keep your priorities.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC's new straight man: In one of those disguised promotions that
occur so often on local news, Channel 4 anchor Paul Moyer interviewed
late-night comedy host Jay Leno the other night.</TE>
<TE>   But as the media Web site ronfineman.com pointed out, the puff
piece veered off in a direction that Moyer probably didn't expect.
Moyer, complimenting Leno on his work habits, said, "When I've been
here at 8 a.m., I see your car."</TE>
<TE>   Leno: "When were you ever here at 8 in the morning?"</TE>
<TE>   Moyer: "A few times, during the Simpson trial."</TE>
<TE>   Leno: "Oh well, eight years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Fineman observed that, while he was the butt of Leno's jokes,
Moyer "was smart enough" to let the exchange appear on the air,
showing he "doesn't take himself too seriously."</TE>
<TE>   But the rest of us do, most of us.</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's unusual showings (see accompanying)
include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house whose features include a room that seems to have been
designed for teenagers (submitted by Bob Abrahams of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * A closet that's on the move (from Reggie Sully of Beverly
Hills).</TE>
<TE>   * A foosball table ad, from Allen Wilkinson of Whittier, who adds:
"Then again, maybe it's a roulette table, which has parted many a
fool from his or her money."</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a bedroom I don't think I'd want to see (from Phil
Proctor of Beverly Hills).</TE>
<TE>   What about Huntington Beach Adjacent? Regarding the drive by some
Costa Mesans to change the city name to Costa Mesa by-the-Sea,
Richard Showstack says: "If they want to improve their image, why
don't they rename it Costa Mesa-by-Newport Beach?"</TE>
<TE>   Guerrilla proofreaders report: Some strange uses of the English
language spotted in print by this column's always alert followers:</TE>
<TE>   * A reference to a movie in which a woman indulges in immoral
behavior to support her "heroine" habit (spotted by Mary deVall of
Santa Monica).</TE>
<TE>   * A church that offers a "mediation" service (deVall).</TE>
<TE>   * A fence made out of "rot iron" (Doug Stokes).</TE>
<TE>   * A church dedicated to "wining" lost souls (Lisette Hepler).</TE>
<TE>   * A play appearing at the Prince of "Peach" Church (Armida and
Bill Thomson).</TE>
<TE>   * A house with "double pain" windows (K. Baker).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, the appointment of an "Oversite Committee" (from
Larry and Janine Mai, who hope it will look into spelling
oversights).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: After reading here the item about the $25 book titled
"1,001 Free Things," Rick Sharafman was reminded of the Abbie Hoffman
book that invited readers to ignore the price. Its title: "Steal This
Book."</TE>

<LD>Mary Garey, 89, who appeared in books and magazine articles with her
famous offspring, actress daughter Diane Ladd and granddaughter Laura
Dern, died May 23 in Ojai of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Born Mary Bernadette Anderson in Mobile, Ala., Garey spent most of
her life in Mississippi, relocating to Ojai in 1998 to be closer to
her family. She was primarily a housewife who had bit parts in
several films. She was widowed by two husbands, Preston Paul Ladner
and Daniel Garey. Ladd was her daughter with Ladner.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, Garey, Ladd and Dern graced the cover of the book
"Mothers and Daughters," by Lauren Cowen and Jayne Wexler, which
explored the complex relationships between daughters and their
mothers through essays and photos. The three-generation trio, unlike
many subjects of the book, reported that they enjoyed a happy
association throughout their lives.</LD>
<TE>   Garey, who had a soft Southern accent, was a popular guest at the
two Oscar nominees' various award ceremonies and gave Ladd away at
her 1999 Bel-Air wedding to businessman Robert C. Hunter.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Sex Abuse Victims File Claim</HD>
<DH>Schools: Millions sought from Oxnard Union district for
former students of Camarillo High teacher charged with 39 counts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A multimillion-dollar claim has been filed against the school
district that employed a 30-year-old Camarillo High School teacher
now accused of sex acts with several students.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, a teacher and coach at the school, faces 39
felony and misdemeanor counts involving 11 teenage boys, nine of whom
are former or current Camarillo High students.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura attorney Brenda Andrade confirmed Thursday that she filed
the claim against the Oxnard Union High School District last week on
behalf of four alleged victims and their parents.</LD>
<TE>   In April, Andrade said she was trying to determine what and when
school officials knew about Pridgen's alleged activity. If they were
liable, she said, she would file a claim.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade on Thursday would not reveal the details of what she found
or the amount of the claim.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, the school district has indicated a willingness to
resolve this matter without further litigation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although legal claims are generally a matter of public record,
school district officials refused to provide a copy of the claim to
The Times on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Woo, the school district's attorney, said she needs to look
at the claim to "make a determination on what, if any, part of it
needs to be released."</TE>
<TE>   Woo said she is exercising the district's right under California
law to keep the information private for 10 days, but did not provide
a specific reason for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   But Terry Francke, general counsel for the Sacramento-based First
Amendment Coalition, said the California Public Records Act forbids
the 10-day provision from being used as a way to delay or obstruct
access to a record if the document is clearly public.</TE>
<TE>   "An agency cannot just use this stalling period arbitrarily,"
Francke said.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Robert Valles and board member Steve Stocks
said trustees discussed the claim in a closed session during a
meeting Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The posted agenda, however, made no mention of discussion of
pending litigation, as required by the state's open-meeting law.
Furthermore, Francke said, if a claim is discussed in closed session,
the Brown Act requires that the claim be made available to the public
without delay.</TE>
<TE>   Valles said the school board was orally briefed on the claim. He
believed such a discussion was allowed under the "personnel"
exemption in the Ralph M. Brown Act, which is listed on the May 29
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an administrative matter," Valles said. "They know what
they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the Oxnard high school district has run
into such problems.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury warned
the school board to familiarize itself with the state's open-meeting
law. Bradbury was responding to allegations that trustees violated
the law in the June 12 firing of former Supt. William Studt.</TE>
<TE>   A government claim like the one filed by Andrade is typically the
first step to a civil lawsuit. In this case, however, district
officials said they want to work with Andrade to prevent any further
harm to the alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to understand what happened," said Steven A. Gama,
the district's risk manager. "We feel in this case, it doesn't seem
the best course of action to summarily reject the claim and fight it
out in court."</TE>
<TE>   Andrade was hired in March by the father of one of the alleged
victims.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father wanted to know whether teachers and
administrators knew or should have known that teens were frequenting
Pridgen's home for weekend parties that authorities say included
alcohol, pornography and sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, at least three more families have joined the civil
case.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen taught upper-level chemistry and environmental science
courses at Camarillo High and coached boys' soccer and girls' and
boys' tennis. He has been on unpaid leave from the district since his
arrest Feb. 5 and is currently free on $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   His preliminary hearing is set for July 23 in Ventura County
Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>Saugus District to Decide on $48-Million Bond</HD>
<DH>Funding: Measure E, to be voted on Tuesday, would help
build two elementary schools, increase Internet access.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters in the Saugus Union School District will consider a
$48-million bond measure in Tuesday's special election that district
administrators say would help build two new schools and fund
improvements throughout the Santa Clarita Valley elementary school
system.</LD>
<LD>   If Measure E gains the two-thirds vote required for passage,
district officials will use the money, along with matching state
funds and developer fees, for a $120-million project that will
include new security fences and Internet capability for all 13
schools in the district.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Supt. Bob Cutting said renovations at four campuses--Rio
Vista, Rosedell, Highlands and Emblem elementary schools--may involve
plumbing, air conditioning and electrical systems.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, two 750-student schools on the western side of the
94-square-mile district would be built by 2005--one on Wellston Drive
near existing Bouquet Canyon School and another in the Plum Canyon
neighborhood, near a new 2,400-home development, Cutting said.</TE>
<TE>   With 9,600 students enrolled and a 14th school opening in July,
Cutting said the district is not crowded.</TE>
<TE>   But the city of Santa Clarita saw a nearly 37% population gain in
the 1990s, and officials expect hundreds more students in the
district, which includes both city and unincorporated Los Angeles
County neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Because the measure is being decided in a special election, the
recent state law that lowered the level of support to 55% for some
school bonds does not apply.</TE>
<TE>   There are no other items on the Saugus ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Ender, a parent who has been organizing support for Measure
E, said she is optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Though two bond proposals for the local high school district have
failed in the last four years, a third attempt for $158 million
passed in the November election, along with an $82-million bond
measure for nearby College of the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting said that under Measure E, homeowners in the district
would be taxed $28 per $100,000 of assessed value for 30 years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of classes were canceled at UC Davis on Thursday as faculty
lecturers staged the second day of a planned two-day strike to
protest a new policy that has prompted dismissals of lecturers.</LD>
<LD>   A UC Davis spokeswoman said fewer than 100 classes were called off
because of the walkout, but a union representative said the total
might have been 150. The striking lecturers said they would return to
work today.</LD>
<LD>   The lecturers, represented by the University Council-American
Federation of Teachers, are challenging a policy calling for
lecturers to be dismissed after six years of service. UC Davis
officials say the policy was adopted as part of a plan to create more
tenured professor positions, which are higher-ranking teaching posts.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to clarify California's ban on bilingual instruction,
the State Board of Education voted 6 to 0 for new regulations that
outline alternatives to full English immersion classes.</LD>
<LD>   The policy allows parents to apply for their children to receive
bilingual instruction after 30 days of English immersion. It dropped
earlier proposals to allow teachers and administrators to do the
same, plans that anti-bilingual activists argued would gut
Proposition 227, which ended most bilingual instruction in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Parents raised the issue with the state board, said Board of
Education spokesman Phil Garcia, after local school districts took a
hard line against granting waivers for bilingual instruction to
struggling students.</LD>

<HD>Assembly Bill Would End O.C. Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH>Environment: Law seeks to require second treatment of
waste. Fight over local control is expected in Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill that would block the Orange County Sanitation District from
dumping partially treated waste into the ocean cleared the state
Assembly on Thursday but faces a showdown in the Senate that will
likely center on the issue of local control.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Ken Maddox's (R-Garden Grove) AB 1969 would require
that all waste water discharged by the sanitation district into the
ocean receive at least secondary treatment as required by federal
law.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is aimed at ending a situation in which the Orange County
district is allowed to dump some sewage into the ocean that is
treated at a less thorough level than what is required by most other
waste water agencies. The federal waiver that allows it expires next
year.</LD>
<TE>   The sanitation district hasn't decided whether to seek an
extension for the waiver. But seven cities have come out against an
extension, fearing the sewage is polluting the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), who is on the
state senate's committee for environmental quality, said he is
inclined to support the bill. "It's an identifiable problem that
needs to be corrected," McPherson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Brian Brady, president of the Irvine Ranch Water District
board and a member of the sanitation district, fears the legislation
would usurp the authority of Orange County officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like [the bill] at all," said Brady, who opposes the
waiver extension. "Good government should be local control;
otherwise, why not have the state do everything for us?"</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district said that it would have to build a
$435-million facility to handle the additional waste water treatment
if the waiver is not renewed. Those costs could add anywhere from $17
to $50 per year to a household's sewage bill, Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   The district's board is also considering a nonbinding ballot
measure in November that would ask voters whether the agency should
seek an extension. Maddox said he believes the bill will sail through
the Senate's environmental quality committee and has a good chance of
passing the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County environmental activist Jan Vandersloot called the
bill's passage in the Assembly on a 61-8 vote a "major victory."</TE>
<TE>   "It means the state is recognizing our plight and that the sewage
off our coast needs to be treated to full secondary treatment," she
said.</TE>

<HD>Fourth Teacher Sickout at Capistrano Unified</HD>
<DH>Labor: Frustrated by stalled contract talks, one-third of
Dana Point instructors fail to show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their students' Stanford 9 tests completed, more than 50
teachers at Dana Hills High School in Dana Point did not show up for
class Thursday, staging the fourth sickout in a week at Capistrano
Unified School District campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers are frustrated by protracted contract negotiations with
the district over salary and benefits. The sickouts, though not a
sanctioned action by the teachers union, have disrupted classrooms,
and several students have walked out or skipped classes.</LD>
<LD>   "Today's events are more telling than last week," said Frank
Weirath, president of the Capistrano Unified Education Assn. "The
teachers are just really upset about how this bargaining process is
going. It's really hit their morale."</LD>
<TE>   About one-third of Dana Hills teachers called in sick or absent
because of family necessity Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, dozens were absent from three campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The sickout prompted about 200 students to try to walk out of
class at Aliso Niguel High in Aliso Viejo before Orange County
sheriff's deputies escorted them back.</TE>
<TE>   The district's latest offer is a 2% increase in the teachers'
salary schedule, half of what the union is demanding.</TE>
<TE>   Letters were mailed to all 2,400 teachers in the district's 49
schools, reminding them of the sick-leave policy, district spokesman
David Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers also are restricted from striking until their contracts
expire at the end of the school year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in about a decade ... we've had this kind
of teachers' sickout or protracted negotiations," Smollar said.</TE>

<HD>Minority Prosecutors Face Tough Questions</HD>
<DH>Latino and black deputy D.A.s sometimes are mistaken for
defenders and accused of betraying their people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When criminal defendants enter the courtroom and see Mario
Coto-Lopez, they sometimes ask: "Are you defending me?"</LD>
<LD>   "No, I'm actually the one accusing you," replies Coto-Lopez, a Los
Angeles County deputy district attorney with the office's Strategies
Against Gang Environments program.</LD>
<LD>   In a county criminal justice system where the majority of inmates
are people of color, Latino and African American prosecutors often
face tough questions. "Why do you put your own people in jail?" "Are
you a sellout?" "Why aren't you a defense lawyer?"</LD>
<TE>   In response, black and Latino deputy district attorneys are
increasingly joining or forming professional organizations they hope
will eradicate suspicions in their communities that as prosecutors
they are just another arm of a criminal justice system that fails
people of color.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County jails house about 19,500 inmates--nearly 80% of
them black or Latino. But victims are minorities too, said Michael
Yglecias, head deputy of the district attorney's Pomona office.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I going to represent the person who got raped? Or the rapist?"
Yglecias said.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Yglecias and about 50 fellow deputy district attorneys
formed the Latino Prosecutors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The group's main goal is to offer support to members while making
the Latino community more comfortable with the legal system and the
role of prosecutors in it. The group is fighting years of bad
perceptions, said Laura Gomez, a professor of law and sociology at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very clear from popular polls, and some academic studies,
that there is a real gap in confidence in the criminal justice
system," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Real or not, the perception of bias against a community hurts the
system, said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor during a 1993 address she
made to a U.S. 9th Circuit Court task force investigating prejudice
in federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   "When people perceive ... bias in a legal system, whether they
suffer from it or not, they lose respect for the system as well as
for the law," O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers in the Latino Prosecutors Assn. say they will seek to
change such perceptions by discussing legal procedures with Latinos,
including what to expect if subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   Often, his role as a prosecutor gives defendants and their
families "this amazing misconception that we don't understand," said
Coto-Lopez, 42, a board member of the Latino Prosecutors Assn. "But
we do."</TE>
<TE>   Coto-Lopez moved with his family from Costa Rica to the Pico-Union
area of Los Angeles when he was 10. He grew up with five other family
members in a one-bedroom apartment a few houses down from original
members of a notorious street gang, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the rise of drive-bys, of helicopters flying around. I'm
not from an upper middle-class background. Most of us aren't,"
Coto-Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   African American prosecutors also tend to be misunderstood, said
county Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Jennings, regional director of the
National Black Prosecutors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings went home to the Bay Area to see his family during the
O.J. Simpson murder trial, in which African American attorney
Christopher Darden was prosecuting the high-profile defendant.</TE>
<TE>   During an outdoor barbecue, a family friend confronted him on the
patio with, "People like you shouldn't be involved. You're on the
wrong side. When are you going to come back to the community and help
us?"</TE>
<TE>   Flabbergasted, Jennings had to defend his career, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained how in my position I'm the one who decides if a case
is even filed, whether there is bias, whether the defendant has been
affected by his race. It's really important to have attorneys of
color making these decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings still walks into many courthouses where few except
defendants are minorities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most judges are white, and the majority of prosecutors are
white," Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he feels like a prosecutor and a community activist at
the same time, he said, especially when he works on behalf of the
victims but still wants to make sure the defendants get fair
treatment. In one such situation, he recalled, he was prosecuting an
18-year-old man in a gang-related shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "He was facing a lot of time. He called me a name that implied I
wasn't black," Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the insult, Jennings said he made sure the defendant's
family understood what was taking place in court by explaining the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "As a person of color, I had a little insight. This is one of the
hardest things of being a prosecutor. Even though I'm involved in my
community, I'm part of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings said he has little hope that stereotypes will change
soon, in part because there are few black prosecutors in Los Angeles
County. He has worked in courtrooms in Bellflower, Compton and
Torrance, and he said the one constant is that "people still don't
expect to see a prosecutor of color. I don't think it will ever
happen that they won't be surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Some questions about career choice come from peers, said Cristene
Albanese, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who grew up
in East Los Angeles and went to Loyola Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was going to Loyola I was joining groups there like
[Mexican American activists] National Council of La Raza, and there
was always this negativity toward prosecutors," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Albanese sometimes returns to the university to speak about her
career, encouraging law students to help their communities by making
them safer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not putting that gang member away because he is Mexican or
Puerto Rican, but because he needs to go away," the Latino
Prosecutors Assn. board member tells students.</TE>
<TE>   The association also seeks to increase diversity in the district
attorney's office, Yglecias said. Raised in Boyle Heights, he is one
of the highest-ranking Latinos in the department and the Latino
prosecutors group's first president.</TE>
<TE>   Yglecias went to Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley with the idea of the
association to make sure the group was accepted rather than risk it
being seen as a group of disgruntled employees. There are more than
110 Latino deputy district attorneys in the office out of more than
1,000 lawyers, said D.A.'s office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. There
are about 80 black prosecutors in the office, Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   The professional groups can have a role in increasing those
numbers, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stanley Williams, who is black.</TE>
<TE>   "We give a face to the many people in our community who perceive
that law enforcement organizations are not fair," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them it's a system for all of us, and that it's generally
a fair system. Some even seem somewhat proud, awestruck that a person
of color is in the system. They're certainly respectful of what I
have to say."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man apparently shot his wife and daughter to death and then took
his own life at the family's apartment in Highland Park, police said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   None of the dead was identified by officials pending notification
of relatives. According to neighbors, the man, who was believed to
have worked as a security guard, had often appeared troubled.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the bodies were found Thursday afternoon by a city
building inspector who was checking apartments in the modest,
two-story complex in the 100 block of Avenue 55.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives said a preliminary examination of the victims indicated
that they died Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the 11-year-old girl was a student at nearby Monte
Vista Street Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   They added that the family kept to itself.</TE>
<TE>   Hernan Salazar, 13, who lives in the building, described the girl
as quiet and said he saw her around the building frequently.</TE>

<LD>The family of a 15-year-old Ventura boy convicted of second-degree
murder in the slaying of a homeless man urged a judge Thursday to
send the teen to a treatment center and not to the California Youth
Authority.</LD>
<LD>   But relatives of James Clark, the 58-year-old veteran beaten to
death last summer, told Superior Court Judge John E. Dobroth that
Rocky Mattley deserves the maximum punishment for his role in the
June 30 slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Mattley is the first of four teens to stand trial on murder
charges. Prosecutors want him sent to the California Youth Authority,
where he could be held until he turns 25. But defense lawyers fear
that the boy would not receive needed counseling and educational
opportunities. Dobroth is expected to rule next week.</LD>

<HD>Nancy White, 85; Edited Harper's Bazaar 1958-71</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy White, the editor of Harper's Bazaar who guided the magazine
through the tumultuous fashion changes of the 1960s, died at her
Manhattan home Saturday of cancer. She was 85.</LD>
<LD>   The impeccably groomed White edited the Hearst magazine from 1958
to 1971, a time when fashion, and fashion editors, became
increasingly flamboyant.</LD>
<LD>   "She was very much a typical lady who knew how to edit a
magazine," said Eleanor Lambert, a New York City publicist and
contemporary. "She did not operate by personality and do eccentric
things. She was not a fashionista at all," Lambert said, in reference
to White's main competitor, the colorful, legendary Vogue editor
Diana Vreeland, and current-day editors.</LD>
<TE>   After a 16-year stint at another Hearst magazine, Good
Housekeeping, where she rose from an assistant to become fashion
editor, she joined Bazaar as assistant editor. She arrived at the
close of some of the most important years for Bazaar, when
then-fashion editor Vreeland, art director Alexey Brodovitch and
White's aunt, the celebrated editor Carmel Snow, together
revolutionized the look of fashion magazines through elegant graphic
design and photography. Snow handpicked her niece as her successor,
and soon after, Vreeland left and became head of Vogue.</TE>
<TE>   White, who wasn't known as an innovator and was overshadowed by
Vreeland, is nevertheless remembered for maintaining and enhancing
the graphic purity of Bazaar throughout her reign.</TE>
<TE>   She was born to a publishing family, the daughter of Thomas White,
a onetime general manager of several Hearst magazines. Throughout
three marriages, including one to Fortune magazine publisher Ralph D.
Paine Jr., she was known as Miss White, a moniker that was
simultaneously a mark of her independence and genteel upbringing.</TE>
<TE>   "She was brought up as a lady," said Marilyn Evins, founder of the
namesake New York public relations agency who worked with White.
"After all, her aunt was the dowager queen in the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Though conservative, White wasn't stuffy and was known for
fostering new designers and photographers. "She was always
championing the young talents that were coming along," Evins said.
"She pushed them and inspired them."</TE>
<TE>   White made the magazine a showcase for legendary photographers
such as Richard Avedon and Hiro, who have returned to its pages under
the direction of its new editor, Glenda Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss White was extremely good at mixing the avant-garde with the
accessible," said Bailey, who was born the year that White was
appointed editor. "She edited Bazaar at a time when society was
undergoing enormous change. She represented cultural milestones in
memorably creative and stylish ways--a fashion shoot at Cape
Canaveral and a striking image of the new contraceptive pill
photographed by Hiro."</TE>
<TE>   Though she was known for her seriousness, not her wit, colleagues
in the industry considered her personable and professional, said
Bernadine Morris, a former fashion critic at the New York Times. "She
was sort of the picture of a fashion editor," Morris said. "She was
so neat and clean and always appropriately dressed." Morris recalled
that White took pains to appear at fashion shows wearing a designer's
look and even changed clothes in her limousine in between shows.</TE>
<TE>   When White left Bazaar, she became fashion director for Bergdorf
Goodman. She also became the first woman to join the board of
directors for General Mills Corp. The former editor devoted herself
to philanthropy, and organized one of the March of Dimes' most
successful fund-raisers, a dinner cooked by top chefs.</TE>
<TE>   White had a daughter, Gillette Dauphinot Piper, with her first
husband, Clarence Dauphinot, founder of Deltec International; and
with Paine, a second daughter, Katharine Delahaye Paine. In 1978, she
married her high school sweetheart, George K. Thompson. She is
survived by her daughters, a stepdaughter, a brother, a sister, three
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Zoo Blooms as Botanical Garden</HD>
<DH>Ecology: The L.A. institution wins new designation for its
collection, use and special cataloging system of plant life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lions, and tigers, and palm trees, oh my.</LD>
<LD>   The plants at the Los Angeles Zoo still play second fiddle to the
animals. But the zoo's extensive collection of plants has won it a
new accreditation--as a zoo and botanical gardens from the American
Assn. of Museums, announced Mayor James K. Hahn and zoo officials
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The horticulturists see the botanical collections as having a
purpose loftier than making the zoo a green and pleasant place.</LD>
<TE>   "A zoo is the only place in the world where animals from every
continent and plants from every bio-region and people from every walk
of life and culture come together on a daily basis," said T.H.
Culhane, horticulture data specialist. "The zoo is the only place in
L.A. where this happens. What we model here is a vision of a
harmonious world, some would say a Utopian vision."</TE>
<TE>   Peer review is part of the accreditation process, as is evaluation
of a study prepared by the institution, according to the American
Assn. of Museums, which has accredited about 750 institutions
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Sausman, president of the Living Desert Garden and Zoo in
Palm Desert/Indian Wells, was one of two people to evaluate the zoo
and its botanical gardens for accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   "We found something extraordinarily admirable," Sausman said: The
zoo's horticulture staff, working with volunteers, developed a
computer program, and used it, along with global satellite
positioning technology, to catalog and map all 7,500 plants at the
zoo. Now the zoo can instantly update its computerized database and
create accurate maps of all its plant life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the most sophisticated plant-mapping system I've
seen in a botanical collection," Sausman said. "A very important part
of managing a botanical garden is knowing what you've got and where
it is."</TE>
<TE>   She also lauded the park for sharing its innovative technology and
database with other institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo spends about $1.3 million a year on its botanical gardens,
most of it for salaries for about 30 staff members. Its plant-related
expenses last year included $40,000 for tree-trimming, a zoo
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with money and a sophisticated database, gardening in a zoo
is no walk in the park, according to Edward Melara, senior
maintenance supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "We have large crowds coming through the zoo, and a lot of times
they trample on plant material," he said. Last year, 1.4 million
people visited.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever possible, the staff uses plants that reflect the natural
habitat of the animals, zoo horticulturist Janica Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   To help keep visitors from getting lost, there are "indicator
plants" for each of the zoo's five main areas--Australia, North
America, Africa, Eurasia and South America.</TE>
<TE>   An African flowering shrub known as lion's tail is the indicator
plant for the African section. If you spot the shrub, you know the
chimps and lions are nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Also when possible, the zoo uses nonchemical pest control. "The
peacocks help with the snails," said D.J. Smetana, park maintenance
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has a number of rare plants, including two 60-foot Chilean
wine palms. Rare plants keep arriving because the zoo is an official
plant rescue center for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever
plants are confiscated at LAX or elsewhere, they are sent to the zoo
or another center for safekeeping. Often, they remain, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the zoo got a large collection of confiscated South
African succulents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've also been getting a lot of cycads lately," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Cycads are ancient, primitive plants, explained Culhane:
"Universal Studios uses them in the Jurassic Park attraction. When
you want to say dinosaurs, you use cycads."</TE>
<TE>   Melara said he and his staff try to keep the plants looking good
but natural. The zoo has stopped skirting its Mexican fan palms, or
removing the grass skirt of dry material that hangs from the top.</TE>
<TE>   In its botanical database, the zoo keeps track of plants that are
appropriate food for the animals, called foraging plants. But mixing
plants and animals is always a tricky business, the staff said.</TE>
<TE>   Plants that are potentially toxic to a particular animal are kept
at a safe distance.</TE>
<TE>   The staff also looks for plants that are compatible with specific
animals. Thanks to the Paris Zoo, the L.A. facility recently got
access to botanical data collected by 67 European zoos. As a result,
it has learned that camels live nicely with elderberry and that swamp
wallabies don't mind black walnut trees.</TE>
<TE>   But some plants and animals don't mix. Smetana recalled the
staff's frustration in planting the black bear exhibit. They used
only plants found in the bear's natural habitat, including sequoias
and cedars.</TE>
<TE>   "We went in and made it beautiful," he said. "It looked like you
were standing in Yosemite."</TE>
<TE>   Not for long. Within two weeks, the bears had battered the
saplings into oblivion. After three tries, the staff gave up and
covered the floor of the exhibit with redwood chips.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has a garden full of native plants near its entrance to
encourage the public's use of indigenous, drought-tolerant plants at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "The zoo has an enormous impact on families and kids on what the
environment can be," Culhane said.</TE>
<TE>   For her, Jones said, "the satisfaction [in tending the zoo's
plants] comes from making it a better place for the animals and the
visitors."</TE>

<HD>Not All of Huntington's Power Plant Retrofit May See the
Light</HD>
<DH>Energy: Retrofit project has run into delays. One generator
will go on line in July, but with the state's electricity crunch
over, AES questions restarting the second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a year ago, the state gave energy giant AES "fast-track"
approval to restart two mothballed generators in Huntington Beach,
allowing the company to streamline lengthy environmental reviews.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, AES predicted that the plants would begin providing
electricity by last summer--just when officials thought California's
energy crisis would be most severe.</LD>
<LD>   But today, both generators remain idle.</LD>
<TE>   The refurbishing project that was supposed to take a few months
has run into a string of delays, in part because the generators
needed far more extensive repairs than the company had expected.</TE>
<TE>   AES officials now say that one of the generators will go on line
in July.</TE>
<TE>   But with California's power shortages solved for now, they
question whether the second generator should be restarted.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think there will be a demand for the power," said Ed
Blackford, a manager for AES. "Right now, we don't see it possible to
get that [second unit] on line this summer."</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, California's energy shortage has eased
considerably. Nine additional plants have fired up, producing more
than 1,800 megawatts of power since the crisis peaked last summer. At
the same time, price caps and other regulations have reduced the
ability of energy companies to manipulate the market.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach residents strongly opposed AES' fast-track
approval, arguing that environmental and health studies on the
effects of restarting the generators should be done before the plants
resume operating.</TE>
<TE>   But state regulators granted permission to AES to restart the
generators as soon as possible while completing a $1.5-million study
of environmental impacts.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said the situation shows that government
regulations aren't the only factor in delaying new power sources.</TE>
<TE>   "AES didn't live up to their part of the bargain," said John
Scott, a resident of southeast Huntington Beach, where the plant is
located.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole reason to give them this fast track was so they could
meet the energy needs of California."</TE>
<TE>   AES officials said their original plans for the generators were
ambitious but realistic. "It was an aggressive schedule, no doubt
about it," Blackford said. "We were looking at a best-case scenario
for just about everything."</TE>
<TE>   But the project was immediately beset by problems.</TE>
<TE>   The boilers were the biggest setback because they needed far more
work than the engineers had originally thought. "Even though this was
a retrofit," Blackford said, "you have to remember this was a
1960s-vintage [boiler], and an entire new instrumentation and control
panel had to be installed."</TE>
<TE>   AES used some nonunion workers for the project, a move that
sparked criticism from officials of organized labor who contended the
company was accepting substandard work.</TE>
<TE>   The general contractor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March,
prompting dozens of liens totaling about $50 million to be filed
against AES.</TE>
<TE>   The contractor, PMSI, contends that AES still owes the company $62
million. But Blackford disputes this: "We've paid in full for the
contracted work ... as well as approved change orders."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, AES estimated the work on the two generators would
cost about $120 million. But the project is now about $40 million
over budget, Blackford said.</TE>
<TE>   State energy regulators said AES won't be penalized for the delays
because the company does not have a contract with the state.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Johnson, a California Energy Commission manager, said AES
will eventually resolve its problems and generate power from
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Even though energy prices are less than they were a year ago, AES
will still need revenue from the sale of electricity to justify the
millions it spent to repair the generators.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to have that [power] this summer," Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Notorious Insect a Prime Suspect Again</HD>
<DH>Crops: A pest blamed for killing grape vines may also be
causing a citrus disease. Scientists will look at Ventura County
orchards for clues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agricultural researchers have launched a four-year study to determine
whether a voracious bug that has wreaked havoc on California's wine
industry could also be harming the state's citrus groves.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists with the California Citrus Research Board will soon
begin scouring orchards in Ventura and Riverside counties for links
between the glassy-winged sharpshooter and a host of emerging
problems affecting fruit and trees.</LD>
<LD>   The needle-nosed insect, which spreads a disease that has
devastated Temecula Valley vineyards and poses a major threat to
other grape-growing regions, has made its home in California's citrus
groves for more than a decade.</LD>
<TE>   But other than causing trees to go thirsty--the yellow-eyed bug
drains fluids as it feeds--it wasn't thought to be an immediate
danger until recently, when pest populations began to explode and
fruit scarring and other problems began appearing in citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Batkin, president of the Visalia-based citrus board, said
researchers will try to determine whether the bug is responsible for
those problems and, if so, what growers can do to keep sharpshooter
populations in check.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know whether the kinds of problems we are seeing are
caused by the sharpshooter or not," Batkin said. "We just know we
have a problem, and we've got to find the answer to it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 research projects are underway across California to
battle the half-inch insect, an exotic pest accidentally brought into
the state from Mexico and discovered in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium that causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs water-carrying vessels in plants--starving them of
nutrients--and causing them to dry up.</TE>
<TE>   Though the disease--which only affects plants--has plagued
agricultural areas for more than a century, the arrival of the
aggressive, fast-moving sharpshooter supercharged its spread. The
worst damage has occurred in Temecula, where 1,000 acres of wine
grapes have been destroyed in recent years, costing growers $40
million.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpshooter infestations have been reported from San Diego to San
Bernardino, and in parts of the San Joaquin Valley. The bug has even
been found as far north as Butte County. This year's first
infestation was reported earlier this week in Santa Clara County,
where sharpshooters were found at a Cupertino nursery.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent the insect from moving into high-priced winemaking
regions such as Napa and Sonoma, state regulators have invoked a
range of restrictions on shipments of nursery stock and other
agricultural products.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, for example, local inspectors must examine
every leaf of every nursery plant--except cut flowers--for
sharpshooter eggs before they leave the county. Citrus products also
must meet certain conditions to prevent sharpshooters from hitching
rides to non-infested counties.</TE>
<TE>   County agricultural officials have just launched a program of
their own aimed at reducing sharpshooter populations in 6,000 acres
of citrus and avocados bordering nearly two dozen nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the insects suck so much of the plants' juices everyday,
you can't really have the high populations we have without causing
some damage to the trees," Deputy Agricultural Commissioner David
Buettner said.</TE>
<TE>   Although grapevines are particularly susceptible to Pierce's
disease, the bacterium does not have the same lethal effect on citrus
trees.</TE>
<TE>   However, the bug has spread a related strain of the bacterium that
has devastated citrus groves in Brazil and other South American
countries.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, the California Citrus Research Board years ago
began investigating the pest, long before it began to ravage the
grape industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say we weren't concerned about it, but the fact is up
to this point we haven't been able to demonstrate the detrimental
effect of having high populations [of sharpshooters] in our groves,''
said Roger Orr, a Santa Paula lemon grower and chairman of the
research board.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the evidence has been anecdotal," he added. "That is why
we wanted to pursue this study.''</TE>
<TE>   The study will take place for at least four years with navel
oranges in Redlands, lemons in Temecula and Valencia oranges near
Piru, where high numbers of sharpshooters have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers will look to see whether the pests are responsible for
problems such as rind scarring that has started appearing on fruit
coming from infested groves. They also will try to determine to what
extent the trees themselves are being harmed.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, many growers are having to spend additional
money to water trees that are being dehydrated by large numbers of
the sucking insects, said Chris Taylor, senior vice president of
farming for the Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co., Ventura County's
largest farming enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor said it's possible that trees are being stressed by the
sharpshooter to the point where they are producing smaller,
low-quality fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could eradicate it I would, but I don't think that's ever
going to happen," Taylor said. "Our best hope is to try to control
their numbers. But it's pretty precocious. It doesn't have too many
enemies. It's kind of near the top of the food chain for bugs."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Health Agency's Deficit Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adding to the county health department's financial woes, a state
audit has found that it has underestimated its looming shortfall by
$170 million.</LD>
<LD>   In a report released Thursday, state auditor Elaine M. Howle said
Los Angeles County will be more than $850 million short by 2005-06, a
sum so substantial that if the department does not convince the state
and federal governments to contribute more money, it will have to
fundamentally redefine what services it provides.</LD>
<LD>   The bulk of the projected deficit is caused by the end of a
federal bailout, which would leave the department $688 million in the
red. But even that figure, previously released by county officials,
overestimates revenues and underestimates expenses, the report said.
It does not include the effect of regulatory changes that will reduce
federal reimbursement limits and require higher nurse-to-patient
ratios and seismic retrofitting of hospitals, among other things.</LD>
<TE>   "There has to be a change in the government funding or they're
going to have to cut back services," said Ann Campbell, the principal
auditor for the report.</TE>
<TE>   The county's health director, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, said that the
report is "reasonably accurate" and that the department knew about
the additional financial problems. County administrator David Janssen
said the deficit projections purposefully did not include the impact
of the new regulatory changes while they were tentative.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough money into the future to give the level of
services we have," he said. "Anything that deepens the deficit is
discouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Next month, Garthwaite will present recommendations to the county
Board of Supervisors on how to fix his department's financial
problems.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed with the state auditor's assessment that any solution
goes far beyond simple cost-cutting measures to a fundamental shift
away from the county's hospital-based model to cheaper outpatient
services.</TE>
<TE>   "As I look at the redesigned system and I try to add up what the
redesigned system would save, I don't come near $688 million,"
Garthwaite said. "I have to close down a few things to get to $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   "To get to the real money," he added, "we have to cut pretty
deep."</TE>
<TE>   The department has socked away $500 million in reserves, which
could allow it to delay the crisis for a couple of years, but county
officials say they are committed to beginning reforms now.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals under review run the gamut from closing hospitals to
turning some hospitals into clinics and reducing beds in others.</TE>
<TE>   The solution depends, in part, on whether Garthwaite and the Board
of Supervisors can convince state and federal officials to again
rescue the county's health system, which serves nearly 3 million
uninsured residents with a $4.7-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has already bailed out the county health
department twice with billion-dollar waivers to Medicaid rules that
allowed the county to bill Washington more for outpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   The last waiver in 2000 was meant to be just that--a five-year
weaning plan that drops to zero in 2005-06.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said that the county is not asking for money this
time--just "flexibility." He and county supervisors are lobbying for
reform by removing profit incentives for expensive hospital care and
replacing them with incentives for currently unprofitable preventive
care.</TE>
<TE>   He said state and federal officials have been willing to listen to
the county's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But the state has a $22-billion deficit of its own and the federal
government not only is under a new administration but also has its
own fiscal woes, increasing the likelihood that the county will have
to save itself this time.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the state auditor's report was positive.</TE>
<TE>   It said that the county hospital system is reasonably
efficient--about average when compared with its peers--and that the
health department has a fairly reliable system for assessing its
financial situation, although some of its internal projections were
not realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, we found that Health Services has done a reasonable
job of controlling its costs and that it has been innovative in
finding new state and federal sources of revenue," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   The audit was ordered by the Legislature in 2001 to independently
assess the department's financial dilemma and determine whether it
had a handle on how to solve it.</TE>
<TE>   What it found, according to chief deputy state auditor Steve
Hendrickson, is that "they've still got some solving to do."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A state administrative law judge has struck down a landmark
$1.1-million fine against Kaiser Permanente over alleged lapses in
patient care. But the state official who regulates HMOs quickly
overruled the decision Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Michael C. Cohn ruled that the Department of Managed Health
Care overstepped its authority when it penalized Kaiser.</LD>
<LD>   The state alleged that Kaiser did not assess or treat ill patients
in a timely manner, which regulators say contributed to the deaths of
three people. Kaiser denied the charges.</LD>
<TE>   Cohn said that a 1975 state law allows HMO regulators to oversee
health plan finances but not the quality of medical care that
patients receive.</TE>
<TE>   The act was never intended "to grant the department authority to
micromanage the systems a health-care plan puts into place," Cohn
wrote in his May 15 decision, which was made public Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn also ruled that the state had not proved that Kaiser and its
physicians had provided inappropriate care.</TE>
<TE>   He did levy a $25,000 fine against the health maintenance
organization for not following a grievance process established by the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The state's HMO czar, Daniel Zingale, said Cohn's ruling, if
allowed to stand, would gut the state's patient protection laws.
Kaiser, the state's largest HMO, should begin addressing the concerns
raised about the care it provides, Zingale said, instead of attacking
the state's authority to fine the HMO.</TE>
<TE>   State law gives Zingale the power to reject the decision. Kaiser
can now make one final appeal to the Department of Managed Health
Care before the HMO can file suit in Superior Court, where a decision
could not be overturned by Zingale.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to in any way understate the gravity of the threat
that would have been posed by that decision," Zingale said. "That
really was aimed at the core of patient protection."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Pettingill, president of the California division of the
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, said he was disappointed in Zingale's
decision although committed to working cooperatively with the state
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Kaiser would appeal, he said, "We will continue to
explore our options."</TE>
<TE>   Pettingill said Kaiser wants to work with Zingale to develop
quality standards that would apply to all California health plans
uniformly. He said the department has no such formal guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The now-nullified ruling was the latest in a string of defeats for
the Department of Managed Health Care in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court judges have twice ruled that the agency can't force
a health maintenance organization to provide specific prescription
drugs--Viagra for impotence and Xenical for weight loss--to members.
And another Superior Court judge blocked the release of information
on doctor group finances after the California Medical Assn. filed
suit.</TE>
<TE>   The regulatory agency resolves most matters out of court. Just
last week, Kaiser agreed to pay $110,000 to settle a complaint by
Zingale's agency that the HMO had failed to send a young man with
muscular dystrophy to a specialist. Initially, in November, the
department had sought to fine Kaiser $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   In settling the matter, Kaiser did not admit wrongdoing, but
agreed to improve its educational programs.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.1-million fine dates back to the 1996 death of Margaret
Utterback, 74, of San Leandro, who suffered a fatal aneurysm.
Utterback made numerous efforts to see her doctor Jan. 26, 1996, the
day the aneurysm ruptured.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, the state Department of Corporations, which
previously regulated HMOs, found that Kaiser's lapses contributed to
her death. Zingale's agency increased the fine in February 2001,
citing the deaths of two other members who also died of undiagnosed
aneurysms.</TE>
<TE>   Utterback's daughter, Terry Preston of Hayward, said she was
surprised and disappointed by Cohn's decision because she sat through
the testimony and believed the state made compelling arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted out of this process was to know that human life
mattered," she said. "And Kaiser made it very clear throughout the
entire process that that was not their priority."</TE>
<TE>   Zingale's decision to overrule the decision "gives me hope that
the state feels so strongly about this that they're going to continue
to fight," Preston said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser officials say Cohn's ruling, and similar findings by the
California Medical Board, vindicate Kaiser personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the pain and the anguish that losing a parent
brings," said Dr. Robert Pearl, chief executive of the Permanente
Medical Group, the Kaiser-affiliated physician group that treats
Northern California patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I also understand the pain and suffering of the physicians,
nurses and staff who feel they have been inappropriately and unfairly
criticized. This decision affirms that the care they provided is
appropriate."</TE>

<HD>CenterLine Would Be a Track Star, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As light-rail opponents geared up for a political fight, researchers
at Cal State Fullerton predicted Thursday that a commuter train
proposed for central Orange County will create more than 29,000 jobs
and pump $3.2 billion into the local economy if it is built.</LD>
<LD>   The forecasts by the Institute for Economic and Environmental
Studies also show that the recently revived CenterLine project would
generate almost $450 million in federal, state and local tax revenue
during construction and the first 20 years of operation.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed rail line was shelved more than a year ago after
political and business support withered. The revived--and greatly
shortened--rail line would extend 18 miles through Irvine, Santa Ana,
and Costa Mesa. The original project called for a $2.3-billion,
35-mile line from Irvine to Fullerton. Early estimates indicate the
shortened line would cost about $1.5 billion to build and $632
million to operate and maintain for 20 years after service begins.</LD>
<TE>   The line--which would link county buildings, South Coast Plaza and
perhaps UC Irvine--would initially attract up to 30,000 passengers a
day, Orange County Transportation Authority officials estimate. They
project that daily ridership would eventually climb to more than
40,000.</TE>
<TE>   "CenterLine is not just a transportation project. It is an
economic engine," said county Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who chairs the
OCTA board. "The data shows the public how dollars generated by the
project will ripple through the county."</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA board, which has authorized preliminary economic and
engineering studies, is assessing the feasibility of the project. A
final decision on the line is more than a year away.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's analysis could help supporters sell the project to
other cities. A coalition of municipalities in western Orange County
already has formed to attract CenterLine service. Another is getting
started in North County.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that CenterLine will have economic benefits,
critics say light-rail systems are more costly, carry fewer
passengers and offer less flexibility than bus service.</TE>
<TE>   Since light rail nationally serves less than half a percent of all
commuters, critics contend CenterLine would do little to relieve
rush-hour traffic congestion and air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   National studies show that while there are successful light-rail
systems in the country, the majority exceed their cost estimates and
fall short of their ridership projections, sometimes dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "You could dig a $2-billion ditch in the middle of Orange County
and accomplish the same thing economically as CenterLine," said Jack
Mallinckrodt, a director of Drivers for Highway Safety, a local
transportation group that has been critical of carpool lanes and
light rail systems.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine opponents launched an initiative effort Wednesday to
let Irvine voters decide whether they want light rail in their city.
If the drive is successful, the initiative could appear on the
February ballot and--if approved--would revise Irvine's general plan
by eliminating the possibility of building rail lines through
residential areas. It would further require the Irvine City Council
to retract its support for CenterLine.</TE>
<TE>   "Protecting our neighborhoods must be our first priority," said
Bill Mavity, an antirail activist and Woodbridge Village Assn. board
member. "I have seen OCTA try to sell, sell, sell the CenterLine, and
it reminds me of a kid in a candy store with a pocketful of change.
Let's vote before we spend."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said OCTA and Irvine officials are concerned about the
potential effect of CenterLine on neighborhoods. They have ordered a
study comparing traditional light rail with a monorail system, which
would be elevated, have a narrower right of way and intrude less into
residential areas.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Puts Threat on Hold</HD>
<DH>Finances: Baca was widely criticized after saying that he
would release 400 prisoners to help make up a $100-million budget
cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY and GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing a decision announced less than 24 hours earlier, Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca on Thursday backed off from his
threat to start releasing 400 inmates accused of misdemeanors as a
budget-cutting measure.</LD>
<LD>   "I will suspend this ... so we can have an opportunity to continue
to listen to the critics," Baca announced, responding to a storm of
objections that greeted his earlier decision.</LD>
<LD>   "I am looking for ways not to have to do this," Baca said.</LD>
<TE>   The uproar came from judges, prosecutors and county supervisors
Wednesday after Baca said that $100 million in impending cuts in his
$1.6-billion budget would force him to make major reductions.</TE>
<TE>   The threatened release applies to inmates with bail under $25,000
who are not charged with felonies or violent misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   It would apply only to those awaiting trial, not to inmates
already convicted, and would have begun today.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's threat prompted Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo to say that they would instruct their deputies to
seek higher bails to avoid the releases. It also triggered critics in
county government and a union, who said Baca could close the budget
gap without the use of mass releases.</TE>
<TE>   Baca announced that no releases will take place before July 1. He
said the delay will provide more time to find other ways to solve his
budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   Although his verbal sparring with county supervisors continued
Thursday, Baca's decision brought some relief.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very grateful for that," Los Angeles County Superior Court
Judge Dan T. Oki, who supervises criminal courts, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo pledged to "do all I can to make sure this policy
doesn't go into effect."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Yvonne Braithwaite Burke called
Baca's reversal "good news." But they said his budget problems are
his own doing.</TE>
<TE>   Baca denied that, saying that he has no choice but to release
inmates because the jails are underfunded by about $25 million.
Reducing the number of inmates by 400 would save about $5 million, a
sheriff's spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the releases, Baca said, he will be forced to close
the 2,000-inmate Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood, which
houses 1,600 people. The inmates at Century would be moved to other
facilities, and the space shortage caused by the closure would be met
by releasing new arrestees.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff issued a challenge in rejecting claims that he could
balance his budget without releasing prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome anyone inside government or in the private sector to
come in and show me where the cuts are in view of the fact that I am
already taking a $100-million cut.</TE>
<TE>   "The board has two more weeks to decide to restore the funds. I
hope they do so; if they do, the release will not be necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said he would welcome an analysis of his budget by
independent auditors, as well as a public referendum on whether more
county funding should go to the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The department's $1.6-billion budget includes $648 million from
the county, Baca said. The jail population is about 20,000 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   At a later news conference, Burke and Yaroslavsky charged that
Baca has not worked hard enough to save money and questioned his
math.</TE>
<TE>   They said Baca's budget is being increased by $21 million, and
acknowledged that level will still create a $50-million shortfall in
funding his programs.</TE>
<TE>   The state economic slowdown took a $205-million chunk out of the
county budget, which is projected to be $16.2 billion next year.</TE>
<TE>   Some proposed cuts would come from service reductions in a number
of areas, including closing a juvenile camp, increasing caseloads for
officers supervising juvenile probationers, ending the district
attorney's environmental crimes and sex crimes units, and cutting
library hours or closing branches.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that [Baca] needs to stand up to the plate just as
we are," Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky agreed. "In a budget of $1.6 billion you can find ways
to cut costs and increase efficiencies," he said. "I simply hope that
the last 24 hours will be a lesson that we need to put the people
first."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said supervisors face "what may be the worst budgetary
cycle that this county has faced in a generation."</TE>
<TE>   He said county officials want to know how much money Baca has
spent on new programs during the current fiscal year, such as plans
for a homeless facility near Twin Towers Correctional Facility and a
training program for upper-management.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said he needed the information "in order for us to do
our job" and make informed suggestions on where the sheriff can make
his cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to know what has happened to the money we have
appropriated."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Maynard, a spokeswoman for a coalition of unions
representing thousands of staffers in Baca's department, said
Thursday that her organization has suggested several options, other
than prisoner releases, to save money.</TE>
<TE>   She said the Sheriff's Department could reduce expenses on
vehicles used by civilians and could suspend the hiring of new
executives in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon R. Harper, an official in the county chief administrative
officer's office, cited more than $10 million in savings that she
said Baca could realize in a fund for new equipment, such as cars and
photocopiers.</TE>
<TE>   Baca would not have been the first Los Angeles County sheriff to
release prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1995, then-Sheriff Sherman Block announced the release of
about 3,000 inmates because of budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Those inmates were serving sentences for misdemeanors and
"low-grade" felonies such as burglary. Block repeatedly had
threatened to make early releases and to close jails during budget
skirmishes with the Board of Supervisors.</TE>

<HD>Suit Targets Turn Lanes and Signal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most communities rejoice when their local officials pony up some
money for neighborhood traffic improvements.</LD>
<LD>   Not the well-heeled folks along Roscomare Road in the Santa Monica
Mountains. After the city of Los Angeles approved $200,000 in March
to add turn lanes and a traffic signal on the road, the community
sued the city to stop the improvements.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit charges that the new lanes and signal at the
intersection with Mulholland Drive would improve traffic flow, thus
encouraging more drivers to use Roscomare as an alternative to the
congested San Diego Freeway from the San Fernando Valley to the
Westside. This, the residents argue, would bring more speeding,
accidents and noise.</LD>
<TE>   "Who wants 2,000 more cars on their street every day?" asked
Steven Twining, president of the Roscomare Valley Assn., the
homeowners group that filed the lawsuit in April.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the city receives nearly 200 requests for traffic
signals but, because of budget shortfalls, can install only 10 to 15
annually. Still, transportation officials say they can't remember the
last time the city has been sued to stop a signal.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the latest example of the neighborhood turmoil that
is created in Southern California when commuters seek shortcuts
through quiet residential communities to avoid increasingly crowded
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Each weekday, more than 120,000 commuters use residential streets
to traverse the Santa Monica Mountains between the Valley and the
portion of Los Angeles to the south. In the last 25 years, such
traffic has grown about 40%, according to the Los Angeles Department
of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in other neighborhoods suffering from cut-through
traffic have demanded increased police patrols and more improvements,
such as signal lights and no-turn signs.</TE>
<TE>   But on Roscomare Road, the residents say more improvements will
only serve additional drivers. They cite a traffic study they
commissioned that predicts that traffic on the street will increase
by 1,800 cars per day with the signal.</TE>
<TE>   City officials dismiss such predictions, saying the improvements
would only improve safety at a dangerous intersection.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents the area, said the suit
defies logic.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is: Traffic will increase one way or another," he
said. "It would be foolish to think [that] if we do nothing, our
traffic problems will go away."</TE>
<TE>   Roscomare, a narrow, two-lane residential street, parallels the
freeway from the crest of the mountains south into Bel-Air. Despite
the installation of speed humps at six places along the road,
speeding cut-through traffic continues unabated.</TE>
<TE>   The center of dispute is the intersection of Roscomare and
Mulholland. Traffic on Roscomare faces a stop sign at the crossroads.
Drivers on Mulholland do not.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists turning left from westbound Mulholland onto Roscomare or
left from northbound Roscomare onto Mulholland must wait for traffic
on Mulholland to clear to complete the turn.</TE>
<TE>   Intersection Can Turn Into a Bottleneck</TE>
<TE>   When traffic is heavy--particularly during rush hours--the
intersection turns into a bottleneck. Aggravating the problem are
sharp curves on Mulholland that partially obscure the view of
oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   City transportation officials say a three-way signal will address
that problem by stopping traffic on Mulholland so motorists on
Roscomare can more safely turn left onto Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   But some members of the Roscomare Valley Assn. say the signal will
also accommodate more commuters on Roscomare.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was a lot easier to make that left-hand turn, more of them
would be coming," said Jim Enstrom, an association member who has
lived in the neighborhood 16 years. "It's also going to increase the
accident rate on our street."</TE>
<TE>   The group's lawsuit demands that the city complete an
environmental study before installing the signal. The suit claims
that the community plan for the neighborhood requires an
environmental study before the city can make street improvements that
might increase traffic. No date has been set for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials reject these arguments, saying the signal will
increase safety, not traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't buy that," said John Fisher, assistant general manager
for the city Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss also rejected the need for an environmental study.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it makes any sense to claim that the California
Environmental Quality Act requires [an environmental study] when one
wants to put in a traffic light," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And not all neighbors on Roscomare support the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Fritz Zeiser, a member of the homeowners association who has lived
about a block from the intersection for 45 years, said of the suit:
"It's crazy and it's stupid."</TE>
<TE>   He says that some of his neighbors want to keep the intersection
as it is, in hopes that the bottlenecks and risk of accidents will
keep motorists away.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's make it safe for everyone," Zeiser said. "We don't want
someone killed at that intersection."</TE>

<HD>Priest's Wrestling Web Site Shut</HD>
<DH>Religion: Internet project showing photos of bare-chested
youths was meant to raise funds for an O.C. teen. Ex-Placentia pastor
had a similar set-up.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Web site run by a Roman Catholic priest in Pennsylvania that sold
videos of bare-chested teenage boys wrestling--ostensibly to raise
funds for a severely injured Orange County man--was closed down
voluntarily Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A similar site started by a former Orange County priest shut down
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Although the founders of both sites had said the proceeds would go
to help Tomas Mejia of Lake Forest, the man's family said they have
received no charitable funds during the last several years.</LD>
<TE>   A director of one of the groups running a Web site said the
materials on the site are an innocent spoof of wrestling, and the
group has sent money regularly for the Mejia family.</TE>
<TE>   An initial fund to help the family was set up in 1994 by Father
James Curran, who worked in the Diocese of Orange then. Tomas Mejia,
a former prep star at El Toro High School, was paralyzed and suffered
severe brain damage in a 1994 traffic accident before his sophomore
year. His family had no insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Curran said through an attorney Thursday that he met Father Glenn
Michael Davidowich in 1997 or 1998 on the East Coast and told him
about Mejia's plight.</TE>
<TE>   The Pennsylvania priest offered to help.</TE>
<TE>   Davidowich, pastor of St. Michael the Archangel Byzantine Catholic
Church in Mont Clare, Penn., founded the Junior Professional
Wrestling Assn. in 1999. In filings seeking nonprofit status, he said
the purpose was to help pay continuing medical bills for Tomas Mejia.</TE>
<TE>   For the last three years, the association's Internet site has
featured photos of youthful grapplers--some as young as 16--with such
nicknames as "Corporal Punishment" and "Johnny Heartbreaker."</TE>
<TE>   It also peddled a long list of its own wrestling videos, such as
"Back-to-School Bash," "Heat Stroke 2" and "Cabin Fever 2," some shot
in a church rectory. The videos sold for roughly $20 apiece. The
nonprofit did not file required tax returns that would have indicated
how much money it brought in and gave away.</TE>
<TE>   Davidowich sent Curran "one or two checks" totaling about $1,500,
said Richard Leamy, an attorney for the Claretian Missionaries, the
order of priests to which Curran belongs. Leamy said Curran severed
fund-raising ties with the wrestling organization several years ago
after viewing its Web site and finding the photographs distasteful.</TE>
<TE>   Curran, now an associate pastor at a church in Stone Mountain,
Ga., declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But public documents show that Curran undertook a similar
enterprise about the same time Davidowich did.</TE>
<TE>   He listed himself as owner of Con Ganas Sports Entertainment in
1999 fictitious-business-name statements, and gave, as an address,
St. Joseph Church in Placentia, where he was an associate pastor. Con
Ganas is Spanish for "with desire" or "with enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   The Con Ganas Web site featured fund-raising pleas for Tomas
Mejia, along with beefcake poses of high school wrestlers, videos of
prep wrestling matches and unofficial tussles featuring athletes
named "Y2K Hunk" and "Surfin' Superboy." Video titles include: "The
Future Looks Good" and "Class Act."</TE>
<TE>   The site, which listed a Placentia post-office box as the
organization's address, signed off last summer with this notice:</TE>
<TE>   "Con Ganas Sports began in the summer of 1999 as a not-for-profit
sports entertainment entity, specializing in professional wrestling
with the sole purpose of generating funds for the Tomas Mejia
Fund.... Con Ganas has decided to discontinue production
indefinitely, while we consider more cost-efficient ways of
accomplishing our original purpose."</TE>
<TE>   When told late Thursday of Curran's former Web site and business,
attorney Leamy said, "That's news to me. I can't really comment."</TE>
<TE>   Curran left the Orange diocese last summer. A diocesan spokeswoman
said the church had no knowledge of the business and wouldn't have
allowed it if it had. She also noted that Curran had only
complimentary reviews in his personnel file.</TE>
<TE>   Marcella Mejias, who along with her husband, cares for her son in
a two-bedroom apartment, said this week that she had never heard of
any wrestling associations designed to raise money for Tomas and
hasn't received a check from any group for years. She said the
initial fund started by Curran, a priest she admires, has been closed
down.</TE>
<TE>   "My life is taking care of my son and that's it," she said. "We
don't have any idea of what [the wrestling association] is about."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Karl, director of the Pennsylvania group, said in a written
statement that his organization each year sent a check for about
$2,000 for Mejia to Curran, though the last check was returned
because the priest had moved from Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Karl said the site has been criticized by Davidowich's
parishioners as sexually suggestive and unseemly for a
church-connected organization. The wrestlers are scantily dressed and
earlier photographs showed some of them in dog collars and chains.</TE>
<TE>   Davidowich allowed a few wrestling matches, which were videotaped,
on St. Michael's property during the summer of 2000, Karl wrote in an
e-mail response to reporters' questions.</TE>
<TE>   "In August 2000, Davidowich realized it was poor judgment to film
on parish property" and halted the practice, Karl wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Karl said Davidowich resigned from the wrestling association after
meeting with his bishop in February 2001. Still, he was featured
prominently on its Web site up until it closed this week, and he was
listed until recently as the nonprofit's director.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Andrew Pataki of the Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Passaic
in West Patterson, N.J., did not return phone calls or e-mails
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials in Pennsylvania said they haven't
received any complaints about the Web site and are not investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Karl contends that the site's photographs have been misconstrued.
"[We] provide sports entertainment, and nothing more," he said. "It's
a makeshift attempt to mimic and spoof pro wrestling."</TE>
<TE>   Ages of the wrestlers ranged from 16 to 30, Karl said, with minors
getting parental permission.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Kills 2 at Market in Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two decomposed bodies are found in his apartment
after police fatally shoot him. Four others in store are wounded.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A gunman opened fire in a Long Beach supermarket Thursday afternoon,
killing a woman and a 7-year-old girl and wounding four others before
he was fatally shot by police, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly before 11 p.m., officers found two badly decomposed bodies
in the suspect's home at 439 Cedar Ave., which faces the Top Valu
Market at 4th Street and Pacific Avenue. Investigators were not able
to determine the victims' age or gender.</LD>
<LD>   ''The bodies were located in one room and the suspect appeared to
occupy the other bedroom,'' said Sgt. Steve Filippini of the Long
Beach Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Police did not know how long the bodies had been in the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The gunfire at the Top Valu Market erupted about 5:30 p.m., police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said it was not known why the man began shooting, but a
Top Valu employee, who was not in the store, said there were
unconfirmed reports that the man, who had two handguns, became
enraged after a clerk refused to cash his check.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely an unfortunate and traumatic thing that happened
here. A 7-year-old lost her life and the police officers that
responded were also forced to take a life," said Filippini.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking to witnesses and anyone who knew him."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the suspect was 35 years old, but he was not further
identified. He was taken to St. Mary Medical Center, where he died
late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department officials said the girl and woman killed in the
store were not believed to be related. Victims' identities were not
released, but police said most of them were thought to be customers.</TE>
<TE>   A 28-year-old man was listed in very serious condition at St. Mary
Medical Center. A 58-year-old woman was in stable condition at the
center. A man and woman in their 40s were treated and released from
Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Police were having difficulty piecing together what happened after
the gunman entered the store. Detectives said they had not ruled out
the possibility that he might have been attempting a robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Joe LaRocque, 30, who lives across the street in a second-floor
apartment, said he had walked out onto his balcony to smoke a
cigarette when he noticed that the Top Valu parking lot was unusually
empty.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a ghost town," he said.</TE>
<TE>   LaRocque said he then saw a store security guard crouching at a
corner of the building, talking with two Long Beach police officers
who had just arrived. Moments later, LaRocque said, the two officers
walked into the store with guns drawn.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers yelled, 'Get on the ground, now!'" LaRocque said.
"Then there were gunshots.... It was a cacophony, a quick burst of
several shots."</TE>
<TE>   LaRocque said he couldn't see inside the store, so he didn't know
exactly what happened--whether police fired all those shots or the
gunman fired back.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, he said, more police stormed the store. Within
minutes, he said, ambulances arrived and began rushing the wounded to
nearby hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very chaotic," said Andy Busch, a spokesman for the Long
Beach Fire Department. "People were working to secure the scene to
make sure there were no other suspects running around.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed so many ambulances," he said. "Five gunshot victims,
that's pretty rare."</TE>
<TE>   All witnesses were bused to the Long Beach police station
immediately after the shooting. At 11:30 p.m., a man who had been
entering the store when the shooting started returned to the Top Valu
parking lot in hopes of retrieving his car.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea why he started and I don't think anyone else
knows," said the man, who did not want to give his name. "I feel
sorry for that woman and the baby that died."</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 19, an argument at the Top Valu supermarket between a
schizophrenic woman and store workers ended a few blocks away when
police officers fatally shot Marcella Byrd, 57, after she allegedly
raised a knife as if to throw it at them.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Byrd had tried to leave the market without paying and
was confronted by store workers, whom she allegedly threatened,
before leaving.</TE>
