<LD>It was night and everyone was somewhere else, which was fine with me.
After a weekend filled with guests, even good ones, it's a relief to
be in the house alone, staring at something on television that
amounts to nothing.</LD>
<LD>   But this time, there was a difference.</LD>
<LD>   I was alone, all right, and the TV set was on, but it was 9
o'clock on the nose, and the channel had already been set to HBO. I
was about to see America in pain all over again.</LD>
<TE>   I'd known for weeks that the documentary, "In Memoriam: New York
City, 9/11/01," was going to be aired that weekend but then forgot
about it until Sunday night. I had even monitored some of the
objections to its being shown at all, hearing critics argue that we
didn't need a replay of the scenes that were already seared into our
national memory.</TE>
<TE>   I too had pondered whether I wanted to see those beautiful,
sky-scraping twin towers again, standing like scepters of power
against a powdery blue sky, then collapsing in fire and smoke and
human lives.</TE>
<TE>   I have a photograph of them taken by my wife a few weeks before
the attack that changed the world. We'd flown to Manhattan with our
two 15-year-old granddaughters as a kind of coming-of-age treat, when
the World Trade Center was still a dominating feature of the vista
that was once New York.</TE>
<TE>   And I returned a week after the attack to gaze in sorrow at those
two vacant places on the skyline, that hole in the clouds where the
towers had stood such a short time before.</TE>
<TE>   Was it necessary to relive the pain on television? Did I want to
once more hear the cries and thunder of that sad September song? Yes.
I had to.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to watch that documentary for the same reasons that
compelled me to visit Buchenwald on a trip to Germany, the killing
fields on a visit to Korea and the memorial at Pearl Harbor on a trip
to Oahu.</TE>
<TE>   They represent instances in history that reveal with shocking
clarity how humanity has yet to make it completely out of the jungle.
Sensitivities that define compassion and caring are not yet fully
developed in an age dominated by technology.</TE>
<TE>   It was time to view calamity without tears.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and memories of laughter remain for the lifetime of those
who've suffered a loss, like the loss of a child, but there is only
so much grieving to be done before it dissolves into self-pity. It
becomes not the child we mourn for, but ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   So I sat alone Sunday night, staring at images too awful to watch
but too mesmerizing to avoid. A thousand hours of footage had been
condensed into 60 minutes of horror, history and acts of courage so
elevating that their spiritual triumph almost compensated for the
darkness of the evil that required them.</TE>
<TE>   I saw those two Boeing 767s, tubes of jet fuel and humanity, fly
like arrows into the sides of the towers. I saw the blossoming
fireballs and the billowing darkness. I saw humans fall from the
highest reaches of the burning skyscrapers, and we prayed that God
would give them wings and bear them to the sun.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the faces of the terrified, the bewildered, the determined,
the sad and the brave, reacting, running, moving in, comforting,
swearing, not believing. And the face of Rudy Giuliani, an oddly
puckish face, with a sweep of expressions that reflected everyone's
emotions, and a voice that said in so many words that they've taken
our buildings but not our soul.</TE>
<TE>   I watched alone in a house as still as midnight. Sometimes I muted
the sound to view in silence images that seemed somehow more real
than they had eight months ago.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Dali landscape then, but now it's documented history,
burned like a cattle brand into the body politic.</TE>
<TE>   Silence in the Santa Monica Mountains has an embracing quality,
allowing only small, ambient sounds to intrude: a dog bark, a car
engine, the refrigerator motor purring, an animal scurrying across
the roof. Scratches of sound. Puffs of sound.</TE>
<TE>   It was a familiar moment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, I sat in silence and watched the funeral of John F.
Kennedy. Five years later, I sat up most of the night and watched
muted replays of the events that surrounded the murder of Bobby
Kennedy. Figures moved across the screen in a ballet choreographed by
the age, swallowing sound into the stillness.</TE>
<TE>   I don't need words once they've been said. Repetition denies them
the impact they deserve. I had to see what was emotionally
unwatchable, I had to be connected to the people that comprised the
images. And the only way I could do that was to silence the sound and
absorb the humanity.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, I turned off the set completely and pondered.
Was it worth watching?</TE>
<TE>   Yes. It was. Not to remember what they did to us, but to remind
myself of what we do to each other. We'll be judged by that someday.
And the judgment may be harsh.</TE>

<LD>Chastity Bono has never been comfortable with the celebrity that
comes with being the daughter of Sonny and Cher. As a child, she was
happy to escape the glamour of her mother's life for an afternoon of
skateboarding at the Thousand Oaks home of her best friend. "I was
always striving for normality," she said by phone Monday from her
West Hollywood home.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, however, Bono has embraced the limelight as an
outspoken advocate for gay and lesbian rights. Her very public role
emerged, she says, from the heartbreak that followed the death of her
lover, Joan Stephens, in 1994 to non-Hodgkins lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   In her new book, "The End of Innocence: A Memoir" (Alyson
Publications), Bono, who's 33, details her love affair with Stephens,
a woman in her 40s and a childhood friend of Cher.</LD>
<TE>   Bono was 24 and struggling to make a record with her rock band
when she realized she didn't have the drive to stay in the music
business. For one thing, she had to hide too much. Although a tabloid
reported her homosexuality in 1990, Bono refused to go public for
fear of derailing her music career.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she relinquished her record deal to nurse Stephens.
The experience, Bono said, "gave me a sense of confidence that I
didn't have before."</TE>
<TE>   After Stephens died, Bono spent a year immobilized with grief. "I
had no idea what to do with my life," she said. Then, in 1995, she
started writing for the Advocate and publicly proclaimed herself a
lesbian on its cover. She went on to become spokeswoman for the Human
Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Bono and Cher remained close. "I went through such
a change in how I felt about my orientation," Bono said.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of enabled my mom to take the next step ... going from
accepting me and loving me to really having my sexual orientation not
be an issue at all."</TE>

<TE>   Space Tourist Shares His Slides</TE>
<TE>   Watching someone else's holiday slides may be an uninspired way to
spend an evening--unless you're a friend of multimillionaire Dennis
Tito. On Saturday, the famed space tourist will be showing slides and
home movies from his 2001 space vacation to raise funds for UCLA's
Jonsson Cancer Center.</TE>
<TE>   The event at his Pacific Palisades home also gives the 60-year-old
Tito an opportunity to tell a crowd of about 250 well-heeled guests
about the experience and its impact.</TE>
<TE>   It's rare, he said by phone from his house, "that you experience
something radically different in your life. After marriage and your
first children, life becomes another European city, another
cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   His trip to space, however, was "a life's dream." He has since
talked to other people interested in space travel, including the
28-year-old Internet millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, who came back
from his trip to space earlier this month. "It's all worth it," Tito
said he tells the prospective space tourists. "The experience changes
you forever .... It gives you a sense of accomplishment, confidence
and self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   A ticket to space costs about $20 million, but the cash-strapped
can take in the slide show. Tickets for the evening go for $1,250.</TE>

<LD>INTERESTING WOMEN</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Andrea Lee</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   288 pages; $22.95</TE>
<TE>   The women who inhabit the 13 stories in Andrea Lee's "Interesting
Women" have interesting names like Merope, Silver and Clay. They are
often American expatriates who exist in locales such as Milan, Paris,
Madagascar, Rome. They tend to be well-heeled and well-bred, but
they're left feeling that something significant is missing from their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Birthday Present," a bored 37-year-old woman named Ariel
decides on a special surprise for her Italian husband Roberto's 55th
birthday: a call girl. She knows that her exacting husband--"an
old-fashioned domestic tyrant"-- will be pleased with the gift rather
than shocked by it. He hasn't always been faithful to Ariel, his
second wife.</TE>
<TE>   Women seem to preoccupy Lee far more than men in these stories,
so, fittingly, she makes the focus of "The Birthday Present" Ariel's
planning rather than Roberto's experience. A good wife and mother who
speaks in a "seamlessly cheerful voice she has perfected over the
years," Ariel experiences a rare excitement and titillation in
preparing Roberto's gift.</TE>
<TE>   The prostitute becomes a kind of present to her as well, providing
her with a break from "the fathomless triviality of domestic life."
After the birthday has ended, Ariel feels an inexplicable sense of
loss, and the story ends on a surprisingly poignant note.</TE>
<TE>   "Brothers and Sisters Around the World" offers another portrait of
a marriage, and of a woman fiercely protective of her husband. Race
is a recurring issue throughout the book, as it is here: An American
black woman vacationing in Madagascar with Michel, her French husband
of eight years, is unsettled by the locals who flirt with him.</TE>
<TE>   Two teenagers, "not really whores" but just local girls "hoping to
trade sex for a T-shirt, a hair clip," are looking to stir up
trouble, and do. The narrator is furious when she learns that Michel
has taken the girls for a boat ride, but understands that he assumed
she wouldn't mind. She and her husband hold idealized images of one
another: "mine of the French gentleman-adventurer, and his of a
pliant black goddess whose feelings accord with his."</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who has written for the New Yorker and is the author of
"Russian Journal" and the novel "Sarah Phillips," flirts with issues
of race and class much like her characters flirt with each other, yet
she won't commit to saying anything substantial about such issues. If
Lee is capable of achieving the stunning depth that short-story
masters such as Alice Munro consistently offer, she isn't willing to
reveal it here. Her characters seem disenchanted but are too
complacent to do anything about it. (What's frustrating is that they
certainly have the financial and intellectual resources to do so.)</TE>
<TE>   Their worlds are steeped in wealth and a jaded kind of glamour.
Throughout the book are references to places and things unfamiliar to
most people: "an overpriced hotel suite in Portofino," a "beautiful
ostrich-skin bag," various playgrounds of the fabulously rich and
elite institutions such as Harvard or the Sorbonne. Such references
are casually tossed off without being examined. Perhaps if this
collection didn't display flashes of promise, it would seem less
disappointing. There are some genuinely inspired moments, but too
often Lee lets them languish. An exception is "Un Petit d'un Petit,"
in which a woman recalls her encounters over the years with Gus, her
best friend's older sister, with whom she was infatuated as a girl
growing up in Philadelphia. She says that "worshipping Gus is a
private luxury like a certain kind of candy I hoard in my locker: a
shell-shaped bitter chocolate with an Italian name." As the two women
age and move through marriages, homes and raising children, the
narrator starts to wonder if "there is a hidden logic to this sparse
set of encounters across oceans and years." Though her crush on Gus
is now a distant memory, she is left feeling an inexplicable,
bittersweet sense of longing for their next meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there's a tiresome sameness to the stories in
"Interesting Women." When Lee ventures into truly interesting
territory (affection between women or interracial relationships), she
raises more questions than she is willing to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it a story about black people and white people, or men and
women?" the narrator asks in "The Pulpit." Lee resists venturing
further.</TE>
<TE>   Longing, race, sex, class, home, identity are compelling issues,
to be sure, yet Lee uses them in ways that are neither profound nor
especially convincing. That men are minor players in this collection
is less of a problem than the female players, who are sophisticated
but shallow. They might be interesting women, but to whom?</TE>

<LD>As spring slides into summer, it's time to finish up any planting.
Overcast days may allow spring to linger, especially near the foggy
coast, but it will soon be too hot to plant much of anything.
Watering becomes the big job in gardens from now until fall and the
first rain.</LD>
<LD>   Unless you plan to water new plants nearly every day, consider
this the last chance to plant summer's flowers. The hot weather
champs are verbena, vinca rosea (also call catharanthus) and
zinnia--even in Palmdale they won't poop out--but you can also plant
ageratum, alyssum, amaranthus, balsam, celosia, bedding dahlia,
annual dianthus, dusty miller, gaillardia, gazania, gloriosa daisy,
lobelia, marigold, nierembergia, petunia, portulaca and salvia. In
the shade, try bedding begonia, forget-me-not, coleus, mimulus and
impatiens.</LD>

<LD>What Is an Oratorio?</LD>
<LD>   Singing is a wonderful way to express yourself because it lets you
make music and tell a story at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   There are many different types of music. Did you know that some
music is written for solo, or single, voice? Other music may feature
both solo voice and a choir, which is a group of singers who perform
together. Choirs can range in size from just a few vocalists to
hundreds of singers. Maybe you sing in a school or church choir.</LD>
<TE>   An "oratorio" is a type of music for many voices and instruments
that tells a dramatic story without costumes or scenery. Composers
(people who write music) may use a beautiful poem, a folk tale or a
passage from the Bible as the "words" for their piece. All of the
"action" comes from the music, making it very exciting to hear.</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest oratorios of all time, "Israel in Egypt," is
being sung by the Los Angeles Master Chorale on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
Composed by George Frideric Handel more than 260 years ago, it
recounts the biblical story of Moses leading the Hebrew tribes out of
Egypt to free them from slavery. It tells about the plagues, or
disasters, that struck Egypt, such as the Nile turning to blood and
terrible attacks by frogs, hail, locusts and more. In the end, Moses
parts the sea to help the Hebrews escape. The music features parts
for solo voice as well as sections for a double chorus. For ticket
information, call (213) 972-7282 or visit www.lamc.org.</TE>

<LD>Students in Cathy Weinstein's third-grade class at Clover Avenue
School in L.A. share some of the things they plan to do for their
dads on Father's Day.</LD>
<LD>   * I will take care of my very active sister because my dad always
takes care of her while he does his job. Also I would like to take my
dad back to Seoul, Korea, because he misses his business there. He'd
like to see how much Korea has changed since he came to America.
(Dolan, 9)</LD>
<LD>   * I would like to take my father to California Adventure. They
have many roller coasters there. He also likes Space Mountain in
Disneyland. (Michael, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * I would like to take my dad to an empty grass field. Why?
Because I want to plan a surprise party for him. (Irene, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * I would take my father to the university he went to when I was
born because it has been about 10 years since he was there. (Yhian,
8)</TE>
<TE>   * I would take my father to the arcade. We would play video games
all day and then go see "The Scorpion King" because that's his
favorite movie. Then we would go to the Third Street Promenade and
eat clams. (Hunter, 9)</TE>

<HD>Who Made That Shot: Horry--or Luck?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The arc of the ball was clean and true, the shot fired off coolly at
the buzzer--almost the kind of moment that every kid, every athlete
dreams about owning in a playoff game.... But just as quickly as
Lakers forward Robert Horry nailed the game-winning shot against the
Sacramento Kings on Sunday--keeping his team's playoff hopes
alive--the moment was snatched away, the fantasy dismissed.</LD>
<LD>   "That's [a] lucky shot, that's all," sniffed the Kings' Vlade
Divac, who had accidentally tipped the ball toward Horry. "You don't
need skill in that situation. You throw it, [if] it goes in, it goes
in."</LD>
<LD>   Trash talk or not, such comments from Divac and others have
touched off a debate: Was it just luck? Or was it a typical shot from
a low-key player who, time after time, rises to the occasion and
delivers under a cocked gun?</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers were one second away from a key loss in the playoffs
when Horry grabbed the loose ball. With sixth-tenths of a second
remaining, and forward Chris Webber charging, Horry swished the ball
straight into the basket. The final score: Lakers, 100; Kings, 99.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, Horry's three-pointer could prove to be pivotal
in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals, should the Lakers
manage to pull off a come-from-behind series victory. (Point guard
Mike Bibby made his own cool game-winning jumper for the Kings in
Sacramento on Tuesday, with 8.2 seconds left on the clock; his team
now leads the series, 3-2, heading into Game 6 on Friday at Staples
Center.) For now, anyway, Horry's 25-foot basket is the talk of the
series, one of those suspended moments in time that would force even
Divac to concede: "This is the way basketball should be, a
last-second shot."</TE>
<TE>   In the world of sports, fairly or unfairly, the measure of a
champion is partly defined by the clutch performance, how someone
delivers when the stakes are the highest. ESPN's Web site recently
ranked the all-time best clutch performers in sports--topped by
Michael Jordan, Joe Montana and John Elway--and the "worst choke
artists of all time"--led by golfer Greg Norman, the California
Angels and University of Houston's men's basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Horry, 31, is a background player next
to Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Rick Fox, but in the playoffs,
he is becoming known for making huge shots in the biggest of games.</TE>
<TE>   After Game 4 at Staples Center, sports writers cited Horry's
growing reputation as Mr. Clutch. The Washington Times reported that
Horry's jumper was "magical ... Horry has developed an almost
mythical reputation for hitting big shots, many of them
three-pointers at crucial times in games."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Lakers got a lucky break when the ball ended up in
Horry's hands, said David Yukelson, a sports psychologist at
Pennsylvania State University. Then, he noted, Horry's mental
training kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't panic, didn't rush, didn't lose his concentration.
"There was nothing lucky about it," said Yukelson, president of the
Assn. for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology. "The ball came
to him, and he executed without thinking. He was in the moment and
delivered.... It was pure rhythm, pure skill ... with confidence,
with relaxation, he's, 'I get it. I [nail] it. It's in. Let's go
party.'"</TE>
<TE>   Later, Horry would tell reporters that he didn't have any pressure
on him, that the spotlight is on the superstars, so he is loose and
ready when opportunity comes his way.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Yukelson said, a top athlete such as Michelle
Kwan can tighten in defining moments, such as the Winter Olympics
figure-skating competition. Kwan, who has won a U.S. record of seven
medals at the world championships, is ranked No. 6 on ESPN's list of
biggest chokers in sports. In Salt Lake City, she won a bronze medal;
upstart U.S. skater Sarah Hughes took home the gold. "You get the
little hotshot who comes in with nothing to lose and hits [huge
jumps], but somebody who's on top is maybe thinking too much, putting
too much pressure on themselves," Yukelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's three-pointer is being mislabeled, both as a "clutch shot"
and a "lucky shot," said sports psychologist Chris Carr at the
Methodist Sports Medicine Center in Indianapolis. In a way, said
Carr, his last-minute basket was routine, a kind of reflexive action
that comes after intense practice and visualization of crunch
moments. "In that level of performance, an athlete will describe it
as a subconscious phenomenon, like everything was in slow motion,"
said Carr, who works with the Kansas City Royals and the U.S. men's
Alpine ski team. "Time is kind of distorted ... an athlete who has a
good mental routine really dictates their subconscious to perform
when the cues are right."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Horry would say he didn't have time to think; his instincts
took over. He planted his feet, spun the ball so he could grip it by
the seams, jumped and fired, "cool as a cucumber ... like every other
shot, every other day," noted Bart Lerner, who teaches sports
psychology at the Arizona School of Professional Psychology. Had the
clock not ticked away, "maybe, if there was five or six seconds,
maybe he would think too much," Lerner speculated. "'Should I pass or
take a shot?' Then possibly Chris Webber could have blocked his shot
or been a lot closer ... some people will kind of tighten up and
think too much, and then the ball goes off the rim."</TE>
<TE>   Though the media spun Horry's buzzer shot as just short of
magical--"It was pure Hollywood ... right out of the movies," an AP
sports writer crowed--the Laker forward simply was coming through as
a professional, said Paul Salitsky, a lecturer in sports psychology
at UC Davis. "The truth of it is, it's an everyday occurrence," said
Salitsky, who has researched the Kings' team performance. "There are
clutch and pressure situations, and you get the ball to the person
who can handle it. They practice this. This is their domain, with
that kind of noise, that kind of [game] on the line. It's not a
negative to [feel pressure]. It's their gold medal moment."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention a sports fan's dream, said Salitsky, a Kings fan.
"I want to see competition. I want to see teams battling down to the
end so somebody does have a setup like that ... that's what it should
be about."</TE>

<HD>Creativity Lives Here in Comfort</HD>
<DH>Spanish Colonial Revival idea house mixes authenticity with
modern conveniences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was old is new again at the 2002 Philharmonic House of Design.
Casa Cantante, a new Spanish Colonial Revival, Santa Barbara-style
house, has been decorated by 24 members of the American Society of
Interior Designers/Orange County. For anyone looking for ways to
update a conventional wall or a traditional decor, this
6,000-square-foot house in Irvine's new residential and golf
community, the guard-gated Shady Canyon, is full of creative ideas.
Informal in tone, the house appears comfortable and unpretentious,
even with many designers showing off some of their latest
innovations.</LD>
<LD>   Although the house and development are new, the showcase's chosen
color palette harks back to Santa Barbara-style houses of the
1920s--indigo blue, smoky blue, cornflower yellow, light moss green,
smoky green, terra cotta and deep copper brown. "You see these colors
picked up in the accessories and details throughout the house," says
Beverly Stadler of Design Focus in San Clemente, who acted as the
project's design chairman. "Design elements are quite authentic here;
they're just freshened for today while still being true to the
traditional motif. In terms of style, things are a little dressier
than they would have been originally."</LD>
<TE>   The house sits on a hill on a 30,000-square-foot lot that backs up
to a natural creek and looks out over the natural terrain of the
canyon. Large windows throughout the house ensure that the
out-of-doors is never long out of sight. The house has a red-tiled
roof, arched windows, high ceilings and multiple patios. "All the
designers are trying to show off something that is a little different
but still makes sense in the realm of function," Stadler says. Some
of those functions are almost universal now, such as home offices and
entertainment centers; others, such as Whirlpool's $10,000 Personal
Valet dry-cleaning machine in the room-sized master closet, are not
likely to have mass appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Stadler says the emphasis was on specialized finishes, evident in
everything from wallpaper with a raised metallic design to trompe
l'oeil western scenes and bas relief flowers on a bathroom wall.</TE>
<TE>   The house's entry and gallery walls, designed by Anna Shay of
Solanna Designs, feature hand-done marmarina, an ancient Venetian
technique that means "small marble" and involves putting ground
marble into plaster, then hand-applying the mixture. Here, done by
artisan Alie Varner over a drywall base, the finished surface is
waxed a couple of times and appears instantly antique. "As the walls
age, they calcify and return somewhat to their stone state, which
gives them that ancient look," says Varner, who works for Revcon
Artisan Plaster in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The dining room, by Steve Stein of SLS Design Ltd., also
highlights finishes. The ceiling, for example, has a faux finish with
copper. Pearlized, taupe textured walls were made by putting wet
kraft paper on the walls, wrinkling it, and then adding two coats of
primer paint--a base coat and a glaze. Lighting fixtures throughout
the house often echo traditional wrought-iron designs but are made in
a contemporary mode.</TE>
<TE>   Other ubiquitous design elements include stone and tile work. The
dining room and the entry are done in white oak; the rest of the
downstairs uses terra-cotta pavers. Upstairs floors are primarily
distressed rustic light oak, except for the children's room, which is
bordered in wood with inlaid carpet on the floor. A small bathroom in
the guest suite by Rebecca Pellitier of Elegant Environments features
copper and tile inserts in the floor, as well as marble counters. The
living room, by Mark Cutler Design with Pacific Design Estates, is a
light cream color, and heavy beams in the ceiling have been
hand-distressed. A cast stone fireplace coordinates with two-level
draperies in linen and copper silk.</TE>
<TE>   In the family room, designed by John Benecke, walls are
copper-colored, with an upholstered niche for a flat-screened
television. The standout in this room is the fireplace, which uses
traditional terra cotta and ceramics in a lively new way.</TE>
<TE>   "The fireplace wall is made of hand-fired, hand-made terra-cotta
pieces assembled to my design. The ceramic hearth and mantle are
glazed to bring out a bluish color," Benecke says.</TE>
<TE>   Sotera Townsend Interior Design did the kitchen with plastered
walls with a sponged-on texture as well as colorful mosaic wall tiles
with hand-hammered copper insets. The adjoining breakfast room, by
Jamie Namanny of Interior Matters, has a pantry with shelves so high
that a sliding library ladder was added for easy access. Both
designers used the same fabric on bar stools and valances to unite
the design.</TE>
<TE>   The hobby room, by Candace Donnell Interior Designs, has a large
table in the center that can be retracted or expanded for kids'
projects. "There are sewing and knitting areas because we do so much
more in our homes now. We're just showing some of the possible
functions for a room like this," says Stadler. The adjoining bathroom
has a tree done in gold and green tiles on the bathroom wall.</TE>
<TE>   The House of Design is open Tuesday through June 30, Tuesdays
through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Thursdays until 8 p.m.
Free design seminars are every Wednesday at 2 p.m. and Thursday at 6
p.m., and garden talks are held each Tuesday at 2 p.m. Tickets are
$20, with all proceeds benefiting the Philharmonic Society's music
education programs for youth. There is complimentary parking in the
Irvine Spectrum Pavilion on West Technology and Horizon near Alton
Parkway with a continuous shuttle to the house. Tickets and
information: (714) 840-7542 or www.philharmonic society.org.</TE>

<LD>Richard Frinier sips iced tea in his Long Beach garden, scanning an
article about fashion designer Ralph Lauren's 35 years at the top.
"Can you believe it? He was the first to cross over into home
furnishings, and he's still at it," Frinier marvels. "What an amazing
success!"</LD>
<LD>   It takes one to know one.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two decades, Frinier has been the driving force
behind Brown Jordan, the El Monte-based outdoor-furniture
manufacturer whose innovative, elegant, well-constructed chairs,
tables, chaises, benches and umbrellas have made it the best-known
name in the luxury market.</LD>
<TE>   From the minimalist profile of his Quantum chair to the more
ornate scrollwork of his Florentine chaise, Frinier has proved
himself a master of both contemporary and traditional styles. And
whether they are fabricated in aluminum, teak or woven resin cord,
his designs have timeless appeal, many of them as suitable indoors as
out.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, after producing 60 furniture collections for
Brown Jordan, the 56-year-old designer retired as chief creative
officer. Frinier intends to keep his hand in the home-furnishings
business but doesn't yet know what he'll do next. Whatever his second
act, he has altered the outdoor field forever.</TE>
<TE>   "Outdoor furniture was pretty dowdy until Richard goosed it and
brought in sex appeal and excitement," says Marian McEvoy, editor in
chief of House Beautiful. "He did it by not copying the same old
things ... he came up with original forms and took the latest
materials to a level that was really chic."</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a half-century ago, outdoor furniture as we
know it didn't exist. Sure, there were cast-iron garden seats, wicker
settees and Adirondack chairs, but they rusted, faded, cracked and
otherwise fell to pieces in the rain and sun. Only after World War
II, when new materials such as aluminum and vinyl became readily
available, did things begin to change.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Robert Brown and Hubert Jordan teamed up in Pasadena to
manufacture wrought-iron breakfast sets. Three years later, at the
request of a Honolulu hotel, Brown Jordan started making
tubular-aluminum chairs with vinyl-lace seats that could be left
exposed to the elements. The Leisure collection was an instant
hit--and Brown Jordan and the patio industry never looked back.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the company helped pioneer emerging technologies,
most notably, powder coating, in which electrostatically charged
particles of pigment are sprayed on and then fused to metal. The firm
also led the way with the latest in fabrics (solution-dyed acrylics
and vinyl-coated polyester instead of rawhide and cotton), finishes
(antiqued and textured effects instead of smooth surfaces) and colors
(pastels, metallics and tints instead of plain white, blue or dark
green).</TE>
<TE>   Today, thanks to the popularity of "outdoor rooms" that extend a
house's usable space and multiply the opportunities for entertaining,
patio-furniture sales account for 10% of the $23-billion
residential-furniture business. And thanks to Frinier, Brown Jordan
has captured the imagination of the high-end consumer.</TE>
<TE>   Retail prices for Brown Jordan furniture range from $400 for an
armchair to about $3,000 for chaises and sofas. Costs vary, depending
on materials and labor, with machine-extruded aluminum being the
least expensive, stainless steel being the most expensive and
hand-woven resin-cord and teak falling in between.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all stuck with the same materials and technologies, but
those who can come up with something fresh have the edge," says
Richard Schultz, the former Knoll designer who created the now-iconic
1966 collection, a streamlined study in white mesh stretched across
white aluminum. "I'm very encouraged when I look around and see
something I'd be envious of. Richard's stuff falls into that
category."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Frinier, a mild-mannered native Angeleno, didn't set
out to design furniture at all. "I grew up surfing and loved the
water," says the onetime lifeguard who was born in South-Central L.A.
and raised in Downey. In college, he studied fine arts at Cal State
Long Beach, earning a master's degree in crafts in 1976. "My thesis
was about lighting," he recalls. "I was fascinated by light as a
material and, gradually, I started translating sculptural forms into
functional lamps."</TE>
<TE>   Then Frinier landed a part-time job teaching wood-furniture design
at Cerritos College, and, later, a friend who happened to own a local
furniture factory invited him to design bedroom pieces. Along the
way, he bought a tiny 1922 flat-roofed stucco house in Long Beach
that he has since remodeled and furnished with Gustav Stickley
reproductions and his own Mesa collection. He continues to live there
with his wife, Catherine, a writer in public/media relations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Frinier went to work for Brown Jordan. Designer emeritus
Hall Bradley, known for his skill with rattan and metal, returned to
mentor the new hire and pass the Brown Jordan baton. Says Frinier:
"He taught me to stay true to the brand but to challenge the status
quo, to carry the torch but show leadership."</TE>
<TE>   As a link between the company's past and its future, Frinier
introduced his first line, Quantum, in 1982. Influenced by Schultz's
1966 collection for Knoll, Frinier designed the armchair ($415) as
one sleek frame of flat extruded-aluminum tubing but with three seat
options--straps, mesh or cushions. Quantum went on to become a
contemporary classic and, like several of his older designs, the
13-piece collection remains in the company catalog.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully," Frinier says, "it will find its way into a museum
someday."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Frinier's interest in photography prompted him to take
charge of Brown Jordan's advertising and marketing campaigns. Working
with graphic designers like Jane Kobayashi of 5D Studio in Malibu, he
not only designed the furniture but shaped the way it was promoted to
the public. The result was beautiful locations and slick brochures.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard allowed us to reinvent the Brown Jordan look every year
with each new line instead of sticking with the brand identity,"
Kobayashi says. "He was very good at pushing people further." Frinier
had a keen sense of timing as well. In 1986, when everyone else was
churning out contemporary pieces, he broke from the pack with the
wrought-iron Florentine and Venetian collections. They marked a
return to the use of a material Brown Jordan had abandoned in the
1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Rampant construction of Mediterranean-style housing across the
Southland sent Frinier searching for inspiration in the details of
historic European buildings. "I knew people were going to need to
furnish all those places," he says, "and it would be good for me to
design something to complement that architecture." Frinier, who
furnished his own patio with Venetian, later phased out the wrought
iron and offered both designs in aluminum with textured and antiqued
finishes to simulate Old World ironwork.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, Frinier adapted his designs to available
production facilities, as he did with the Mission line in 1989. To
capitalize on an Indonesian factory already making ready-to-assemble
indoor furniture for Europe, he conceived a line of outdoor furniture
that could be built of local teak and shipped back to America for
assembly here.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, Frinier was experimenting with a new
weather-resistant extruded-resin cord that could be handled like
wicker. He first saw the material, now known as Hularo, at a trade
show in Europe, but it was woven on a less-durable rattan frame.
Frinier improved on the concept by making an aluminum frame, then
wrapped it in the cord in three different ways to produce three
distinct lines of woven furniture. One of them, Eastlake, is still
sold today.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Frinier ventured out in yet another new
direction--stainless steel. An homage to the mid-20th century
aesthetic of architects like Mies van der Rohe and Eileen Gray, the
Vu and Nxt collections gave him a chance to work with a luxe material
that hadn't been applied to outdoor furniture. Bold as they are,
however, these lines--particularly the Nxt armchair ($1,670)--remain
consistent with the Brown Jordan look.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard's designs were always leading-edge and trendsetting.
Without a doubt, he won more Design Excellence Awards than any other
single designer," says Joseph P. Logan, executive director of the
Summer &amp; Casual Furniture Manufacturers Assn., which hands out the
equivalent of the Oscars for the outdoor-furniture trade.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Frinier insists there are still frontiers to be
explored. Textured fabrics such as sateens and chenilles are one
area. Special-effect paints that, like pearlescent automotive paints,
change color depending on the light are another.</TE>
<TE>   But he'll have to be content with Brown Jordan's next lineup. Due
out in spring 2003, it's his last and most prolific--six collections
in all. Right now, Frinier, a workaholic once noted for working
weekends and holidays, has slowed down to consider life after Brown
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows?" he says. "Thirty years later, maybe I'll design that
line of lighting after all."</TE>

<LD>The head grasshopper hurried into the hallway. The heavy door closed
behind him with a clang. He looked at Ignatz through the little
window and gave the order to turn off the air-conditioning. A hissing
began. "Let's see how brave you are when you have used up all the
oxygen," the head grasshopper said with an evil chuckle.</LD>
<LD>   An instrument on the wall next to the door showed the head
grasshopper that the air in the room was getting thinner and thinner.</LD>
<LD>   He became angry as he watched Ignatz sitting calmly on the
platform in the center of the room. "Why is he not beating on the
door?" the head grasshopper asked a member of his crew. "Why is he
not asking for help?"</LD>
<TE>   "Perhaps he is tougher than he looks," the crew member suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Impossible!" the head grasshopper cried. "If he can live without
air he is tougher than we are! No one in the universe is tougher than
we are!"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he is able to hold his breath for a long time," the crew
member suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "That's it," the head grasshopper cried. "But he cannot hold his
breath forever. Come. We will have a nice lunch. When we come back
we'll see how brave he is."</TE>
<TE>   While he ate lunch, the head grasshopper told the members of his
crew how the Earthling would soon exchange a whiff of oxygen for all
the information they needed to invade Earth. After lunch. the head
grasshopper took a nap.</TE>

little window. He was surprised to see Ignatz sitting as calmly as

<HD>A Light Shined on the Edges of Truth</HD>
<DH>In 'Everything Is Illuminated,' young Jonathan Safran Foer
takes liberties with traditional storytelling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jonathan Safran Foer the author of the white-hot new novel
"Everything Is Illuminated" (Houghton Mifflin) and Jonathan Safran
Foer the protagonist in  the white-hot new novel "Everything Is
Illuminated" share only one salient similarity besides name and age.</LD>
<LD>   They both traveled to the Ukraine with a photograph of a mystery
woman, young and luminous, a woman said to have saved their
grandfather from the Nazis during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Here their narratives diverge.</LD>
<TE>   The fictional Foer returns with a rucksack of memories of peculiar
encounters as surreal as dreams. His search for the woman in the
photo puts him in the company of three oddly matched tour guides:
There's Alexander Perchov, a boasting, Ukrainian 20-year-old, son of
a travel agent, who is proud of his "fluid" English and his
all-around "premium" guy-ness. Then, there's Alex's melancholy
grandfather, (also Alex) who says he's blind. Filling out the group
is the elder Alex's seeing-eye dog, Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior
(named for "grandfather's beloved singer" and " the Negro of the Rat
Pack!"), who is as passionate as she is dim. Together, they take a
meandering road trip to locate the vanished shtetl of Trachimbrod, a
journey that unearths secrets that tip them all toward unexpected
answers and questions.</TE>
<TE>   As for the flesh-and-blood Foer, he returned with nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Or so he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "My trip to the Ukraine in 1997 resembled the purpose of the trip
in the book," says Foer, taking a few days off from his book tour to
write and collect his thoughts in his Queens apartment. "I did have a
photograph of woman who I had been looking for, who I had been told
saved my grandfather during the war," he explains. "But it ended up
like nothing. I didn't find anything resembling anything. There was
no person like Alex. There was no person like Alex's grandfather.
There was no person who resembled this woman we were looking for.
There was really just nothing. And not an inspiring nothing. Just a
real nothing."</TE>
<TE>   But once he got back to Prague, his base that summer, the blank
space somehow opened onto a promising path. He teased out one
sentence, toying with a self-made riddle inspired by a plaque he'd
seen in on his journey to Trachimbrod: "It was March 18, 1791, when
Trachim B's double-axle wagon either did or did not pin him against
the bottom of the Brod River."</TE>
<TE>   That ambiguous beginning unlatched something. He asked himself:
"Wouldn't it be more exciting if [Trachim B.] got away? Or more
exciting if we didn't know? Could I just side with my own
imagination? Is there anything wrong with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Apparently not.</TE>
<TE>   His imagination tantalized the publishing world, with Houghton
Mifflin outbidding 15 other publishers for a two-book deal. And over
the last month, effusive praise for what Foer wrought from "nothing"
has splashed across newspaper arts and book pages. The New Yorker ran
an early excerpt, trumpeting a new generational voice. Actor Liev
Schreiber grabbed the film rights. The book appeared at No. 9 last
week on The Times' bestseller list. And Foer, barely 25, became the
subject of magazine profiles and radio interviews--ranging from too
earnest to too quirky--in which he's found himself "disconcertingly"
discussing himself in the third person, or explaining how he is--or
isn't--like the Jonathan Safran Foer in the book.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything Is Illuminated" isn't a memoir, but it treads on the
edges of truth. Not just facts-and-dates truth, but the truths that
emerge when time and retelling reshape family stories.</TE>
<TE>   While Foer's wild, form-bending novel work has drawn comparisons
to Mel Brooks and "staggering genius" Dave Eggers, and everything
from the magic realism of Isaac Bashevis Singer to the fractured
English of Desi Arnaz, comparisons don't quite get at what he's
attempted to do. His briskly paced and often humorous book is not
simply an atypical turn on a Holocaust memento but a rethinking of
the very plane of the page with prose transformed like poetry--words
scattered among rows of periods or run together in breathless chunks.</TE>
<TE>   The text, a lively cut-and-paste snipped from various trains of
thought, spans three centuries. Foer sets down a backdrop, fancifully
outlining knotty political and religious histories. He overlays that
with explorations of the lingering effects of hate and compassion,
both in their extremes. And into the spaces between, he fits a
teasing mix of linguistic sleight of hand and broad humor.
Consequently, the book feels more like an impressionistic canvas than
a manuscript as it swings from voice to voice, narrative to
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Foer finds the most texture in the often gray area between family
stories and family secrets. "Everything Is Illuminated" is powered by
once-secret stories that gain--or change--meaning as they are cast
and recast like the bronze statue, the Dial, that stands in
Trachimbrod's public square.</TE>
<TE>   "The heart of the book is retelling, the inherent good of that,"
Foer explains. "Everyone in the book has a version of everything that
happens. There is nothing even resembling a definitive story. And in
the end, retelling becomes the effort to learn .... We retell
[familiar stories] and make them contemporary. And in doing that, we
figure out ways that they can influence our lives for the better."</TE>
<TE>   His own exercise in storytelling was a bit like experiencing a
thaw. "The emotions happened when I wrote the book," emotions
difficult to pin down, says Foer: "Happiness and gratitude. Anxiety
and self-doubt .... It changed. But it was always there. It was more
like--" he pauses, searching for an image. "Imagine listening to your
stereo. You can be listening to classical music, or rock or the
traffic report, but it all comes out of the same speaker. So I think
for me it was the question of the volume of the emotion rather than
the quality of it."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge, he says, became "making sure that I didn't stray
from what I felt. I wanted to make sure that I didn't ever lose the
rawness of the emotion"--whatever it might be. "The best book was the
one that strayed least far from the emotions that inspired it."</TE>
<TE>   The story begins at the end--as an over-the-shoulder glance--after
the fictional Jonathan has returned to the States from Lvov and his
trip with Alex, and both are left to unravel mysteries ancient and
new.</TE>
<TE>   Over the miles, a lively correspondence springs up between Alex
and Jonathan. Alex sends letters and a quasi-factual A-to-B retelling
of their trip in his thesaurus-bludgeoned English. Jonathan's
installments unfold as a wild and baroque history of his
grandfather's shtetl from its beginnings to its literal last breath.
As the pages move back and forth, their stories overlap, then blur.
"With our writing, we are reminding ourselves of things," writes
Alex. "We are working on the same story."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is no coincidence that "Everything Is Illuminated" is a
collage of voice, intentions and form. While a student at Princeton
University, Foer conceived and began recruiting writers for a
collection called "A Convergence of Birds" (Distributed Art
Publishers, 2001), an assemblage of ruminations on the curio-filled
boxes of artist Joseph Cornell by writers including Robert Pinsky and
Foer's creative writing teacher, Joyce Carol Oates.</TE>
<TE>   And though the first draft of "Everything Is Illuminated" took
only eight weeks, Foer spent a good part of 21/2 years fine-tuning
his own curio-filled shadow box--carefully choosing details,
arranging things on the page. This meticulous self-editing, he says,
he squeezed between all manner of odd jobs: "tutor, ghost writer,
receptionist. I lived on a farm for six months," he says. "If you can
think of it, I probably did it."</TE>
<TE>   Once the book was done, the former philosophy major tucked it away
and put his mind to other endeavors. "I did nothing for a while," he
says. "I didn't know that I should." He stops for a moment. "I mean,
I wasn't naive, but it never occurred to me that it was a pressing
thing." It may have sat longer had another writer friend not asked
him: "So what is it you do anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   The fast-forward turn of events that followed--the agent, the film
option, translations into 13 languages, the "voice of Gen-Y"
coronation-- flummoxes Foer, who, to hear him tell it, didn't then,
and doesn't quite yet, see himself as a writer per se.</TE>
<TE>   "It never occurred to me that there was something that I or anyone
else would refer to as 'my writing' and that someone would like it,"
says Foer. "But I knew I needed outlets creative outlets And it was
life or death." Before he realized that writing was his outlet,
admits Foer, with a hot bloom of bashfulness passing through his
voice, "I ended up having lots of crushes."</TE>
<TE>   That energy, says Foer's editor, Eric Chinski, felt, even at first
read, fresh, not coy or like Foer was showing off. "It really leaps
off into the realm of the imagination," says Chinski. "He really
trusts his imagination rather than staying so close to what he knows.
He'll try bigger themes and is willing to take risks." Part of that
willingness, explains Chinski, probably has much to do with Foer's
attempts to shrug off the romanticized writer mantle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really important to him to try to deflate this idea that a
writer is in commune with the muses. He sits down every day whether
he's inspired or not--and writes. He sees writing as a dialogue
rather than a monologue A book is a table that two can sit at."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, what finds its way onto the page is
unconventional. And the book's disjointed form has given some readers
pause: "It has frustrated some people," Foer acknowledges. "It
doesn't really resemble traditional storytelling. It's just a
different kind of investment a reader has. My hope was all of these
little images--just as in a collage--all those little images do make
a big picture. Something recognizable. But it will never have the
same kind of unity as, say, a painted portrait. Which is not to say
that it is better or worse."</TE>
<TE>   The world of the fictional Foer has, for the moment, upended the
real Foer's life and tipped it at a new and strange angle. Grateful
for the success, he is keen to reassemble the bits and pieces that
make up his old routines. ("I love the institutions in my
neighborhood: my post office. The Chinese restaurant. The 7 train. My
mailbox.")</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of moving around mentally and physically,"
says Foer with a wistful tinge. "Often, the things I'm most proud of
tend to happen in corners of rooms. In very intimate spaces. When
you're exploring." Stories, just like life, he contends, are not
linear. "I sort of believe that we don't live in a traditional
storytelling manner. The way that we process and experience the world
happens in these little pieces."</TE>

<LD>"The Eminem Show" entered the national album sales chart at No. 1 as
expected Wednesday, but the early release of the CD cost the Detroit
rapper the chance of becoming the first solo artist to have
back-to-back opening-week sales of a million-plus.</LD>
<LD>   Eminem's last album, 2000's "The Marshall Mathers LP," sold 1.76
million copies in its first week in stores, and many retailers
expected the new collection to pass that mark in its first week. But
that goal was lost when Interscope Records, eager to combat
widespread downloading and street piracy of the album, allowed stores
to begin selling the album last weekend instead of waiting until the
scheduled Tuesday release date.</LD>
<LD>   Though most stores apparently began selling the album Sunday, some
retailers reportedly began selling it as early as Friday. Despite
limited publicity about the early release date, fans bought 285,000
copies Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   That figure made "The Eminem Show" an easy winner in the weekly
sales race, according to Nielsen SoundScan, which monitors U.S.
record sales. The runner-up, P. Diddy &amp; Bad Boy Records' "We Invented
the Remix," sold 144,000 copies over seven days. The second-highest
new arrival on the chart was Marc Anthony's "Mended," which sold
111,000 copies and entered at No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is whether Eminem has enough sales punch to sell
a million copies this week. Geoff Mayfield, the savvy director of
charts for Billboard magazine, believes the rapper has a fighting
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a couple of different projections from people I
respect," he said Wednesday. "One camp is projecting it could do
between 925,000 and a million, and the other one is saying it could
do as much as a million and a half this week.</TE>
<TE>   The positive factors in believing the album will sell a million is
that a lot of his fans might not have even known it was on sale last
week. The advertising was all tied to it going on sale Tuesday. Plus,
the album should benefit from Memorial Day sales Monday that wouldn't
have been possible if it went on sale Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "On the downside, the 280,000-plus that sold over the weekend
won't be in this week's tally, and Memorial Day isn't traditionally
one of those long weekends that's great for shopping. People do other
things besides going to record stores over Memorial Day weekend."</TE>
<TE>   The other positions in the Top 10 this week are held, in order, by
Cam'ron, Ashanti, Celine Dion, Musiq, Vol. 9 of "Now That's What I
Call Music," Kenny Chesney and Moby. The best-selling single remains
'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on "Girlfriend."</TE>

<HD>The Fundamental Things Apply</HD>
<DH>Technology is taking a back seat for Patty Griffin, who
offers pure, unadorned music in the CD '1000 Kisses.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patty Griffin likes things simple. The singer-songwriter is not
afraid of machines and computers but is just a little concerned about
her dependence on them, even becoming suspicious of the power windows
in her car. So in her music, she wants to strip things down, to send
the songs back to a basic, intimate core.</LD>
<LD>   It's a feeling reflected in the ballads of her newest album, "1000
Kisses," and a tour that has her subdued, blues-flavored voice
accompanied only by acoustic guitar, mandolin, cello and keyboards.
(She plays tonight at the Troubadour.)</LD>
<LD>   She is not alone, as it turns out. The recent success of the
chart-topping, Grammy-winning film soundtrack of folk and bluegrass
for "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" revealed a wide audience for pure,
unadorned music that Griffin finds encouraging. Like those listeners,
she prefers her music home-grown.</LD>
<TE>   "It's sort of like being able to go out and grow your own food,"
she says. "That kind of music, anybody can do it. You don't need
money. You pick up a guitar and open your mouth and sing. It's
reassuring to me that it's alive and well and of interest to people."</TE>
<TE>   The acclaimed Griffin already has her own dedicated following,
including the likes of Emmylou Harris and the Dixie Chicks, who have
recorded Griffin songs on their albums. Most recently, Griffin's "My
Dear Old Friend" was recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter for the
soundtrack to "We Were Soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin is now with ATO Records (distributed by BMG) after leaving
Interscope, which had absorbed her original label, A&amp;M. "1000
Kisses," which came out last month to the usual critical acclaim, was
recorded last year, mostly in the Nashville basement studio of Doug
Lancio, who co-produced the album with Griffin in search of music
that focused mainly on the emotions within her voice.</TE>
<TE>   One track, the bittersweet "Making Pies," was the one song to
survive from "Summer Bell," a lushly produced album she recorded in
2000 for A&amp;M that was never released. It explores the life of a woman
factory worker dealing with changing life and changing priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell a story with my records," Griffin says. "Growing
up, I felt like I could lie on the floor after everyone had gone to
bed and put some headphones on and listen to an album and be carried
away. It would sort of feed my life."</TE>
<TE>   Artists who have had that effect on Griffin include Rickie Lee
Jones and Bruce Springsteen, whose "Stolen Car" is performed on the
new album.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin was drawn to the Springsteen song, though it was clearly
written from the perspective of a male protagonist, because it
captured "that thing where you feel that you're totally at the end of
your rope. It's hard to get that down in a way that feels real. He
got it, and it's a really amazing song."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin has often performed other writers' songs in her shows, but
"1000 Kisses" is her first album to include material she didn't write
herself. There is also Lonnie Johnson's 1948 R&amp;B hit "Tomorrow Night"
(learned from a 1992 Bob Dylan recording) and "Mil Besos" (Spanish
for "1000 Kisses"), a Tejano ballad recorded at the suggestion of
keyboardist Michael Ramos.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin does not speak Spanish, but Ramos coached her through the
subtle shadings of lyric and inflection, and Griffin found the
exercise liberating.</TE>
<TE>   "It sort of takes you to a different place vocally," she says.
"Different things came out of my voice, things that I hadn't heard
before. I get real excited when someone who's Latino comes up and
gives me the nod on it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1964 in Old Town, Maine, Griffin spent years in the
Northeast before moving to Nashville, then settling into Austin three
years ago. She plans to stay there a while and is now making plans to
begin work on another album next year. But accelerating technology is
already getting her down.</TE>
<TE>   The singer normally tries out the occasional song-in-progress on
stage. "Unfortunately, as soon as I do that, it's on the Internet the
next day," she laments. "It kind of bums me out. It takes the thrill
out of it a little bit--I'm still working on this stuff!"</TE>
<TE>   Griffin may be striving for escape from machines, but her fans at
least are unafraid of computers. "No," she says with a laugh. "They
know how to use it really well."</TE>

<TE>   Singer-poet Patti Smith and artist-folklorist-filmmaker Harry
Smith have more in common than a surname. When Harry met Patti in the
1970s New York avant-garde scene, they struck up a creative
relationship that led, among other things, to her appearance in his
experimental film version of the Brecht-Weill opera "The Rise and
Fall of the City of Mahagonny." So it's fitting that Patti Smith
closes the Getty Center's two-day symposium on the film with a
performance of music and spoken word, accompanied by her son,
Jackson.</TE>

<LD>all day Art</LD>
<LD>   Many a joke has been made about California being a cultural
wasteland (mostly by Easterners). In its inaugural exhibition, the
Pasadena Museum of California Art asserts that California has been a
remarkable source of artistic inspiration. The survey, "On-Ramps:
Transitional Moments in California Art" compiled by four independent
curators, focuses on four important California movements:
Impressionism to Post-Impressionism, Post-Surrealism, Hard-Edge
Abstraction to Finish Fetish, and Bay Area Conceptualism. In
addition, "PUSHALE!" a group show of works dedicated to contemporary
Tijuana artists, will debut in the museum's Classroom Gallery.</LD>

<TE>   Garbage in, Garbage out. That's sort of the way it went for the
band of that name, which arrived with a splash in 1995 but hasn't
managed to break through to wider stardom. As a major cult band,
though, charismatic Scot Shirley Manson and her Midwestern bandmates
are hard to beat, piling on the attitude and excess with seductive
exuberance.</TE>

short "An Eastern Westerner" opens the evening, which concludes with

asked surfers to do what they usually do on their boards--but without
their boards, he says, "so you see it as dance." You'll also see what
he calls "a folk dance" choreographed from a typical style of beach
walking and various board maneuvers. Finally, some lucky townie in
the audience each night will get a surfing lesson from an authentic
Malibu surfing star. In all, it's a 50-minute beach party without the
sunburn.</TE>

<LD>Larry Pollack and Tom Dillon, who cheesed up the Sunset Strip with a
mechanical bull (Sunset Chop House) and shouting sushi chefs
(Miyagi's), have added Rome to their list of campy playhouses. They
had artist Natalie Gray reproduce Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
masterpiece on the restaurant's dome ceiling....</LD>
<LD>   The Parlour Club on Santa Monica Boulevard is off the hook. I
popped in last week and was blown away by Mount Sims, a
DJ-dance-fashion-art collective that's ready for off-Broadway. DJ
Mount Sims, who is totally wired in to his laptop, got the party
started with "techno sexual" beats and dancers, who were (barely)
adorned in Ryan Heffington's punk-rock designs. By the time the
shaving cream came out, I danced off a few pounds. You'll have to
wait until June 11 to see 'em again at Parlour's Sockit night....</LD>
<LD>   Everyone's talking about Ghoul School, the new Wednesday-night
death rock scene at Spike, the gay bar next door to the Parlour. But
I spent last Wednesday at Twine at the Alterknit Lounge. I got to get
jiggy with DJ Meredith Chinn, who was spinning "bastard pop"
bootlegs, and was amazed by multimedia man DJ Joshua Gabriel, who
played bongos and scratched the turntables while his own experimental
film, with insanely cool hand-drawn images, was projected on the
screen.</LD>

<HD>New Sound for Old Movies</HD>
<DH>DJ Thomas Golubic reinterprets classic films by adding a
modern score</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of L.A.'s freshest nightlife events--a mix of classic films and
progressive tunes served up by DJ Thomas Golubic--was born of
questionable manners and small revenge. Thank goodness for bad
behavior.</LD>
<LD>   Several months ago, Golubic, one half of the music supervision
team for HBO's "Six Feet Under," was enjoying a quiet night at home
when three friends dropped by. Not only were they uninvited, Golubic
recalls, "they were not in their right minds." He didn't want his
unexpected guests driving, however, so he plopped them down in front
of the TV. Darren Aronofsky's dark 2000 film, "Requiem for a Dream,"
a favorite of his, was just beginning.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I should turn the sound down and put some music on to
freak them out," Golubic says. He ended up DJ-ing through the final
credits, basically rescoring the film while his friends watched and
listened. "The next day one of my friends called and said, 'Dude,
that was amazing.' So I thought let me try this thing and see if
there's any validity," he says. The result is Synchronize, a free
monthly--sometimes bimonthly--event in the plush, spacious lounge at
West Hollywood's Moomba.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Golubic's impromptu effort at home, these are musically
scripted affairs; he spends hours masterminding in advance. "Most of
the creativity is in how I move from one track to another," he says.
The other difference is that in the club he layers the dialogue over
the music.</TE>
<TE>   Synchronize debuted quietly in March with, appropriately enough,
"Requiem for a Dream." Then came "Blade Runner." Earlier this month,
Golubic rescored Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." About 100
people, most in their late 20s and early 30s and mainly musicians,
industry people, FOTs (friends of Thomas), or some combination
thereof, showed up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful change of pace from the multiplexes," said Amy
Rosen, a music supervisor who attended the screening with a group of
friends. "I hate the prices, the lines, the noise like crying kids.
This is closer in spirit to when our parents went to the movies, like
an event."</TE>
<TE>   But this is not an ultra-hush Writers Guild-style screening
environment. The lights are dimmed but not dark. Candles flicker on
the tables. There's the occasional shake, shake, shake of ice on
metal from the bar as well as the chatter and laughter of friends and
couples who consider the film more atmosphere than focal point.
People wander out to the parking lot for a smoke. But the majority of
the audience sits quietly transfixed, sometimes grooving in their
seats to the music, sipping martinis, cosmos, or red wine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting take, especially for things you've already
seen, because it puts a new perspective on it musically," said Kyle
Schember, who was there with his Rockstar bandmate Ryan Stuit. "And
honestly," Stuit said, "where can you order a New York strip and
watch a movie at the same time?"</TE>
<TE>   Many of the artists featured in the Synchronize rescores can also
be heard on Golubic's weekly late-night radio show, "Swing Shift," on
KCRW-FM (89.9). "2001," for example, included tracks from Groove
Armada, David Sylvian and Holger Czukay, Brian Eno, Radiohead,
Rinocerose, Sigur Ros, Royksopp and DJ Spooky. "I try to avoid music
with lyrics because I really don't want the lyrics to distract you,"
Golubic says. "And I try not to use music that was available at the
time the movie was made."</TE>
<TE>   Among the "2001" audience members who made it to the end of the
often contemplative, nearly 21/2-hour film was Vickie Curea, a
psychotherapist who'd seen it several times before. "I was totally
surprised and pleasantly so," she said. "I thought the way he
interpreted many of the scenes in the film, he heightened the sense
of fun and absurdity." She also appreciated the comfy couch she and
her friend scored by arriving early. "I think that anybody that's a
fan of movies and eclectic music would groove on something like this.
I don't know if it would hit in Fargo, but it would in Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Synchronize will feature "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate
Factory." Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" is slated for next month with
accompaniment from electronic composer George Sarah and a live string
trio. Among the films Golubic is considering for later in the summer
are "Barbarella," "Mad Max" and Jacques Tati's "Playtime." He wants
to do Wim Wender's "Wings of Desire" down the line and the Hong Kong
action flick "The Heroic Trio."</TE>
<TE>   "I choose films that have a very distinctive visual storytelling
approach," Golubic says, "films that are not dialogue- or narrative-
based." He also gravitates to films that have good music to begin
with. After all, where's the challenge in reinterpreting a mess?</TE>
<TE>   Synchronize, tonight, 9 p.m., at Moomba, 665 N. Robertson Blvd.,
West Hollywood. Also June 20, July 25 and Aug. 22. (310) 652-6364.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Marino has had a large Chinese influx in the last 10 years.
Unlike neighboring Arcadia, San Gabriel, Alhambra and Monterey Park,
though, that hasn't generated great Chinese restaurants. The only
game in town is Shanghai Palace.</LD>
<LD>   This decades-old eatery fell, a few years back, into the hands of
John Lieu, a dapper fellow with great respect for the dishes of his
native Shanghai. Lieu replaced the coffee shop booths with beautiful
wooden furniture from China and an abundance of plants. But his real
change was in the kitchen. Once a place for Americanized Chinese
food, Shanghai Palace has developed into a serious Shanghai
restaurant. The subtle cuisine of Shanghai is known for cold dishes,
dumplings and seafood, and a taste for the flavors of soy and star
anise. You'll see both Chinese and non-Chinese enjoying the same
dishes at Shanghai Palace, which is not generally the case in San
Gabriel Valley Chinese restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   Start with a few cold dishes from the appetizer section. The dish
modestly named "celery," for instance: cold, crisp celery stalks
marinated in a perfect balance of sesame oil and chile. "Vegetarian
goose" is a long wrapper of bean curd skin soaked in soy sauce. It's
filled with minced bamboo and shiitake mushrooms. Virtually all the
cold dishes are faultless; the duck feet are pungent and fiery, the
cold beef aromatic with star anise. Some might object to the
wine-marinated chicken, which is slightly undercooked for Western
tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Now try some selections from the "wonton and pastry" corner of the
menu. The steamed dumplings are that glory of Shanghai tea rooms,
shiao lung bao: "little dragon dumplings." The steamer dish is filled
with eight perfect dumplings, precisely pinched at the top. Each has
a soupy minced pork filling and fairly bursts with juice at a touch.
"Shredded roll" is really a twisty raised bun studded with sesame
seeds. The noodles in the filling (combined with shredded pork and
preserved vegetables) have a good al dente bite.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Chinese restaurants in the area, Shanghai Palace has a
huge menu. Some of the best dishes are in the 16-item section headed
"house specials." The house special soup has to be ordered in
advance, and you'd be missing out if you didn't do so. It's basically
made with enormous hunks of whatever fish is fresh that day, usually
tilapia or sea bass, with dried mushrooms and baby bok choy.</TE>
<TE>   Another great dish from this section is "noisette pork pump,"
which Lieu popularized when he ran Lakespring Restaurant in Monterey
Park. The name is really pork rump, but the misspelling has taken
root. It's a luscious braised leg of pork in rich brown gravy.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite from this section is stuffed hen with sticky rice.
It's an oven-roasted Cornish hen crammed with rice, minced pork,
mushrooms and vegetables. When sliced through, it's like a classic
French galantine, but with the surprise of Chinese flavors. The
sauteed spicy shrimp with noodles--fiery shrimp, thick noodles--is a
perfect dish for spring.</TE>
<TE>   There are many noteworthy dishes on this part of the menu, though
a few may be challenging for those new to Shanghai cuisine. Duck
tongue with fresh basil, for instance; it's delicious, but definitely
a grad school subject for the Chinese restaurant-goer. Likewise
sauteed winter melon, flavored with shards of salty Chinese ham.</TE>
<TE>   Some other particularly good dishes are scattered in other
sections of the menu. Meat ball casserole, in the hot pot section, is
fine fatty meatballs in a crock of bean thread noodles and
vegetables. Under seafoods, you'll find the spicy clam with bay leaf:
a pile of fried clams dominated by the flavor of sweet basil. Eight
treasure steamed rice, the quintessential Chinese dessert, is a dome
of sticky rice laced with red dates, candied fruits and chopped
chestnuts.</TE>
<TE>   So San Marino has become a destination city in the Chinese
restaurant sweepstakes, despite having only one worthy entry.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai Palace, 932 Huntington Drive, San Marino. (626) 282-8815.
Lunch and dinner, 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m. daily. Full bar. Street parking.
All major cards. Dinner for two, $23 to $45.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: celery, steamed dumplings, house special soup
(advance order only), noisette pork pump, stuffed chicken with sticky
rice, spicy clam with bay leaf, eight treasure steamed rice.</TE>

<HD>Journey to the Center ofL.A.</HD>
<DH>The point of living in a city always on the move is to do
the same--to see it, sense it, experience it</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who say Los Angeles would be great if it wasn't for all the
driving have missed the point of Los Angeles. This city is all about
the driving. People who say Los Angeles lacks a center have missed
the other point of Los Angeles. They envision white spires,
weathered-green domes and tiled entryways, buildings and streets with
architectural gravitas where men go to make important things happen.
But the world has changed. Gone are the days when the Acropolis, the
Imperial Palace, London's City, D.C.'s Beltway signified the ultimate
centers of power. Now the important things happen en route, over
phone lines, on airplanes, in cars equipped with laptops and
television screens. Los Angeles has always understood this. It has
always been a city of movement, two-thirds energy, one-third mass.
Just look at it on the map.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles is what happened when the American West closed, when
the boots and wagon wheels hit the soft sand and the sea, when people
staggered across the desert or the river and tagged the pueblo like
it was the sanctuary of a cathedral or home base. Safe. This is where
all the rush wound up. People came for gold and land, for jobs and
fame, for one more chance to stay clean, for a shot at the perfect
wave or a decent education. Then they stayed. No wonder rush hour
lasts most of the day.</LD>
<TE>   According to Webster's, the primary definition of "drive" is "to
force to go; urge onward; push forward." To "control the movement of
[an automobile, horse and wagon, locomotive]" ranks fifth. If you
think about it this way, Los Angeles makes perfect sense.</TE>
<TE>   People who say Los Angeles lacks a center are just not paying
attention as they make their way to work or school or the ballgame or
the beach. The center of this city is all around you when you drive.
We who live here should know this by now. We should not apologize for
all the driving, for the distances we traverse to do the simplest
things, any more than New York should apologize for its congested
sidewalks or Moscow its winters. Close your eyes and think of what
Los Angeles is known for. The Sunset Strip, Hollywood Boulevard,
Mulholland Drive, Pacific Coast Highway. To evoke L.A. in a film, all
you need is a three-second shot of a red convertible driving down a
river of asphalt lined with royal palms and laved with sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   You really don't even need the car.</TE>
<TE>   From downtown to the beach, the city is strung west to east with
such streets, some of them boulevards; others, avenues. Their names
stack up as shiny and sweet as a roll of new dimes. Venice, Pico,
Olympic and Wilshire, Santa Monica, Melrose, Beverly, then Fountain,
Franklin, Hollywood and Sunset. Further north there's Ventura,
Victory, Burbank and Foothill. They are latticed by north-south
streets and avenues, some of which run the entire vertical length of
the city. A few, under one name or another, run from the Valley to
the sea. Garfield, Eastern, Alameda and Vermont, Virgil, Crenshaw and
Western, La Brea, Fairfax, Crescent Heights and Robertson. In the
west, the streets slant, like the shoreline, like the sunlight;
Sawtelle, Centinela, Culver and Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   To an Angeleno, the names are as familiar as the kids in homeroom,
some as well-known as family. You will rarely hear an Angeleno use
the words "street" or "avenue" or "boulevard"; we are on a first-name
basis with our thoroughfares. Each has its own mood, purpose,
persona. If Melrose is a night-blooming club kid, then Beverly is her
older, more serene auntie and Pico their plain-talking neighbor who
can fix anything on wheels. Our streets evoke the same range of
emotions our circles of friends do--we love Fountain and hate Santa
Monica; even after all the years, National remains a mystery and San
Fernando is as uninteresting as it is dependable.</TE>
<TE>   If you live in Los Angeles long enough, you will sometimes catch
yourself choosing your route out of desire, out of mood, rather than
expediency. Has it been a while since you've slid along the stately
corridor of Wilshire or crested the commercial sprawl of 3rd Street?
Do you need to follow the taproot of La Brea from the 10 to the
Hollywood Hills or, even better, follow Western through the guts of
the city as it makes all stops from Griffith Park to San Pedro?</TE>
<TE>   On the longer streets you get more than a tour of the city, you
get the world. Count the languages on the signs as you go south on
Vermont, east on Olympic. On one sidewalk, women in purdah pass by
men wearing black leather hip-huggers and makeup; on another, a clot
of TV executives makes way for a hand-holding string of Catholic
schoolkids while, nearby, men in flannel shirts lean against a
chain-link fence and smoke, waiting for daywork.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Los Angeles move you from one place to another
faster than any thoroughfare in the world. Even in gridlock. In the
space of two blocks, razor-wired car-tow lots give way to emerald
aprons of grass and $2-million houses; the canyon roads take you from
Beverly Hills up and over a sudden hilly wilderness then into the
suburban serenity of the Valley in less than 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   You can follow Sunset, too often pared down in the collective
imagination to the cluttered playroom of the Strip, from the cliffs
of the Pacific Palisades all the way to downtown where it turns into
Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. No Californian should leave this world
without doing it at least once. There are moments of splendid
vistas--some, like Mulholland or PCH, are well known. Others take you
by surprise. When turning onto the top of Vermont or any of its
north-south companions, there is the breath-catching moment before
descent, like the split-second before the drop on a water flume ride.
The city rolls out in front of you, a three-dimensional tapestry
glittering with movement, and whoosh, here you go.</TE>
<TE>   When you drive you can see different stages of the city's history
pushed together, overlapping in places, like layers of shale and
sandstone, like a presence of an ancient Roman wall beneath the ruins
of a medieval castle beneath a modern bank. Burrowing through the
western end of Venice Boulevard, you see the former vacation
bungalows of rich inlanders next to once-dirt-cheap artist lofts all
surrounded by the tourist mecca dream of Abbot Kinney, which now
lends "charm" to the million-dollar refurbs of canal-side condos.</TE>
<TE>   Every city has streets and scenery and neighborhoods that change
with time, but in Los Angeles it's possible to move through five
ethnic neighborhoods, and two weather systems, on the way to the
mall. And the moving itself is key--impossibly, the center holds
because it is not stationary, it is not static. The bones of this
city are still soft. L.A. is young enough to be mesmerized by the
sound of keys jingling, to lie and say, "we're out of milk," just for
the opportunity to grab those keys and go. It doesn't really matter
where. All the wheres are interesting when you're moving.</TE>
<TE>   Fantasies are woven behind the windshield, resentments listed,
avowals made and broken in the length of a stoplight. Likewise,
people say things to each other in the car that they would never say
in the office, or the bedroom, because driving is a world unto
itself. You are in a metal bubble, you are in a place neither here
nor there. Things said or done seem less tied to reality; they might
stick, they might not. What happens in the car exists outside the
rules applied to public and private behavior--driving, you are
somewhere in between. You are ever in the act of leaving or of going.
The difference is not always clear.</TE>
<TE>   Even the art form of this city requires movement, distance--a
mural seen up close or gazed at like a portrait makes no sense. Only
from the street, and in passing, is its beauty revealed.</TE>
<TE>   We need to remember this as we face down our commutes and complain
about the lack of left-turn signals, the inexplicable narrowing of
lanes. We need to pay attention to what is passing, within and
without, to take back the streets of our city, of our collective

<LD>The Boulevards</LD>
<LD>   Almost any L.A. street more than 15 blocks long travels through
space, history and the city's socioeconomic spectrum. Here are a few
that do so spectacularly:</LD>
<LD>   Wilshire Boulevard. Take it from its origins downtown all the way
to the ocean and you'll get a sense of how the city moved from the
pueblo to the sea, with stops at the tar pits and Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Western Avenue. From Los Feliz Boulevard to the cliffs overlooking
San Pedro, Western is, according to Guinness, the longest "straight"
street in the U.S. A drive down or up exposes the layers of L.A. like
a knife through a wedding cake.</TE>
<TE>   Mission to Huntington to Del Mar. A street that begins just across
the river from the original pueblo, cuts through the urban
neighborhoods of Lincoln Heights, El Sereno and Monterey Hills before
cruising through semiprecious South Pasadena on its way to the
moneyed mansions of San Marino. All in a half-hour drive.</TE>
<TE>   Sunset Boulevard. Sunset begins in the leafy rim of the Palisades
and wriggles along the top of Westwood, Beverly Hills and Hollywood
before descending through Echo Park to downtown. Crossing the 110, it
becomes Cesar Chavez, a seven-mile street created in 1994 from
Sunset, Brooklyn Avenue and Macy Street, which shoots through
downtown and into East L.A. until it hits Riggin just southeast of
East L.A. College.</TE>
<TE>   La Brea Avenue. From Inglewood into the Hollywood Hills, La Brea
has great views of the vista variety (coming through the gap in
Baldwin Hills, you can see the entire L.A. Basin on a clear day) and
the cultural variety (the motor inns and small bungalows on the
blocks that hug the 10 were built for the folks who came for work or
a visit and decided to stay).</TE>
<TE>   Topanga Canyon. It is possible, on a summer's day, to exit the 101
in Woodland Hills onto Topanga under a sun so bright and brutal that
the air above the road shakes with heat, and in less than half an
hour slide into a chilly fog rising from the ocean just before
Topanga dumps you onto PCH. At any time of year it is an absolutely
gorgeous road, but if you have a tendency toward carsickness, stay
out of the passenger seat.</TE>
<TE>   Coldwater Canyon. Like Topanga, Coldwater runs from the Valley
over the hills. But on Coldwater, the journey from thriving suburbia
through sudden wild woodlands into placid Beverly Hills is a much
more pronounced narrative arc.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson Boulevard from National to Santa Monica is a short but
interesting drive. It runs along the border of two distinct
neighborhoods--Beverly Hills and West Hollywood--and clearly
delineates the difference between them and the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's guide to getting across town from east to west: Los
Feliz to Franklin, Franklin to Sierra Bonita, Sierra Bonita to
Hollywood, Hollywood to Laurel Avenue to Fountain to Crescent Heights
to wherever you were planning to go.</TE>
<TE>   Scenic Freeways</TE>
<TE>   As oxymoronic as it sounds, there are a few non-surface-street
routes with poetic merit.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Freeway (or the 110 from downtown to Pasadena). Famously
the first freeway to be completed in L.A., it was intentionally made
winding so motorists, sailing along at a majestic top speed of 35
mph, would not get bored. Anything but boring when traveled with
those who do it daily, it offers an early, Studebaker-and-fedora
version of a metropolis whose main arteries would be landscaped and
filigreed with graceful bridges and innocuous on- and offramps.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Freeway (Highway 2). Beginning just north of downtown off
Glendale Boulevard, this virtually raises the motorist up and out of
urban sprawl and into the Verdugo Hills. Follow it as it becomes the
210 and heads through La Canada and into Pasadena, and you'll
understand the term "foothill community." Traveling north to south,
you will glimpse downtown, faraway and improbable, like the turrets
of a fairy-tale castle in the forest. Yet you can be there in 15
minutes. Unreal.</TE>
<TE>   The 105 East to the 110 North  (carpool lane). It only lasts a few
minutes, but as the carpool lane rises and hooks left like a ribbon
pulled taut, all of Los Angeles is visible (on a semi-clear day). At
sunset it is extraordinary. The perfect welcome for any visitor who
fears all of Los Angeles will resemble the Tom Bradley Terminal.
Continue on the 110 and, ducking under the various interchanges of
the 10, you will see what a generation ago was considered a vision of
the world's future.</TE>
<TE>   The 118 from the 405 to the 34. One minute you're in Mission
Hills, the next surrounded by a golden ruptured landscape right out
of the Old Testament. This is Steinbeck country, where beauty is born
of chaos and endurance. Even the "Welcome to Simi Valley" sign seems
symbolic of humanity's own upheavals.</TE>
<TE>   Night Drives</TE>
<TE>   These are drives that are more illuminating in the dark than in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Coast Highway from the 10 up through Malibu. During the
day, this stretch of road is often bumper to bumper and pocked with
construction. Yes, the sea glitters dutifully and the sand beckons,
but all the development--the restaurants and gas stations and
oceanfront condos--makes it a bit tacky. At night, however, much of
this blurs into darkness, and you are left with the moon on water,
the pearly shine of the beach and a string of lights running up the
coast like tiki torches at a party.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland Drive. Day or night, one of the best drives in the
country, or the world, but you really must see it at night, when the
Valley spreads out like a blanket of stars.</TE>
<TE>   Melrose Avenue. By day, the infamously hip stretch between La Brea
and Fairfax is beginning to show its age--a bit too yearningly
commercial, a bit too made over. But at night it still blooms with
Popsicle-colored neon, the light of cafes and window displays, and
the hopeful beams of headlights.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 to the 110 through downtown. For about three minutes (20 if
there's a Dodger game), Los Angeles looks like a dream city, like
Metropolis after Superman has restored peace and justice. And then
you hit the 5 interchange and it's all over.</TE>
<TE>   The 405 to the 101. Traveling in either direction, the stretch of
the 405 between the 10 and the 101 is an adventure at night. (During
the day, you might as well walk.) Coming south, the hills that
separate the Valley from the basin make themselves felt as you hurtle
through the darkness. But no matter how fast you're going, everyone
else is going faster. Heading north, you climb, but there are several
minutes at the crest when you see that famous grid of lights and the
101 cutting through it, and it looks just like magic.</TE>

<DH>Costello, embracing rock again, battles sound woes in a
charming blend of recent songs and favorites.</DH>

<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You must all be singing majors," Elvis Costello said to his audience
Tuesday at UCLA's Ackerman Grand Ballroom, gently teasing the crowd
after luring it into a sing-along on one of his new songs, "Tart."</LD>
<LD>   This geniality was a far cry from whatever was eating Costello
that night in the late '70s when he stormed off the stage of the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and ended the show after a few songs
(something about the audience not getting the point). But the
evening's overall energy might not have matched the night in 1978 at
the Hollywood High School Auditorium when his concert was recorded
for a promotional disc.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Ackerman will be filed with those memorable events because
it was billed as Costello's first dance hall show in 20 years. (It
was a late addition to the performer's term as UCLA's "artist in
residence," a position that has now been extended into next season
after his spotty service--in part due to recording a new album--over
the past year.) And it did have its character and its charms.</LD>
<TE>   The latter flowed from the veteran singer-songwriter's recent
return to raw rock 'n' roll after several years of slumming with
old-line pop icons (Tony Bennett, Burt Bacharach), classical
collaborators (mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, the Brodsky
Quartet) and various genres (jazz with the Charles Mingus Orchestra,
a still-pending ballet score).</TE>
<TE>   The new album, "When I Was Cruel," has been embraced as the
47-year-old Englishman's strongest work since his late-'70s heyday,
and it does seem like a conscious effort to shed all subsequent
influences and home in on the mix of verbal alacrity, pop catchiness
and rock intensity that once made Costello the hottest thing around.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, such "Cruel" songs as "45," "15 Petals," "Tear Off Your
Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution)" and "Dust" slid in easily among
the classics Tuesday. In fact, they shaped and dominated the show,
allowing the singer-guitarist to evoke the golden era without
embalming the show in nostalgia. It helped that he was accompanied by
a three-piece band, the Imposters, that's essentially his old
Attractions, with a different bassist, Davey Farragher, joining
drummer Pete Thomas and keyboardist Steve Nieve.</TE>
<TE>   Costello didn't seem to tailor the set to the idea of a dance
hall. He devoted long stretches to slow and mid-tempo material that
emphasized his soulful touch and emotional range. The new album's
vampy title song segued perfectly into "Clowntime Is Over," a
balladic one-two punch that risked losing the crowd's attention but
ended up as a spellbinding epic.</TE>
<TE>   In the new songs, Costello also returns to his signature themes,
depicting personal relationships and social-political arrangements as
tense battlegrounds teeming with deceivers and manipulators. These
scenarios, in such songs as "Dust" and "Alibi," inspired especially
vehement vocals from one of rock's most distinctive singers.</TE>
<TE>   The show's sonic character was more a mixed bag, thanks to its
placement in the giant shoebox of the student union ballroom. The
sound sometimes clumped together like a ball of mud, then seemed to
scatter in different directions. Frequencies bounced off the flat,
squared surfaces, and there was always the disconcerting sensation
that an additional drummer sat tapping away at the back of the room.
The Kodak Theatre, where Costello plays tonight, has taken some heat
for its sound, but there's nothing like Ackerman.</TE>
<TE>   But it also sounded exhilarating and real, Costello's vocals were
surprisingly audible, and the old-fashioned, un-slick feel (there
weren't even any spotlights that could follow him when he stalked
around the stage) suited the twang and snarl of the distorted attack.</TE>

<HD>A Bon Voyage at $1 a Kayak</HD>
<DH>Rentals at Lake Balboa and Hansen Dam are priced to
encourage potential paddlers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After would-be kayakers find out about the buck-a-use kayak rentals
at Lake Balboa in Van Nuys, they always seem to be waiting for the
catch, the secret behind the plan designed to get more people
paddling on the 27-acre man-made body of water.</LD>
<LD>   "People are skeptical about the program," says Jon Kopitzke,
aquatic facilities manager at the lake run by the Los Angeles
Department of Recreation and Parks, because comparable rentals can
start at $20 an hour. "We designed it to remove barriers. They keep
waiting for the 'but.' We tried to make this something where there
was no 'but' to it."</LD>
<LD>   But it's not quite as simple as handing over a greenback and
hopping onto one of the half-dozen kayaks for rent. New paddlers must
complete a 10-minute safety swim at any city-operated pool (and pay
the $1.25 pool admission fee) and take a two-hour kayak fitness
orientation class that costs $15. After buying a 25-use punch pass
for $25, they are good to go.</LD>
<TE>   Only about 15 people a week rent boats through the 4-year-old
program, though about 250 paddlers have completed the kayaking class,
which covers basic paddling technique and familiarizes fledgling
boaters with using the sit-on-top kayaks on Lake Balboa.</TE>
<TE>   "Kayaking is easy, but it's important to do it properly. The
proper technique uses most of the body, and it moves the boat
better," says Terry Valle, a certified whitewater instructor who
teaches at Lake Balboa and Hansen Dam, where a similar program began
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kayaking at Hansen Dam in Lake View Terrace is akin to "paddling
on a pond," since the lake is a comparatively small 9 acres, says
Gilbert Alvarez, manager of the aquatics facility also run by the
Department of Recreation and Parks. Another difference--while Lake
Balboa's water is reclaimed, Hansen Dam's is fresh, so techniques
such as rolling over that require falling in water can be practiced.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday in early May, my family and I set out to test the
kayaking waters at Lake Balboa. We don't have to bother with the
training sessions offered the first Saturday of every month because I
own a tandem kayak, a gift from my husband for one of those crisis
birthdays that end in a zero.</TE>
<TE>   We do have to deal with tethering the kayak to the top of our
Jeep. The 16-mile trip east on the Ventura Freeway seems
excruciatingly long, filled with high anxiety over the mere
possibility the boat could wrench itself free. Suddenly, the idea of
jumping into a public pool fully clothed and taking a paddling class
to qualify to use a kayak that's already there seems remarkably
sensible. At least when you lug along your own boat, kayaking at Lake
Balboa is free.</TE>
<TE>   We pull into Anthony C. Beilenson Park, the 80-acre recreation
area that encircles Lake Balboa, and follow the road that snakes
around to the launch ramp. Once afloat, my 11-year-old son and I
paddle around the lake, loosely shaped like a clover. His goal seems
to be to splash me with as much reclaimed water as possible while
counting the low-flying planes heading toward Van Nuys Airport.</TE>
<TE>   We study cloud formations and flocks of birds before my son
switches places with my 14-year-old daughter, who was on the lake
with my husband in one of the pedal boats that rent for $10 an hour.
She and I head toward the cascade, where mechanically and chemically
treated water pours over rocks into the lake. One other lone kayaker
shares our space.</TE>
<TE>   The soothing sound of rushing water fools us into feeling as if
we're on vacation until we are jolted by the sight of a bloated rat
floating nearby. I'm thankful my daughter's co-piloting instead of my
son, who bemoans his bad luck for missing the rodent sighting.
(Floating rats are not common, Kopitzke assures me later.)</TE>
<TE>   After my husband takes a solo spin, we pack up the kayak and give
the kids a couple of dollars to squander on the lake's other
dollar-a-pop program--the ice cream man. We've taken longer to load
and unload the kayak than the 45 minutes we spent on the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Hauling a kayak to the lake is a lot like getting stuck in
gridlock en route to the gym. "If you have to drive an hour and a
half to work out for 45 minutes, you probably won't do it," Kopitzke
says. "With our program, you don't have to worry about car-topping
the boat. You just show up and the boat is there. It becomes a lot
more accessible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kayaking from 9 a.m. to an hour before sunset at Lake Balboa, 6300
Balboa Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 756-9743. Next orientation session is
Saturday. Monthly ocean-touring classes begin June 16. Minimum age
for classes is 12.</TE>
<TE>   Kayaking from sunrise to an hour before sunset at Hansen Dam
Aquatic Center, 11798 Foothill Blvd., Lake View Terrace, (818)
899-3779. Introductory, advanced and ocean kayaking classes offered.</TE>

<LD>* The singer and bassist for the rock band KISS has also developed a
new magazine called Gene Simmons' Tongue, which debuts in June.</LD>
<LD>   Craving Cake: I like the Grill in the middle of Beverly Hills for
lunch. It's a film sort of hangout. I also like Mr. Chow for lunch.
Usually, I eat I've-got-to-watch-my-girlish- figure-type food because
when I finish a meal, I get a really bad sweet tooth. Food doesn't
really do all that much for me. I don't have pasta or butter or any
of that stuff. However, I am thoroughly addicted to sweets, but not
all kinds. I particularly crave Viennese cakes and bapka. Bapka is a
kind of heavy pastry, like a Danish. Imagine an entire cake with that
consistency. I get that at Jewish bakeries. Canter's on Fairfax is
terrific because before you walk into the restaurant, you have to
pass that gantlet of pastry.</LD>
<LD>   Bowling for Danish: I love bowling, especially at the alley next
to Jerry's Deli in the Valley, because you can go in and bowl and
then go next door and gorge on pastries. You see, it always comes
back to pastries and Danishes.</LD>
<TE>   Kid Time: I have two kids--two that I know of--and I've got to
spend time with them too. We do real cornball things. We eat
together. We talk over the day's stuff. When my daughter gets into
her I-gotta-get-to-sleep mode, then I tell her stories almost every
night. When we go out, I take them bowling or to Benihana, very few
exotic things. They don't come on tour with me. I mean, they have for
one or two shows, but it's not the place for kids.</TE>
<TE>   Clean Living: My life is my recreation, but as far as working out,
I go to Billy Blanks to do my cardio for an hour. That will knock me
out. Or I climb up Runyon Canyon, that mountaintop in Hollywood,
right off of Fuller near Franklin. I don't smoke, never have, and I
don't drink alcohol. I have never been drunk in my life.</TE>
<TE>   More About Cake: Sundays, if I have a meeting, I like the Bel-Air
Hotel, the little garden out there. They make great granola and they
do it right there on the spot, so it's fresh. They put blueberries in
it. Love that. And of course, they have great cake. The guy who
invents cake that tastes like a great Danish, and which is actually
nonfat, is going to be very rich. I'll make sure of that. I worship
cake. Jews tend to, you know. It's not about, "Hey man, do you want
to go get a drink?" I don't think Jews say "man" or talk about drinks
too much. It's more about cake.</TE>

<LD>   J.B. --Potent theatricality has always overridden the textual
pretensions of "J.B.," and so it proves in the current Buffalo Nights
production. Although Archibald MacLeish's 1959 Pulitzer Prize-winning
retelling of the Book of Job has nothing on King James, director
Brian Kite and his exuberant company achieve considerable impact.
MacLeish's verse drama utilizes a circus setting, placing two clowns
(Gibson Frazier and Marco Sanchez) in the roles of God and Satan, who
wreak havoc upon the title character (Michael Goorjian) in successive
vignettes, interrupted by an offstage prompter (voiced by Victor
Garber) of metaphysical import. Kite's energetic staging is
thankfully light-handed, deftly offsetting the author's plummy
excesses.</LD>

<LD>   Baby Shakespeare. Baby Einstein Company/Walt Disney Home
Entertainment. 101 minutes. Infants and toddlers. DVD: $20. (800)
793-1454. www.baby einstein.com</LD>
<LD>   The name of this company may suggest that the creation of infant
geniuses is but a click of the remote away. These carefully crafted
videos and DVDs, however, are best viewed as an exploration of
sights, sounds and communication through shared play and learning
between babies and adult caregivers. Here, an imaginative "Theater"
section is divided into 30 short segments featuring puppets, toys,
real children, gentle animation, poems by Wadsworth, Shakespeare,
Langston Hughes, Tennessee Williams, Robert Frost and others, with
excerpts of works by Beethoven.</LD>
<TE>   The "Concert Hall" portion of the DVD is for listening without
visuals, with snippets of Beethoven divided into "A Concert for
Little Ears," "Bedtime" and "Playtime." The poems are recited again
with accompanying photos in an "Exhibition Center."</TE>

<TE>   Video</TE>
<TE>   Just the Facts: The Human Body--Musculoskeletal System. Goldhil
Video. 50 minutes. $20. Ages 8 to adult. (800) 250-8760.</TE>
<TE>   This lab-coat tour of bones and muscles is informative but dry,
like school films of decades past. There is some live action, a few
animated illustrations and doctors with pens for pointers talking on
camera while holding or manipulating real skeletons and artificial
anatomical visual aids: "We have similar movements in the
extremities--" "If we look in the region of the nasal area--"</TE>
<TE>   A comparison between the skeletons of babies and adults is a bit
haunting, but interesting, and it's amazing to see the many bones
that make up the skull taken apart like a puzzle. Still, a needed
spark of wonder is missing from this worthy reference tool. There's a
hint of it only when one expert's sudden rush of enthusiasm takes her
beyond pedantry into poetry: with the air of sharing a delightful
secret, she takes apart a skull to reveal how one facial bone looks
like "a big butterfly."</TE>
<TE>   Angelina Ballerina: Rose Fairy Princess. HIT Entertainment. 48
minutes. Ages 3 to 8. VHS: $15. DVD: $17. (866) 587-1778.
www.angelinaballerina.com</TE>
<TE>   The little mouse with a grand passion for ballet, star of the
hugely popular books by author Katharine Holabird and illustrator
Helen Craig, is now the star of a new video series, as well as a new
weekly PBS series.</TE>
<TE>   Animated by Grand Slamm Children's Films and produced by HIT
Entertainment, Angelina's transition to the small screen does her
creators proud, with a rainbow palette of soft colors, and finely
drawn background art filled with charming detail, from fabric
patterns, vases of flowers and painted china to the grand decor of a
theater.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, the simple stories that teach impulsive Angelina
various life lessons--conquering her fears, being sensitive to
others, not giving up--feature a spot-on British voice cast, headed
by Oscar-winner Dame Judi Dench as ballet teacher Miss Lilly and
Dench's real-life daughter, Finty Williams, in the title role.</TE>
<TE>   In this four-episode video series, Angelina lands a coveted "Rose
Fairy Princess" ballet role, loses track of her young cousin at the
fair, almost misses out on a performance by her ballet idols, and has
an unfortunate encounter with a prize-winning cauliflower.</TE>

<HD>Vigilantism's New Face</HD>
<DH>The characters taking justice into their hands are more
Everyman than Superman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAEL LOWENSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Everyone has a limit," warns the tag line for "Enough," the new
thriller that stars Jennifer Lopez as a battered woman who decides to
get back at her abusive husband. In recent months, movies and
television are offering us visions of what happens when everyday
people reach that limit. A clear trend in post-Sept. 11 entertainment
is that protagonists, mistrustful of incompetent bureaucracy and law
enforcement agencies, opt to take justice into their own hands.</LD>
<LD>   From the spectacular HMO rebellion of "John Q" to the
crowd-pleasing vengeance of "Enough" to the gritty amorality of the
new FX drama "The Shield," vigilante justice is becoming an
entertainment staple with implications beyond those of the
prototypical Stallone and Schwarzenegger hero-outside-the-system
cliche. As the award-winning drama "In the Bedroom" illustrated so
poignantly last year, the 21st century vigilante is more an Everyman
than a Superman.</LD>
<LD>   These are not steroid-pumped testosterone fantasies, but real
people dealing with real problems by taking measures to redress
wrongs that have been done to them and their loved ones. And it is no
accident that this year's vigilante films all deal with issues that
have received a great deal of recent media exposure.</LD>
<TE>   As though timed in anticipation of Lopez's "Enough," Gov. Gray
Davis recently allowed the parole of Cheryl Sellers, a woman
convicted of murdering her abusive husband. This was only the second
time in 85 parole reviews that Davis had allowed a convicted murderer
to be released. But, as Sellers' lawyer noted, "We're in an electoral
season," and this is a very popular issue. The issue is popular
because, from women like Sellers who take justice into their own
hands to women like Nicole Brown Simpson who are failed in life and
in death by the legal system, it has become increasingly clear that
battered women are not adequately protected by the rules that be.</TE>
<TE>   The system's failure to provide protection is ostensibly what
propels Lopez's Slim first to run and hide from her abusive husband
Mitch (Billy Campbell) and later to use his own tactics against him.
Molding herself into a cold and calculating fighting machine trained
in the Israeli martial art Krav Maga, Lopez acts out the ultimate
vigilante fantasy. Nowhere is that fantasy more evident than in the
audience's cheers as Slim finally gives Mitch the beating to end all
beatings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the notion of an abused wife bent on vengeance is
nothing new. Once the province of TV movies like "The Burning Bed,"
it has been dramatized to varying degrees of success in films like
"Sleeping With the Enemy" and "Double Jeopardy." But seldom has such
a film tapped a cultural nerve as effectively and unapologetically as
does "Enough." Never in the movie does Lopez so much as report her
husband to the police: It is as if her mistrust of authority and
vigilante revenge are already pre-justified in the minds of the
public by cultural touchstone stories like those of Nicole Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of the infamous O.J. trial, it is impossible when
watching "In the Bedroom" not to recollect the death of Ron Goldman
and the very public mourning by his father, Fred Goldman. Millions of
Americans were witness to not only Goldman's rage but also his
outrage, his sense that the system does not work. As we watch
"Bedroom's" shattered Tom Wilkinson metamorphose into a man capable
of avenging his murdered son (and violate his own code of ethics in
the process), there is a sense of both catharsis and loss.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Bedroom's" Wilkinson, Denzel Washington's title character in
"John Q" is not imbued with special powers or abilities. John is
simply a loving father who will do whatever it takes to give his son
the life-saving heart transplant that the hospital, citing inadequate
insurance coverage, has refused.</TE>
<TE>   In so doing, Washington also taps into current cultural anguish
and accomplishes at least on an individual basis something that
President Clinton publicly failed to accomplish in his eight years in
office--health-care reform.</TE>
<TE>   And just as J. Lo's newfound strength galvanizes the audience
watching "Enough," a cheer inevitably erupts in theaters with John's
announcement, "The hospital's under new management now. Free health
care for everyone!"</TE>
<TE>   These are not movies of prefabricated Rambo-esque revenge, but
rather ones that tap into the public's outrage about real social
problems that our civic leaders have been unwilling or unable to
solve. In Los Angeles, perhaps the most pertinent civic issue of
recent years has concerned the integrity and reliability of our
police force. From Rodney King to the Rampart scandal, there is a
growing sense that law enforcement is at best corrupt and at worst
incompetent.</TE>
<TE>   This concern is also reflected on Fox's breakout new hit "The
Shield." The hero of the show, Michael Chiklis' Vic Mackey, is a kind
of the postmillennial version of Dirty Harry. With Eastwood's Harry,
you always knew whose side you were on: He was tall, handsome and
always did the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   Chiklis, on the other hand, is like Hobbes' description of life:
nasty, brutish and short. He's a balding, adulterous bully just as
likely to shoot another cop as a bad guy, and the show positively
dares you to like him. Yet like him you do, for one reason and one
reason only: He gets results. Have the events of Sept. 11 changed the
way Americans think about vigilante justice? When President Bush
diverged from his scripted material last fall and declared that he
wanted Bin Laden and his cronies "dead or alive," adding that he was
prepared to "smoke 'em out of their caves," he was criticized by some
who suggested that leaders should not be John Wayne-type vigilantes
who get their man at any price.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the public's reaction to Bush's performance was to give him
the highest approval ratings of any president in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the president has proved unable to follow through on
those initial promises, and his approval ratings are beginning to dip
even as ratings for shows like "The Shield" continue to go up; we are
drawing upon fictional heroes for role models capable of solving
everyday problems.</TE>
<TE>   For that, perhaps, is finally what the fantasy of vigilantism is
all about: simple efficacy, the ability and the will to do what needs
to be done. Politicians may talk about morality and integrity and
character, but if today's entertainment trends are any indication,
Americans will happily settle for conviction and competence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet therein lies the rub. While "In the Bedroom" illustrated the
tragic psychological cost of a citizen taking the law into his own
hands, movies like the post-Sept. 11 "Enough" are glossing over what
is lost and focusing solely on the triumphant catharsis of
retribution. As Juliette Lewis' character asserts so memorably in the
climactic sound bite justifying J. Lo's decision to ignore police
help and take matters into her own hands, "You have a divine animal
right to protect yourself and your offspring." She does not add,
however, that the thing that has long separated human societies from
those of other animals is precisely the rule of law.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Up in the hilltop cemetery, the dead are pondering how they spent
their lives, and their thoughts, catching on the breeze, float down
to the living.</LD>
<LD>   Funny, shocking, disquieting and reassuring, their stories, as
told in "Spoon River Anthology," have captivated a couple of
generations of Los Angeles theatergoers. A 40th-anniversary revival
at Theatre West assures that another generation is about to join
them.</LD>
<LD>   An adaptation of Edgar Lee Masters' poems, "Spoon River" was
devised by Theatre West co-founder Charles Aidman and given its
premiere by the company in 1962. The following year, the show
traveled to Broadway and helped establish Los Angeles as a birthing
place for important new plays.</LD>
<TE>   Two original cast members, Betty Garrett and Joyce Van Patten,
have directed the current production, and a third, Naomi Caryl, is
musical director.</TE>
<TE>   To resurrect the dead of a small Illinois town, the staging
employs theater's simplest yet most potent magic. On an almost bare
stage, four actors--Lee Meriwether, Bridget Hanley, Drew Katzman and
Abbott Alexander--portray as many as 18 characters apiece. Aside from
minor costume adjustments, the actors make their transformations
entirely through variations of demeanor, voice and posture.</TE>
<TE>   Interspersed among the stories are folk songs (some traditional,
some written by Aidman and Caryl) performed by singer-guitarists Andy
Taylor and Jane George.</TE>
<TE>   The performances are uniformly excellent, but Meriwether (one-time
Miss America and "Barnaby Jones" co-star) is particularly riveting.
With a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, she is Dora Williams, wife to
rich husbands who die under mysterious circumstances, while, suffused
with selfless devotion, she is old-maid schoolteacher Emily Sparks,
who urges a young charge toward greatness.</TE>
<TE>   Hanley, meanwhile, is at once majestic and haggard as Margaret
Fuller Slack, compelled by marriage and motherhood to give up her
dream of becoming a writer. Alexander is chagrined as Archibald
Higbie, who travels the world trying to rid himself of Spoon River,
yet finds it's an inescapable part of who he is. And Katzman is
transported with joy as Willie Metcalf, a boy of inauspicious
beginnings who finds life's greatest treasure in the town's natural
wonders.</TE>
<TE>   The show's quiet wisdom is often reminiscent of Thornton Wilder's
"Our Town." Like that great play, "Spoon River" doesn't so much grab
you by the lapels as quietly slip an arm around your waist and give
you a gentle, reassuring squeeze.</TE>

<LD>* New this week: "Slackers" is a standard-issue undergrad gross-out
comedy notable only for the showy role it provides Jason Schwartzman,
well remembered as "Rushmore's" geeky high school student Max
Fischer. Schwartzman, a short, stocky Energizer bunny, is the
irrepressible Ethan, who's smart yet hopelessly square, relentlessly
obnoxious and fearlessly persistent. After catching a trio of
graduating seniors cheating, he blackmails them into promising to
land him the girl of his dreams (James King). Unfortunately, the
three are so sleazy and shallow and take up so much screen time that
"Slackers" is a turnoff despite Schwartzman's considerable talents.</LD>

<LD>Beth Orton's filmy, pale slip dress outlined her thin frame Tuesday
at the House of Blues, creating an impression of veiled vulnerability
that reflected the barely concealed raw emotions behind her lush,
electronica-infused mix of folk and jazz.</LD>
<LD>   The English singer-songwriter garnered attention in the mid-'90s
for blending acoustic and techno music, but the themes of melancholy,
restlessness and need in her work have endured the hype. Tuesday's
performance revealed an adept grasp of her hybrid style, as you'd
expect from an artist whose forthcoming album, "Daybreaker" (due July
30), features contributions from the English electronic team the
Chemical Brothers as well as country-informed U.S. singers Ryan Adams
and Emmylou Harris.</LD>
<LD>   Playing guitar and crooning in a plaintive-to-soulful voice, Orton
lightened the often somber two-hour set with between-song banter. Her
backing sextet included cello, double bass, and violin--the better to
achieve an organic sound that was surprisingly free of mechanism
despite the electronic textures. She previewed new tunes such as
"Concrete Sky" and "God Song" but also offered many older favorites,
much to the capacity crowd's delight.</LD>
<TE>   Contrast played a part in such memorable moments as "Pass in
Time," where her voice's ragged edge belied the feeling of peace
found in ruminating on her mother's death, and the solo acoustic turn
on "Feel to Believe," which downplayed the frustrated agony of the
words.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all the dreamy atmospherics, the watercolor washes of
emotion might have become tedious to those seeking strong hooks or
melodies. But Orton made up for that with her understated yet
powerful way of finding strength in emotional adversity.</TE>

<DH>A producer and a film series give new life to Mario Bava's
influential horror</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the benefits of the ever-expanding DVD market is the way in
which entire oeuvres are being salvaged from obscurity. Italian
director Mario Bava, for example, never received widespread
recognition during his lifetime, but his stature grows with each
passing year, thanks in part to the increased availability of his
work on home video. Largely known as a director of gothic horror
pictures, Bava's filmography also includes sex comedies, spy movies,
gladiator pictures and other genre oddities, although many of his
films never received proper theatrical distribution in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing its project of reviving forgotten genre films, on
Friday the American Cinematheque kicks off a retrospective tribute
that includes new prints of many of Bava's better-known films, as
well as a selection of lesser-known gems. The series opens with
"Kidnapped," originally shot in 1974, unfinished at the time of
Bava's death in 1980 and only recently completed by Bava's producer,
Alfredo Leone, his son Lamberto Bava and grandson Roy Bava.</LD>
<TE>   In some respects a "filmmaker's filmmaker" even though his name
may not be known to a broader audience, Bava had an influence that
can be seen in the diverse group of directors who have acknowledged
their indebtedness to his work, including Martin Scorsese, Vincent
Gallo, Joe Dante and Tim Burton. The Beastie Boys' music video for
"Body Movin'" was an explicit knockoff of Bava's swinging spy
thriller "Danger: Diabolik," the same film director Roman Coppola has
pointed to as an influence on his own debut feature, "CQ."</TE>
<TE>   Bava's father was a respected sculptor and cameraman in the
Italian studio system. He worked on films such as the landmark "Quo
Vadis." So it is not a stretch to say that Mario, born in 1914, had
filmmaking in his blood.</TE>
<TE>   An in-demand cam- eraman by the 1940s, Bava toiled out of the
spotlight for years. As the story goes, a temperamental director
walked off the set on two pictures in a row, which Bava finished
shooting without him. His employers then asked him to direct a
picture. And so, at 46, he directed his first film, "Black Sunday."
Now seen as a landmark, the film about a vengeful reincarnated witch
was highly influential for its moody black-and-white look and made a
minor star of British actress Barbara Steele.</TE>
<TE>   During the next decade and a half, Bava would reinvent horror
filmmaking, creating sleek, stylish films that unfolded as if in a
dreamlike trance. His "The Girl Who Knew Too Much," released in
America as "The Evil Eye," is frequently credited as being the first
"giallo," a peculiarly Italian brand of stalker-thriller that melded
violence and eroticism into a frightening psychosexual wallop. Bava's
1971 "Bay of Blood" (also known by the delightfully evocative title
"Twitch of the Death Nerve") would become a veritable blueprint for
American stalk-and-slash films of the 1970s and '80s, while his 1965
"Planet of the Vampires" provided key concepts for the decidedly
higher-class "Alien."</TE>
<TE>   It was while working on the 1969 sex comedy "Four Times That
Night" that Bava first met producer Leone, called in by the film's
financiers to assist after the Yugoslav producers ran out of money.
Leone was impressed by what Bava had done with limited resources, as
the lavishly hip, ultramodern bachelor pad seen on screen was made of
little more than cardboard and cellophane. The men would ultimately
work together on five projects.</TE>
<TE>   Dapper and energetic during a recent lunch at the Friars Club,
Leone said he has become the keeper of Bava's legacy, purchasing
rights to other Bava films in addition to the ones they worked on
together.</TE>
<TE>   After "Four Times," the pair worked on "Baron Blood," starring
Joseph Cotten and Elke Sommer. Filmed in a castle in Austria, which
came complete with a genuine torture chamber, the film was another
step forward in Bava's exploration of psychological terror. As with
many of his films, it was released in the U.S.--by Samuel Arkoff and
James H. Nicholson's American International Pictures--only after
being severely reedited, poorly dubbed and with an inferior score.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "Baron Blood" was enough of a success that Bava and
Leone next undertook "Lisa and the Devil," a tale of possession and
obsession again starring Sommer, this time paired with Telly Savalas
as the Devil. (In an interesting footnote, Savalas is first seen here
with his trademark "Kojak" lollipop, supposedly after Bava suggested
it as a method to help the actor quit smoking.) Screened at the
Cannes Film Festival in 1973 to overflow crowds, Leone nonetheless
was unable to secure distribution for "Lisa" and stood to lose more
than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   After much pleading with Bava, the pair retooled the film to seem
more like the then-popular "The Exorcist," a ploy that led to the
eventual release of "The House of Exorcism."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to put that debacle behind them, the pair began planning a
project based on an Italian news story about a botched robbery and
kidnapping. It was to be a different kind of film for Bava, based on
the contemporary fears of modern life rather than the more detached
terrors of his gothic films. When the story rights were stolen out
from under him by his own production manager, Leone found his
director gone as well. Bava had made a decision to follow the story,
and although he and Leone were to remain friends, they would never
work together again.</TE>
<TE>   Once Bava completed shooting, the production ran out of money, and
after the renegade producer died of a heart attack, the film was
stopped in its tracks. Without funds for post-production, for the
only time in his career Bava was forced to abandon a project as
unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   The unedited footage sat in a Rome vault for more than 20 years
before being assembled and released in 1998 on a DVD overseen by Lea
Lander, one of the film's stars, and Tim Lucas, Bava biographer and
publisher of the popular cinephile magazine Video Watchdog. Titled
"Rabid Dogs," even in that cobbled-together version, the film was
unlike anything else Bava had done--told in real time, shot mostly in
a single car speeding around Rome, using only available light.</TE>
<TE>   Once Leone came into possession of the footage, he decided to
finish the film himself. Bava's son Lamberto, a successful director
in Italy, was initially hesitant to undertake the project. Eventually
agreeing, he brought aboard his son Roy, and although much of the
original cast had passed away, the three assembled as much of the
film's original crew as they could, setting out to complete scenes
and create the transitions necessary to finish the picture. The film
also features a new score by Bava collaborator Stelvio Cipriani.</TE>
<TE>   With the goal of moving Bava's influence into the future, Leone
also recently partnered with production company Kismet Entertainment
to pursue remakes of Bava's films, much as producer Joel Silver has
done with the catalog of exploitation pioneer William Castle.</TE>
<TE>   For Leone, the experience of completing "Kidnapped" has brought
him full circle in his relationship with Bava. Asked to describe the
director and his own motivations for keeping Bava's legacy alive,
Leone says simply, "I've meet some fine people in this bus- iness,
but absolutely no one with the compassion, the intellect and the
genius of Mario Bava."</TE>

<HD>Tarr's 'Harmonies' Is Involving Puzzle</HD>
<DH>The tale of a man's encounter with irrational forces will
get three showings at LACMA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bela Tarr's beautiful and confounding "Werckmeister Harmonies," which
screens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Friday at 7:30
p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., generates remarkable tension
between its sheer visual power and its implacable elusiveness. As
wearying as the film becomes in its long, bleak sequences, its
uniquely cinematic and emotion-charged experience makes the effort
worthwhile.</LD>
<LD>   It opens in a drab workingman's bar in a drab Hungarian town as it
is about to close for the night--but not before a saintly young man,
Janos Valuska (Lars Rudolph) leads the men to act out, in a
dirge-like dance, the workings of the cosmos during an eclipse, after
which he assures everyone that "the sun will rise again."</LD>
<LD>   Janos makes himself useful to others around the clock, helping
care for a frail musicologist, Gyorgy Eszter (Peter Fitz), who has
banished his despised--but not to be underestimated--wife, Tunde (a
deglamorized but ever-commanding Hanna Schygulla).</LD>
<TE>   While delivering the local paper late at night, Janos encounters
an immense truck rumbling into the town's huge open square. It
contains the stuffed remains of "the world's largest giant whale,"
attended by a barker called Prince, who has developed into a
Hitler-like rabble-rouser, attracting hundreds of discontented men to
the square. The crowd grows more restless, especially with the
nonappearance of both the whale and the Prince, ever closer to raging
out of control. By the end of this harrowing work, Tarr suggests
there's nothing to be done when irrational forces overtake society
but to try to survive and endure until they pass, like an eclipse.

<TE>   As part of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Andy Warhol
retrospective, the facility is presenting the first of a three-part
Warhol film series that is by far the most comprehensive ever
assembled in Los Angeles. The first part (Friday through July 26)
will screen at the Pacific Design Center; the second, in cooperation
with the American Cinematheque, at the Egyptian (July 31-Aug. 28).
The third is composed of three programs of screen tests, which are
running continuously in MOCA's Ahmanson Auditorium beginning at noon
each day. Approximately two-thirds of the films have never been shown
locally.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's earliest films, virtual home movies shot in grainy black
and white, are by and large extended put-ons and travesties; yet on
occasion they attain the level of camp pathos. They feature the
denizens of Warhol's famous Factory and celebrate a languid,
sometimes druggy sexuality that in tone are alternately outrageous,
striking and sometimes just plain tedious. Warhol's work was part of
an underground cinema emerging in the '60s that offered a jolting
contrast to the mainstream movies of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The first program, Friday at 7 p.m. in the SilverScreen Theater at
the Pacific Design Center, opens with the three-minute "Elvis at
Ferus" (1963), in which Warhol pans the camera around La Cienega's
Ferus Gallery, capturing the artist's reprocessed and repeated
life-size images of Elvis Presley in a gunfighter pose and in front
of them the gallery's Irving Blum, who was the first to show Warhol's
work on the West Coast in 1962. It will be followed by the 35-minute
"Eat" (1964), featuring a young man wearing a hat and eating an
egg--interminably. With the amusing 47-minute "Soap Opera" (1964)
Warhol intercuts hilarious '50s commercials and infomercials with a
series of silent romantic encounters and their travails, focusing
primarily on Warhol superstar Baby Jane Holzer tossing her blond mane
a lot, and including a couple of moments that wouldn't be allowed on
daytime drama even today. Screening Saturday beginning at noon is
"Empire" (1984), an eight-hour portrait of the Empire State Building.
(213) 621-1745.</TE>

<TE>   Kim A. Snyder's "I Remember Me," which begins an open-ended
Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. run at the Monica 4-Plex this weekend, is
a consciousness-raising documentary about the mysterious debilitating
disease called chronic fatigue syndrome, which strikes people with
varying intensity and varying lengths of time. At its worst people
can be rendered too weak to get out of bed, sometimes for years on
end. As she began to recover from the disease, although at times
confined to a wheelchair, Snyder decided to investigate it. Chronic
fatigue syndrome, whose onset is similar to an extremely bad case of
flu, tends to occur in clusters, such as one in the Lake Tahoe area,
where over 300 people were stricken between May 1984 and late 1986,
yet no virus has been identified. The elusiveness of the disease has
made it much tougher for sufferers to get a positive response from
the government; indeed, Snyder discovers that $13,000 intended for
its investigation was diverted to other diseases by the national
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran director Blake Edwards speaks of struggling with CFS for
some 15 years; Olympic gold medalist and women's World Cup soccer
star Michelle Akers tells of being sidelined by it, struggling to
regain her health and resume her sports activities; and a Connecticut
teenager, ill for three years, tells of his determination to attend
his high school graduation, even if it means via a gurney and
ambulance. Snyder learns that well-documented accounts of the
outbreak of the disease date back at least to the 1950s, yet little
has been done to fight the malady. With her graceful, informative
film, Snyder has made a big step in the right direction. (310)

<TE>   Early in her career, German director Doris Dorrie won
international acclaim for her rueful comedy "Men ..." and now with
"Enlightenment Guaranteed," she again tackles with humor but even
more compassion the vicissitudes that can beset ordinary guys. Dorrie
has explored spiritual quests before, but her shift in tone from the
comic to the serious is exceptional here in its depth and scope.
"Enlightenment Guaranteed" is as funny as it is nourishing, and it
has stellar performances from Uwe Ochsenknecht and Gustav Peter
Wohler, who play off each other like Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.
Although this 1999 production played a regular local engagement a
year ago, it opens the Goethe Institute's annual Blockbuster series
of recent German box-office hits Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the institute,
5750 Wilshire Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Ochsenknecht's Uwe and Wohler's Gustav are fortysomething brothers
living in Munich who go on a retreat to a Buddhist monastery near
Tokyo. Their adjustment to routines of prayer and household labor is
a source of continuing humor, yet Dorrie unobtrusively evokes in them
a gradual and genuine spiritual enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   The great lesson for the West from the East, Dorrie has said, is
to learn to live in the present and not for the future. This is what
Uwe and Gustav learn, and Ochsenknecht, one of the stars of "Men ..."
and Wohler, move between the comic and the serious with ease. (323)

<TE>   The American Cinematheque's "Haunted World of Italian Horror
Maestro Mario Bava" is the largest retrospective ever assembled of
the films of the late director, celebrated for a bravura sense of
style and the darkly poetic power of his imagery. It will present 18
films, 13 in new 35-millimeter prints, between May 31 and June 12 at
the Egyptian Theater. Participants will include Bava's son and
collaborator Lamberto, his producer Alfredo Leone and several of his
stars, Barbara Steele, Elke Sommer, Mark Damon and John Saxon.</TE>
<TE>   The series begins Friday at 7:30 p.m. with the U.S. premiere of
"Kidnapped" (1974), which remained unfinished for over 20 years until
it was assembled for DVD release by Bava authority Tim Lucas with
several additional scenes directed by Lamberto Bava and additional
music by Stelvio Cipriani. Also known as "L'Uomo e il Bambino" and
"Rabid Dogs," it is a stunning psychological thriller that has been
aptly compared to Sam Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs," and its raw,
on-the-road grittiness stands in stark contrast with Bava's
atmospheric period pieces. A gang of robbers pulls a successful heist
of a pharmaceuticals company on the outskirts of Rome only to
discover the police on their tail. A bloody standoff in a parking
structure leaves four people dead, including one of the robbers. The
icy, suave leader of the gang, Doc (Maurice Poli) and his two scruffy
henchmen Thirtytwo (Luigi Montefiori) and Blade (Aldo Caponi) take a
woman, Maria (Lea Lander), hostage and make their getaway,
subsequently taking hostage Riccardo (Riccardo Cucciola), a
middle-aged man, with an unconscious boy.</TE>
<TE>   Bava is expert at milking the tension as the bad guys take flight
with their captives. He keeps fresh developments coming along that
sustain interest but never strain credibility as the psychological
aspects of the situation emerge under mounting pressure. Thirtytwo
and Blade are crude, volatile and mindless thugs who all but drool
over Maria, to the extent that one has to wonder just how much
control Doc has over them. "Kidnapped" plays out faultlessly and ends
with a twist that really is a shocker. Leone and Lamberto Bava will
discuss the film after its screening.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Steele, star of Bava's "Black Sunday" (1960), perhaps the
most famous of Bava's films, will discuss it following its 5 p.m.
screening Saturday. There will be an 8 p.m. double feature composed
of the uncut European version of the director's reported favorite,
"Black Sabbath" (1963), starring Boris Karloff, Mark Damon and
Jacqueline Pierreux in a trio of terror tales, and "The Whip and the
Body" (1963), a kinky Gothic thriller starring Christopher Lee and
Daliah Lavi. Damon will appear between the two films. (323) 461-2020.

<LD>An American flag is on fire at the Wilshire Theatre. Or so it seems.</LD>
<LD>   No, Penn &amp; Teller are not protesting the actions of the U.S.
government. They're displaying respect for the principles that are
symbolized by the American flag.</LD>
<LD>   This weeklong gig by magic's middle-aged scamps marks the local
unfurling of their new flag piece, in the second act. Perhaps it was
inspired by the indiscriminate flag-waving that followed the events
of Sept. 11. But it wasn't part of their one-night engagements in
Thousand Oaks, Escondido and Cerritos in November.</LD>
<TE>   We don't want to give away the details, so let's just say that
Penn &amp; Teller use a couple of Old Glories, a piece of paper on which
is written the Bill of Rights, and their usual legerdemain to make a
rather provocative statement.</TE>
<TE>   Some magic fans may not appreciate being asked to consider any
subjects outside the world of illusion, but Penn &amp; Teller have never
especially catered to that crowd. They've always wanted their
audiences to think about the meaning of magic and reality.</TE>
<TE>   Also new here are Teller's apparent transformation of coins into
fish and, later, Penn's apparent transformation into Teller in a
piece involving a gorilla suit.</TE>
<TE>   A few other bits were on the one-night programs last
fall--Teller's opening escape from locked boxes, a funny would-be
knife-throwing stunt, and the full version of a card trick in which
Teller sits on a throne. Dressed in a wizard cap, ascot and smoking
jacket, he fans himself and sips tea like a potentate out of a fairy
tale. The comic imagery of his cherubic countenance amid these
trappings is as much the point as the illusion.</TE>
<TE>   Penn, of course, lacks any semblance of a cherubic countenance.
He's still the heavy, the carnival barker, occasionally the screamer,
while Teller offers nary a word. This stark contrast between the two
men provides much of the drama in their act, and it's best
illustrated in a sketch in which they temporarily leave behind Penn &amp;
Teller and play the roles of strangers sharing a park bench.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the show, Penn refers to their 27-year partnership
and grumbles, "We're so sick of it, we could spit." But from the
energy and precision of this performance, there's no indication we're
supposed to take that literally.</TE>
<TE>   This is another opportunity to see Teller's classic bit in which
he carves up a flower's shadow--or their finale involving bullets
shot into each other's teeth. The fun continues after the curtain
call, as a theme song ushers the audience out and the magicians greet
theatergoers on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   The theater's size may be problematic for those who aren't close
to the stage. Penn mentions "these little tiny props and this very
big theater." This isn't a show in which elephants appear, so try to
sit up front. Don't worry that you're more vulnerable to being picked
as a "volunteer"--Penn goes out of his way to involve individuals
from the seats that are farther back.</TE>

<HD>I Got the Horse Right Here</HD>
<DH>During Hollywood Park's Friday Night Racing, even newbies
can play a hunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIA GAYNOR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phrase "going to the races" suggested two things to me:
chain-smoking, grizzled old men who go "down to the track" to risk it
all on a pretty filly called Lucky Lady, or, aristocratic ladies in
hats stepping out of Bentleys to watch the "sport of kings." The
racetrack could be someplace decadent or desperate, but not a
destination for the urban twenty- or thirtysomething. You know,
cynical, everything-in-moderation, Gen-X-type people.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out, Hollywood Park in Inglewood sees it differently. It
sees an untapped market ripe for recruitment. For its Friday Night
Racing, it is using well-tested enticements--$1 beers, hot dogs and
soft drinks, and even $1 bets--to initiate a new generation of horse
racing fans.</LD>
<LD>   Friday Night Racing, in its 10th year, is one of the few times the
park is open for nighttime racing and is offered from May to July.
(The last Friday night race is July 19.) The first race starts at 7
p.m. and the last one at 10:30 p.m., when they give the MTV
generation another reason to trek to Inglewood--live music at
Longshots, the Hollywood Park bar.</LD>
<TE>   I arrived at Hollywood Park a complete racetrack novice. I was
pretty sure I wouldn't need my wide-brimmed hat but didn't know if it
would be run-down and seedy or smart and upscale. Turns out it's
somewhere in between. There are three levels of admission: Grandstand
($7), general admission to the track; the Clubhouse ($10); and the
glamorous-sounding Turf Club ($20). Everything in moderation, I chose
Clubhouse. Once inside, I couldn't understand why anyone would pick
the no-frills Grandstand when the extra $3 gained me access to
patios, bars, ample seats and charming equestrian paintings lining
the walls. Perhaps it's because Grandstand admission, though with
fewer amenities, gets you close to the action and leaves $3 for
another wager.</TE>
<TE>   The actual racetrack was just what I'd imagined, only more
kitschy. There's the traditional-looking oval dirt track encircled by
a white fence, but inside the track--in the infield--is a manicured
grassy area, complete with a small waterfall, a pond, live flamingos
and a horse topiary that looks more like a Labrador retriever. With
the track so close to Los Angeles International Airport, the
low-flying jets threatened to distract from the horses, but after a
few minutes the noise became part of the ambience, along with the
nasal voice of the announcer, the vendor shouting "peanuts, lemonade
and ice cream" and the rustle of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   To decide which horses to bet on, many people buy--in addition to
the regular program--a copy of the Racing Form, a daily newspaper and
guide to each race, with information about the horses, jockeys,
trainers, odds and opinions from handicappers. To me much of it
looked like hieroglyphics--a mishmash of fractions, abbreviations and
acronyms, with no discernable glossary of terms. Luckily, a nice man
in an information booth saw my eyes glaze over and handed me the
racing Rosetta Stone, a pocket-sized yellow card with definitions of
racing and betting terms like "quinella," "trifecta" and "maiden
race."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Park doesn't offer a beginner's guide per se, which is
surprising with the market they get on Friday nights. If you don't
have a friend with betting experience, try meeting someone who does.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday night I went, most of the crowd was under 40. Some were
on dates, some came in groups. Few looked like seasoned pros. Usher
Dominick Mastro explained that this wasn't a typical Hollywood Park
crowd. "The typical racetrack people, midweek, are very serious about
it. The regulars don't come on Friday nights. They don't want to
fight the traffic and the crowds."</TE>
<TE>   With a two-minute race every half-hour, that's 56 minutes left
each hour to learn how to bet, read the Racing Form, make a wager,
buy a beer or catch up with friends. It's not exactly action-packed,
but during the races it's easy to get swept up in the frenzy of the
crowd. Even when my horse was indistinguishable from the galloping
blur, I heard myself screaming "Come on, 6, keep going!" over the
other hyped-up gamblers.</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs that even Hollywood Park doesn't think horse
racing is quite exciting enough. Just after the sixth race, the song
"Hollywood Nights" began blaring out of the loudspeakers, and for no
apparent reason, a dance troupe, scantily clad in black leather pants
and royal blue spandex tops, started a shimmying routine. Turns out,
these are the Hollywood Starlets, the Laker Girls of Hollywood Park.
A bit later came the "hop-along derby," grown men racing down the
grass on red bouncy balls.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because the betting isn't nonstop, unlike most casino games,
there's less temptation to be impulsive. You can bet as little as $1,
and nobody I met put more than $20 on any one race. Most people pick
their horse using the early odds printed in the program or the
updated odds displayed on an electric scoreboard in the infield, but
some, such as Jennifer Johnson, a 29-year-old physical therapist from
Burbank, use other methods.</TE>
<TE>   "I choose a horse based solely on its name or number," she said.
"Five is my favorite number, so I choose horse No. 5 a lot. That's
probably why I never win, but it's fun anyway. For me, it's
entertainment. If you really want to win money, I guess you should
pay more attention."</TE>
<TE>   Paying attention didn't get me anywhere. I bet timidly for several
hours, putting money on the favorites, but it didn't work. I tried
choosing longshots, hoping for the big money off my $2 bet. That
didn't work. Then I tried a "trifecta box." I chose three horses, and
if they finished first, second and third, in any order, I would win.
Didn't win then either. At the end of the day, it felt like as much
of a game of chance as roulette.</TE>
<TE>   But, like fellow first-timer Ron McGinty, a 27-year-old legal
secretary from Hollywood, I didn't regret the money lost. "I never
won but came close four times," he told me. "I spent $25, probably
less than I would have, had I gone somewhere else for three or four
hours, and I had three beers and a hot dog. And unlike just going out
to some bar, there was a chance I could actually win some money."</TE>

<LD>The baton pass from the official television season to the summer took
place last week, as several high-rated programs capped off the latest
rating sweeps--which concluded May 22--before viewers began
scattering for the long Memorial Day weekend, based on viewing
estimates issued Wednesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's schedule will get an injection from the NBA playoffs the
next few weeks, and thus far the network's coverage is up more than
10% compared with last year, with Game 3 of the Lakers-Kings series
garnering respectable numbers Friday that were good enough to win the
night.</LD>
<LD>   This is also a time of year when cable channels capitalize on
network reruns, and HBO delivered strong tune-in by the pay channel's
standards Sunday with the documentary "In Memoriam: New York,
9/11/01," which was last week's most-watched cable program.</LD>
<TE>   The sweeps, meanwhile, ended with a bang, as "The West Wing"
season finale won its hour against Fox's "Celebrity Boxing," which
dropped sharply compared with its March debut versus a "Wing" rerun.
Fox also got no appreciable bump for the payoff of its serialized
drama "24," which faced the ninth-season finales of the still-durable
"Frasier" and "NYPD Blue."</TE>

<HD>Criterion's 'Traffic' Delivers the Goods</HD>
<DH>The director, the screenwriter and others provide
insightful commentary tracks on DVD release of the Oscar-winning
film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the Criterion Collection specializes in thought-provoking DVDs
of vintage film, the Illinois-based company on occasion showcases
more contemporary films like "Armageddon" and "Rushmore." Criterion
now has turned its spotlight on Steven Soderbergh's
multi-Oscar-winning "Traffic" ($40) in a special two-disc set that is
packed with extras.</LD>
<LD>   Based on the 1989 British TV miniseries "Traffik," this complex,
multilayered drama from 2000 looks at the dangerous world of drug
trafficking. Soderbergh won the Academy Award for best director,
Stephen Gaghan picked up the Oscar for his screenplay adaptation,
Benicio Del Toro won best supporting actor as a Mexican police
detective and Stephen Mirrione received an Oscar for his editing.
Besides Del Toro, the ensemble cast includes Michael Douglas,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Amy Irving and Don Cheadle.</LD>
<LD>   The first disc of "Traffic" includes the wide-screen edition of
the film and three commentary tracks. Soderbergh and Gaghan offer
terrific insights into the making of "Traffic." Especially noteworthy
are Soderbergh's explanations for the distinct visual look for each
of the separate story lines--the washed out, almost sepia tones for
the Mexico scenes, the blue hues for Douglas' story set in
Cincinnati, and the bright, harsh glow of the San Diego sequences</LD>
<TE>   Producers Laura Bickford, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz and
consultants Tim Golden and Craig Chretien participate in the second
track, and composer Cliff Martinez discusses the score on the third.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to 25 deleted scenes with commentary from Soderbergh
and Gaghan, the second disc highlights the technical aspects of the
filmmaking process. The demonstration explaining the five-step
process to achieve the look of the Mexico sequences is a bit too
technical. An interactive audio editing demonstration of the dialogue
editing process is so "inside" that it will fly over the heads of
most viewers. But the outtakes are fascinating, especially multiple
angles of the cocktail party sequence in which real U.S. senators,
politicians, lobbyists and media personalities discuss their feelings
about the war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Stallone flexes his pecs and kicks major butt as the
former Green Beret John Rambo in three action-thrillers from the
1980s: "First Blood," "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Rambo III."
This week, Artisan Entertainment released a four-disc "Rambo Special
Edition" set ($60). The discs for each film include decent making-of
documentaries. Novelist David Morrell, who wrote "First Blood" in
1972, talks about the decade-long struggle to get the movie made.
Stallone discusses how Kirk Douglas was originally cast to play
Rambo's friend and mentor, Col. Sam Trautman, but left the location
before production began because he wanted to have certain changes
made in the script, most notably having Rambo's character die at the
end of "First Blood." Richard Crenna was brought in to replace
Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth disc includes seven featurettes examining everything
from the box-office performance of the three "Rambo" movies to the
various Rambo toys that were produced, to the weapons Rambo used in
the three films. There are also three more documentaries dealing with
the Vietnam War, including the very emotional "The Real Nam: Voice
From Within," which features recollections of several Vietnam vets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sex and the City" executive producer, writer and director Michael
Patrick King offers very witty and wicked commentary on four of the
13 episodes on the new "Sex and the City: The Complete Third Season"
three-disc DVD set (HBO, $50). Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall,
Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon star in HBO's Emmy Award-winning
adult comedy series about the lives and loves of four New York
friends. Besides commentary, the discs feature cast and crew bios,
episodic previews, an episode index and a list of the show's awards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There have been many spoofs over the years of "Star Wars," but
probably the best is 1977's "Hardware Wars." It features the
characters Fluke Starbucker, Augie Ben Doggie, Princess Anne-Droid
(who wears real hot cinnamon buns in her hair), Ham Salad and Darth
Nader. A new DVD (Tapeworm Video, $15) features a witty commentary
track from writer-director Ernie Fosselius, comments from producer
Michael Wiese, a lame spoof of "Antiques Roadshow," a "director's"
cut filled with very funny outtakes and a pirated "foreign" version.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Czech director Jan Sverak, who admits he's so shy he has a
difficult time shooting love scenes, offers sweet commentary on the
digital edition of his World War II epic, "Dark Blue World" (Columbia
TriStar, $30). Sverak is joined in his commentary by his British
producer, Eric Abraham, who helps the Czech director with his
sometimes shaky English. Sverak and Abraham previously collaborated
on the Oscar-winning foreign film "Kolya."</TE>
<TE>   "Dark Blue World" tells the story of how Czech fighter pilots fled
their country after the German occupation and went to England to fly
with the RAF. When they returned home after the war, though, they
were imprisoned by the Communist-run Czech government. Despite good
performances from the Czech and English cast, "Dark Blue World" is
eventually grounded by a predictable love triangle subplot.</TE>
<TE>   Besides commentary, the digital edition features a documentary on
the making of the film, a look at the visual effects and a photo
montage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The charming 1988 Disney animated musical, "Oliver &amp; Company,"
which is loosely based on Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist," arrived on
DVD this week ($23) in a not-very-special edition. The DVD includes a
ho-hum documentary on the making of the film, a very brief featurette
focusing on the history of Disney's animated animals, a gallery of
production art and two sing-along music videos. The best extra on the
DVD by far is the Oscar-winning 1941 short "Lend a Paw," in which
Pluto gets more than he bargained for when he rescues a mischievous
kitten from certain death.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The thriller "Sorry, Wrong Number" began its life as a 30-minute
installment of the old radio show "Suspense." Taut and terrifying, it
featured a bravura radio performance from Agnes Moorehead as an
invalid alone in her house who learns that two hit men are coming to
kill her. The episode was so popular it was rebroadcast seven times
and turned into a novel. The 1948 film stars Barbara Stanwyck,
appropriately fearful and neurotic as the doomed invalid (she
received an Oscar nomination). But the film is weighted down with
flashbacks and one too many characters. Burt Lancaster stars as the
husband who puts out the hit. The DVD (Paramount, $25) features a
nice transfer of the film and the original trailer.</TE>

<LD>   London Museum Faces Stolen Property Claim</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The British Museum said it's considering a claim that four of its
Old Master drawings were seized from a Jewish family in
Czechoslovakia after the Nazis invaded the country more than 60 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The charge, leveled by the descendants of the purported owner, art
collector Arthur Feldmann, is the most significant claim since the
British government set up a panel last year to investigate
allegations by former owners, or their families, that works of art in
private collections were stolen by the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   It is being pursued through the Commission for Looted Art in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The four works, dating from the 15th to the 18th centuries, are
reportedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Three were bought
on behalf of the British Museum at a sale at Sotheby's in London in
1946 and the fourth came through a bequest.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Bryan, a veteran radio host and programmer who has worked at
stations in San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, New York and, most
recently, Seattle, has been hired to take the morning-drive reins at
KRTH-FM (101.1). He'll probably go on the air June 10, station
general manager Pat Duffy said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy said the oldies music station was looking for a 6-to-10 a.m.
host who could provide "adult humor without being blue." He described
Bryan's comedic taste as more akin to David Letterman and Jay Leno
than to Howard Stern, the English-language ratings leader in local
morning radio.</TE>
<TE>   Current KRTH morning hosts Frazer Smith and Joni Caryl may
continue as part of the program, Duffy said, while Jim Carson will
move to another time slot.</TE>

<HD>It's a Chamber-Sized Year at the Ojai Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For regulars of the Ojai Festival, the world-class classical music
fete that lands every year on the precipice between spring and
summer, the Libbey Bowl stage may well appear underpopulated this
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The festival traditionally features some orchestral presence,
usually the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by various celebrated
maestros. This year, however, they're cutting costs and saving up for
next year's big event, featuring Pierre Boulez.</LD>
<LD>   Which doesn't mean that the festival isn't amply stocked with
musical firepower. It's just presented in smaller, chamber-sized
packages. Whatever our sentimental attachments to orchestral grandeur
in the park, it would be hard to sniff at a program that includes one
of the world's finest string quartets, the Emerson (performing
Beethoven and Shostakovich on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights), or
concert-stage-meets-cabaret singer Ute Lemper singing songs of Kurt
Weill, one of her claims to fame, along with noted guitarist Eliot
Fisk in the Sunday morning concert.</LD>
<TE>   This year's fest, aptly dubbed "Last and Latest Thoughts," will be
the last directed by Ernest Fleischmann, the former L.A. Philharmonic
chief. He has brought energy, new ideas and a prickly stage presence
to Ojai in his short stay. For instance, he expanded the festival to
include pre-weekend concerts and panel discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the festival began Wednesday night. Today and Friday,
a symposium at the Ojai Presbyterian Church will run from 10:30 to
4:30 each day, with scholarly papers and a panel discussion featuring
festival artists and Times music critic Mark Swed.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning concerts in Ojai are often reserved for lighter,
family-friendly fare. But that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile. A
few years back, Esa-Pekka Salonen brought his delightfully flexible
chamber group Toimii to play, replete with costume changes and
child-tickling horseplay--a sophisticated surrogate for Saturday
morning cartoons. This Saturday morning, Marino Formenti presents a
gutsy yet enjoyable program, "The Latest Sounds for Eager Ears:
Today's Music for Today's Kids," and expands that agenda for a full,
grown-up recital on Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, 2002's fest will be remembered as the Emersonian year in
Ojai. The group will unveil an ambitious three-night, two-composer
survey of late quartets by Beethoven and Shostakovich. It won't be a
walk in the park but promises to touch deep.</TE>
<TE>   * Ojai Festival, Libbey Bowl, downtown Ojai, through Sunday.
Friday at 8:15 p.m., Emerson String Quartet; Saturday at 10:30 a.m.,
family concert with pianist Marino Formenti; Saturday at 2:30 p.m.,
pianist Marino Formenti; Saturday at 8:30 p.m., Emerson String
Quartet; Sunday at 11 a.m., Ute Lemper and Eliot Fisk; Sunday at 5:30
p.m., Emerson String Quartet. Call for ticket prices and
availability. (805) 646-2094. www.ojaifestival.org.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other Festival Notes: The eighth-annual Ventura Chamber Music
Festival May 2-12 came off without notable hitches and had the
distinction of bringing a legend to Ventura, in the form of pianist
Alicia de Larrocha. Otherwise, this year's program was pretty tried
and true, with return visits from the violinist Corey Cerovsek and
the Rossetti Quartet (albeit without the abruptly departed first
violinist Nina Bodnar).</TE>
<TE>   Every festival needs unpredictability, and the wildest concert of
the festival was the Saturday afternoon showdown of opposing forces
at the Church of Religious Science. Bryan Pezzone is a wonderful
pianist, whose exacting touch and gamey sense of adventure make him a
favorite of the Los Angeles new music scene. On Saturday, his crisp,
meaningful playing on the Mozart, and in ensemble for Ventura College
teacher Cesar Mateus' bracing, brainy premiere, were exemplary.</TE>
<TE>   Left to his own devices, however, Pezzone's improvisation-driven
program--which he calls the "freedom series"--can be surprisingly
shallow. Although he periodically came to life, as during the classic
Bill Evans/Miles Davis ballad "Blue in Green," elsewhere his
meandering lines smacked of New Age or instrumental pop ideas, and
his self-reflective chatter between pieces tried one's patience.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, stark contrast greeted us in the form of Jim
Fox's hypnotic "Solo for Reed Instrument," played by bass clarinetist
Marty Walker. Especially effective in this quasi-Mayan chapel space,
the work's pared-down gestures focus our listening minds on qualities
other than standard virtuosity or melodic development.</TE>
<TE>   Mateus' new "Visitations for Chamber Orchestra" favors
explorations of overtones and fundamentals of sound rather than the
traditional music building blocks. It's a powerful example of how
essentially abstract music can also be gripping. The work conveyed a
distracted, ambiguous air, a feeling of expectancy and introspection,
but also a sense of assertive sound painting.</TE>

<LD>David and Susan Steeno couldn't believe their luck. There, on a leafy
street just a few blocks removed from a scenic mountain range, they
found their dream house. Sure, the interior of the cottage-style
bungalow needed work, but it wasn't anything they couldn't handle.</LD>
<LD>   The surrounding yard was another matter. From the curb, the
scattering of gnarled shrubs, cracked and mismatched concrete and a
forbidding Chinese elm made their dream house resemble the House of
Usher. "Help," they screamed.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, Home &amp; Garden Television was listening, and tonight
at 8 you can see what $12,500 and a nice design can do in
"Landscaper's Challenge," now in what will be its regular weekly time
slot.</LD>
<TE>   The people-pleasing make-over format, already used by HGTV in its
"Designer's Challenge" series geared to interiors, has been turned
inside-out to take care of forlorn yardscapes everywhere. Homeowners
set a budget and devise a wish list of features, then three design
contractors are marched in one at a time to make their pitch. The
homeowners then select a plan, and work is started. Afterward,
viewers are treated to the finished product.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the Steenos admit they went a bit over budget in
achieving their goals, but dreams don't come cheaply, even on HGTV.</TE>

<HD>Coercion at Issue in Andersen Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Both sides raise questions about whether potential
witnesses were pressured by the government in pretrial interviews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers for accounting firm Arthur Andersen complained to a
federal judge Wednesday that prosecutors were unfairly questioning
witnesses about how investigators treated them during pretrial
interviews.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys defending the firm against an obstruction-of-justice
charge here asked U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon to
instruct federal prosecutors not to raise the issue with witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors countered that the issue has become critical in the
case because the defense claims that the government pressured some
Andersen executives who might testify.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen defense lawyer Rusty Hardin has raised questions about
the prosecution's treatment of witnesses many times during the trial.
Hardin has accused prosecutors of intimidating potential witnesses by
notifying them that they had become targets of the broader federal
probe of Enron Corp.'s meltdown. He also has suggested that the
government's chief witness, David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who
was in charge of auditing Enron, pleaded guilty to a separate count
of obstruction because of pressure from investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The issue arose again Wednesday after former Andersen manager
Jennifer Stevenson, responding to a question from Assistant U.S.
Atty. Andrew Weissmann, said no one had pressured her to change her
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Weissmann, responding to Hardin's objections outside the jury's
presence, told the judge that he needed to raise the coercion issue
because he expects the defense to use it in closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon did not rule on the matter. But the questioning signaled
that prosecutors believe the jury's impression of Duncan's plea could
be significant.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan testified that he intended to impede a Securities and
Exchange Commission inquiry when he directed subordinates in the
Houston office to comply with Andersen's document policy.</TE>
<TE>   But on cross-examination, Duncan was unable to identify any
specific information he intended to keep away from investigators.</TE>
<TE>   As the defense continued, Hardin hammered at the idea that no one
at Andersen believed that an instruction to comply with the document
policy was an implicit directive to shred potentially incriminating
documents.</TE>
<TE>   A former auditor in the firm's Portland, Ore., office, which
handled audits of an Enron affiliate, testified that he received a
reminder of the firm's policy last fall and instructed his team to
retain all Enron-related papers.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Philpot said he asked his bosses about a voicemail he
received instructing auditors to "clean up" records related to the
affiliate, Portland General Electric. He said supervisors advised him
that the policy is "not a document destruction policy."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors introduced an e-mail sent Oct. 24 by Peter Kwong, an
Andersen auditor in Portland, to a member of the Enron audit team in
Houston, that said, "All items in my possession as noted in your
voicemail to me have been deleted or destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   But another Andersen official, Tim McCann, said Philpot had
replaced Kwong on the Portland General account a year earlier, and
Kwong had no connection to Enron or the subsidiary when he sent the
e-mail. McCann said he knew of the SEC's informal inquiry into Enron
when he decided to retain Enron-related files, but that he made the
decision primarily because the team had just completed its audit work
on Portland General Electric.</TE>

<HD>Drawing the Line on Refunds</HD>
<DH>Energy: State, federal regulators take far different
approaches on electricity reparations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although the harsh rhetoric between California and federal energy
regulators has toned down in recent weeks, the two sides remain far
apart today on the state's key demand for reparations for alleged
industry abuses during the electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   With the release this month of internal Enron Corp. memos
detailing trading ploys during the energy crisis, California
officials have stepped up their demands for refunds.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission "must give Californians
their money back, both for past market manipulation in 2000 and 2001
and for excessive long-term contract prices," said Loretta Lynch,
California's top utilities regulator.</LD>
<TE>   But her counterpart at FERC, commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood
III, has reached no such conclusions: "There's not a lot of remedial
authority that we have. Our remedial authority here is much less than
any state [utilities commission] has in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law precludes FERC from ordering any refunds before
October 2000, which would put overcharges during the summer of 2000
beyond its reach. That could slash the refund amount the state is
requesting, $8.9billion for the period of May 2000 to May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   FERC will determine who will receive any refunds they order, but
the money probably would go to Southern California Edison, Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   The funds eventually could flow to customers who paid higher
rates.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to refunds, California is also seeking to renegotiate
about $40billion in long-term electricity contracts that it entered
into before power prices plunged last summer.</TE>
<TE>   FERC policy discourages undoing contracts entered into by private
parties, but a possible compromise may involve shortening the term of
the deals by simply allowing them to lapse. The state could then
claim a savings.</TE>
<TE>   California officials attacked FERC during the height of the energy
crisis, saying it failed to take an aggressive enough posture in
fighting alleged market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   But recent steps by FERC to widen its investigation into possible
manipulation have softened the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Wood, who was appointed to the top FERC post in August, has
pleased California officials by declaring that market abuses must be
exposed and punished, but he has been very guarded when it comes to
what FERC will do in the California case.</TE>
<TE>   The refund and contracts issues are the subject of separate legal
proceedings before FERC administrative law judges.</TE>
<TE>   "Did California experience severe electric market problems?
Clearly, yes," Wood said. "Were those problems the result of market
manipulation? We are currently investigating that issue."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, however, asserts that FERC's lack of regulation helped
spawn the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The California energy crisis has never been about ... economic
fundamentals. It has been about the complete lack of ... federal
regulation," Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   But many industry and FERC insiders see no violations of federal
laws in the trading practices detailed in Enron memos released this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Commodities traders make money by buying goods in a market where
the prices are low and selling them in another market where prices
are higher. Many of the Enron strategies described in the memos
simply built on that theme, while also taking advantage of convoluted
market rules in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Are those unfair business practices proscribed by the Federal
Power Act? That is not clear," said Roger Berliner, a veteran
Washington energy lawyer who represents Los Angeles County before
FERC.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this is going to be a matter of black-letter law.
This is going to be a matter of interpretation and signal sending."
Berliner is working with the county in its support of the state's
refund plea.</TE>
<TE>   Refunds as such might never materialize, said an independent
consultant who represents the industry. Instead, the power generators
may choose to reduce electricity bills they are still owed by
California utilities and the state.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely that at the end of this process anybody will write
a check to the state of California," said the consultant, who asked
not to be identified. "The question is, how much will the state of
California have to write a check for money that it owes to other
people? It's going to be less than what's on the books at this
moment."</TE>
<TE>   For the average citizen, there probably isn't much of a
distinction between the two remedies being sought by California:
refunds for power already purchased and consumed, and lower prices
for power contracted for in the future. Both represent a form of
restitution. The bottom line is the same: Californians would save.</TE>
<TE>   At FERC, refunds and renegotiated contracts represent distinctly
different legal issues, both thorny.</TE>
<TE>   The same federal law that gives FERC authority to set "just and
reasonable" rates for wholesale electricity also restricts its power
to order refunds.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's governing board ruled in July that it had no legal
authority to act on a significant portion of Gov. Gray Davis' refund
request. That's because the law limits the period for which a refund
can be required.</TE>
<TE>   California is seeking refunds for the period beginning in May
2000. FERC said it can order refunds only from Oct. 2, 2000,
onward--that is, 60 days after a complaint was first filed with FERC,
as prescribed in the law.</TE>
<TE>   A precise breakdown of the state's $8.9-billion demand is not
available, but most analysts believe the refund restriction would
trim it by several billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wood has asked Congress to change the law to allow refunds for
periods exceeding the 60-day limit. "It will increase the deterrent
effect [and] it will give customers a stronger incentive to notify
the commission immediately when they perceive manipulation," he told
the Senate. It would come too late to help California.</TE>
<TE>   FERC appears to have more maneuvering room on the contracts issue.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's basic policy is not to interfere with contracts that
independent parties already have entered into because government
tinkering makes investors skittish.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission's long-standing policy ... has been to recognize
the sanctity of contracts," FERC's governing board said in an April
decision to investigate the California contracts. "Rarely has the
commission deviated from that policy and then only in extreme
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   However, the board went on to say it would consider nullifying the
contracts because of public interest concerns and "unusual
circumstances" in California and the West.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Commissioner William Massey, an internal critic whose
warnings about California turned out to be prophetic, said the agency
should put utility customers ahead of Wall Street investors.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand there is a concern that investigating these
contracts may create uncertainty for long-term contracts and
investing," said Massey. "Nevertheless, this commission is simply not
meeting its statutory responsibilities if we rubber-stamp contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems obvious to me that the soaring prices in the spot market
had a dramatic effect on ... the contracts that were ultimately
negotiated," Massey said. "Certainly no buyer would agree to pay $249
per megawatt-hour if spot market prices and expectations of future
spot market prices were not also in that range."</TE>
<TE>   California power is now trading for about $30 per megawatt-hour.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T's Credit Rating Is Cut</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Downgrade to two notches above 'junk' sends shares
tumbling to 10-year closing low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday cut AT&amp;T Corp.'s credit rating
to two notches above "junk" status, saying the largest long-distance
telephone company will be challenged to boost revenue amid rising
competition for its core business.</LD>
<LD>   The cut triggers a rise in interest costs for AT&amp;T, which becomes
the latest big telecom to suffer a credit-rating cut. No. 2
long-distance company WorldCom Inc. was cut to junk status by all
leading U.S. rating companies, and Standard &amp; Poor's cut Qwest
Communications International Inc., the No. 4 domestic local phone
company, to junk. AT&amp;T now has the same rating as No. 3 Sprint Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "The downgrade of a highly visible credit such as AT&amp;T highlights
some of the big problems in the telecommunications sector, such as
overcapacity and the lack of pricing power," said John Boston, who
oversees more than $1 billion as director of taxable fixed income for
AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, Ala. He sold his AT&amp;T bonds last year.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's cut AT&amp;T's senior unsecured debt two notches to Baa2 from
A3. Its rating outlook is negative. Standard &amp; Poor's rates AT&amp;T's
senior debt BBB-plus, one notch above Moody's new rating. AT&amp;T
enjoyed AAA ratings in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The downgrade, affecting about $25 billion of debt, sent AT&amp;T
shares down 40 cents, or 3.2%, to a 10-year closing low of $12.01 in
heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares traded as
low as $11.95. The price has fallen 34% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said the downgrade "reflects the weakened revenue
prospects for the long-distance voice and data industry" and rising
competitive pressures from the regional Bell operating companies
BellSouth Corp., Qwest, SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon
Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Regional Bells "will be extremely competitive" in long-distance,
said Brad Dyslin, director of fixed-income research at Principal
Capital Income Investors in Des Moines, which invests $40 billion but
owns no AT&amp;T bonds. "Long-distance providers are severely
disadvantaged. The advent of wireless and the Internet has taken away
volume, and revenue that is not coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of consumer long-distance telephone service at AT&amp;T and
rivals such as WorldCom have slumped amid rising use of e-mail and
mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   Long-distance call rates have dropped to as low as 2 cents a
minute. "It's a very, very competitive business; companies are
practically giving away long-distance," said John Cassady, who
doesn't hold AT&amp;T debt in the $4 billion he helps manage at Fifth
Third Investment Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said, "The downgrade will have no
practical effect on the way we conduct our business. We do expect to
improve our margins in our growth businesses, specifically data and
managed services."</TE>
<TE>   But the reduction will cost AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   The company in November became the first U.S. issuer to agree to
pay higher interest on its bonds if its credit ratings declined. A
two-level downgrade by Moody's may cost the phone company 0.5
percentage points on the $10.1 billion of bonds it sold at the time,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will raise interest costs," said Cory Jackson, an analyst who
follows AT&amp;T debt at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "They
definitely face a challenging environment."</TE>
<TE>   The coupon on the $2.75 billion of bonds due in 2031 would rise to
8.5% from 8%. The $2.75 billion of notes maturing in 2011 would carry
a coupon of 7.8%, up from 7.3% at the time of the sale. A cut to junk
could, under some conditions, allow bondholders to force AT&amp;T to buy
back the entire $10 billion of bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong racked up $65 billion of debt
to build AT&amp;T into the biggest U.S. cable television company and sell
cable TV, phone and wireless services under one roof. Armstrong was
forced to reverse that strategy as its business declined and its
stock price tumbled.</TE>
<TE>   In December, he agreed to sell AT&amp;T's cable business to Comcast
Corp. for $72 billion. That sale, while reducing debt, will leave
AT&amp;T without one of its best-performing businesses, Moody's analyst
Robert Ray said.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T will have about $20 billion of debt after the cable sale.
Much of AT&amp;T's obligations don't come due until 2006, 2011 and 2031.</TE>

<HD>Deposit Insurance Hike Could Cost Savers</HD>
<DH>Banking: Expense of increasing federally insured limit to
$130,000 probably would be passed on to consumers, congressional
study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A congressional study released Wednesday said raising federal bank
deposit insurance would cost financial institutions $3.5 billion over
10 years--an expense that probably would be passed on to savers.</LD>
<LD>   Increasing insurance caps would require financial institutions to
pay greater premiums to cover expected losses from increased
protection as well as to maintain government insurance funds at
required levels, the Congressional Budget Office said.</LD>
<LD>   "That $3.5-billion rise in costs to the banking system over 10
years would most likely be passed on to consumers through a
combination of increased service charges and lower interest rates on
bank deposits," the CBO said.</LD>
<TE>   Congress is considering legislation that would boost the size of
bank deposits covered under federal insurance to at least $130,000
per account and revamp the way banks pay into the insurance fund.</TE>
<TE>   The House passed the measure last week by a vote of 408 to 18. The
Senate Banking Committee has held one hearing on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO study of the potential effects of raising the insured
amount of deposits was commissioned by the ranking minority member of
the Senate banking panel, Phil Gramm (R-Texas). Gramm opposes
increasing insurance caps.</TE>
<TE>   "The CBO analysis shows that this legislation would benefit no one
other than a very narrow segment of wealthy Americans," Gramm said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of boosting deposit insurance note it has not been
raised since 1980, when it was lifted to the current $100,000 on
individual deposits, from $40,000. They said it would provide
convenience to savers who have to divide their funds among several
accounts to benefit from full coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters also said raising the caps would attract more deposits
to banks and thrifts, and could increase the competitiveness of small
banks, which are more dependent on deposits than large banks.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, said raising the caps on
guaranteed deposits would encourage banks to make riskier loans and
investments.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO study concluded that raising the coverage limit would
provide modest benefits to a small number of depositors and trigger a
small increase in the total volume of bank deposits. But the rise
would deliver few benefits to small banks and raise the cost of
insurance "significantly" for depository institutions and depositors,
the CBO said.</TE>

<HD>El Paso to Reduce Energy-Trading Activities, Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Paso Corp., the biggest U.S. natural-gas pipeline owner, said
Wednesday that it slashed its 2002 profit forecast, cut
energy-trading jobs by half and plans to sell assets and $1.5 billion
in stock to raise cash and trim debt.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso shares plunged 23%, the biggest decline since the company
went public in 1992. The stock is down 36% since December, when rival
energy trader Enron Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection and sparked
a decline in energy companies such as Dynegy Inc., Williams Cos. and
Mirant Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive William Wise is backing away from energy trading a
year after he opened 80,000 square feet of offices for 500 traders in
Houston.</LD>
<TE>   El Paso has been selling assets to reduce debt, including $2
billion in off-balance-sheet liabilities created through partnerships
similar to those used by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso said it expects to earn $2.60 to $2.75 a share this year,
down from $3.33, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call. The stock fell $8.26 to $27.01 on the New York
Stock Exchange, a 31/2-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based El Paso is cutting 300 positions from the trading
unit, or 2% of its total work force, and people from other units will
be fired later, a spokeswoman said. El Paso has 15,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is probing charges that
El Paso withheld capacity on its pipelines to California when prices
soared in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In other energy industry news:</TE>
<TE>   * CMS Energy Corp. said it plans to sell its oil and gas
exploration and production unit and exit that business.</TE>
<TE>   CMS plans to auction CMS Oil &amp; Gas Co., which has properties in
the Permian Basin of West Texas and in Cameroon, the Republic of
Congo, Colombia, Eritrea, Tunisia and Venezuela. CMS said the
proceeds would add to the $2.4 billion it has raised toward a target
of $2.9 billion in asset sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Dearborn, Mich.-based company has been shedding foreign assets
to reduce debt and to focus on its natural-gas pipeline network in
North America and energy trading.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of CMS fell 49 cents, or 2.6%, to $18.05 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Reliant Resources Inc., the energy-trading business being spun
off from Reliant Energy Inc., affirmed its 2002 earnings outlook amid
regulator probes of trading practices that led to the departure of
two executives.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources will earn $1.80 to $2 a share this year and
expects profit to grow 12% to 15% annually after the spinoff, the
company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources shares fell 49 cents, or 4.9%, to $9.50 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Renewable Energy, Bias Ban Gain in Exxon Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Exxon Mobil Corp. management Wednesday defeated a series of
contentious issues at the company's annual meeting, but shareholders
signaled rising support for promoting renewable energy and explicitly
banning discrimination against gays.</LD>
<LD>   The renewable-energy and antidiscrimination resolutions had
received fewer than 13% of shareholder votes in previous years, but
pulled 20.3% and 23.5% of the shares voted Wednesday, respectively,
according to the company's preliminary results.</LD>
<LD>   Exxon Chairman Lee R. Raymond attributed the increase in support
for the measures to endorsement from Institutional Shareholder
Services, which advises pension funds and other large investors. He
said the proposals would hurt Exxon Mobil's business.</LD>
<TE>   The renewable-energy resolution, offered by a Roman Catholic order
from Milwaukee, called on Exxon Mobil to issue a report by Sept. 1
outlining how it would promote renewable energy and include
alternatives to oil in the company's energy mix.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the resolution said Exxon Mobil lags behind global
rivals Royal Dutch/Shell and BP in developing alternative fuels. They
said the company was missing a long-term investment opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   The nondiscrimination resolution was offered by the New York City
Employees' Retirement System and would request that the board amend
Exxon Mobil's written employment policy to explicitly ban
discrimination based on sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials argued that their policy prohibits
discrimination of any kind and that nothing more explicit is needed
to protect gay employees.</TE>

<HD>Hilton Cuts Room-Revenue Forecast</HD>
<DH>Hotels: Company blames the expected 5% decrease on
depressed rates, a sign of continued weakness in the sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG YOUNG</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp. on Wednesday lowered its second-quarter
room-revenue forecast, becoming the industry's second major player in
two weeks to trim its outlook amid signs the sector's recovery is
stalling.</LD>
<LD>   Hilton said it expects room revenue for hotels it owns, a widely
watched industry barometer, to fall about 5% in the second quarter
from a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The revision was a significant downgrade from Hilton's previous
forecast of a 1% to 2% drop announced last month when the Beverly
Hills-based company released first-quarter results.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the downgrade, Hilton said it expects to earn about
$300million, or about 20 cents a share, before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and noncash items.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton blamed its lowered room-revenue outlook on depressed room
rates, which combine with occupancy rates to generate the overall
room-revenue figure.</TE>
<TE>   The company did not say whether the weaker-than-expected second
quarter will affect its full-year outlook for a 2% to 3% gain in room
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Its reduced revenue outlook comes nine days after rival Marriott
International Inc. said its second-quarter room revenue will come in
at the lower end of its April forecast of a 5% to 7% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Both Marriott and Hilton were quick to add that healthy margins
obtained through strict cost controls would keep previous
second-quarter earnings forecasts on track despite weak revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton said strong demand for its time-share units also would help
it meet its second-quarter earnings goals.</TE>
<TE>   The broader industry weakness was reflected in a revised report
released Wednesday by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which said it expects
U.S. hotel room revenue to decline by 0.7% this year, contrasted with
a previous forecast of a 3% gain.</TE>
<TE>   The report blamed the weakness on a slower-than-expected economic
recovery and continued sluggishness in business travel.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the downgrade was not unexpected in light of a
recent stall in the hotel industry's rebound, which was stronger than
expected after the depths reached in the initial weeks of the
post-Sept. 11 travel slump.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center put a chill on
travel nationwide, sending U.S. hotel room revenue down as much as
37%.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, business has recovered steadily and now most declines
are in the single digits.</TE>

<HD>ICN Board Majority Goes to Dissidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A record first quarter for ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. apparently was
not enough to preserve the influence of mercurial Chief Executive
Milan Panic on Wednesday as dissident shareholders gave Panic's
opponents a clear majority on the company's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   The ICN board, which is being downsized from 12 to nine members,
will include six members who have strongly questioned Panic's
stewardship of the company he founded 42 years ago. The new board is
expected to move quickly to oust Panic as CEO.</LD>
<LD>   A bitter and expensive proxy fight had pitted three ICN- preferred
board candidates against a slate of outsiders nominated by Franklin
Mutual Advisers and Iridian Asset Management, two investor groups
that together hold more than 10% of the Costa Mesa drug maker's
stock. Three other dissidents had been elected to the ICN board last
year.</LD>
<TE>   Although ICN will not formally release the results of the proxy
fight until they have been certified, the company all but conceded at
a shareholders meeting that Panic had lost what was probably his last
battle to maintain control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can assume from the comments [made at the meeting]
that we are losing," said Alan F. Charles, executive vice president
for corporate relations at ICN.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Mutual Advisers and Iridian Asset Management claimed
victory in a statement released after the meeting. Sources at the
meeting said voting shareholders had favored the opposing slate of
candidates by a 3-to-1 margin.</TE>
<TE>   "The shareholders of ICN, in an extraordinary show of support for
our efforts and our slate, have delivered the clearest and most
direct message possible of their profound unhappiness with the status
quo at ICN," Franklin and Iridian said.</TE>
<TE>   In an hourlong speech at the shareholders meeting, Panic was
unclear about how he would accept the vote, alternately rattling his
saber and extending an olive branch for "an orderly transition."</TE>
<TE>   At another point, Panic said he would "viciously and vigorously
defend if anything [negative] affects this company."</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, Panic has survived government investigations,
sexual harassment accusations and attempts by shareholders to limit
his power.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predicted that the new board majority would accelerate
the push for breaking ICN into three companies, a process that began
this year with the initial public offering of its Ribapharm Inc.
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Observers differed on whether the proxy fight had larger
implications for the pharmaceutical industry or other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a unique case because Panic is unique," said Arnhold &amp; S.
Bleichroeder analyst Richard R. Stover, who did not view the board
changes positively. "You knew where things were going with Panic.
With these new board members, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Fariba Ghodsian, managing director and head of health-care
research for Roth Capital Partners, disagreed, noting: "It will
provide more independent thinking for the company."</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Goldfarb, senior managing director and general counsel
to Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., a proxy firm that has
represented both company interests and those of dissidents in proxy
fights, called the board battle a sign that shareholders in general
have decided to make their interests and influence known, rather than
just sell shares when they disagree with board or company policies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no shame in speaking up and expressing your doubts in
this post-Enron environment," Goldfarb said, referring to the energy
trader whose collapse left shareholders holding near- worthless
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Panic drew fresh criticism from dissidents last month when he was
awarded a $33.1-million bonus for his role in the recent spinoff of
Ribapharm.</TE>
<TE>   ICN representatives said Panic did not receive stock in Ribapharm.
Instead, the board awarded the cash bonus to Panic, along with
bonuses totaling about $17 million to 12 other executives and
directors.</TE>
<TE>   ICN had reported a 60% jump in first-quarter net income as
royalties more than doubled for its biggest product, the hepatitis C
drug ribavirin.</TE>
<TE>   The drug maker, which also sells antibiotics, sedatives, vitamins
and cosmetic lasers, earned 40 cents a share, beating Wall Street
estimates averaging 36 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Panic said he expected second-quarter earnings to exceed Wall
Street estimates of 43 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   On the day, ICN shares fell 15 cents to $27.80 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Impax Wins Round in Battle Over Claritin-D</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Firm gets tentative OK for a generic
version, awaits final FDA approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HAYWARD</DL>
<LD>Impax Laboratories Inc. on Wednesday won tentative regulatory
approval for a generic version of Schering-Plough Corp.'s allergy
drug Claritin-D, sending its shares up 3.8%.</LD>
<LD>   Final Food and Drug Administration approval depends on the outcome
of a patent lawsuit Schering-Plough brought against Impax, the
expiration of a stay preventing approval of a generic for 30 months
when a patent-infringement suit is filed and the expiration of any
generic marketing exclusivity, Impax said.</LD>
<LD>   Rival Andrx Corp. was the first generic-drug maker to seek
approval for the 24-hour extended release form of the drug, which
would give that company a six-month head start in the market before
other generic versions were allowed under FDA rules, said Barry
Edwards, co-chief executive of Impax.</LD>
<TE>   Claritin-D had annual U.S. sales of about $539 million for the 12
months ended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Impax, which had sales of $6.6 million last year, is seeking FDA
permission to sell generic copies of 15 brand-name products,
including Aventis' allergy medicine Allegra.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough's lawsuit says Impax's November 2000 filing with
the FDA violated two patents covering Claritin. Those patents don't
expire until 2004 and 2014, Schering-Plough alleged in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Impax, based in Hayward, Calif., rose 30 cents to $8.20
on Nasdaq. The shares have lost more than 30% of their value in the
last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Schering-Plough fell 5 cents to $26.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>College Loan Rates to Hit New Lows</HD>
<DH>Lending: On July 1, federal aid cost will drop to 4.06% for
students, 4.86% for their parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost of federal student loans is about to fall for most borrowers
from already historic lows, the Education Department said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   On July 1, the annualized interest rate on government-backed
student loans will automatically fall to 4.06% from 5.99%. Parents
borrowing to finance their children's schooling will see their rate
drop to 4.86% from 6.79%.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's rates were the lowest since the student loan program
began in 1965 with a rate of 7%.</LD>
<TE>   Loans are issued at a variable rate that resets each July 1, based
on short-term Treasury security interest rates at the end of May.</TE>
<TE>   The interest rate drops apply to so-called Stafford loans for
students and PLUS loans for parents that were disbursed on or after
July 1, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Loans obtained before then also could benefit from the lower rates
if consolidated. But borrowers thinking of consolidating should
examine their options, said Sally Stroup, assistant secretary for
post-secondary education.</TE>
<TE>   "These rates are for the whole year. They don't need to race out
and do it the first day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   New borrowers also should be aware that, because loan rates are
revised annually, future loan costs could rise sharply if market
interest rates increase with a stronger economy. However, by law
Stafford loan rates can't rise above 8.25%.</TE>
<TE>   Repayment of Stafford loans begins six months after graduation.
PLUS loans are repaid immediately, like credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 8,000 colleges, universities and vocational schools may
take part in the U.S. loan program.</TE>

<HD>Smaller-Company Shares Slide, but Gold Hits a High</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Selling in sector that had been a market
bright spot raises concern. Near-term futures of the precious metal
climb to $325.50.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks tripped again Wednesday, but this time smaller shares bore the
brunt of the selling--raising questions about the potential for a
deeper sell-off in that recently hot sector.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, Treasury bond yields slid on the heels of strong
demand at the government's sale of new two-year notes. Gold rose
further, hitting a 4 1/2-year high. The dollar's slump continued.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the Dow industrials gyrated in a narrow range for
most of the session and closed down 58.54 points, or 0.6%, at
9,923.04. It was the blue-chip index's third straight loss.</LD>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite also fell for a third
session, losing 27.78 points, or 1.7%, to 1,624.39, hurt by a sharp
slide in shares of Cisco Systems and another drop in semiconductor
shares.</TE>
<TE>   More disconcerting to some analysts was the 0.9% decline in the
Standard &amp; Poor's index of 600 smaller stocks.</TE>
<TE>   That index has fallen in six of the last seven sessions, and at
243.86 on Wednesday was the lowest since late March.</TE>
<TE>   Another small-stock index, the Russell 2,000, fell 1% on Wednesday
and also has dropped in six of the last seven sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks, especially of non-tech companies, had been a
bright spot in the market this year, as many investors hunted for new
ideas amid accounting scandals at bigger firms and the continuing
bear market in tech shares.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 600 index still is up 5% year-to-date, compared with a 7%
drop in the blue-chip S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the selling in smaller stocks could just be a mild
bout of profit-taking. But they said it bears watching because a
sharper decline could suggest that investors are losing faith even in
market sectors that have generated profits this year.</TE>
<TE>   The market overall struggled Wednesday after another major
company--oilfield services firm Halliburton--disclosed that the
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its accounting.
Halliburton shares dropped as low as $17.90, then rebounded slightly
to end the trading session at $18.72, down 63 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech sector, semiconductor-equipment maker Novellus Systems
dropped $3.27 to $43.40 after the company raised its second-quarter
orders forecast but failed to indicate whether the improvement would
carry over to the third quarter. The SOX chip-stock index stumbled
3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Cisco slid 73 cents to $15.65. An analyst at brokerage
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein downgraded the stock to "sell" from
"hold," citing worries about the computer networker's profit margins
and stock option compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 21 to 13 on Nasdaq and by 9 to 7 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to get investors excited on a sustained basis
about putting their money into stocks," said Charles G. Crane,
strategist at Victory SBSF Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   The weakening dollar continued to be a negative for stocks,
discouraging foreign investors from buying U.S. shares. The euro rose
to a 14-month high against the dollar, reaching 93.7 cents, up from
92.9 cents Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Global investors' conclusion increasingly is that "there are
better places in the world to park your money" than in the U.S., Dori
Levanoni, head of currency research at First Quadrant in Pasadena,
told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment also is helping to fuel gold's rally, analysts
said. Near-term gold futures in New York rose $1.40 to $325.50 an
ounce. The metal traded as high as $327.30 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing another wave of fund buying" of gold, Peter Merritt,
head of precious-metals trading at HSBC Holdings in New York, told
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Increased tensions between India and Pakistan, both nuclear
powers, and the unresolved conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians also have boosted the metal's appeal as a safe haven.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dollar's weakness, the Treasury bond market rallied.
The yield on the 10-year T-note dipped to 5.06% from 5.13% on Tuesday
and is at its lowest level since May 7.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury market was buoyed after the government received more
bids than expected for a record $27-billion sale of two-year notes.
The yield was 3.27%.</TE>

<HD>Philip Morris Said to Be Near Deal to Sell Miller</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK LAKE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Philip Morris Cos. is close to an agreement to sell its Miller
Brewing Co. to South African Breweries for about $3 billion, people
familiar with the transaction said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   An announcement of the purchase is expected to come as early as
today, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   SAB would pay $3 billion in stock and assume $2 billion in debt
from Miller, the maker of Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft, the
sources said. The board of London-based SAB met Wednesday to review
the transaction, they said.</LD>
<TE>   SAB Chief Executive Graham Mackay is betting he can turn around
more than two decades of falling market share at Miller, which failed
to counter the catchy ads and expanded distribution network of
Anheuser-Busch Cos., analysts said. Mackay has spent about $2 billion
in two years to buy rivals in emerging markets such as China as sales
fell in South Africa, SAB's biggest market.</TE>
<TE>   "Miller gives SAB massive exposure to the U.S. beer market," said
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Martin Feldman, who rates Philip Morris
"near-term strong buy" and doesn't own any shares.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Chaloner, a spokesman for SAB, and Miller's Scott Bussen
declined to comment. Philip Morris also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   SAB had confirmed in early April that it was in talks to buy
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris, based in New York, rose 91 cents to $56.01 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 5.3% since the talks
were confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Miller would give SAB income in dollars, investors said, and that
would help SAB counter declines in South Africa, where a more than
50% slide in the rand has contributed to two straight years of
falling profit.</TE>
<TE>   For Philip Morris, the sale is a "positive strategic move," said
analyst Keith Patriquin of Loomis Sayles &amp; Co., whose $65 billion in
assets includes 116,469 Philip Morris shares.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's share of the U.S. beer market has fallen in six of the
last seven years even as marketing spending increased. Its sales fell
to 40.6 million barrels in 2001, or 19.7% of the U.S. market, from
44.2 million, or 21.6%, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The company accounted for 4.7% of Philip Morris' $89.9 billion in
sales last year. In the first quarter, Miller's U.S. shipments to
retailers rose 1.6% to 9.5 million barrels. Operating income for the
unit rose 4.8% to $130 million.</TE>

<HD>Nortel Predicting a Narrower Loss</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm, which says it will have another round of
staff reductions, also trimmed its revenue forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA</DL>
<LD>Nortel Networks Corp. said Wednesday that it was on track for a
narrower loss in the second quarter, but announced plans for 3,500
more job cuts and further asset sales, including its once highflying
fiber optics unit.</LD>
<LD>   The company, mired in a telecom slump, also pared its revenue
forecast and cut its break-even sales target to $3.2 billion from
$3.5 billion by the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Nortel shares, which initially rose on the announcement, ended the
session down 17 cents, or nearly 7%, at $2.35 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Largely expected by the market, the move to cut an additional 8%
of Nortel's work force was seen as good news, analysts said, but a
dismal outlook for recovery and the slight reduction of its sales
forecast were not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of it is stuff that anybody who has been watching the
company should have realized" was coming, said Sanford Bernstein
analyst Paul Sagawa, who has a "buy" rating on the stock, which he
calls cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel, which sells equipment for wireless, Internet and phone
networks, said its second-quarter pro forma net loss from continuing
operations will narrow from that of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But it wavered on its revenue estimates from its previous forecast
of flat growth. Sales expectations range from flat to down 5% from
first-quarter sales of $2.91 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel also does not forecast a recovery for the long-haul fiber
optics sector until late 2003 or early 2004. In response, as well as
shedding staff, it will sell or cut back its optical components unit,
once a huge growth business the company had considered spinning off
in a public offering.</TE>
<TE>   Technology such as optical switches and network management tools
will be maintained in the overhaul, which should be complete by the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks will further shrink Nortel's work force to about
42,000. Nortel has slashed its payroll from a peak of 94,500 at the
end of 2000.</TE>

<HD>Occidental Says Sempra Breached Contract</HD>
<DH>Utilities: The partners in the Elk Hills power plant are at
odds over the deal with the Department of Water Resources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental Petroleum Corp. said that Sempra Energy, its partner on a
power plant under construction in Kern County, cut it out of a
$6.6-billion contract to sell power to California.</LD>
<LD>   The Elk Hills power plant is the subject of a separate dispute
between Sempra and the California Department of Water Resources that
surfaced after Occidental filed its complaint. The state agency said
Sempra lied about plans to complete the power plant by this year so
it would win the 10-year electricity contract.</LD>
<LD>   Occidental said Sempra breached a contract to develop and manage
the plant for the benefit of both partners.</LD>
<TE>   The suit seeks a court order to give Occidental part of the
multibillion-dollar contract as well as more than $100 million in
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra, among other things, breached its duties by "representing
its own interest rather than those of the project in negotiations
with CDWR," according to the amended complaint filed March 29 in Kern
County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   In early April, California's dispute with Sempra became public.
The state threatened to cancel the Sempra contract, saying the
company failed to complete on schedule a generating unit at Elk
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra on Tuesday filed suit in San Diego Superior Court seeking
to block possible termination of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra declined to comment on the suit, said spokesman Tom
Murnane.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra has said it is fulfilling the contract.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, Los Angeles-based Occidental and San Diego-based
Sempra agreed to split the costs of building the Elk Hills power
plant and share ownership of the project, according to the suit.
Sempra, an owner and marketer of utilities, agreed to market the
plant's power supply.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental also said that Sempra thwarted its attempt to sell its
interest in the Elk Hills project.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental said it ended talks with Aquila Inc. after Sempra made
an offer to pay $51 million for Occidental's stake. Sempra then
allegedly offered a "vastly lower revised price," according to the
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sempra fell 52 cents to $24.95, and Occidental shares
fell 5 cents to $30.16, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Shareholders Spurn Execs in Proxy Votes</HD>
<DH>Survey: More investors are questioning corporate governance
and backing resolutions that go against management's wishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angered by two years of bear market losses in stocks and a surge in
corporate scandals, investors are voting in favor of
shareholder-sponsored resolutions at a record pace this year.</LD>
<LD>   The nonbinding resolutions, which give shareholders a chance to
sound off on such issues as stock option plans, executive severance
packages and the separation of auditing and consulting contracts,
have gotten a majority of votes cast in 39% of this year's elections
at annual meetings, according to a proxy advisory service that tracks
the measures.</LD>
<LD>   Though this year's tally isn't complete, the results so far exceed
the previous record 25% approval rate of two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The voting suggests a significant shift in the relationship
between big investors and corporate managers. Many investors in the
past have been reluctant to buck corporate management when it comes
to proxy voting. Unhappy investors said they were more likely to sell
their shares than lodge a protest vote.</TE>
<TE>   But in the post-Enron Corp. era, more investors appear eager to
send a message to managers about undesirable practices.</TE>
<TE>   The vote survey by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in
Washington covers resolutions related to corporate governance issues
at 2,000 of the largest U.S. companies but excludes those focusing on
so-called social issues such as sweatshop wages, which can generate
strong debate but almost never get a majority vote of shareowners.</TE>
<TE>   The IRRC so far has tallied results of 122 resolutions, of which
48 have gotten a majority of votes cast. In nearly all of the cases,
management asked shareholders to vote no on the measures.</TE>
<TE>   The group still is gathering data or awaiting votes on 161 other
resolutions. Most shareholder votes are taken at companies'
springtime annual meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Consultants and activist shareholders say the biggest surprise has
been the success of first-time resolutions, such as one sponsored by
pension giant TIAA-CREF that urged software maker Mentor Graphics
Corp. to require shareholder approval of future employee stock option
plans. Historically, resolutions have needed years of repeated
campaigning to gain traction with shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Mentor stock owners approved the measure with 57% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions calling for annual, rather than staggered, elections
of directors and measures opposing anti-takeover plans known as
"poison pills" have been popular with shareholders for several years.
But this year, resolutions covering topics such as auditor
independence and executive "golden parachutes" also have met with
success.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is shaping up to be quite extraordinary," said Ann
Yerger, research director at the Council of Institutional Investors,
a Washington group that represents large pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The trend for several years has been that an increasing number of
resolutions are passing, but this season is unusual in that a number
of victories have come in less-traditional provinces," Yerger said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would have predicted that a golden-parachute proposal at
Bank of America Corp. would be successful, for example, or that a
pay-related proposal would get a majority vote at UAL Corp., which is
predominantly owned by its employees," she said. "The Mentor Graphics
vote was remarkable for a first-ever proposal."</TE>
<TE>   At BofA, a majority of investors requested that management support
limiting exit pay to double an executive's annual salary, and UAL
investors voted to urge the company to separate the chairman and
chief executive positions, to link executive pay with rebuilding the
downsized airline and to require shareholder approval of future
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Many big investors such as mutual funds and pension funds view
staggered boards and poison pills as protecting entrenched board
members and corporate management at the expense of most shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to resolutions on poison pills and staggered boards,
the most common proposals this year have sought to increase board or
board-committee independence and to bar auditors from also doing
consulting work for the firm, said Carol Bowie, director of
governance research at the IRRC.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this year's discontent can be attributed to the stock
market downturn that began in spring 2000, activists said.</TE>
<TE>   "Activism by dissident shareholders becomes proportionally easier
the deeper the bear market," said Robert Chapman, who runs the
activist hedge fund Chap-Cap Partners in Los Angeles. "In a bull
market, you could have Mr. Magoo as CEO supported by the Seven Dwarfs
as directors, and the shareholders would back them. But in a bear
market, everybody is looking for a savior, and that's where the
activist comes in."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate arrogance and scandal symbolized by the fall of energy
trader Enron also have been key factors in rousing shareholders,
activists said.</TE>
<TE>   "Money managers are being much more careful" in voting, said Damon
Silvers, associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO. "Enron and some of
the other disasters have created a well of skepticism about corporate
management."</TE>
<TE>   Though proxy votes are almost always nonbinding and usually "less
than a handful" are followed by management, according to Yerger,
several big companies have taken steps this year to address
shareholder concerns--in some cases preemptively rendering
resolutions moot.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., Motorola Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. took
steps this spring to bar their auditors from also performing
consulting work, an overlapping practice that critics say creates a
conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Mattel Inc., still smarting from criticism of former CEO
Jill Barad's $50-million send-off in early 2000, revised its policy
on exit packages, promising to consider the effect of such deals on
worker morale.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the victories, activists still are meeting with mixed
results in pushing for corporate change.</TE>
<TE>   At computer maker Gateway Inc., a proposal by the California
Public Employees' Retirement System for annual elections of directors
was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   At data storage leader EMC Corp., investors backed a proposal
calling for a more independent board but spurned one calling for more
ethnic and gender diversity among its directors.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's antitrust watchdog said it has launched an investigation of
anti-competitive practices in the retail sector, apparently based on
complaints filed against powerhouse Wal-Mart de Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Competition Commission announced in the official Daily
Gazette that it is looking into alleged monopolistic practices, such
as contracts that unfairly displace competitors and certain pricing
conditions it gets from suppliers.</LD>
<LD>   Distributors filed a complaint against Walmex, accusing the
leading retailer of threatening to hold back purchases unless it
received certain price conditions.</LD>
<TE>   Executives at Walmex, which is majority owned by U.S. retailing
giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc., were not available for comment. The
company has said it would cooperate with the investigation.</TE>

<LD>A judge thew out part of Courtney Love's suit against Geffen Records
but said the lead singer for the rock band Hole can press a claim
that her contract was breached.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Fumiko Wasserman's
five-page ruling came three weeks after attorneys presented oral
arguments in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Wasserman found unconvincing Love's argument that a labor code
section allowing record companies to sue recording artists for
damages was invalid and unconstitutional.</LD>

the recording agreement by failing to pay royalties."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. is exploring the idea of selling
nonfood items in its restaurants to drive up sales beyond its
mainstay hamburgers, fries and soft drinks.</LD>
<LD>   As part of its long-term growth strategy, McDonald's is "looking
at concepts that might go beyond restaurants, which could involve
retail extension," spokesman Walt Riker said.</LD>
<LD>   Any venture into retailing would not materialize for at least two
years, he said.</LD>

<LD>HealthSouth Corp. scaled back its venture with Oracle Corp. to build
an automated hospital because the software maker couldn't meet
hospital deadlines, HealthSouth Chief Executive Richard Scrushy said.</LD>
<LD>   Siemens, Germany's largest electronics company, has replaced
Oracle as supplier of some of the computer systems for the
$200-million "digital hospital" in Birmingham, Ala., Scrushy said.</LD>
<LD>   Oracle shares, which have tumbled 45% in the last year, fell 54
cents to $8.40. HealthSouth shares fell 35 cents to $13.73 and have
risen 8.1% the last year. Both trade on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>   The White House's Office of Management and Budget asked the Office

administration said should require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to
publicly disclose information required of publicly traded companies
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "Even though they are not subject to direct SEC oversight, as
publicly traded companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be
subject to no lesser standard than applies to other companies," said
John Graham, regulatory affairs administrator at the OMB.</LD>

<LD>   The complaint claims that Latino employees at Cox's Georgetown,
Texas, office "suffered repeated slurs, threats and derogatory
insults" because of their national origin.</LD>
<TE>   Cox spokeswoman Amy Cohn wouldn't comment, saying the company
hasn't read the suit.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Says It's Ready for Long-Distance Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. will seek approval to sell
long-distance service in part of its 14-state region, saying it has
shown its system is open to competition in local calling.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest, which provides local service to most of the Northwest and
the Rocky Mountain region, plans to file applications with the
Federal Communications Commission by mid-June to provide
long-distance service in Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota and
Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   A report made public Wednesday shows results of tests conducted by
regulators in 13 of Qwest's states. Arizona conducted tests
separately.</LD>
<TE>   Regulators monitored transactions to test Qwest's ability to
process orders to switch customers to a rival service and provide
repairs. Qwest satisfied 645 of 685 components of its system that
were tested, said Steve Davis, senior vice president of policy and
law.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're required to do is effectively open our network to
competitors, and the test conclusively shows we've done that," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors said Qwest fell short in some areas, including pricing
for competitors to gain network access. AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
urged regulators to consider whether customers truly have a choice of
local phone service before supporting Qwest's long-distance efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Any Qwest claim that it is ready for long-distance approval based
on this test clearly is premature," said Jim Lewis, WorldCom senior
vice president of public policy.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado regulators said they would have to rearrange their
schedule for determining their recommendation on a long-distance
application.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest was barred from offering long-distance service in the region
when it acquired local phone provider US West in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest shares closed down 14 cents to $5.06 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of equipment that
directs Internet traffic, fell 4.5% after a Merrill Lynch analyst
raised concerns about the company's reserves in case customers do not
pay. Cisco shares fell 73 cents, or 4.46%, to $15.65 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Ariane Mahler
downgraded her rating on the stock to "sell" from "hold," citing
questions about Cisco's gross profit margins, stock option
compensation and off-balance sheet commitments.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Lynch analyst Samuel Wilson raised a "yellow flag" on
Cisco's allowance for doubtful accounts, which has risen to its
highest levels ever both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
gross receivables.</LD>
<TE>   Cisco said it has not changed its approach on reserves, which it
characterized as conservative.</TE>

<HD>One-Third of Tires May Fail Stricter Standards</HD>
<DH>Safety: Regulators say new rules will save lives, but tire
makers contend that tests are too severe and will cost too much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About a third of the 287 million passenger car and truck tires sold
in the United States every year might fail new standards spurred by
the Firestone tire crisis, according to U.S. auto safety regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that
although some tires would have to be redesigned, the new rules could
save 27 lives and prevent 667 injuries a year from crashes caused by
blowouts or other tire failures. It also estimates the standards
would cost the tire industry $282 million annually.</LD>
<LD>   Tire makers contend that the rules are unnecessarily severe and
would cost the industry far more than NHTSA estimates. The agency had
a June 1 deadline for a decision, but the debate has pushed the
deadline back indefinitely--one of several delays the agency faces in
putting new safety rules in place.</LD>
<TE>   "We agree with NHTSA that tire tests need to be updated," said Dan
Zielinski, spokesman for the Rubber Manufacturers Assn. "We just
think they need to be more reflective of real-world conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The 271 deaths and more than 800 injuries linked to tread
separation and other failures of tires made by Bridgestone Corp.'s
Firestone unit, mostly on Ford Motor Co. Explorer sport utility
vehicles, spurred Congress to order a rewrite of federal tire
standards that have not changed since 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The Firestone tires were found to have manufacturing defects that
left them susceptible to losing their tread, especially at high
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Although data on tire-related crashes are sketchy, NHTSA estimates
that about 414 deaths and 10,275 injuries a year might be caused by
tire failures. NHTSA's research also found that heat is a common
factor in all tire failures, with the highest rate of accidents in
Southern states during summer.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the new tests would be tougher versions of current
measures, such as doubling the length of the endurance test to 3,278
miles.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also required NHTSA to order all new vehicles to come
with a tire-pressure monitor. But because many owners will not check
their tire pressure until the monitor goes off, the agency wants
tires to perform for a short time at low inflation levels to ensure
an extra margin of safety.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed test would take the tires from the endurance test and
run them under-inflated for 90 minutes at speeds up to 99 mph.</TE>
<TE>   All the new standards combined would flunk 33% of current tires,
according to limited tests conducted by NHTSA. It also warned that
its tests found wide differences in the performance of tires that
should have been identical.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubber Manufacturers Assn. also has proposed less stringent
tests that NHTSA says all modern tires probably would pass.</TE>

<HD>CEO of Vivendi Gains Layer of Oversight as Debt Mounts</HD>
<DH>Media: Committee led by Bronfman will monitor Messier as he
attempts to reassure investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an eight-hour meeting Wednesday with his frustrated bosses,
Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier emerged with a
new layer of oversight, by a committee led by one of the
conglomerate's most powerful shareholders, and a mandate to slash the
corporation's mounting debt.</LD>
<LD>   The corporate governance committee created by Vivendi's board of
directors will be co-chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr., vice chairman of
the Vivendi board. The Bronfman family owns 5.3% of Vivendi and has
been unhappy about a significant falloff in its holdings as Vivendi's
stock has dropped 45% this year amid investor concerns over the
company's strategy and high debt load.</LD>
<LD>   Bronfman's heightened role comes only six months after he cut his
day-to-day ties to Vivendi Universal. Bronfman headed Universal when
it was owned by his family's Seagram Co., which sold the studio to
Vivendi 18 months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Assisting Bronfman will be Marc Vienot, former chief executive of
Societe Generale, who had expressed support for Messier at the
company's tumultuous shareholder meeting last month in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said in a statement after Wednesday's marathon meeting in
New York that it was Messier's idea to create the committee, which
the company said would address "the best international practices" in
corporate governance, but declined to discuss specifics. A source
close to the board said one of the committee's key tasks would be to
monitor Messier's management of the company as it attempts to regain
investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Messier, Bronfman nor Vienot could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving from Paris to New York last year, Messier has faced a
barrage of setbacks in his homeland and in the U.S. He recently
inflamed the French establishment with the firing of a popular French
television executive.</TE>
<TE>   Some French board members also have been frustrated by Messier's
flamboyant style, his tendency to reverse previously announced
decisions and his growth-by-acquisition strategy.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., he has failed to win over investors, who are
skeptical about his multimedia vision of using cell phones and the
Internet as pipelines for movies, music and games.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, moreover, are confused by a company that has one foot
in the entertainment world and the other in the water distribution
and sewage treatment business.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company posted a $12.6-billion loss--the biggest in
French corporate history--because of a sharp decline in the value of
its Canal Plus and Seagram acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-member board includes some of France's most influential
businessmen, including Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint-Gobain;
Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton; and Serge Tchuruk, CEO of phone firm Alcatel.</TE>
<TE>   Some board members publicly rallied behind Messier amid
speculation that he was losing his grip on the company he has run
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish Jean-Marie Messier plenty of success and assure him of my
backing," Henri Lachmann, CEO of Schneider and a Vivendi board member
told Europe 1 radio Wednesday. "My backing sometimes comes with some
criticism, but never publicly."</TE>
<TE>   Support also came from Le Figaro, France's largest conservative
newspaper. Editor Yves de Chaisemartin praised Messier for taking
risks in an article titled "We must save Private Messier."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Diller, who heads the U.S. entertainment division of Vivendi
but is not a board member, told reporters gathered outside Vivendi's
New York offices, "I am a supporter of Messier." When asked whether
he might replace Messier, he said, "You must be joking."</TE>
<TE>   The rumors surrounding Messier come as Vivendi's debt ballooned to
$30 billion in the last two years as the former investment banker
orchestrated a series of high-profile acquisitions aimed at
transforming a 149-year-old water utility into a rival of AOL Time
Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, Messier presented a plan to reduce the
company's debt through the sale of peripheral businesses, including
reducing the company's stake in its utility business from 63% to
below 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would allow Vivendi to raise $1.7 billion in cash from
the proposed utility sale, which would also remove $14 billion of the
unit's debt from the company's balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's board said it supported the debt-reduction program but
declined to discuss specific candidates for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi also said the board "carried out a detailed examination"
of the company's financial targets and wants management to
"concentrate on implementing this strategy."</TE>
<TE>   The company could raise about $5.8 billion from the sale of
non-core assets, including the utility investment, wrote Gregory
Deschamps, an analyst with Oddo Pinatton, in a note to investors.</TE>
<TE>   That includes $900 million from the sale of Telepiu, its
money-losing pay television unit; $460 million from Numericable, a
French cable operator; and $325 million from Canal Plus Technologies,
a pay-TV software provider.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the board also decided not to schedule another
shareholder meeting. After its annual shareholder meeting in April,
Vivendi discovered that the electronic voting system had been
tampered with, affecting results for two key resolutions: one that
would have allowed the company to raise $2.7 billion by issuing new
shares, and one that would have allocated 5% of Vivendi's shares for
stock options for senior executives.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vivendi had court approval to put the resolutions to
another vote, the company reconsidered because of the expense of
holding another meeting and a reluctance to give Messier's critics
another platform, said sources close to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's American depositary receipts rose 5 cents to $31.57 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Deloitte Faces Suits, SEC Investigation</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Adelphia shareholders say auditors signed off
on financial statements that didn't reflect the cable company's
condition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deloitte &amp; Touche is facing a torrent of lawsuits from Adelphia
Communications Corp. shareholders who say the accounting firm should
have known about the cable company's undisclosed debt, lawyers said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Deloitte also is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the New York Times said.</LD>
<LD>   At least two of the more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits filed
against Adelphia list New York-based Deloitte as a co-defendant. The
SEC has started an inquiry into Deloitte's role as Adelphia's
auditor, the Times reported Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC and grand juries in two states are investigating
Adelphia's more than $3 billion in loans to partnerships controlled
by the family of company founder John Rigas.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations have decimated the company's stock, which
continued to plunge Wednesday, falling 84 cents to a record low of
$1.16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "Deloitte signed off on financial statements that did not reflect
the condition of the company," said Fred Isquith, a New York lawyer
who represents shareholders in one of the suits. "Deloitte's opinion
was reckless."</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte spokeswoman Deborah Harrington and Adelphia spokeswoman
Karen Chrosniak didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte was paid $3.4 million in fees by Adelphia in 2000,
including $1.3 million for audit work. Adelphia delayed filing its
2001 annual report to investigate the loans.</TE>
<TE>   Partnerships controlled by Rigas and other members of the founding
family received $3.1 billion in loans that were backed by the firm
and not disclosed to shareholders until March. The funds were used,
in part, to purchase Adelphia securities.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the responsibility of the auditor to stop people from using
public companies as their own bank account," said Wayne Shaw, a
professor of accounting at Southern Methodist University.</TE>

<HD>SEC Approves Plan to Link Options Markets</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved a plan
to start linking U.S. options exchanges by February so that customer
orders will be executed at the best available prices.</LD>
<LD>   The implementation plan, which was submitted by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange and other options markets, would end 3 1/2 years of
wrangling between the government and the exchanges. Last year, SEC
Chairman Harvey Pitt criticized the exchanges for delaying the
project, and set a deadline for them to come up with a timetable.</LD>
<LD>   The new plan calls for the five exchanges to begin testing, by
Dec. 1, the electronic linkage they are developing. They would have
to implement the first phase of the linkage by Feb. 1, and the second
and final phase by April 30.</LD>
<TE>   "This brings us one step closer to fruition of a project that can
help investors by bringing more efficiency to the market," Pacific
Exchange spokesman Dale Carlson said. The timetable approved today
amends a linkage plan approved by the SEC in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Stock "put" and "call" option contracts allow investors to make
big bets on stock moves with a relatively small investment.</TE>
<TE>   In the $650-billion options industry, dealers who are members of
one exchange sometimes have to use a telephone to access better
quotes on other markets, or make special arrangements with the other
exchanges. The process has been described as slow and unwieldy by
exchange officials.</TE>
<TE>   With linkages, dealers will be able to promptly match the best
available prices on any exchange. Investors are likely to benefit by
getting narrower spreads between options' buying and selling prices,
dealers have said. U.S. stock markets are already linked
electronically through the Intermarket Trading System.</TE>
<TE>   The options exchanges are the CBOE, American Stock Exchange, the
Pacific Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the
International Securities Exchange. They have picked the Options
Clearing Corp., a not-for-profit organization that they own, to set
up electronic links among themselves.</TE>

<HD>Overstock.com Latest 'Open-Auction' IPO</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment banker W.R. Hambrecht &amp; Co. brought the latest initial
public stock offering to market Wednesday, in another test of the
bank's controversial "open-auction" IPO system.</LD>
<LD>   Overstock.com, a Salt Lake City firm that sells discounted
electronics, sportswear and other products over the Internet, raised
$39 million by selling three million shares at $13 each. The stock
(ticker symbol: OSTK) will begin trading today on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Hambrecht's OpenIPO system is designed to allow companies to sell
their shares at the best price the market is demanding. By contrast,
most IPOs are priced by underwriters below what the market might be
willing to pay, experts say. The latter system is designed to give
stocks a boost once they begin trading, if investors who couldn't get
the deal bid aggressively in the market.</LD>
<TE>   Hambrecht has marketed its auction system as the best way for
companies to raise the maximum amount of capital in IPOs. Investors
have been warned by the firm that they shouldn't expect a first-day
"pop" in Hambrecht IPOs, because system is supposed to work against
that.</TE>
<TE>   OpenIPO hasn't been widely embraced in the market: Overstock.com
is Hambrecht's seventh deal since 1999.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Meade Instruments Corp.'s potential purchase of Celestron
International Corp., a rival maker of high-performance telescopes
used for star gazing and photography, should be blocked, the Federal
Trade Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC authorized its staff to seek a temporary restraining order
and a preliminary injunction against Meade, the largest U.S.
telescope provider, in federal court to pre-empt an attempt by Meade
"to purchase all, or certain assets, of" Tasco Holdings Inc.'s
Celestron telescopes, the nation's No. 2 telescope provider and the
only other manufacturer of Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes.</LD>
<LD>   The commission said a merger of the companies would eliminate
competition and create a monopoly in the market for the
high-performance, portable Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC filed the suit before a sale announcement because the
transaction might be too small to be reported under federal antitrust
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine-based Meade said it has cooperated with the FTC's inquiry
and remains interested in buying some Tasco assets even though
negotiations ended several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Meade rose 31 cents to close at 5.66 on Nasdaq before
the announcement.</TE>

<HD>Aluminum Foils the Beauty of Baseball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Bradley in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: "College baseball
is a sport ruined by an implement. The aluminum bat skews it beyond
recognition. The aluminum bat renders baseball, a game preciously
balanced between offense and defense, into Arena football.</LD>
<LD>   "The aluminum bat turns every ninth-place hitter into Mark
McGwire, every pitcher into a batting tee, every ballpark into Coors
Field.... Aluminum destroys the contours of baseball in a way that
basketball would be distorted if, all of a sudden, the rims were made
twice as wide."</LD>
<LD>   More on a bat idea: "Imagine the Splendid Splinter [Ted Williams]
with a metal wand. Could he have hit .506, .606, .706? Would he ever
have made an out?"</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for rebounds in a playoff
game?</TE>
<TE>   Lofty ambition: Chicago Cub slugger Sammy Sosa has apparently run
out of interesting people to meet. So he told the New York Post that
one name left on his "to meet" list is God.</TE>
<TE>   "I can meet any person and talk to any person in the whole wide
world because I'm a baseball player," Sosa said. "I'd like to meet
God. I feel like I already know him a little, but I'd like to meet
him and talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   Does God have time to talk to Cub players?</TE>
<TE>   Confident: Sacramento guard Mike Bibby said the Kings had a world
of confidence before Tuesday's playoff game with the Lakers. "We've
got the little swagger and feel like nobody can [mess] with us. And I
don't think anybody can."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Kings won Game 5 of the Western Conference finals and
are on the verge of eliminating the Lakers, it's difficult to argue
with him.</TE>
<TE>   He'd fit in: Ron Rapoport of the Chicago Sun-Times has an update
on the World Cup: "The New York Times says Osama bin Laden is a huge
soccer fan. Just what we need to hear. Attention, all immigration
officials. Keep an eye open for a tall guy inconspicuously disguised
as a British hooligan."</TE>
<TE>   Wishful thinking: Pat Tillman, who was making about $1 million a
year playing safety for the Arizona Cardinals, left the NFL behind
last week to join the Army and become a member of the elite Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Says David Whitley of the Orlando Sentinel: "Oh, for Osama bin
Laden to run a crossing pattern in front of Pvt. Tillman."</TE>
<TE>   Lucky lottery: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "Think Houston will want to start a Ming dynasty? Of course;
this isn't Rocket science. It's a no-brainer, which is exactly the
problem with Houston's starting center, Kelvin Cato."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1927, Chicago Cub shortstop Jimmy
Cooney pulled off an unassisted triple play. Remarkably, Detroit
first baseman Johnny Neun duplicated the feat the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain, 33, against Chicago on April 4,
1971.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Detroit Tigers staged an octopus-throwing contest
and the winner was rushed off to a Red Wing playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "If that doesn't underscore baseball's problems, I don't know what
does," says Keith Olbermann of ABC radio. "First prize in a contest
at a baseball game is--you get to leave the baseball game?"</TE>

merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,

exception: No products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: "Player's Journal"</LD>
<LD>   Channel: Lifetime</LD>
<TE>   When: Friday, 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The second season of "Player's Journal," a half-hour magazine show
on WNBA athletes, begins with a feature on this season's most high
profile rookie--Sue Bird.</TE>
<TE>   From her Long Island upbringing to her high school success in
Queens to the brilliant college career at Connecticut capped by this
year's 39-0 national championship season, Bird is portrayed as cool,
yet intense, with the gifts of a star yet a desire to fit in with the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Host and Academy Award winning actress Holly Hunter smartly avoids
playing pseudo journalist, introducing the show and closing it with a
quick tribute to Title IX, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary
in June. In between, Bird tells her own story interlaced with
interviews from former coaches, teammates, parents and acquaintances.
Considering Bird and teammates Asjha Jones, Tamika Williams and Swin
Cash shared an apartment at Connecticut, the anecdotes are fleeting
and unrevealing. The best examples given are of Bird's impatience, of
how "she'll walk away from you" without realizing it, according to
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   And while Bird's mother was given plenty of airtime, there were no
remarks from her father, even though Bird lived with him in Queens
when she went to Christ the King High after her parents divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise the show is no harm, no foul.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Bird's play has always been more compelling than her
personality.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father-and-son training duo of Wally and Craig Dollase has been
hot through the first five weeks of Hollywood Park's spring-summer
meet.</LD>
<LD>   The elder Dollase has won with five of his first 12 runners while
Craig has won with six of 20. He also had a big victory out of town
Monday, when Swept Overboard, an 11-1 shot who had been beaten as the
favorite in his previous two races in California, easily won the
$750,000 Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park.</LD>
<LD>   Both Dollases have a chance to improve on their win percentages
today.</LD>
<TE>   Craig will start probable favorite Pali Princess in the first, a
six-furlong race for $50,000 3-year-old fillies. She should be hard
to beat with the return to the main track, as she has won three of
her last four on dirt. Patrick Valenzuela, who leads the jockey
standings, will ride.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, a 1 1/16-mile contest for older maidens, father and
son will go head to head. Wally will send out favorite Pressure Play
while Craig will be represented by Ivan Motley.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old gelded son of Capote, Pressure Play has lost at 5-2
and 17-10 in his most recent races, but a duplication of his last
might be enough to get him his first win.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Motley, a 3-year-old Peaks and Valleys colt, was third in the
same race that Pressure Play exits. He was beaten by three lengths in
the fifth on May 11.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Magical Nature, victimized by a questionable ride
in her last start, will take on eight other 3-year-old fillies at a
mile on the turf in Hollywood Park's seventh race.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Laura De Seroux. The trainer won two Grade I races in
three days last weekend at Hollywood Park. She also has the pleasure
of looking after the nation's best female dirt runner (Azeri) and the
top female turfer (Astra).</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Certain pick-six players. Many serious bettors took a
big loss Monday when the pick six returned only $629.20 on a card
that had a $1-million guaranteed pool.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Youmakemethorbaby, Runaway
Susie and More No in the fifth; singling Pressure Play in the sixth;
using Orlass, Magical Nature and Thunder Island in the seventh and
Legend In Disguise, Ruth's Match Trick and Yesnoyesno in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/69. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $20.60/$404.80. Total money bet: $450.</TE>

<LD>Sammies White Chick will try to extend a lengthy streak in tonight's
seventh race.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old gray daughter of Chicks Beduino who has won three
times, Sammies Chick has been second or better in six consecutive
races. The only time she finished off the board was when she was
fourth in her debut Nov. 3, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Adan Farias for owner Felix Gonzalez, Sammies Chick was
impressive in her latest victory on May 9. Breaking from the outside
post in a field of nine, she won by 13/4 lengths going 350 yards.</LD>
<TE>   She drew the outside again tonight going 350 and will be ridden
for the first time by Dennis Means.</TE>
<TE>   Three races earlier, another sharp horse will try to extend his
win streak to three. Cielo Apache, a 4-year-old thoroughbred gelding,
will step up to the $5,000 level for trainer Felix Gonzalez after
winning for $2,500 on May 10 and for $3,200 eight days later.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Nothing No Personal. 2. Amazing Proof. 3. Devine
Diva. 4. Cielo Apache. 5. Talking Tactics. 6. Mustang Pilot. 7.
Sammies White Chick. 8. A Big Shot Of Brandy.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Noble Thunderstorm, Talking Tactics and My Traffic
Dasher in the fifth; Mustang Pilot, Run Cielo Run and Star's Wild in
the sixth; single Sammies White Chick in the seventh and use Dream
Harder, A Big Shot Of Brandy and Tst Mr Linster.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Willie Awesome adds Lasix for his second start
for trainer Jaime Gomez in the third. My Traffic Dasher gets a
confident boost in class in the fifth after being taken for $7,500 by
trainer Jose Antonio Flores on March 15.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I went to the Dodger game Wednesday afternoon and immediately noticed
a problem: I can't tell which players are on steroids.</LD>
<LD>   I don't know why baseball can't follow horse racing's lead, which
places an "L" next to the name of a horse running with Lasix, and a
circled "L" next to the name of a horse that's a first-time Lasix
user. Baseball could use "S"s.</LD>
<LD>   If the Brewers had two "S"s and one circled "S" due up in the top
of the ninth inning, my gosh, the anticipation, the excitement, and
I'd sure like to think that Manager Jim Tracy would go to his top
"S."</LD>
<TE>   When I asked Tracy after the game which of his players were using
steroids, he said he didn't know, so he's got the same problem I've
got. If he knew, do you think he'd waste reliever Eric Gagne on three
Brewers who don't use steroids?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS A parent, wouldn't you appreciate an "S" appearing on the
baseball card of your child's favorite player, so he knows early on
whether he'll have to get used to needles if he's ever going to be as
good as his role model.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CONSIDER THE statistical bonanza for Ross Porter if we added "S"s
and circled "S"s.</TE>
<TE>   Tell me it wouldn't be riveting to hear Vin Scully tell us about
that pivotal day, or moment in a player's life, when he decided to go
on the juice.</TE>
<TE>   Later in life, if there were disastrous side effects, Plaschke
would have something to write about. It's a win-win for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JOSE CANSECO and Ken Caminiti are in the news for suggesting that
50% to 85% of the players in baseball are using steroids. That would
make 121/2 to 211/4 of the Dodgers on the stuff.</TE>
<TE>   It's all guesswork. For all I know it was 121/2 two weeks ago when
they were being shut out for the eighth time, then they had a juice
party, and now it's 211/4 because they're averaging six runs in their
last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Shawn Green if he had been hooked up to some kind of
steroid IV, because I remember him only a few weeks ago having
difficulty even hitting the ball let alone driving it out of the
park. He laughed and pulled up his shirt to show me his skinny belly.</TE>
<TE>   That was good enough for me. There was a time when I was known as
an investigative performer, and I know steroid users sometimes suffer
from shrunken testicles and enlarged breasts. But if you think my
relationship with Kevin Brown is at a breaking point now, asking him
if his nipples are particularly painful or to drop his trousers just
might end any chance at reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   Another tell-tale sign is if a player's back breaks out, which
probably explains why a lot of ballplayers--more than I can
remember--are never seen in the clubhouse with their shirts off. But
then I don't take my shirt off around the house as much as I used to,
and that's just a Krispy Kreme problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE PEOPLE outside baseball have reacted with outrage to Canseco's
and Caminiti's assertions--as if they had no idea half the players
out there are risking their health to hit the ball farther.</TE>
<TE>   As for the people inside the game, they are reacting with outrage
to Canseco's and Caminiti's assertions because these two guys are
breaking the code and talking about clubhouse secrets. On the bright
side: Gay baseball players have been pushed off the back page of the
New York Post.</TE>
<TE>   As for me, I wonder if Major League Baseball would have to cancel
the home run hitting contest the day before the All-Star game if no
one was on the juice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS LONG as steroids are going to be a part of the game, and
imagine all the warning track fly outs if steroids were not a part of
the game, why not really use steroids to save the sport?</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has some real problems. From what we've been told, there
might not be an All-Star game, there could be a work stoppage, and
ultimately six to eight small-market teams could go out of business
if something isn't done to allow them to compete at the same level as
the big boys.</TE>
<TE>   The quickest way to make smaller markets more competitive with the
big-city teams is to make sure all the smaller-market players are on
steroids and the big-city players are clean.</TE>
<TE>   That would give a whole new meaning to a broadcaster's claim: "The
Royals are really juiced to play the Yankees tonight."</TE>
<TE>   There is no question, according to experts, that in a short amount
of time, an athlete can improve his strength faster through steroids
than anything he can do in a gymnasium. I hope Derek Fisher is paying
attention.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Steroids can jump you a level or two," Texas pitcher Kenny
Rogers told Sports Illustrated. "The average player can become a star
and the star player can become a superstar...."</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, I'd hate to learn Tim Salmon has been on
steroids, and his performance could have been a lot worse if he
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TIMES PUBLISHER John Puerner took the mound at Dodger Stadium to
throw out the ceremonial first pitch as part of the newspaper's "Read
by 9" program and a day at the ballpark for kids. As for his pitch,
let's just say if The Times employed paperboys who threw the way he
did, you'd never get your paper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jimmy D.:</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like you to get the word out and have fans at Staples 'moo'
the Kings."</TE>
<TE>   Make it "moon" the Kings, invite Salma Hayek to the game, and I'll
get the word out, make signs, write a column and get it on the
overhead scoreboard.</TE>

<HD>Roshan Takes the Heat, Title</HD>

<LD>Nima Roshan spent most of his formative years in Australia, where
sweltering conditions are not unusual. So the Granada Hills High
senior was determined to win the City Section boys' tennis singles
title, weather or not.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm OK with the heat," Roshan said minutes after proving it with
a come-from-behind 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over top-seeded Jason Nguyen
of Chatsworth in 100-degree temperatures Wednesday at Balboa Sports
Complex in Encino.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder Roshan, who was born in the United States and spent 12
years down under before returning in 1997, felt at home.</LD>
<TE>   The victory was an impressive encore for the defending champion,
who was seeded second. Roshan defeated El Camino Real's Matt Jones in
three sets for the title at the same site last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a goal from the start for me," Roshan said. "The first
time I won it was special, and I wanted that feeling again. I wanted
to know that I could maintain that level again."</TE>
<TE>   To do it, Roshan raised the level of his play to meet that
displayed in the first set by a familiar foe and good friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected a battle, and he came out and made some awesome shots
the first set," Roshan said of Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   "But I knew I just had to hang in there and stay with it."</TE>
<TE>   Roshan and Nguyen work out with the same private coach, Craig
Cignarelli of Woodland Hills, and the two players are doubles
partners on the U.S. Tennis Assn. junior circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he has a problem with heat and cramping, so I just tried
to keep the rallies going and run him around," Roshan said.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping the first set and the first game of the second set,
Roshan rallied to win four consecutive games and six of seven. After
a 10-minute break before the third set, during which Nguyen
stretched, doused himself with water and drank fluids, Roshan rolled
to an insurmountable 4-0 lead to open the third set.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had a pretty good chance to win this, but I just
didn't have anything left at the end," said Nguyen, who plans to walk
on to the UCLA tennis team. Nguyen, who advanced to the 2000 City
final but defaulted because of an ankle injury, didn't play last
season.</TE>
<TE>   In the City doubles final, brothers Norman and Bobby Tam of
Belmont defeated Carson's Nick Noa and Ron Esquerra, 6-1, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Tam lost in the singles final as a freshman and fell in the
quarterfinals the last two seasons before teaming with his freshman
brother. Noa and Esquerra lost in last year's doubles final.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Nets Don't Kidd Around, 103-92</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: After Celtics close within a point, New
Jersey goes on a 20-1 run and takes a 3-2 lead in the series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics had almost done it again, rallying from a 20-point
deficit. Their defensive pressure had put fear into the hearts, eyes
and minds of the New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   The Celtics were causing an unraveling of the Eastern Conference's
best team for the second game in this series.</LD>
<LD>   Erick Strickland, a backup Boston guard who hadn't scored in the
first four games, made two free throws, his 10th and 11th points,
with 10:50 left to cut the Nets' lead to 74-73. Twice in a row, the
Nets didn't score. There was a turnover and a missed layup by Kerry
Kittles. Twice in a row the Celtics had that chance to take the lead,
which would have been their first since 2-0. Twice in a row the
Celtics could have caused the ultimate panic, could have knocked the
guts out of the Nets.</LD>
<TE>   But they didn't. They missed a shot, then threw away a pass. Jason
Kidd scored on a 22-foot jump shot and the fear went into a closet.
Keith Van Horn threw in an off-balance layup and made a free throw.
The closet door was shut.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets ended up defeating the Celtics, 103-92, Wednesday night
at Continental Airlines Arena to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven
series. Game 6 is Friday at Boston's FleetCenter.</TE>
<TE>   What Kidd started with his jump shot was a ferocious 20-1 run.
When it was done, punctuated by consecutive Van Horn three-point
baskets that sent forward Kenyon Martin into a towel-waving frenzy,
the Nets led, 94-74.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no other Celtic comeback.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Boston standouts Antoine Walker (13 points) and Paul
Pierce (24) were on the bench, faces set in fierce scowls. Pierce and
Walker were scoreless in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "You get frustrated," Pierce said. "You battle back so hard and
then come up short. We've got to understand that it's the little
things that win ballgames, just keeping them out of transition,
keeping them from getting easy opportunities. Once we got ourselves
back in the game, I thought we'd come out with a little more energy
in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   There has been a pattern to this series. The Celtics stumble onto
the court and get behind. By 15, 20, 26 points. In the last three
games, Boston has trailed 28-13, 31-18 and 31-16 at the end of the
first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "With the units on the floor to start the game, they're flat-out
outplaying us." Boston Coach Jim O'Brien said. "We're letting them
execute their offense. We don't seem to have an answer early on to
stop it."</TE>
<TE>   And the Nets' confounding trend is to let the Celtics back into
the game. In Game 3 they blew a 26-point third-quarter lead. In Game
4, they lost a 15-point third-quarter lead before winning when Pierce
missed two free throws at the end.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Boston outscored the Nets, 31-17, in the third
quarter. Strickland had nine points. The Nets were six of 19 from the
field. What had been a 55-38 halftime lead was down to 72-69.</TE>
<TE>   When Strickland made his two free throws in the fourth, there was
a deep rumble in the crowd. Then came the determined move by Kidd,
who finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. Kidd
cocked, aimed and made his 22-foot shot with the confidence of a
superstar.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what Jason does," said Martin, who had 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Five players scored in the 20-1 run. Kidd had six points; Van Horn
(19 for the game) had nine. Backup center Jason Collins even had one.
Kittles, who didn't score in the run, did his part by getting the
Nets off to the big start, scoring 12 of his 21 points in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for myself and Kerry to get going early," Van
Horn said. "It really helps this team, helps all of us to a better
performance."</TE>
<TE>   A discouraged O'Brien answered "I don't know," when asked about
changing the starting lineup for Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a better team with our backs up against the wall," Pierce
said.</TE>
<TE>   And the Celtics' backs are pressed hard against that wall.</TE>
<TE>   Since entering the NBA from the American Basketball Assn. in 1976,
the Nets have never gone to the league finals. Now they are only a
victory away.</TE>

<HD>Story Line for Open Should Be a Long One</HD>

<LD>It's worth noting that Tiger Woods has won three of his seven majors
when he has taken a two-week break before them. Woods is taking two
weeks off before the U.S. Open, June 13-16 at Bethpage Black in
Farmingdale, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it remains to be seen if scheduling is as important as
pounding the ball off the tee at Bethpage, which is the longest U.S.
Open in history at 7,214 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Woods and Mark O'Meara played the par-70 course Tuesday and
O'Meara said this afterward: "I don't think we're going to light it
up."</LD>
<TE>   Somewhere, all those in USGA jackets are rubbing their hands in
glee.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious way to go is that this course is suitable for power
hitters only because of its prodigious length (one yard longer than
Congressional in the 1997 U.S. Open).</TE>
<TE>   Bethpage Black also features the two longest par-four holes in
U.S. Open history--the 499-yard 12th and the 492-yard 10th.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Woods reached the 12th with a driver and a
four-iron. O'Meara said only one of the two par-fives is
reachable--the 517-yard fourth hole. Woods got there with a
four-iron.</TE>
<TE>   With narrow fairways--Rees Jones says they will be 26-28 yards
wide--and rough grown to four inches, the Open is going to be a long
journey for a lot of players.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Snead, 1912-2002</TE>
<TE>   Sam Snead, who was buried Sunday, one day before his 90th
birthday, was one of golf's real treasures. That's no secret. Snead
was clearly one of the greatest players of all time, but it should be
pointed out that he was also one of the greatest sources of material
for writers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things about covering golf was that when you
needed perspective, you could simply pick up a telephone and speak to
Gene Sarazen, Paul Runyan, Snead and Byron Nelson. Now, only Nelson
is left.</TE>
<TE>   Snead was a writer's ally. When he was interviewed in 1995 for a
story about St. Andrews, Snead recalled that in 1946, he rode a train
as it passed the legendary layout and remarked to the Scot beside
him, "Look, there's an abandoned golf course over there."</TE>
<TE>   It was Snead who took playful exception to Woods' choice of
cheeseburgers for the Masters champions dinner in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Said Snead: "Cheeseburgers aren't food. Steak is food."</TE>
<TE>   Snead won the 1946 British Open, the 1949, 1952 and 1954 Masters
and the PGA Championship in 1941, 1949 and 1951, but he never won the
U.S. Open. Snead once said: "Hey, a lot of guys never won the U.S.
Open.... Besides, who cares about the U.S. Open?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Snead did, but he wasn't above joking about it ... make
that half-joking.</TE>
<TE>   Snead always made light of how little money he made in his
legendary career and he was never mean-spirited about it or jealous
of how much the current crop of pros earn.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf isn't about money ... unless you don't have any," he once
said.</TE>
<TE>   We'll miss Snead in a lot of ways, and for a very long time.</TE>
<TE>   Nick's Time</TE>
<TE>   Nick Faldo's streak lives. When the USGA gave him a special
exemption to play in the U.S. Open, it meant that Faldo would play in
his 60th consecutive major.</TE>
<TE>   That streak is likely to reach 63, up to the 2003 U.S. Open,
before it has a chance to end. Unless Faldo wins, which he hasn't in
five years, he may have to depend on the USGA for another special
exemption and although it's possible, getting exemptions in
consecutive years would not be the way to bet.</TE>
<TE>   Faldo, who turns 45 in July, is a three-time British Open
champion, so he can play that event until he's 65, if he wants. And
the PGA of America has already sent a special invitation to Faldo to
play at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn., for the PGA Championship in
August because he's not otherwise eligible. A three-time Masters
champion, Faldo is exempt at Augusta in 2003 before his string of
majors is in jeopardy at the 2003 U.S. Open at Olympia Fields outside
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Bibs Are Next</TE>
<TE>   What? David Fay, stuffed shirt? No one can accuse the USGA's
executive director of that after his explanation of why he wears bow
ties. Said Fay: "I was dripping stuff on my ties."</TE>
<TE>   Zzzzzzzzz</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Paulson says he doesn't watch golf on television because it
puts him to sleep. Says Paulson: "It's a wonderful nap brought on by
a little white ball."</TE>
<TE>   Web of Intrigue</TE>
<TE>   He is scarcely the only player with a Web site, but Greg Norman's
shark.com is fairly typical ... not much news, flattering stuff, full
of fluff ... and this week's offering is no different--the
tried-and-true timeline.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the first few bits of Norman's timeline revealed on the
Web site:</TE>
<TE>   5:30 a.m.: A wake-up call begins a long day.</TE>
<TE>   8:30 a.m.: Greg meets with the president of his golf course design
firm.</TE>
<TE>   10 a.m.: Greg leaves for Palm Beach International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   And so on. Listen, if this thing's going to work, then it's got to
have a lot more punch.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe something like this:</TE>
<TE>   5:30 a.m.: Greg hits the bed after a long night of alligator
hunting.</TE>
<TE>   8:30 a.m.: Greg becomes disoriented and gets lost in his walk-in
closet as he tries to figure out which straw hat to wear.</TE>
<TE>   10 a.m.: Greg buys Palm Beach International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, that's more like it.</TE>
<TE>   He's No Angel?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Miguel Angel Martin, best known for being the player
1997 Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros threw off the team, is
accused of cheating on the course by unnamed players.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: One of them didn't have the initials S.B., did he?</TE>
<TE>   Casey Update</TE>
<TE>   Casey Martin, who has missed the cut in the four Buy.com Tour
events he's played this year, is playing the Kemper Open this
week--his first PGA Tour event this year. He received a sponsor's
invitation, the only one he has received. Martin turns 30 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It's Good to Be Pro</TE>
<TE>   Here is another reason players turn pro as soon as they finish
driver's ed: The European Tour just named Marquis Jet Partners as its
preferred supplier of business jet service and also signed up for the
Marquis Concierge Service, which includes luxury hotel
accommodations, rental cars and theater booking.</TE>
<TE>   Next: The Birdie Valet service to escort that special golf ball in
your life into that dreamy little hole.</TE>
<TE>   Charming</TE>
<TE>   The first quote of the week is from Rosie Jones, who was second to
Laura Diaz last week at the LPGA Corning Classic. Jones said she took
some consolation from the experience: "I made her sweat the whole way
around."</TE>
<TE>   Charge It</TE>
<TE>   The second quote of the week is from Woods, who introduced an
American Express credit card with his image on it. Said Woods: "I
guess I'll be sitting on my face."</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   The Shriners Open tournament will be held July 15 at the Navy
course in Cypress. The event benefits El Bekal Shrine Center in
Anaheim. Details: (714) 563-9111.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour will donate $500,000 to the New York Police and Fire
Widows and Children's Benefit Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Bates of Thousand Palms won the LPGA Teaching and Club Pro
Western Section title and earned a spot in the next major, the
McDonald's LPGA Championship, June 6-9, at DuPont Country Club in
Wilmington, Del.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Is Ready for Battle</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Baffert is pleased with Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner's workout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first workout since winning the Preakness, War Emblem was
clocked in 1:003/5 for five furlongs Wednesday at Churchill Downs,
where he will remain until three days before he tries to win the
Belmont Stakes and sweep the Triple Crown.</LD>
<LD>   With Dana Barnes, trainer Bob Baffert's ace exercise rider,
aboard, War Emblem went through splits of :123/5, :244/5 and :482/5
en route to his final time. Unofficially, he galloped out six
furlongs in 1:131/5 and seven furlongs in 1:263/5.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like he hasn't lost it," Baffert said after the work.
"It was a good work for the way he did it. He could have gone a lot
faster."</LD>
<TE>   Churchill Downs is where War Emblem's improbable Triple Crown
chase began.</TE>
<TE>   At 20-1--and less than a month after the Saudi Arabian prince
Ahmed Salman bought him for $900,000--he won the Kentucky Derby by
four lengths in rare gate-to-wire fashion on May 4. Two weeks later,
War Emblem was favored as he added a three-quarter-length victory in
the Preakness at Pimlico.</TE>
<TE>   A victory in the $1-million Belmont Stakes in New York on June 8
would make him the 12th Triple Crown champion and the first since
Affirmed in 1978. There's a $5-million bonus attached to winning all
three races.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has been this way before, winning the Derby and the
Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and again with Real Quiet in
1998, but both horses finished second in the Belmont. Baffert will
follow the same pre-Belmont routine with War Emblem as he did with
those two colts, stabling him at Churchill Downs until a few days
before the race. War Emblem is scheduled to work again Tuesday, and
will be flown to New York the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Another horse flying to New York from Kentucky will be Sarava,
winner of the Sir Barton Stakes at Pimlico on Preakness day. Trainer
Ken McPeek, who finished seventh in the Derby with Harlan's Holiday,
the race favorite, and ran fourth in the Preakness, feels that he has
a legitimate chance with a fresh horse.</TE>
<TE>   "I think War Emblem is beatable this time," McPeek said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a good, solid horse with a big, long stride who's coming
to hand at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Del Mar Thoroughbred Club's board of directors unanimously
agreed Wednesday to oppose the proposed transfer of the Los Angeles
County Fair's racing dates from Fairplex Park to Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County Fair Association has agreed to lease the Arcadia
racetrack for the Fair's meet to be held Sept. 13-29.</TE>
<TE>   The California Horse Racing Board, which must approve the Santa
Anita-Fairplex deal, will meet June 6.</TE>
<TE>   The Del Mar group believes there would be a negative impact from
having a 17-day meet at Santa Anita only two days after Del Mar's
summer meeting ends Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Sire of War Emblem Is Sold for $7 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a year after a Maryland couple bought Our Emblem for a
reported $200,000, the sire of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner was sold Wednesday for an amount believed to be in excess of
$7 million.</LD>
<LD>   After War Emblem won the Derby on May 4, Audrey and Allen Murray,
who own Murmur Farm in Darlington, Md., said they received a written
offer of $4.5 million for Our Emblem. In an interview last week, the
Murrays said that while they plan to sell Our Emblem, they probably
would wait until after War Emblem ran in the Belmont Stakes on June
8.</LD>
<LD>   A win by War Emblem in the Belmont would make him the first Triple
Crown winner in 24 years and greatly enhance Our Emblem's value as a
stallion.</LD>
<TE>   "It would take a very high offer for us to sell before the
Belmont," Allen Murray said a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Murrays also had an oral offer of $6.5 million on the table,
but apparently that was topped this week by WinStar Farm, whose
president, Doug Cauthen, announced the purchase Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cauthen is a brother of Steve Cauthen, who rode Affirmed, the last
Triple Crown champion, in 1978. Doug Cauthen also said that starting
in February, Our Emblem will stand at Taylor Made Farm in
Nicholasville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The stallion is finishing up his only stud season at Murmur, where
he will have been bred to 95 mares by July.</TE>
<TE>   Our Emblem's stud fee started at $4,000 at Murmur and was raised
to $7,500 a mating after War Emblem won the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Our Emblem's fee could be expected to be in the six-figure range
next year, regardless of what War Emblem does in the Belmont. Our
Emblem, an 11-year-old, is a regally bred son of Mr. Prospector and
Personal Ensign.</TE>
<TE>   But in four years on the track for trainer Shug McCaughey, he won
only five races, none of them stakes. Then in five years at stud at
Claiborne Farm in Kentucky, he sired only one minor stakes winner.
Claiborne sold him to the Murrays last November.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, War Emblem, the result of a mating between Our
Emblem and Sweetest Lady, a Lord At War mare, had broken his maiden
at first asking, but then finished seventh at a grass stake at
Arlington Park.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Bibby Has Stepped Up His Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>By now it's clear there are significant differences between the Kings
who were swept from the playoffs by the Lakers last season and the
Kings who have pushed the Lakers to the brink of elimination this
season.</LD>
<LD>   One of them is named Mike Bibby.</LD>
<LD>   It was Bibby's 22-foot jump shot with 8.2 seconds remaining
Tuesday in Game 5 that gave the Kings a 92-91 victory over the Lakers
and a three-games-to-two lead in the Western Conference finals. Game
6 is Friday at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "Mike reminds me of Terry Porter when I had him in Portland," said
King Coach Rick Adelman, who coached the Trail Blazers from 1988 to
1994. "He's going from a good player to a great player right before
your eyes. He's so quiet, but you can see the confidence building in
him. He has nerves of steel. Mike was good in the regular season, but
he's been great in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's scoring average has risen from 13.7 during the regular
season to 19.4 in the playoffs, but there's more to his
transformation than points, according to Adelman.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has taken a step up," he said. "Our offense is different
[because of Bibby]. We're more efficient. Getting one player like him
changes the way you play."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings dealt erratic point guard Jason Williams to the
Grizzlies last summer to get Bibby and now are one victory away from
reaching the finals for the first time since 1951, when the franchise
was based in Rochester, N.Y., and was called the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   "I marvel at the way he gets around people," Adelman said when
asked about Bibby's ability to beat defenders. "He makes a play. He
beats people and everything becomes very clear around him. John
Stockton is that way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson, a reserve guard, wished to make it clear that he
did not get away with a foul in thwarting Kobe Bryant on a
last-second jump shot in Game 5. Television replays indicated that
Jackson yanked Bryant's jersey from his shorts seconds before
Bryant's shot sailed off target, preserving the Kings' one-point
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I fouled him," Jackson said. "I poked the ball away.
I didn't touch him after that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug Christie, assigned to Bryant until fouling out late in Game
5, agonized on the bench after Jackson took his place. "The worst
four minutes of my life," Christie said. "I hated it. It was a
terrible experience."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic played Tuesday for the first time since spraining
his right ankle May 9. He had two points, missed all three shots he
attempted and took six rebounds in 18 minutes. He hopes to play
better and for longer stretches Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't 100%," Stojakovic said. "It's sore and tender and weak.
I'm hoping it will get better for Friday. I couldn't stand to watch,
being in street clothes. I wanted to be a part of the team.... I'm
not worried about my conditioning. I am worried about my foot feeling
better."</TE>

<LD>Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant did their best to quiet a minor
controversy after the Lakers' decision to have Derek Fisher defend
Mike Bibby late in Game 5.</LD>
<LD>   After Tuesday's 92-91 loss to the Kings, Jackson said that Bryant
told him during the game that he wanted to defend Bobby Jackson.
"[Kobe] said, 'I don't feel quite comfortable picking [Bibby] up at
this time and not being used to his move,'" Jackson said. "I think it
was a decision he wanted to make and I concurred with him."</LD>
<LD>   But Bryant somewhat disagreed with his coach, claiming that he
never backs from a challenge and that Jackson's quote was
"ridiculous."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Jackson explained his decision again.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that [Fisher] had done a good job; he had fought his way
back after playing a rather poor six minutes in the third quarter,"
Jackson said. "He got his second wind and started playing the right
way.... Kobe and I actually concurred about it and he said, '[Fisher]
is doing a good job and that he'd rather stay with Bobby Jackson.'
And from that point, we stayed with that."</TE>
<TE>   When asked again about his conversation with Jackson, Bryant
seemed offended.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys should know that I don't even think like that," Bryant
said after Wednesday's practice. "My mind doesn't even work like
that.... We both mutually agreed at the time that [Fisher] was doing
a good job on him."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and Bryant each agree that it really doesn't matter how
the conversation went because they know that the Lakers have to do
something to contain Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "If Phil wants me to be on him for 48 minutes, I'll [defend] him
for 48 minutes," said Bryant, who has done a better-than-average job
defending Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic did not make a basket and finished with only two
points in 18 minutes on Tuesday, but Jackson expects the King forward
to have more impact in Game 6 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be a lot better after getting some game experience,"
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   An effective Stojakovic is another challenge the Lakers will have
to overcome against the Kings, who are 5-1 on the road in the
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a team that comes to our home court knowing that they've
played good on the road," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal on the officiating in the series, which has
awarded the Kings 37 more free throws than the Lakers: "I don't want
to make this like I'm complaining and whining. This is just some of
the things that you have to go through. But I think people see and
understand what is going on."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson on the same subject: "All things are judgment calls and we
didn't get some calls for us in [Game 5]. Sometimes, it goes like
that.... We won a game at the buzzer and they won a game at the
buzzer.... Now it's time to settle in and play the game we know how
to play, then carry it back to their court and do the same thing so
we can have another chance to win."</TE>

<HD>Ticket Sales for Tyson-Lewis Fight Are Lagging</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It turns out Mike Tyson's fight with heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis on June 8 isn't such a hot ticket after all.</LD>
<LD>   Despite claims of a record-breaking $23-million sellout, tickets
are so plentiful it appears promoters seriously overestimated the
attractiveness of a title bout at Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   Some people close to the fight estimate that only a little more
than half of the 19,000-plus tickets have been sold to fans. Most of
the others are in the hands of ticket brokers or have gone on public
sale at the Pyramid Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The lack of demand became even more evident Wednesday when
promoters put another 3,500 seats up for public sale.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Mike Jones, a one-time Super Bowl hero with the St.
Louis Rams, will be released Friday by the Pittsburgh Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Jones will count $83,333 against the salary cap, but the Steelers
will save his $750,000 salary.</TE>
<TE>   College Sports</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week after signing a six-year contract, Indiana men's
basketball Coach Mike Davis agreed to another $300,000 incentive
clause.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will receive an additional $100,000 in the fourth, fifth and
sixth years of the contract--if he remains the Hoosiers' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Portie shot a five-under-par 66 to lead Colorado's quick start
before heavy rains and lightning suspended the first round of the
NCAA men's golf championship at Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen teams and three individuals marked their shots and were
called in. They will resume play early today before the second round
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's four-under 280 led the teams in the clubhouse. Arizona
was next at 282, followed by defending champion Florida, Texas
Christian and Toledo, all at 283.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Michaelis is retiring after 40 seasons as women's
volleyball coach at Brigham Young but will remain the school's
athletic director for women's sports.</TE>
<TE>   Michaelis never had a losing season in posting an 887-225-5 career
record. She ranks second among Division I women's coaches behind
UCLA's Andy Banachowski, who had 919 victories in 35 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Former Notre Dame receiver Lorenzo Crawford had consensual sex
with a female student and was not involved in a gang rape, his lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Cotter said that while an affidavit submitted by prosecutors
with the charges against four former players indicates Crawford
admitted to rape, a videotaped statement shows Crawford was saying
the sex was consensual.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford and Abram Elam were arraigned Wednesday at South Bend.,
Ind. Donald Dykes was arraigned Tuesday and Justin Smith had a
bond-reduction hearing. Each is free on $3,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration defended a federal law that has greatly
expanded women's athletic programs, arguing that a lawsuit by male
college coaches and athletes should be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit against the Education Department, filed in January in
federal district court by the National Wrestling Coaches Assn., says
the law--meant to ensure equal educational and athletic opportunities
for men and women--hurts lower-profile male sports.</TE>
<TE>   The 1972 statute known as Title IX prohibits any school or college
that receives federal funding from discrimination based on sex in
sports or academics.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that many schools have trimmed men's sports
instead of adding women's teams to achieve equality. The government
said the suit should be dismissed because only the schools can
correct the alleged damage.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   News agency ANSA said that police Wednesday night raided hotels
housing cycling teams competing in the Giro d'Italia as part of an
investigation into the alleged use of banned performance-enhancing

<HD>Group Extends Hand to Chargers</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Posturing begins as Anschutz representatives
query team about relocation to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A representative of the San Diego Chargers said Wednesday the
franchise has been formally approached about relocating to Los
Angeles but, for the moment, plans to focus on negotiations to stay
in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Fabiani, a political strategist recently hired by the
Chargers, said the team was contacted Tuesday by the Philip
Anschutz-backed group interested in building an NFL stadium in the
South Park area of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "We told them our first priority is to stay in San Diego," Fabiani
said. "We have discussions going on with the city, and we want those
to have a chance to succeed. We have a lot of work to do in the next
couple of months."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Anschutz Entertainment Group declined to comment
on the development.</TE>
<TE>   Fabiani said the Chargers intend to talk to the Los Angeles group
at some point, possibly mid-summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers are the front-runners among a number of relocation
candidates, including New Orleans, Minnesota, Indianapolis, New
Orleans and Buffalo. Under the terms of their Qualcomm Stadium lease,
the earliest the Chargers could move would be after the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Fabiani's disclosure came a day after San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy
released an April letter from the Chargers that stated the team met
the conditions last year to trigger an escape clause in its lease and
expects to do so again this year. As long as certain salary-related
conditions are met, the Chargers have a two-month window in which to
trigger the clause, beginning Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I firmly believe it is in the best interests of both the city and
the Chargers to begin negotiations now, rather than forcing the
Chargers to trigger the contractual renegotiation right," Charger
President Dean Spanos wrote in the letter, dated April 22.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos, whose family owns the team, said last week his first
choice is to stay in San Diego, as long as the Chargers stay
financially competitive with other NFL teams. That financial health
depends heavily on a team's stadium deal, and Spanos said Qualcomm
Stadium--which will host the Super Bowl in January--is outdated and
insufficient. He also ruled out the notion of refurbishing the venue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that works," he said. "It would cost you so much to
refurbish and make the stadium good, it would be better to start all
over again."</TE>
<TE>   Spanos said he learned roughly six months ago that a coalition of
Los Angeles business leaders was interested in a downtown stadium. He
was told of the proposal when the Chargers were working out the
details of moving their training camp to Anschutz' $120-million
sports complex being constructed in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several discussions about the possibility of a
downtown stadium," Spanos said. "Very informal discussions. More
conceptual in nature.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, I think the performance and history [of the
Anschutz group] speaks for itself. Based on their record alone, you
have to respect them."</TE>
<TE>   In a related development this week, the Los Angeles City Council
formed an ad-hoc committee to evaluate any stadium proposals and all
other aspects of an NFL return.</TE>

name from consideration.</LD>
<LD>   Hybl said Wednesday he has also thrown his full support behind
Paul George, now serving as a USOC vice president. George narrowly
lost to Baldwin in the USOC's December 2000 presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   Hybl's two-pronged action gives George a considerable boost as the
USOC moves to fill the presidential position. George also can be
expected to receive key support from the agencies that oversee
individual Olympic sports in this country, called "national governing
bodies."</LD>
<TE>   George, a Boston attorney, has long been active in the
administration of figure skating and other winter sports. He was the
U.S. team's chief at the 1998 Nagano Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill has been the president twice," George said Wednesday. "He
knows what the job entails. I'm honored."</TE>
<TE>   No timetable has been set for selection of Baldwin's successor.
The next president will serve the remainder of what would have been
her term, through the end of 2004. Baldwin resigned Friday, 17 months
into her presidency, after the disclosure of discrepancies in her
academic record on her self-supplied USOC biography.</TE>
<TE>   By resigning her USOC slot, Baldwin, 62, a real estate executive
in Mesa, Ariz., also gave up her position as a member of the
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Mankamyer, a Colorado Springs businesswoman who is the
USOC's secretary, is currently its acting president; she has
expressed interest in running for the job. Other potential candidates
include Herman Frazier, athletic director at the University of
Alabama Birmingham, and Michael Lenard, a Los Angeles businessman who
narrowly lost an election for USOC president to Hybl in 1996. Like
George, Frazier is currently a USOC vice president; Lenard is not now
a USOC officer.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl, a Colorado Springs businessman and politician, had been
considered one of the strongest contenders to fill out the remaining
21/2 years of the current presidential term.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl served as USOC president from 1996 to 2000, after being
elected to a four-year term, and in 1991 and 1992, when he replaced
Robert Helmick, who had resigned amid conflict of interest
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl also served as a member of the International Olympic
Committee for about 18 months, from the 2000 Sydney Summer Games to
the Salt Lake Winter Olympics earlier this year; he stepped aside to
make way on the IOC for Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Hybl notified Lloyd Ward, the USOC's chief operating
officer, that he would not be a candidate to succeed Baldwin. Hybl
said Wednesday, "I considered it. On balance, I've endorsed Paul."</TE>
<TE>   The USOC has endured two decades of management turmoil, and Hybl
also observed, "At this juncture, it's very important that this
organization pull together to show that indeed we do represent the
Olympic ideals, and the athletes and the [national governing
bodies]."</TE>
<TE>   Ward declined to comment on any of the potential candidates. He
said only that the USOC now must work through a process "both
expedient and effective."</TE>

<LD>Dylan Kim swept his three sets at No. 1 singles to lead Glendale
Hoover High to its first Southern Section boys' tennis title with an
11-7 victory over Palos Verdes Peninsula in the Division I final
Wednesday afternoon at The Claremont Club.</LD>
<LD>   It was Hoover's first section title in any sport since 1975 when
the Tornadoes defeated Lakewood, 2-1, in baseball. Hoover's only
other appearance in a boys' tennis final was in 1931, two years after
the school opened, when it lost to Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "This was huge for our kids," Hoover Coach Lynn Santamaria said.
"Playing on a neutral court helped because we lost to this same team
in the [quarterfinals] last year at their place."</LD>
<TE>   Kim defeated Peninsula's top player, Rylan Rizza, 7-5, in a key
match between highly ranked juniors.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Hoover (24-1) won four doubles sets, three by the
No. 2 team of Hakop Tadevosian and Eddie Choi, against a stacked
Peninsula lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Panthers (17-8) reached a final for the seventh
time in the last 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine University 11, Fullerton Troy 7--In a battle between the
top two seeded teams, No. 1 University (24-2-1) won seven of nine
singles sets to capture its third consecutive Division II title.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Yovan swept at No. 1 singles, including a 7-5 victory over
Jeffrey Das, the top singles player for Troy (26-2). Seniors Anson
Hsu and Jeff Lawrence swept at No. 1 doubles for University.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Westlake 10, Irvine Woodbridge 8--The top-seeded
Warriors (24-0) won five singles and five doubles sets to capture the
Division III title, their second section title in three years. Aaron
Bert and Alex Sundling each won two of their three singles sets for
Westlake, which improved to 65-1 in match play over the last three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Van Linge swept at No. 1 singles for second-seeded
Woodbridge (19-6), which was playing in its third section final in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert 10, Irvine Northwood 8--Freshman Cale Plank lost just
four games in three singles sets and Jordan Colman also swept for
second-seeded Palm Desert (23-1), which won the Division IV title.
Ryan Aarges and Andy Moody swept at No. 1 doubles for fourth-seeded
Northwood (17-7), which won seven doubles sets.</TE>

<LD>   Each team won nine sets, but when total games were counted,
Harvard-Westlake (27-1) had captured its first section title since
1999.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew it could go either way," said senior Jesse Ferlianto, the
No. 1 Wolverine singles player. "We figured if we could just get to
nine, we'd have a chance, and that's exactly how it turned out."</LD>
<TE>   Eric McKean swept at No.1 singles for Brentwood (17-5), which
advanced to a final for the fifth consecutive year by upsetting
top-seeded Corona del Mar in the semifinals. Ari Rosenthal won two
singles sets for Brentwood, losing 6-1 to Ferlianto.</TE>

<HD>Assa Abloy Wins in Close Call</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>

<DL>GOTHENBURG, Sweden</DL>
<LD>Sweden's Assa Abloy, the nearest thing to an American entry, led the
way into its home port minutes after midnight Wednesday to complete
the eighth leg of the Volvo Ocean Race in the closest and most
tightly packed finish of any phase of the global races of the last
three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Assa Abloy, named for its Sweden-based lockmaker sponsor, was only
2 minutes 16 seconds ahead of Bermuda's Tyco, then it was 1:40 to
Australia's News Corp, 1:11 to Germany's illbruck and 1:33 to
Italy/Finland's Amer Sports One--the top five of the eight-boat fleet
all finishing within a span of 6:40.</LD>
<LD>   Assa Abloy is sailing with Mark Rudiger of San Francisco as
navigator/co-skipper, Mike Howard of Malibu as sail trimmer/helmsman
and Chris Larson of Annapolis as tactician/helmsman. The skipper is
Neal McDonald of the United Kingdom.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a world-class effort by Assa Abloy all the way," Rudiger
said. The 1,075-nautical mile leg from La Rochelle in France through
the English Channel was so close that the crews hardly slept the last
24 hours of the 41/2-day run.</TE>
<TE>   Assa Abloy has won three of the eight legs but still trails
American skipper John Kostecki's illbruck for first place, 54 points
to 49. The last leg, down the Baltic Sea to Kiel, Germany, will start
June 8.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Miami, which lost its season opener against Minnesota on
Tuesday, 66-63, had already sustained a bigger loss when starting
6-foot-5 center Ruth Riley broke her right little finger on Sunday.
She is expected to be out at least four weeks. Coach Ron Rothstein's
starting lineup was disrupted before Riley's injury. Guard Sandy
Brondello sat out the Sol's exhibition schedule because of a foot
injury (she did play 11 minutes Tuesday, scoring two points), and
forward Elena Baranova did not return from Europe. The Sol struggled
Tuesday, with only two starters scoring in double figures. One of
them was newcomer Tamara Moore, who set a first-game rookie record
with 22 points. Lisa Leslie, who had 16 double-doubles last season
for the Sparks, has two in two games.</TE>

who won the pole vault at the NCAA championships Wednesday despite a
painful back that kept her from practicing most of the last six
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   O'Hara started to sit to talk after clearing 13 feet 91/4 inches
to defeat Andrea Wildrick of Liberty in a jump-off, but her back
quickly complained.</LD>
<TE>   "Better to stand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara has vaulted higher--she holds the collegiate record of
14-71/4, set in 2000. Although she hoped to set a personal record in
her final collegiate meet, she had no complaints about winning her
third NCAA title after being limited mostly to the pool and the
chiropractor's table recently.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just keeping the faith," said O'Hara, who won the NCAA
outdoor and indoor titles two years ago as a sophomore and was second
in both events last year.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara's victory, worth 10 points, helped top-ranked UCLA take the
lead after the first day of the four-day meet with 15 points--five
ahead of Clemson and North Carolina State. Cari Soong took fourth in
the hammer for the Bruins' other points.</TE>
<TE>   USC, the defending women's champion, has three points off
L'Orangerie Crawford's sixth-place finish in the hammer.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Natasha Mayers--a transfer from L.A. Southwest College who
competed in the Sydney Olympics for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines--ran the third-fastest 200-meter time in school history,
winning her heat in 22.80 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Kinshasa Davis also qualified for the 200-meter final, but
Angela Williams--poised to seek four consecutive NCAA titles in the
100 meters Saturday--failed to qualify in the 200 by two
one-hundredths of a second.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Aleksandra Deren qualified in the 800. The Trojans'
400-meter relay team also qualified.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' Sheena Johnson won her 400-meter hurdle heat, but
Tiffany Burgess failed to qualify in the 800.</TE>
<TE>   The leader in the men's competition is Georgia, with USC and UCLA
scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' Kyle Erickson, hobbled because of a hamstring injury,
tried to run the 400-meter hurdles but pulled up before the first
hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   USC qualified for the finals of the 400-meter relay.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS SERIES REPORT/ OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>No Need to Fear, Underdog's Here</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KREIDLER</AU>
<BD>SACRAMENTO BEE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber recognized it. Webber had just come in from the latest
biggest victory in the Kings' Sacramento history, and he was now at
the far end of fielding question after question not so much about the
grandeur of triumph, but about what it might ultimately take to get
these Lakers behind them; and Webber knew.</LD>
<LD>   "We're still the underdog," he said, flashing that Webberian
smile.</LD>
<LD>   Listen, it's the only way to be.</LD>
<TE>   What the Kings ought to know in their hearts right this minute are
two terribly relevant things: (1) They can close out this L.A. team
and win the Western Conference championship; and (2) Until they've
done it, they're not even close.</TE>
<TE>   The champion isn't vanquished until he is. And there isn't a Gavin
Maloof cross-court dance in the world that will change that.</TE>
<TE>   That pulsating game at Arco Arena on Tuesday night, the one won by
the Kings, 92-91, on Mike Bibby's jumper and lost by the Lakers on
Kobe Bryant's no-Horry-for-you miss? That was undergraduate work--the
best undergraduate work the Kings have ever delivered, no question,
but undergrad all the same.</TE>
<TE>   What seems unfathomable, but is absolutely true, is that the next
step is infinitely more difficult, not just a little bit so. You
could barely detect it through the hysteria at Arco, but it was
there. Buried under the sonic boom of Bibby's shot, perhaps, but
there all the same.</TE>
<TE>   What Bryant's missed jumper over Bobby Jackson ensured is the most
brutal test the Kings have ever faced as a team, which sounds like a
ridiculous thing to say about the franchise that just took the 3-2
lead in the series and has the security blanket of a Game 7 at home.</TE>
<TE>   But there you go, questioning life above the rim in the NBA.
Congratulations! You've just run your first mile. And coming up next
here on the How Bad Do You Want It Network: The starting line of that
marathon, right over there.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, everything's on par," said the Lakers' Rick
Fox, designated verbal swordsman in this series.</TE>
<TE>   "If things go the way they're supposed to go, we'll be back here
for a seventh game on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't exactly pathworn territory for the Lakers, who over the
last three seasons have faced an elimination game only twice.</TE>
<TE>   The last time was against Portland in the Western Conference
finals of 2000, and that seventh game was played at Staples Center in
L.A., not on the road, as this would be.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on so many levels, it isn't the point.</TE>
<TE>   The point is that the Kings have played the Lakers into a position
that probably feels a little uncomfortable on both sides--the Lakers
dealing with the same reality the Kings had faced on Heartbreak
Sunday in L.A., the Kings dealing with the enormity of what suddenly
feels right in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   And underdog is the way to go.</TE>

<LD>Sheryl Swoopes scored 20 points and Tynesha Lewis had a career-high
12, and the Houston Comets defeated Phoenix, 61-56, Wednesday night
at Houston in the Mercury's season-opener.</LD>
<LD>   Swoopes was eight for 16 from the field, though the Comets shot
only 38%.</LD>
<LD>   "Our shots are not falling right now. My shot is not falling right
now, but I think we're close to getting to where we want to be," said
Swoopes, who sat out last season because of a knee injury.</LD>
<TE>   Swoopes led the Comets with five steals, including two in the
final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis made two three-point baskets down the stretch for the
Comets, who avoided losing two games to start a season for the first
time in the franchise's six-year history.</TE>
<TE>   New York 84, Portland 62--Becky Hammon scored 22 points and Tari
Phillips had 20 for the Liberty, which used a 20-5 run in the second
half to put the game away at Portland, Ore.</TE>

<HD>Swoopes Shows Rust, Promise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheryl Swoopes' return to the WNBA on Monday in Houston was just
about everything she and the Comets could hope for.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, there was some evidence of rust after sitting out a season to
recover from a torn ligament in her left knee. Swoopes missed nine of
15 shots, looked a bit tired in the second half, and could not
prevent Houston from falling to the league-champion Sparks in its
season opener.</LD>
<LD>   But Swoopes did show quickness in her lateral movement, and she
drove repeatedly and fearlessly to the basket. And her knee was
bumped a couple of times, but she showed no ill effects.</LD>
<TE>   Swoopes, who had a scare two weeks ago when she hyperextended the
surgically repaired knee while stepping off the team bus, said that
while she is confident in her recovery, she will probably need to go
through the entire season before she stops worrying about whether she
is back all the way.</TE>
<TE>   "In coming back from an injury like this, you know there are going
to be times of doubt and wondering if you're ready," Swoopes said.</TE>
<TE>   "But right now I feel really good and confident. I know the knee
is good physically and ready to go. It's all a mental game with me
right now. But I feel confident in what the doctors have done, and I
feel really confident in what I have been able to do as far as rehab
and be able to come back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes' play got high praise from the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our hands full guarding her," Lisa Leslie said. "Sheryl
looked really good. Not too many players can have that type of injury
and come back. She looks 100%; she's strong, she finishes strong,
she's also playing good defense. She's a player. And you can't come
here thinking you can take her lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Added Coach Michael Cooper: "I thought she looked very good. She
has to go a lot of minutes, and I know she's been working out. But
there's nothing like game conditions. You can tell she got a little
winded. But she is still a hell of a player. She's gonna get that
team going after a while."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The opening-day rosters had a couple of surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Moore of Long Beach State and Kayte Christensen of UC Santa
Barbara weren't expected to stick with Indiana and Phoenix,
respectively. But they did.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, drafted and cut last year by Sacramento, was assigned to
Indiana by the league following the April tryout camps.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen was the Mercury's third-round pick in this year's
draft--one of only three third-round picks to make it out of training
camp--and the 40th player taken overall.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee Christensen or Moore will see much playing
time early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   And both roster spots could be tenuous, because Indiana and
Phoenix have some injured players who will soon be available.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Moore and Christensen have already beaten long odds
getting this far.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If WNBA players think there is not much security these days, they
should look at the coaches.</TE>
<TE>   With the league's sixth season underway, there have been 37
coaches heading the 16 teams, with two new coaches--Orlando's Dee
Brown and Washington's Marianne Stanley--this season.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Van Chancellor is the only founding coach left from the
league's inaugural 1997 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland Coach Linda Hargrove has heard the criticism for her
team's draft-day trade with the Sparks, sending first-round pick
Nikki Teasley and veteran Sophia Witherspoon to Los Angeles in
exchange for guard Ukari Figgs and second-round draft Gergana
Slavtcheva, who was later cut from the Fire.</TE>
<TE>   But Hargrove has no complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it definitely could be a good trade for both of us,"
Hargrove said. "I think what we got was somebody with a little bit
more experience than Nikki could have given us, and somebody just a
lot more on an even keel. I don't think we're going to have the ups
and downs that you would have if you were starting a rookie point
guard. So I think that that's an advantage for us.</TE>
<TE>   "Nikki Teasley is a tremendously talented athlete, and in that
system, where they already have a tremendous number of great players
and leaders, she doesn't have to do that, and I think that's a good
fit for Nikki, as well."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks and Fire meet for the first time Monday. Figgs will
probably receive her 2001 championship ring before the game.</TE>

<HD>Cool Giambi Puts Yankees Over Top</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Giambi strolled up to the plate in the top of the ninth inning,
calmly looking at Keith Foulke.</LD>
<LD>   One pitch went by and then another as Giambi waited for a ball he
liked. When he finally got one, the ball was out of the park and the
game was all but over.</LD>
<LD>   Giambi's second homer of the game capped a five-run rally in the
ninth inning against Foulke, giving the New York Yankees a 6-3
victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night at Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   "It's gotten better and better every game, and now I feel real
comfortable at the plate," said Giambi, who has found his groove
after signing a $120-million contract with the Yankees in the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won their fifth in a row and completed their first
three-game sweep at Chicago since May 1986. It was their second
comeback victory in as many days.</TE>
<TE>   The game was billed as a pitchers' duel between New York's Roger
Clemens and Mark Buehrle, who was trying for an AL-leading ninth
victory. Clemens, who did not get a decision, struck out 11 for the
100th double-digit strikeout game of his career and Buehrle came
within two outs of the victory.</TE>
<TE>   But Foulke (0-3) blew his first save at Comiskey Park since
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Tampa Bay 2--Chris Snelling hit his first major league
home run, a two-run drive against Tanyon Sturtze (0-6) in the fifth
inning, to support right-hander Freddy Garcia (6-4) at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 50-23 lifetime, improved to 6-0 against Tampa Bay and
became the fourth-fastest active pitcher to win 50 games by limiting
the Devil Rays to five hits in 71/3 innings. Among active pitchers,
only Tim Hudson, Roger Clemens and Mike Mussina reached 50 wins in
fewer decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Toronto 4--Brian Daubach hit a go-ahead three-run homer
in the seventh inning at Toronto and the Red Sox completed a
three-game sweep of the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Merloni's homer in the seventh tied the score for the Red Sox,
who are 20-4 on the road, the best start away from home in the majors
since Detroit had the same mark in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   John Burkett improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1993, giving
up four runs and seven hits in 62/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Oakland 5--Jeff Conine hit two homers and drove in
five runs at Baltimore and the Orioles ended Oakland's four-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   There were seven home runs, six coming in two half-innings. Scott
Hatteberg, Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez connected in the Oakland
third before Conine, Tony Batista and Marty Cordova answered in the
bottom of the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 18th two-homer game for Conine, who tied a career high
with five runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 9, Minnesota 8--Todd Greene hit a run-scoring single in the
bottom of the ninth inning against J.C. Romero (3-1) and the Rangers
ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Romero had not given up a run in his previous 14 appearances and
had given up only one run in 291/3 innings (0.31 earned-run average)
this season. He was the sixth Minnesota pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 9, Cleveland 5--Damian Jackson's three-run double
highlighted Detroit's eight-run seventh inning at Cleveland just
before thunderstorms arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 5-1, the Tigers got seven hits--a homer, three doubles
and three singles--two walks and a sacrifice fly against reliever
David Riske (0-2) and two other pitchers in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob Cruz homered and Robert Fick doubled twice in Detroit's
biggest inning this season, shortly before severe thunderstorms lit
up and shook Jacobs Field and caused a 1-hour 41-minute rain delay in
the bottom of the eighth.</TE>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>At a time when major league players are making their case for a
possible strike, one of the game's greatest ambassadors said
Wednesday that the players should order union chief Donald Fehr to
negotiate a new labor agreement promptly.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the ballplayers should go to Fehr and say, 'Go in and
settle this thing,'" Negro league legend Buck O'Neil said.</LD>
<LD>   While the owners believe the union is more interested in
preserving the current economic system than negotiating for a new
one, O'Neil said he blames both sides for the failure to reach a new
labor agreement. And, while Commissioner Bud Selig travels the
country arguing that the sport is on the verge of financial ruin,
O'Neil said New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner ought to lead
owners in demanding that Selig's negotiating team reach a settlement.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neil, 90, a star first baseman for the Kansas City Monarchs from
1938-55 and now chairman of the Negro League Baseball Museum here,
said he never made more than $1,000 per month playing for the
Monarchs. But Negro league players could make more money than major
league players in that era, he said, by supplementing their income
playing winter ball in Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   He does not begrudge today's players their million-dollar
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care how much money they're making," he said. "If the
money wasn't there, they wouldn't be making it."</TE>
<TE>   The labor strife obscures potentially greater issues in the sport,
among them attracting a generation of athletes lost to football,
basketball, soccer and golf.</TE>
<TE>   "During my era, the greatest athletes in the world played
baseball," O'Neil said. "The best white athletes played Major League
Baseball. The best black athletes played Negro league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the best athletes in the world might be teeing up a
ball, dunking a basketball or throwing a football. I believe the last
true athlete we had in Major League Baseball was Bo Jackson."</TE>

<HD>Signing of Pitcher Is Put on Hold</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Dominican's visa application denied because he
might be two years older than he claimed. Contract could be voided or
redone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' signing of Dominican pitcher Jonathan Corporan to a
$930,000 bonus in early April has been put on hold--and could be
voided--because of questions surrounding the age of the 6-foot-2
right-hander with a 93-mph fastball.</LD>
<LD>   Team officials--primarily Jeff Schugel, director of international
scouting, and Luchy Guerra, senior manager of Latin American
operations--spent five weeks in February and March trying to verify
Corporan's age, even hiring a private investigator to assist in the
interviews of family members and school officials and to research
public records.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans was confident Corporan was 16
when he signed and turned 17 on April 21.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very comfortable saying this is a 16-year-old kid," Evans
said. "Because of that, we think we got a really good player."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office also approved the deal.</TE>
<TE>   But Corporan's application for a visa to attend the Dodgers'
extended spring training camp in Florida two weeks ago was denied
because the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo suspects Corporan is two
years older than he claims.</TE>
<TE>   Corporan left Campo Las Palmas, the Dodgers' academy in Guerra,
Dominican Republic, this week to return to his Santo Domingo home and
tend to the matter, and the Dodgers hope it will be cleared up in a
week or so.</TE>
<TE>   But if Corporan is older than he claims--as many Latin players
have been found to be since the federal government crackdown on
immigration documentation in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks--the Dodgers will probably want to renegotiate his bonus and
sign him for less.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we're not bound to the contract if he can't
get a visa," Schugel said. "We like this kid, even if he's two or
three years older, but his projection level goes down if he is older,
and we should be able to get him under some different terms.... If he
is a bit older, so be it. We're confident he's still going to be a
Dodger; we just have to let the process run its course."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Melendez, baseball's vice president of international baseball
operations, said the Dodgers would retain Corporan's rights even if
he is 19, and that an addendum to the contract could be executed,
reflecting Corporan's actual age.</TE>
<TE>   Don Nomura, Corporan's agent, said he has no doubts about
Corporan's age.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers did their homework, the commissioner's office
approved it, and now the U.S. consulate is saying this is not who he
is, and they have proof," Nomura said. "I told them to verify that,
show me the proof, and they haven't done it. The Dodgers aren't
happy, we're not happy, he hasn't got his bonus. Everything is on
hold."</TE>
<TE>   If there is an age discrepancy, the Dodgers would prefer Corporan
be older, not younger, than he claims.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the commissioner's office ruled that third baseman Adrian
Beltre was 15 when the Dodgers signed him in 1994. Teams are not
allowed to sign Latin American players younger than 16.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were fined $50,000, prohibited from scouting or
signing first-year Dominican players for a year and had to suspend
operations at their Dominican academy for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our staff did an outstanding job doing a lot of homework," Evans
said of the Corporan case, "and if there are any questions, we've
gone to great lengths to get as many answers as were available to
us."</TE>

<HD>Blatter Is Reelected in a Landslide</HD>
<DH>Analysis: FIFA president fends off accusations, but
governing body's problems persist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>It was an African delegate from Kenya who spoke for all of
international soccer's smaller and less powerful federations
Wednesday when he said they felt as if they were "dancing with
elephants."</LD>
<LD>   And it was an African candidate who was crushed in that dangerous
dance when Issa Hayatou of Cameroon was soundly defeated by incumbent
Joseph "Sepp" Blatter of Switzerland in what had been a bitter and
acrimonious battle for the presidency of FIFA, world soccer's
governing body.</LD>
<LD>   Despite claims of corruption and cronyism, bribery and financial
mismanagement that have been leveled against him over the last few
months, Blatter won with astonishing ease.</LD>
<TE>   Of FIFA's 204 member nations, 197 were eligible to vote at the
53rd FIFA Congress, and Blatter swept to a first-ballot victory,
139-56, with two votes declared void.</TE>
<TE>   The election signals an end to one of the most turbulent periods
in FIFA's 98-year history, but the fact that Blatter, a 66-year-old
former Swiss Army colonel, sportswriter and public relations
executive, has held onto the position he won four years ago will not
make the problems disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Scandal and rumors of scandal have surrounded FIFA for more than
three decades. Brazilian Joao Havelange, Blatter's predecessor and
mentor and the man who ruled FIFA for 24 years as if it were his
personal fiefdom, hovered around the fringes of the election like the
ghost of Christmas past.</TE>
<TE>   When it was all over, the 88-year-old Havelange was one of a
parade of figures, including longtime allies Julio Grondona of
Argentina and Chuck Blazer of the United States, who embraced Blatter
and congratulated him on surviving the verbal knife-fight that had
preceded the election.</TE>
<TE>   At issue has been the state of FIFA's finances, and whether
Blatter has mortgaged the future of the organization by borrowing
from anticipated income from the 2006 World Cup in Germany to meet
the bills of today.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbing Peter to pay Paul," is how the president of Ireland's
soccer federation put it.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, especially FIFA vice presidents Lennart Johansson of
Sweden and Chung Mong-joon of South Korea, claimed FIFA is hundreds
of millions of dollars in debt, and also suggested that Blatter had
used FIFA development programs and the $250,000 it annually gives to
each of its 204 member nations as a way of buying votes.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter consistently denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the
charges were a political smear campaign aimed at ousting him from the
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Matters reached a head on May 3 when Michel Zen-Ruffinen of
Switzerland, a former Blatter protege and the man who succeeded him
as FIFA's secretary general, delivered a scathing report that hinted
that Blatter might have broken Swiss law in his mishandling of FIFA
finances.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven members of FIFA's executive committee subsequently asked
Blatter to resign and, when he did not, they turned the Zen-Ruffinen
documents over to Swiss prosecutors to determine whether any laws had
been broken. The outcome of that action is pending.</TE>
<TE>   After Blatter's victory Wednesday, Zen-Ruffinen's position
appeared precarious in the extreme and he acknowledged that he could
lose his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't resign, I have nothing to be ashamed of," Zen-Ruffinen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter almost certainly will have other ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "If he says he is in trouble, then he is in trouble," Blatter said
ominously, adding that in his second four-year term he would "be a
bit more prudent in the choice of people who have to work directly
with me."</TE>
<TE>   Switching with ease between English, French, German and Spanish,
Blatter thanked the Congress for voting for him and promised to work
for unity.</TE>
<TE>   "One must be practical to be FIFA president," he said, "but I am
emotional today because after months of certain newspapers being
directed to say what a bad man I am, you have once again given me
your trust. If it means I am now a good man, then you are good men
also."</TE>
<TE>   The task of reuniting FIFA will not be easy, if it is possible at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the United States, which supported Blatter's reelection,
England opposed it, and, in a powerful pre-vote speech Wednesday,
Adam Crozier, chief executive of the English Football Assn.,
explained why.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, FIFA has lost 470 million Swiss francs [$320
million] over the last four years," Crozier said. "Realistically,
FIFA has negative equity of 430 million Swiss francs [$300 million].</TE>
<TE>   "One thing is certain, it is not good news and it will get worse."</TE>
<TE>   If the FIFA finances are in the disarray that is claimed, it could
put into jeopardy such events as the FIFA Women's World Cup and the
FIFA Confederations Cup, both scheduled for next year. The FIFA World
Club Championship, postponed last year because of lack of funds,
could disappear altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter's election victory is not the finale, merely the prelude.
The "dancing with elephants" will continue.</TE>

<HD>It's Better Late Than Never for Kuerten</HD>
<DH>French Open: Brazilian plays into darkness and avoids upset
with five-set win over Sanguinetti.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>It's smart to keep the dramatic gestures in appropriate order.</LD>
<LD>   After all, three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil didn't face a match point Wednesday in his close escape
against Italian Davide Sanguinetti in the second round. There was no
need to draw a heart in the clay as he did last year after surviving
match point against qualifier Michael Russell in the fourth round.</LD>
<LD>   In any event, the fans may not have been able to see it because it
was so dark when Kuerten finished, about 9:15 local time Wednesday
night. Still, the seventh-seeded Kuerten had to do something to
acknowledge his 6-7 (0), 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Sanguinetti
in 3 hours 3 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Kuerten sprinted around Court Suzanne Lenglen, giving high fives
to the fans along the sides of the charming show court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's like this every year," said Kuerten, who trailed
0-2, love-40 in the fourth set. "I have to pass and survive these
situations to start growing my game. Still alive. It's good to
survive like this."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the only French Open champion to deliver in the
darkness. Carlos Moya of Spain, the 1998 winner, finished even later
than Kuerten, at 9:51, cracking a clean forehand return winner past
Mark Philippoussis of Australia on his third match point, winning,
6-2, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (9).</TE>
<TE>   There was no shortage of drama on an overloaded day. One of the
favorites, Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, twisted his right ankle in
practice against countryman Tommy Robredo and had to be carried into
the locker room. Ferrero had tests at a local hospital, and is
considered questionable for his second-round match today.</TE>
<TE>   Because of two days of stop-and-go rain, the schedule was backed
up and officials were forced to use 16 courts for singles matches.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick found himself on the cozy confines of Court 2, packed
with young schoolchildren, who, at times, screamed and sang. Mopeds
buzzed along the street outside, and a photographer, on the court,
snapped pictures with one hand and lit a cigarette with another.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say the typical French setting bothered Roddick in
his first-round match. The problem was more with the left hand of his
opponent, Wayne Arthurs, who delivered 25 aces and eventually
unnerved the 13th-seeded Roddick, winning, 4-6, 7-6 (14), 4-6, 7-5,
6-3. Arthurs also had 103 unforced errors.</TE>
<TE>   It's the nature of this sport that veterans start to figure out
the younger players in their second year on the tour. Arthurs agreed
this is happening with Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I think so. I actually sat down and watched [Tommy] Haas
play Andy in Monte Carlo," Arthurs said of a one-sided Roddick loss.
"Haas was standing a long way back on his serve, looping the ball up
to him. A bit of a tactic I used today."</TE>
<TE>   Arthurs won only five times in 2002 before the French Open, and
the outcome continued a disappointing run for Roddick in the Grand
Slam tournaments this year. He lost in the second round at the
Australian Open, and this is the second time he has lost in the first
round of a Slam in five appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough because he has about 72 different serves that he can
hit, so you're not really sure which one's coming," said Roddick, who
had four set points in the second, including three in the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   The serve isn't the only unpredictable aspect of Arthurs' game. At
times, his backhand is shockingly bad. Other times, he is able to
generate sufficient pace off it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the tricky thing about him," Roddick said. "You want to
keep the ball on the court from the back, but sometimes it causes you
to get a little too complacent out there."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick's coach, Frenchman Tarik Benhabiles, said: "He needs a
little bit more experience. At the end, he didn't mix it up. It's
going to take time. He's got a job to do from A to Z."</TE>
<TE>   James Blake advanced to the second round when his opponent, Lars
Burgsmuller of Germany, retired in the second set because of a right
side muscle strain. Also advancing were Vince Spadea and Cecil Mamiit
of Los Angeles. Spadea defeated the aging Cedric Pioline of France,
4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in the first round, his first tour-level win
in 15 months, and first Slam victory in almost two years.</TE>
<TE>   Mamiit's drought was not nearly as long. He defeated hard-serving
Max Mirnyi of Belarus, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, in three hours. Mirnyi,
who has played well on clay of late, had 82 unforced errors and 10
double faults. On his third match point, Mamiit won it by making a
sensational diagonal run from the back of the court to get a drop
volley.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember how far back I was," Mamiit said. "I just tried
as fast as I could, pumping my arms, trying to get to that ball. It
was a die-hard situation. I just utilized my weapon. It just shows I
have my legs back, and that's what got me through the match."</TE>

<LD>All Serena Williams was missing were the shin guards.</LD>
<LD>   Her pre-World Cup tribute to the Cameroon national soccer team
consisted of a green dress, green and yellow shoes (not cleats, of
course, this being clay) and, best of all, yellow socks that were
almost knee high.</LD>
<LD>   Her soccer awareness on the eve of the World Cup does not fully
extend to the United States, as she asked whether Kobe Johnson was
still playing. Close enough, she was thinking of Cobi Jones.</LD>
<TE>   Anyway, Williams has a commercial link, through Puma, to
Cameroon--which will play Ireland in its opening game Saturday in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I always wear sleeveless things, Puma came up with this
idea for me during the French Open to wear the Cameroon outfit, which
is really exciting," said the third-seeded Williams, who defeated
Martina Sucha of Slovakia, 6-3, 6-0, on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, us Americans aren't really into--we call it soccer--but
lately I've been watching a lot of the football or soccer....
[Cameroon] won the Olympics in Sydney. I'm supporting them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was reading an article where it says that Cameroon is
everyone's favorite team. If you're supporting England, a lot of
people have this love for Cameroon because they're always fighting so
much it seems. They're the best African team."</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams, who won her second-round match, 6-0, 6-1, against
Wynne Prakusya of Indonesia in 39 minutes, probably won't be
following her younger sister's fashion statement.</TE>
<TE>   "She said it was really nice, really cute," Serena said. "I think
she wishes she had a team she could support in the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   And as for watching Cameroon....</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm awake," Serena said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to say who had a more difficult day in their
first-round loss, Anna Kournikova or Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain. Sanchez-Vicario, a three-time French Open champion, was
humbled in a 6-0, 6-1 loss to her up-and-coming countrywoman Marta
Marrero.</TE>
<TE>   It was the worst loss at Roland Garros for the 30-year-old
Sanchez-Vicario, who faced a litany of questions about retirement. A
French Open semifinalist as recently as two years ago, she said she
is going to take some time off from tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova lost to Australian wild-card entrant Christina Wheeler,
who had not won a WTA match this year. Wheeler, ranked No. 197, beat
Kournikova, 6-4, 6-3, and relished the reflected attention from the
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure half of them weren't there for me," said Wheeler, who
had to beat four Australians to receive the wild-card spot. "Well,
Anna Kournikova is Anna Kournikova, and she always will be. I guess
it was a little bit different. She's very famous for her on-court and
off-court things that she does."</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova, who is now being coached by Harold Solomon, was asked
about her lawsuit against Penthouse magazine. The magazine has
acknowledged its error in publishing photos it claimed to be of
Kournikova. Instead, they were of Judith E. Soltesz-Benetton, the
daughter-in-law of fashion designer Luciano Benetton.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I put this? Well, first of all, it's not me," Kournikova
said. "I think people who have seen it know that, just in general.
I'm not really allowed to talk about it for the legal purposes. I
really don't know what to say about that."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was only an exhibition for the Galaxy when it played CD Aguila of
El Salvador on Wednesday night at the Rose Bowl, but backup
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman came to play for real.</LD>
<LD>   Hartman, who has started only one Major League Soccer game this
season while starter Matt Reis has the Galaxy three points out of
first place, had three impressive saves in a 3-0 Galaxy victory in
front of an announced crowd of 5,277.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Ruiz scored two goals and Gavin Glinton added another, but
Hartman, the 1999 MLS goalkeeper of the year, had Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid singing his praises after the game.</LD>
<TE>   "He had a huge save with the game on the line," Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably gave Reis something to lose sleep over and gave Sigi
something to think about."</TE>
<TE>   Reis and Hartman have alternated as starters the last two years,
but Schmid decided to use Reis at the beginning of this season.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, the Galaxy improved to 20-8-10 in international
games.</TE>
<TE>   CD Aguila is the 10-time national champion of El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy has one more exhibition scheduled for June 26 against
River Plate of Argentina.</TE>

<HD>Croatians Take Exception to Mexican Coach's Criticism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Whether the aim was to motivate his team against a favored opponent
or simply to play with some Croatian minds a bit, Mexico Coach Javier
Aguirre's dismissive assessment of the Croatian squad has drawn an
emotional response from the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing that Aguirre had described Croatia as not "a really
strong team" that is weak in defense, Croatia Coach Mirko Jozic shot
back, saying Mexico "should show us some respect. When the coaches of
Italy and Germany tell us that this generation of players is
talented, that means something, and I think Mexico should respect us,
too."</LD>
<LD>   Mexico opens World Cup group play against Croatia on Monday in
Niigata. Croatia, which finished third in the 1998 World Cup, is
favored, along with Italy, to advance from Group G. Several days
earlier, Croatia midfielder Anthony Seric told Reuters, "We're pretty
confident [of advancing]. After we win the first match ... then that
will make life so much easier, even to play against harder teams,
because there is less pressure."</LD>
<TE>   That might have prompted the provocative remarks from Aguirre, who
told reporters at the team's training base in Mikuni, "I think this
Croatian team here is not as strong as the one that placed third in
France in 1998. It does not look like a very strong team."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said he and assistant coach Ignacio Ambriz "know the
Croatians in detail." Aguirre called Croatia suspect defensively,
saying that the only defender who impresses him is Robert Kovac.
"[Boris] Zivkovic does not please me and [midfielder Robert] Jarni is
more of an attacker."</TE>
<TE>   Jozic called the '98 team, which lost to eventual champion France
in the semifinals, "a golden generation. For a small country with a
small population to achieve what they did, it was special.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a lot to expect for us to do that again."</TE>
<TE>   When informed of Aguirre's comments, Croatia forward Davor Suker,
the leading scorer at the '98 World Cup, told Reuters, "That's
excellent news. We will also see what they say after the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ireland has submitted a late request to add Celtic midfielder
Colin Healy to its roster to replace captain Roy Keane, who was
kicked off the squad after a series of disputes with Coach Mick
McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   The Football Assn. of Ireland said it had to wait to see how the
Keane situation would be resolved before filing its request to FIFA.
Such a request, so close to the tournament, is considered a longshot.
FIFA rules allow for replacements only in cases of injury or
extraordinary circumstances, such as a death in the family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scientists in Northern Ireland, after hours of exhaustive research
and statistical analysis, have determined that Italy will reach this
year's World Cup final and lose.</TE>
<TE>   And who will beat the Italians?</TE>
<TE>   Either Argentina or Brazil--the study was somewhat inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the University of Ulster used two methods of
research. The first involved a focus group analysis of teams'
strengths and weaknesses, history, even the status of England
midfielder David Beckham's broken foot. The group's conclusion:
Argentina over Italy in the final.</TE>
<TE>   The second method was a computer simulation of the tournament.
Researchers played the tournament 2,000 times. Result: Brazil over
Italy in the final.</TE>
<TE>   "The result of our research is a classic case of head versus
heart--number-crunching against subjective judgment," Peter
O'Donoghue of the university told the BBC. "It will be interesting to
see how the tournament pans out and whether the human brain or the
computer is the best way analyzing such unpredictable results as the
World Cup."</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Force Game 7</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goal by slumping Shanahan helps Detroit beat
Avalanche, 2-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Brendan Shanahan said he didn't sleep well after missing an open net
in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   He made sure that wasn't a problem after Game 6.</LD>
<LD>   Shanahan broke out of his scoring slump with a goal in the first
period, and Dominik Hasek stopped 24 shots as the Red Wings beat the
Colorado Avalanche, 2-0, Wednesday night to force a Game 7.</LD>
<TE>   "You tell yourself good things when you're getting close and
hitting posts, but it's still very frustrating," Shanahan said. "I
personally wanted to have a big night, but I don't think it was a
night of personal gains."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit ended a four-game losing streak in elimination games
dating to a victory over St. Louis in the 1996 conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado will have to play a Game 7 for the fourth straight
series--extending its own league record--and for the fifth time in
its last six series.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche have won four consecutive Game 7s, including
victories over the Kings and San Jose this year.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7 is Friday night in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not happy going back to Detroit," Colorado goalie Patrick
Roy said. "It is a big challenge, but it's been like this for us all
year. We have a hard time making it easy on ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings rallied from eight one-goal deficits in the first
five games, but didn't need any comebacks this time.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan, criticized for his lack of production in the series,
opened the scoring with 38 seconds left in the first period on a shot
that Roy thought he stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Roy raised his glove, thinking he caught Shanahan's shot from the
slot, but the puck hit the ice and trickled into the net. Roy briefly
tried to argue the call, then bent over and covered his mask with
both gloves in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know if I had it in my glove," said Roy, who stopped 26
shots. "I held my glove up looking for the puck and it rolled back."</TE>
<TE>   It was Shanahan's fifth goal of the playoffs.</TE>

<LD>Curt Schilling became the first 10-game winner in the majors,
retiring the first 15 batters in the Arizona Diamondbacks' 7-3
victory over the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday night at San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (10-1) gave up three hits and struck out nine in eight
innings. But several miscues in the sixth led to three San Francisco
runs.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling hit Tsuyoshi Shinjo with a pitch and Ramon Martinez
singled for the first hit. They advanced on Schilling's wild pitch to
Damon Minor and scored with two out on David Bell's triple off the
right-field wall.</LD>
<TE>   Bell scored on Barry Bonds' line-drive double off the wall in
right to narrow Arizona's advantage to 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Atlanta 3--Jose Vidro hit a three-run double against
reliever John Smoltz (0-2) with two out in the top of the ninth
inning to lift the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta nearly rallied in its half of the ninth. Julio Franco hit
a two-out run-scoring single to make it 4-3, but Scott Stewart worked
out of a bases-loaded jam to earn his third save.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Chicago 0--Kip Wells pitched a four-hitter at
Pittsburgh for the Pirates' first complete game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Wells (8-2) won his fourth in a row to become the fifth NL pitcher
to win eight games. He is only two victories short of his victory
total last season.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Philadelphia 3--Mike Piazza hit a tiebreaking homer in
the seventh inning and the Mets rallied from a three-run deficit at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies took a 3-0 lead in the fifth, but starter Randy Wolf
couldn't hold it and Philadelphia lost for the 22nd time in 27 road
games.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Florida 2--Aaron Boone's three-run homer, his third
home run in two games, sparked a five-run first inning at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Luis Castillo singled to extend his hitting streak to 17
games, the longest active streak in the major leagues.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Appears to Save Twins</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They won't be eliminated in 2003 if commission
approves written agreement with the team and baseball.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins will be saved--in 2003, at least--if the
Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission receives and approves a
written agreement with the Twins and Major League Baseball regarding
a proposed settlement of the commission's lawsuit against the Twins
and baseball.</LD>
<LD>   The commission had been expected to vote on the agreement
Wednesday, according to sources, but delayed that decision until it
receives a copy in writing.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball sources said they viewed that as a formality, and
Commissioner Bud Selig said he was "hopeful" this would remove one of
several significant hurdles in keeping the Twins in Minnesota beyond
next year.</LD>
<TE>   Should that happen, and the Twins survive, it would seem to remove
the possibility of any elimination of teams in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball had ticketed the Twins and Montreal Expos for
elimination, and Selig reiterated on Wednesday that the industry
can't fold one team at a time because it would create scheduling
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   However, Selig added, if the obstacles to keeping the Twins in
Minnesota are removed, the next step on the contraction front would
be the decision by arbitrator Shyam Das on the union grievance
charging that management cannot unilaterally contract without the
players' approval.</TE>
<TE>   That decision is expected in late July or early August, and a
confident Selig said "once that ruling is made, we plan to proceed
with contraction. We have other candidates."</TE>
<TE>   Although Selig never named the Twins and Expos as the victims when
he revealed the contraction scenario in November, the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission filed suit in Hennepin County Court, and
Judge Harry Crump issued a temporary injunction that was upheld on
appeal and forced the Twins to honor the final year of their
Metrodome lease, as they are now doing.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, which contends that baseball illegally interfered with
the commission's ability to negotiate a long-term lease with the
team, remained on the court docket as a possible insurance policy if
attempts to keep the team in Minnesota through legislative support
for a new stadium failed. Under the proposed agreement, the
commission will drop the suit if the team stays in 2003 but would
have the right to reintroduce it if baseball tried to eliminate or
move the team in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The behind-the-scenes efforts by Selig and other baseball
officials to resolve the suit out of court, with Crump serving as
mediator, seem a contradiction to the initial attempt to eliminate
the Twins, but skeptics believed from the start that contraction, as
applied to the Twins, was designed only as leverage to influence the
Minnesota legislature to pass a stadium financing bill that would
enable Carl Pohlad, the Twins' owner and Selig ally, to find a local
buyer.</TE>
<TE>   The legislature recently passed a $330-million funding package for
a roof-ready ballpark, but among the provisions that could prove
insurmountable, it still requires a voter referendum and a
$120-million down payment by the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   There is also no buyer on the horizon, but as a baseball source
said, "no one is going to step forward while there are unresolved
legal issues. We're hopeful that the suit has been cleared up and we
can move on to resolving the stadium situation."</TE>

<HD>Keller May Miss Opener After Injuring Elbow in Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Events might be conspiring to save Coach Bruce Arena the difficulty
of deciding between Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel as the starting
goalkeeper for the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Keller suffered an elbow injury in training Wednesday, and
although X-rays at the Asan Medical Center here showed no evidence of
a break, an MRI test was scheduled. The Tottenham Hotspur keeper
could be forced to miss Wednesday's opener against Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   It was as recently as Saturday that Arena said he might even
consider using both goalkeepers in the first round, starting one
against Portugal in Suwon, another against South Korea on June 10 in
Daegu, and then picking one or the other for the June 14 match
against Poland in Daejeon.</LD>
<TE>   "The decision is going to be based on who gives us the best chance
to win," Arena said. "It's not sentimental. If it were sentimental, I
would give myself a chance to play. That would not give us the best
chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Arena, a former goalkeeper, played one national team game for the
U.S., coming on as a substitute in a 2-0 loss to Israel in Beersheba
in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keller, who started against Germany and Iran at the 1998 World Cup
in France, has appeared in 11 games for the U.S. this year compared
to four for Friedel, and it was his play as much as anything that
earned the U.S. its Gold Cup victory.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel played against Yugoslavia in the final France '98 game.</TE>
<TE>   If Keller's injury forces him to the sideline, Tony Meola would
become Friedel's backup.</TE>
<TE>   Meola was the starter in the 1990 and 1994 World Cup tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team has been in South Korea for almost a week and has
settled in well. It has been training once a day, usually behind
closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   "I find humor in comments that we've been lax in our training,"
Arena said. "We don't believe you train twice a day when you've been
playing for the last 10 months. We'd rather have our players have
something in reserve."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The players might take a trip out of Seoul to visit the DMZ,
something they did during a trip to South Korea in December.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be optional for our players," Arena said. "If we
can work it out, it would be great. Others will use the day off to
golf, to shop, to do whatever they would like to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the many banal questions tossed the players' way: winger
Earnie Stewart was asked if he would like to see the U.S. reach the
semifinals, as it did in the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even remember who they played," he said. "That would be
tremendous. We would be happy with that."</TE>
<TE>   Just for the record, it was Belgium and Paraguay the U.S. defeated
before falling to Argentina in the semifinals.</TE>

<HD>Surreality TV Triumphs: 'Osbournes' Is Renewed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO and GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Ozzy Inc., opportunity keeps pounding on the crucifix-covered door.
Ozzy Osbourne, the aging British rocker notorious for once biting the head
off a bat onstage, agreed Wednesday to open his Beverly Hills mansion for
20 more episodes of the hit MTV series "The Osbournes."</LD>
<LD>   After only 10 installments this year, it has become a bona fide
cultural sensation: MTV's top-rated series ever and the most watched
new entertainment show on cable.</LD>
<LD>   Osbourne plays himself, a 54-year-old, tattoo-covered
hellion-turned-slipper-wearing dad with world-weary teenagers.
Basically, his family's shtick is to loaf around the house, which is
furnished in a style that might be termed "kinky robber baron": plush
couches, antique carpets, crucifixes galore, totems of the occult and
a menagerie of rebellious house pets.</LD>
<TE>   The success of the show--a bizarre, unscripted, profanity-laced
family comedy that gives new meaning to the term "reality TV"--has
created heat for all things Ozzy. He's got an invitation to play next
week for Queen Elizabeth II, a six-figure book contract with Simon &amp;
Schuster, a big stack of magazine covers and a flurry of would-be
imitators. The burst of celebrity for Osbourne and his family has
spawned a host of Ozzie-and-Harriet allusions from cultural
commentators (the consensus: America's come a long way) and a
scene-stealing appearance at the White House correspondents' dinner
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Ozzfest, a touring festival launched seven years
ago with the idea of repackaging the aging rocker with young stars,
which will play to a sold-out crowd in Prague, Czech Republic,
tonight as it winds its way toward the United States, where it was
the top hard-rock tour of 2001. It's ripe to repeat the feat.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the Osbournes get filthy rich," said Van Toffler,
president of MTV and MTV2.</TE>
<TE>   MTV is doing its part. Terms of the contract were not divulged,
but Toffler said that previously published reports projecting that
the contract would be valued at $20million were "wildly inflated."
Osbourne and his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, were unavailable
for comment, as the Ozzfest tour moves through Europe.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, MTV can show each episode worldwide up to 100 times,
while raising the cost of advertising on the show. Trade reports
indicate that some commercials in the show have gone for close to
$100,000, virtually unheard-of rates for a cable offering.</TE>
<TE>   The network also committed to show three Osbournes specials this
summer, including one described by MTV as "a very special dinner with
the Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   So-called "reality shows" such as MTV's long-running "The Real
World" and CBS' "Survivor" have thrived, in part, because the casts
change from one season to the next. But unlike those unscripted
series, "The Osbournes" will not change its central characters next
season, and its primary joke will remain the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozzy, Sharon, Jack, Kelly, the dogs, the cats, the assistants,
the band, the roadies, the security guards, the neighbors, Melinda
the nanny and the rest will be back on MTV in the fall to the delight
of millions of fans around the world," Toffler said.</TE>
<TE>   But how long will millions of viewers continue to be amused by
Osbourne's tiffs with wife, Sharon, shouting at kids Jack and Kelly
and doing his chores around their kitchen? The torrent of profanities
requires so many bleeps that the audio suggests a broken heart
monitor.</TE>
<TE>   At its height this spring, 7.8 million people tuned in on Tuesday
nights at 10:30, according to Nielsen Media Research. And they
weren't just the channel's core audience of 18- to 24-year-olds. "The
Osbournes" plays to a wider swath, reaching into a demographic of 18-
to 34-year-olds and beyond. Though its numbers pale in comparison
with, say, NBC's hit sitcom "Friends," which pulls in about 25million
viewers each week, its quirky approach helped it catch on as a hip
viewing choice among media and entertainment industry elites.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Padnick, the over-50 president of Castle Rock TV, said the
show's appeal has spanned the generations at his house.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife, who is my age, is not a typical MTV viewer, but she
wandered into the room the first night when my son was watching it,"
he said. "As weird as they are, they are a loving family.... It's a
great bonding thing."</TE>
<TE>   Toffler said next season may follow the Osbournes back to their
other home in the United Kingdom, where the show just premiered to
big ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people may float in and out," Toffler said. "But we won't
fabricate anything that wouldn't feel organic and, for example,
introduce people that wouldn't normally relate to the Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Burnett, producer of "Survivor," now preparing for its fifth
edition, said the MTV series does not necessarily need to change.</TE>
<TE>   "'The Osbournes' is really funny," Burnett said. "I love it....
It's successful because of the characters. He is hilarious without
knowing it."</TE>
<TE>   The success of "The Osbournes" is also leading, predictably, to
imitators, on MTV and elsewhere. E! Entertainment Television said
Wednesday that it plans a similar show about buxom
model-actress-widow Anna Nicole Smith. And Toffler said MTV is
exploring projects that would provide behind-the-scenes looks at
other entertainers and celebrities, such as rapper-record
producer-entrepreneur Sean "P. Diddy" Combs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about P. Diddy, but I don't think we'd try to
replicate a family situation like the Osbournes'," he said. "I'm not
sure we could ever find a family as unique, as unpredictable and as
twisted as the Osbournes are."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most unpredictable of all is the current widespread
acceptance of former Black Sabbath frontman Osbourne, once reviled by
parents as a gory symbol of reckless rock, as an elder statesmen of
heavy metal and as a multimedia star.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of failed lawsuits by parents who claimed his music
played a role in the suicides of their children, the screeching
native of Birmingham, England, sat out the late 1980s to play father
and heal himself. He called a 1991 album and tour his farewell
effort, and with grunge and rap changing the sound of teen angst,
there was every reason to presume he was accurate.</TE>
<TE>   But seven years ago, he launched a festival tour celebrating the
clangorous power of heavy metal. It was viewed as an ingenious
creation of Sharon Osbourne to bring bigger and younger audiences to
the singer, who had created the sonic blueprint for the British wave
of 1970s metal music. Instead of touring on his own or with metal
heroes of his generation, Ozzfest teamed him with young metal stars
who view Osbourne with reverence and, by association, and kept him
relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park, Papa Roach and Disturbed are just some of the bands
that have become major sellers with help from stints on Ozzfest. This
year's edition of Ozzfest includes Rob Zombie, P.O.D., Adema and, of
course, Osbourne himself, and it arrives in the U.S. on July 6 in
Virginia and locally on Aug. 31 with two shows at the Glen Helen
Blockbuster Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   The Ozzfest brand name has matured to become another moneymaker
for Ozzy Inc. The tour now reportedly has record companies pay toward
production costs if they want their new "baby bands" included. Some
managers say the charge had been $75,000, but others say it's now six
digits.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Osbourne's personal fortune was an estimated $58
million. One reason that figure stays high is the rocker's benefit of
having an in-house manager in wife Sharon, noted Gary Bongiovanni,
editor of Pollstar magazine, the concert industry trade.</TE>
<TE>   "That right there keeps the money in the same bank account," said
Bongiovanni, who added that a star of Osbourne's stature generally
pays a manager 10% of his income. "That's the usual level. But, hey,
who knows what kind of deal Sharon has worked out?"</TE>

<HD>India Claims Proof of Foe Aiding Kashmir Rebels</HD>
<DH>Asia: Incriminating data against Pakistan come as both
nations continue to trade fire in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and SIDHARTHA BARUA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>While Indian troops prepared for a possible war with Pakistan, their
government was pressing its case Wednesday with figures it insists
prove that the Pakistani military is supporting guerrillas who cross
into Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   In briefings for foreign envoys who are trying to avert a war
between the two South Asian nations, Indian officials provided
statistics meant to back their argument that Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf has failed to stop infiltration from areas his
military controls.</LD>
<LD>   In March, when many routes into Kashmir were covered with deep
snow, 132 fighters--most of them Pakistanis and other "foreign
mercenaries"--were able to slip over the Line of Control that divides
the disputed region between the two nations, a senior Indian military
source said.</LD>
<TE>   The number dropped to 113 in April but then jumped to 165 during
the first 27 days of this month, according to the source, who spoke
on the condition that he not be named.</TE>
<TE>   It is not possible to independently verify the Indian numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian contention reflects the growing war of words--and
cross-border gunfire--as the two nations find themselves on the brink
of a fourth war since 1947. On Wednesday, their forces continued to
shell each other across the cease-fire line in Kashmir, killing 23
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Today, police said, two militants, supported by rocket fire from a
nearby hill, entered an Indian police camp in Kashmir, killing three
officers and wounding several others. They were then trapped inside
the camp canteen, trading fire with police and paramilitary forces.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Bush administration warned Wednesday that
"irresponsible elements" are exploiting tensions between India and
Pakistan and could spark a cycle of violence that could lead to war.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a danger that as tensions escalate, the leaders [of
India and Pakistan] could find themselves in a situation in which
irresponsible elements can spark a conflict," State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher warned that a "serious conflagration could ensue if events
spiral out of control," and he called on Musharraf to follow up on a
pledge to prevent Muslim extremists from operating out of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the Indian government's count of recent infiltrations, weapons
taken from slain militants--such as heavy machine guns, rocket
launchers and large amounts of explosives--are among the evidence
cited to suggest the Pakistani army's support of the incursions, the
senior military source said. Also cited was the evident mobility of
the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire [Line of Control] is heavily mined on both sides, but
with certain gaps in the minefields which are recorded and in the
knowledge of local army commanders," he added. "This knowledge is
duly passed on to the infiltrators, without which they would not be
able to maneuver the way across the mine-infested terrain."</TE>
<TE>   Kashmir is a mainly Muslim area divided between India and Pakistan
by the Line of Control, which was established after a 1971 war
between the nations. Rebels in the section controlled by India, whose
government is dominated by Hindus, have been fighting for an
independent state, or union with mostly Muslim Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf claimed in a speech Monday night that no militants were
entering Indian-controlled Kashmir from Pakistani territory. Foreign
leaders, including President Bush, reacted skeptically.</TE>
<TE>   Making it clear that his government's patience is running out,
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Wednesday that Musharraf
has had enough time to stop what New Delhi calls cross-border
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It is vital that he recognize the urgency of the situation,"
Singh warned after meeting with British Foreign Minister Jack Straw.
The visiting official is one of several envoys trying to coax the
nations, both of which have tested nuclear weapons, back from the
brink.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that President Musharraf is serious" about ending
terrorism, Straw told reporters. "But the test of all of these things
has to be actions and not just words."</TE>
<TE>   At the root of the standoff, and diplomatic efforts to resolve it,
are conflicting views of where legitimate struggle for freedom ends
and terrorism begins.</TE>
<TE>   India sees Kashmiri guerrillas as proxy warriors serving Pakistan,
which denies providing anything but moral and political support to
the militants.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, while condemning attacks on civilians as terrorism,
continues to defend the right of Kashmiris to wage a "freedom
struggle" against Indian rule, even though separatist attacks
frequently kill civilians. To most of Kashmir's guerrillas, it is no
less than a jihad, or Muslim holy struggle, against Hindus and anyone
who aids them.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf banned two of the most ruthless groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba
and Jaish-e-Mohammed, after India blamed them for a December attack
on its Parliament building in New Delhi. But more than a dozen
Kashmiri militant groups still operate in a loose coalition called
the United Jihad Council, which has its headquarters in Muzaffarabad,
the main town in the Pakistani-held part of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The council is headed by Syed Salahuddin, who is supreme commander
of the militant group Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   He met on Feb. 1, 1996, with at least four officers from the
Pakistani military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency and "took an
oath for continuation of jihad and unity of the militant outfits,"
according to a senior source in India's civilian intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Salahuddin, wanted on terrorism charges in India, is considered
more moderate than many Kashmiri separatists and was almost forced
off the United Jihad Council for announcing a unilateral cease-fire
in July 2000. Any talk of laying down arms was quickly silenced.</TE>
<TE>   "The fight against Indian troops will continue until they no
longer occupy the land of Kashmir," the council said in a May 16
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Indian intelligence says Salahuddin and Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen have
close ties to the Pakistani military, which the civilian intelligence
source maintained is promoting them "in an attempt to give an
indigenous color to militancy in Jammu and Kashmir," the Indian state
in Kashmir. The source spoke on condition that he not be named
because of the clandestine nature of his work.</TE>
<TE>   At a March 7 meeting in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, the
United Jihad Council voted to expel four terrorist groups made up
mainly of Pakistanis and Afghans, according to the intelligence
officer. He identified the groups as Lashkar-e-Taiba and
Jaish-e-Mohammed, as well as Harkat Moujahedeen and Al Badr. All are
suspected of having links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   "The ISI, which wants the United Jihad Council to be more focused
and better coordinated in its activities, has asked the UJC to cut
down its membership to between three and four" groups, the source
added.</TE>
<TE>   "The UJC also suggested that cadres of Jaish, Lashkar and Al Badr
should join one of the larger Kashmiri groups of militants to
circumvent the Pakistan government's ban on them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reports from Pakistan say leaders of militant groups fighting in
Kashmir have complained in recent days that Musharraf is abandoning
them. Still, India isn't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   After three wars and 55 years of hostility, both countries are
deft at a dangerous game of bait and bluff. Since Sept. 11, the
U.S.-led war against terrorism has given each several new cards to
play, which in turn increases the risk of miscalculation.</TE>
<TE>   Since the December attack on its Parliament--which left 14 dead,
including the five gunmen--India has insisted that it has the same
right as the United States, Russia and Israel to strike against what
it calls terrorist training camps and infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf promised in a Jan. 12 speech that he wouldn't allow his
country to be a staging ground for terrorist attacks anywhere in the
world. Indian skepticism turned to outrage May 14 when Kashmiri
militants attacked an army camp and bus, killing more than 30 people,
including the wives and children of soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorist attacks on civilians and the Indian military's human
rights abuses are routine in a low-intensity conflict that has
claimed more than 33,000 lives since 1990. So there is an element of
strategy to New Delhi's assertion that its patience has run out now.</TE>
<TE>   When tensions were escalating in January, a senior aide to Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said in an interview that his
government saw a window of opportunity open after Sept. 11 to force a
settlement of the Kashmir dispute, which began when Britain granted
India and Pakistan independence in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   India has long opposed third-party mediation to help settle the
competing claims over Kashmir, while Pakistan continues to press
foreign governments, especially the U.S., to intervene. Pakistan
hopes that foreign mediation would force India to let Kashmiris vote
on independence.</TE>
<TE>   India says its military options include limited airstrikes against
what New Delhi claims is a network of training camps in the
Pakistani-controlled area of Kashmir and in Pakistan itself.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has denied that the camps exist, but supporters of the
Kashmiri separatist movement interviewed by The Times in Pakistan
last month named at least two that they said are operating in
restricted areas of Pakistan's North-West Frontier province. India
says there are dozens more.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. troops in Pakistan to support the hunt for Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters, India might be betting that Washington could
restrain Musharraf from retaliating for limited Indian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf warned this week that Pakistan would fight "with
full might" to defend itself. The struggle over Kashmir is such a
deeply emotive issue in Pakistan that the general couldn't expect to
rule for long if he let Indian strikes go unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan sees the U.S. war against terrorism as leverage against
India's threatened attack. Musharraf insists that he can't answer
Washington's call for more help tracking suspected Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters on his nation's western border with Afghanistan
while India is threatening to attack from the east.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage plans to visit India
and Pakistan next week, and the government in New Delhi will want to
hear more than mere promises from Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 29, Bush
singled out Musharraf for special praise.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the
terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own," Bush
said. "Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking
down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President
Musharraf."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was less admiring during a European tour this week, when
asked about Pakistan's testing in recent days of missiles capable of
carrying nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more concerned about insisting, along with other world
leaders ... that President Musharraf show results in terms of
stopping people from crossing the Line of Control," Bush said,
adding, "That's what's more important than the missile testing--that
he perform."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Premier Opts for Restraint</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As six victims of Palestinian attacks are buried,
Sharon is pressured to launch a new offensive or to build a
barricade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israelis buried six more victims of Palestinian attacks as pressure
mounted Wednesday on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to either launch
another wide-scale military operation in the West Bank or erect a
wall to separate it from pre-1967 Israel.</LD>
<LD>   With U.S. envoys heading toward the region to begin rebuilding
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and lay the groundwork for
an international conference, Sharon rejected any change in
policy--for now.</LD>
<LD>   At a stormy Cabinet meeting, Sharon turned aside advice from
ministers that he send massive forces back into Palestinian towns or
immediately build a security wall to cut off the West Bank. He
reprimanded army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz for recommending
that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat be expelled from
the West Bank. Stick to military issues and stay away from politics,
Sharon reportedly told Mofaz.</LD>
<TE>   The session ended with no decisions on how to respond to two
Palestinian attacks Tuesday night in the West Bank in which four
Israelis, including three teenage boys, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We will follow the same policy," said Raanan Gissin, spokesman
for the prime minister. "We will respond based on concrete
information, to hit the terrorists before they hit us, to hit them in
their beds, in their cities."</TE>
<TE>   A New Round</TE>
<TE>   of Diplomacy</TE>
<TE>   Sharon opted for restraint as he awaited the arrival today of U.S.
envoy William Burns to discuss convening a peace conference. CIA
Director George J. Tenet is expected to arrive as early as Friday to
begin contacts with Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs. A
situation of seething tension awaits the two envoys.</TE>
<TE>   The new round of diplomacy is aimed primarily at getting the
Palestinian Authority to adopt political reforms and restructure its
security forces, two steps that would make a Palestinian state more
acceptable to Israel, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the United States is urging Israel not to take
actions, including another prolonged incursion in the West Bank, that
would impede this process and escalate hostilities, the officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is deeply disappointed with Arafat's
failure to rein in terrorists, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "The uptake in terrorist activity over the past week or so has
been a clear indication that more needs to be done," a senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Since ending the five-week Operation Defensive Shield this month,
Israel has routinely sent troops and tanks into
Palestinian-controlled areas in what the army says is an ongoing
effort to thwart attacks. Troops occupied the biblical town of
Bethlehem for a fourth day Wednesday, carrying out house-to-house
searches for militants and keeping residents under curfew. Elsewhere
in the West Bank, troops were in the town of Kalkilya and continuing
a days-long blockade of Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, officials and witnesses said, about 40 Israeli
armored vehicles entered the West Bank city of Hebron, and troops
arrested at least four people, including a senior member of Hamas and
a senior member of Islamic Jihad--both militant Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, soldiers entered, then pulled out of the northern West
Bank city of Jenin, scene last month of one of the bloodiest fights
between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration with the army's tactics is growing, however, as
militants elude the arrest raids and slip through roadblocks and
other defenses to carry out the sort of attacks Defensive Shield
sought to eliminate.</TE>
<TE>   "And once again Jenin," Yoav Limor wrote in the Maariv newspaper
Tuesday. "As if they hadn't left the city last month, at the end of a
bloody battle whose bottom line, so it was promised, was that it
'successfully destroyed the local terrorist infrastructure.'"</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on Israelis dropped sharply in the immediate wake of
Defensive Shield, a senior military official told reporters in a
briefing Wednesday. "But in the last few days, we can sense a
degrading in the situation," said the official, who declined to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   His observation is painfully self-evident to Israelis, many of
whom had thought that Defensive Shield had restored some normality to
life.</TE>
<TE>   In little more than 24 hours this week, Israelis saw a woman and
her toddler granddaughter killed in a suicide bombing, a pool
lifeguard shot to death as he drove a West Bank road and three
teenage boys gunned down while playing basketball at a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Operation Defensive Shield, it turns out, is a limited shield
that urgently needs reinforcement," settler Hanoch Daum wrote in
Maariv. "Israel's citizens are not prepared to return to the terrible
days in which shooting attacks were an everyday occurrence and
suicide terrorists wandered around Israel looking for crowds of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Among those buried Wednesday were Ruth Peled, 56, and her
18-month-old granddaughter, Sinai Keinan. The two were killed, and
Sinai's parents injured, when a suicide bomber blew himself up Monday
in a crowd of families outside an ice cream shop in Petah Tikvah, six
miles northeast of Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands attended the joint funeral at Kibbutz Shfayim, near the
coastal city of Netanya. Sinai's disconsolate parents, newly
discharged from the hospital, were pushed in wheelchairs behind the
coffins.</TE>
<TE>   "Before another child turns into statistics or into an equation,
all the generals and the politicians and the statesmen must go all
the way and not stop," Lior Keinan, Sinai's father, said in a
hospital interview before the funeral. "They must just finish with
this."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Panel Urges</TE>
<TE>   End to Attacks in Israel</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued Wednesday, the Revolutionary Council of
Arafat's Fatah movement said suicide attacks inside Israel's pre-1967
boundaries should end. "Military attacks inside the Green Line must
stop because they reflect negatively on the image of our national
struggle," the council, a key policymaking forum, said after two
weeks of debate.</TE>
<TE>   The group, however, said it supports what it called "resistance"
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip--meaning attacks on Jewish settlers
and soldiers there.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the declaration, Israeli security officials say they are
thwarting attacks almost daily that are planned in the Israeli
heartland. For the second consecutive day Wednesday, traffic snarled
in the crowded coastal plain and in Jerusalem as police stopped and
searched cars, looking for suspected militants. National Police Chief
Shlomo Aharonishky said the police had reports that a gang had set
out from the West Bank city of Ramallah intending to carry out an
attack in downtown Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The army reported Wednesday night that it had arrested a
20-year-old Palestinian woman in the mostly Christian village of Beit
Sahur, south of the city. An army spokesman said she was meant to be
a second bomber in a suicide attack last week in the town of Rishon
Le Zion that killed two Israelis. She apparently backed out of the
attack, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday night, the Israeli Internet news service Y-net
reported that a would-be bomber was stopped at a checkpoint north of
Jerusalem but escaped on foot carrying a bag loaded with explosives.
A manhunt was said to be underway.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, Maariv noted in an editorial, Israelis have
been forced "to maintain a routine on the brink of madness: going to
work, school, shopping, even a night out in the constant shadow of
terrorism." Such a "routine of terrorism, the death roulette, the
constant fear, are things no country can accept."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Robin Wright in Washington and Megan K. Stack
in Jerusalem contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Examine Libyan Offer</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Washington calls the proposal of payments for
Lockerbie victims a step forward, but won't lift sanctions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Wednesday that the United States would
not lift sanctions against Libya based solely on its government's
offer of $2.7 billion as compensation for the 270 people killed in
the bombing in 1988 of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.</LD>
<LD>   But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called reports of the
proposal a move forward and said the U.S. would examine the offer
once it is formally made and the terms are relayed to Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "Just reading press accounts of what has been said about the
offer, it certainly is a step in the right direction, but I don't
think it resolves the entire issue, resolves all the outstanding
issues that have to be dealt with with respect to Libya and Pan Am
103," Powell said after a meeting with Yemeni Foreign Minister
Abubakr al Qerbi.</LD>
<TE>   "We are waiting to see what the actual Libyan offer is," Powell
said. "It's not yet formally put on the table. And we'll examine it
when we see all of its elements."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department earlier Wednesday called the offer of $10
million for each victim a "highly significant factor" in determining
whether Libya meets the demand for compensation, one of four
conditions imposed by the United Nations and the United States in
order to lift a variety of economic, travel, arms and other embargoes
against the regime of Moammar Kadafi.</TE>
<TE>   But by itself, the offer does not satisfy U.N. resolutions or U.S.
demands for full acknowledgment by Libya of its role in the terrorist
attack--the most important condition for many families as well as a
top priority for the U.S. government. The other two conditions are
disclosing information and renouncing terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing killed all 259 passengers and crew members on the jet
as well as 11 people on the ground. Investigators quickly linked
Libyans to the attack, and sanctions against Kadafi's government were
imposed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the North African nation handed over two Libyans who had
been indicted in the bombing by a Scottish court. They were tried in
the Netherlands, a neutral site agreed to by Libya. One defendant was
convicted last year; the other was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   "If the families work out a compensation agreement, that would be
a highly significant factor in our considering whether Libya in fact
was starting to meet some of these requirements of the U.N.
resolutions," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "But
we'll not be in a position to seriously address bilateral issues with
Libya until the U.N. requirements are met."</TE>
<TE>   The Libyan offer came under immediate attack from congressional
leaders, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a member of the
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. policy will be determined by changes in Libyan behavior, not
by conditions imposed by the Libyan government on compensation for
the families of Pan Am 103," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of compensation was thrown into a bit of disarray
Wednesday when a Libyan official was quoted as denying that any
formal offer had been made. Families of victims as well as U.S. and
British officials had been told that a deal was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "It is possible that businessmen or legal experts held talks with
the lawyers of the victims' families, but this was outside the Libyan
state, and I ... state that Libya, officially, was not a party to
these talks," Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgam told Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   A similar statement was distributed by the government-run Libyan
news agency Jana. But Associated Press later quoted Libyan officials
as confirming that a "preliminary" deal was in the works.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the law firm of Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, which
represents the families of 118 victims, insisted Wednesday that the
talks with Libya, which have taken place over the last 10 months, had
reached the general parameters of a settlement.</TE>

<HD>Unsolved Murders Never Die</HD>
<DH>Homicide detectives face growing numbers of unresolved
cases, due in part to a rise in killings by strangers. Lack of
closure takes a toll on cops, too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sheriff's squad room in Commerce, justice deferred takes the
form of office clutter.</LD>
<LD>   Crowding the desks are thick stacks of brown accordion
files--notes on open homicide cases, part of a growing trend of
unsolved murders.</LD>
<LD>   Each represents a life lost, a family bereaved, a killer gone
free.</LD>
<TE>   "They sit at your feet," said Sgt. Delores Scott, a Los Angeles
County sheriff's detective. "You are reminded of them on a daily
basis."</TE>
<TE>   With gang crime again on the rise in Los Angeles, many law
enforcement agencies have seen so-called "clearance" rates plunge
below the 50% mark in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Many factors may be driving the change, which is national in
scope. But criminologists say that it's often not the police who are
to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it may be the changing nature of violent crime. Fewer
domestic homicides and more gang killings mean murderers are less
likely to know their victims. That makes them harder to catch.</TE>
<TE>   The costs are felt in the denial of justice to victims and their
families. But also affected are the detectives, who, regardless of
their skills, are less and less likely to solve their cases.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, detectives talk of unsolved murders stacking up
over the course of a career. Even if you just have four unsolved
cases per year, "you're here 10 years, and that's 40 unsolved cases,"
said Capt. Frank Merriman, a veteran homicide detective for the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Such cases gnaw at the imagination, weigh on the conscience.</TE>
<TE>   And they quite literally hang over investigators' heads.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division,
the mere mention of unsolved murders prompts Det. Mike Coffey to
glance upward.</TE>
<TE>   Five unsolved gang slayings this year are listed in felt-tip pen
on a board over his desk. He likes to keep the names in plain view,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have two or three mothers who call every anniversary of the
death of their children," he said. "They ask if there's anything new,
and if there's anything else we can do."</TE>
<TE>   The experience of survivors reaching out is common to many
homicide detectives, who often form relationships with victims'
bereaved family members. "They just want a sounding board," said
Scott. "They want to know that you remember."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives say they develop defenses to deal with the emotional
strain. "But then," Purcell said, "there are those cases you just
can't get over."</TE>
<TE>   His voice trailed off, and he was silent for several seconds. Then
he talked of unsolved cases that stick, some of which his wife knows
as well as he does.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very powerful thing," he said. "You go to a scene, and
you are the one who is supposed to make it right. People look to you.
You have to make it right."</TE>
<TE>   Exhaustion can be the result of all those unsolved cases, said
Karen MacDonald, an LAPD psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald said she frequently sees detectives who come to discuss
a family problem, but never get around to talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   They can't get past their work. "Of course it's the first thing
out of their mouths," she said. "They talk about it all the
time--that unsolved case, the one that won't go away."</TE>
<TE>   Homicide detectives are not especially prone to burnout or
breakdowns, but they may become absorbed to the point of ill health.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know how tired they are getting," MacDonald said.
"I've seen detectives who have fainted.... Or just exhausted people
who fall asleep in their chair when they come in and talk to me."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. James Bower, a supervisor in LAPD's 77th Street station,
said he has to watch his homicide detectives closely--not because
they slack off, but because they won't. They will work themselves to
the point of no longer being effective if he lets them.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, some days they are all up here with these raccoon
eyes," he said. "I have to say, 'You guys are all outta here. Go
home!'"   Nationally, only about 63% of homicides result in an
arrest, compared to 69% in 1998, according the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Detectives consider a case cleared when a suspect has
been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In large urban areas such as Los Angeles, the rates are lower.
Although officials say things are improving, LAPD's homicide
clearance rate last year was about 50%, after hitting an all-time low
of 44% two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That's down considerably from 1997, when LAPD cleared 70% of
murders, and from 1970, when 79% were cleared.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, larger cities where gang crime is concentrated have
the lowest homicide clearance rates. In Chicago, for example, the
rate dipped from 57% in 1997 to 47% last year.</TE>
<TE>   The change reflects both the good and bad news about murder: On
one hand, husbands and wives no longer kill each other with the
frequency of years past.</TE>
<TE>   But drive-by shootings and other forms of "stranger murders"
remain a plague--and are less likely to result in arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have for evidence is a shell casing in the street,"
lamented Merriman. "And what you have for witnesses is people who are
afraid to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Purcell recalled perusing old files at the Sheriff's Department
library, and his shock at how many listed suspects on the covers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd pull 'em and think, my gosh, look at these, they were solving
all of them," Purcell said. "But then, so many were domestics, or
cases that involved a relationship. So there was some reason for the
murder."</TE>
<TE>   Now there may be no clear relationship between suspect and victim,
and the motive may be simply, "I live on that side of the street, you
live over there, so I hate you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gang-related violence in Southern California peaked in the early
1990s. In Los Angeles, 1992 was a pinnacle: 1,092 people were
killed--119 in August alone, according to the LAPD. In the late '90s,
murders in Los Angeles dropped to just above the 400 mark yearly.</TE>
<TE>   But violence began rising again two years ago, and last year, the
death toll in Los Angeles hit 587. The biggest increases have been in
the toughest murders to solve: gang-related walk-ups, bicycle
ride-ups and drive-bys.</TE>
<TE>   For investigators, one of the most frustrating aspects of such
cases is the lack of cooperative witnesses. Officers talk of arriving
at the scene of a drive-by shooting to find 100 people lingering--but
not one who will talk.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon has led to a grim joke among detectives. Question:
What's the difference between the cops and everyone else standing
around at a murder scene? Answer: The cops are the only ones who
don't know who did it.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in clearance rates is also considered an unintended
consequence of the movement to reform anti-gang units.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in response to the discovery of a cell of violent
and corrupt officers in the Rampart area station, the LAPD
restructured its old gang units, called CRASH, replacing them with
so-called Special Enforcement Units, or SEUs, which operate under
tighter supervision.</TE>
<TE>   The cost was a loss of institutional knowledge about gangs. CRASH
officers and homicide detectives had worked closely together, and
"CRASH officers had been responsible for solving a vast number of
homicide investigations," said Det. Clay Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   Also blamed are the mass retirements of a post-Vietnam War
generation of seasoned detectives.</TE>
<TE>   As with any craft, detectives with the most time on the job tend
to be the best. LAPD has lost 177 of its highest-ranking detectives
to retirement since 1997. Their youthful replacements have yet to
catch up, said Cmdr. Gary Brennan, a department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Among the retirees is J.D. Furr, a 36-year veteran of the force.</TE>
<TE>   Furr is all but legendary on the LAPD, described by
Robbery-Homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau as, "a big, slow-talking guy with
a Southern drawl--a cowboy who has never seen anything that has
surprised him, and who has seen it all."</TE>
<TE>   Furr doesn't know exactly what makes experienced detectives
better.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it took him years to learn to read a crime scene at a
glance, and "to not throw too wide a loop, not look for something
that's not there."</TE>
<TE>   Such intangible losses are being felt in other departments as
well, as they encounter similar age shifts in their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Police Department, for example, has gone from the
nation's fifth-oldest department to the fifth-youngest in the last
decade, said Chicago Police Sgt. Robert Cargie.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, detectives in many departments fret that tight
budgets and high caseloads make it hard to give each murder its due.</TE>
<TE>   Under the best of circumstances, many urban homicide detectives
work grueling hours. The physical strain of their work is exacerbated
by its emotional toll. Burnout increases turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Some agencies have begun seeking ways to improve.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD plans to hire a consultant to evaluate its detective
operations. Like other departments, the LAPD has also started
cold-case units, focusing on unsolved crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But Tatreau said radical breakthroughs are unlikely. "Detective
craft is not a mystery. We just have to give them time and resources
to do their job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, the county investigator, recently returned to the detective
ranks after serving in another post for a year.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had she moved in than a stack of familiar files turned
up on her desk. It was all her old unsolved cases. They had been
shifted to other detectives, and, still unsolved, were now being
reassigned back to her.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was not surprised to see them.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was she surprised at how clearly she remembered each one--she
could still see the crime scenes in her head.</TE>
<TE>   Unsolved cases are just like that, she said: "They follow you."</TE>

<HD>Daily News Becomes a Herald of Secession</HD>
<DH>Media: The paper takes a strong voice in Valley breakup,
which could help it financially.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First of two parts.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn says it would be "a disaster of biblical
proportions" and "the greatest change in urban architecture in the
history of the United States." Other local political and civic
leaders call it the most important question the city of Los Angeles
has ever faced.</LD>
<LD>   But the proposed secession of the San Fernando Valley, which would
split up the nation's second-largest city, attracted relatively
little attention from most of the local news media until very
recently. The national news media have virtually ignored it.</LD>
<TE>   Why? Secession isn't sexy or sensational. It hasn't provided great
pictures or charismatic leaders. Although it's been bruited about for
decades, secession has long seemed unlikely to all but its hardiest
supporters. Even in the Valley, it hasn't generated the big rallies
that accompanied the anti-busing and Proposition 13 movements.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a divorce with accountants--dueling revenue neutrality
arguments--and it's hard to cover that kind of story in eight-second
sound bites," says Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a
member of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which voted this
month to put secession on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But one news organization has given secession heavy, prominent
coverage for years--the Daily News, a 177,000-circulation newspaper
headquartered in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News, founded as the Van Nuys Call in 1911, became the
Valley News and Green Sheet in 1953 and was a free community shopper
for much of its existence. It began daily publication in 1979,
changed its name to the Daily News in 1981 and converted to fully
paid circulation a year later. Whatever its name or format, though,
its primary focus has always been the Valley, so it's not surprising
that it took the Valley secession movement seriously at a time when
other local media--and local political leaders--either ignored it or
ridiculed it.</TE>
<TE>   The media's benign neglect of secession is beginning to change,
thanks to LAFCO's vote and recent polls showing strong support for
secession in the Valley and throughout the city. In April, after
LAFCO ruled that a Valley city would be financially viable, the New
York Times put secession on its front page. National Public Radio and
local television stations have invited guests to discuss secession.
The Los Angeles Times--widely criticized by secession supporters and
opponents alike for having been insufficiently attentive to the story
for many years--organized a five-reporter team this month to cover
secession full time.</TE>
<TE>   But the Daily News has long been "more thorough, more complete,
more attentive to the story than The Times has," says City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, an outspoken opponent of secession.</TE>
<TE>   The paper is widely perceived, even by its critics, as having
provided the best, most aggressive and comprehensive coverage of
secession. It is also seen, however, as having pursued a
pro-secession agenda in its news columns as well as on its editorial
pages, and as having a potential financial stake in the outcome of
the secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   Even when secession has been relatively quiescent, the Daily News
has given it big play, and since Jan. 1, 2001, the paper has had 80
Valley secession stories on its front page; The Times has had
nine--six of them in the last six weeks. Daily News secession stories
have carried headlines with highly charged words: "Hahn ploy foiled,"
"L.A. can't gouge Valley," "Let the nasty political games begin" and
"LAFCO laughs at L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News has also kept up a steady drumbeat of Page 1
headlines blasting various Los Angeles city, county and school
agencies: "Another LAUSD mess," "Elevators fail, council rails at
City Hall," "DWP slush funds probed," "Building boondoggle" and
"Abused kids ignored."</TE>
<TE>   The implicit message of these attacks on City Hall and other
government agencies is, "This is why we should secede," says Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and
Development at USC. "They seem to view everything through the prism
of secession."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News has long been a muckraking newspaper, though, and
it has exposed government inefficiency and corruption even at times
when secession was not an active issue. The paper takes a
quasi-tabloid approach to much of the news--secession included--and
its headlines tend to be bigger and livelier than those of The Times
on a wide range of subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of bringing an energy and an urgency to this
newspaper that I found lacking here when I arrived," says David J.
Butler, editor of the Daily News since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Former Reporters Criticize Newspaper</TE>
<TE>   But on secession, the paper has many critics, among them a number
of former Daily News reporters and editors.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Katches, a reporter at the paper from 1992 to 1996 and now an
investigative editor at the Orange County Register, says the Daily
News "stirred things up and did good, enterprising watchdog
journalism," but about the time he left, the paper had "crossed over
the line." Secession went from "being a story to a cause to a
crusade. It became personal--us versus them, the Valley versus Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   When the Los Angeles City Council approved a massive downtown
redevelopment plan early this month, the Daily News headlines on
three consecutive days were: "Tax grab for L.A. projects," "Downtown
project may 'starve' city," and "$1.7 Billion tax drain."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News clearly sees itself as the voice of the people--in
particular, the people who live in the Valley, which its executives
regard as a disenfranchised, disrespected part of the city.
Editorially, the Daily News shares the views of secession supporters
that Valley residents have long paid far more in taxes than they've
received in city services and that City Hall in downtown Los Angeles
has long been too remote and too unresponsive to Valley needs.</TE>
<TE>   But the Daily News has another incentive to support secession.</TE>
<TE>   If secession is approved, the paper could try to position itself
as the newspaper of record for the new city--the sixth-largest city
in the country--and it could reap significant financial benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "The Daily News obviously has a very strong financial interest in
creating a new city in which they would become THE newspaper," says
David Fleming, chairman of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando
Valley and a leader of the City Charter reform movement. "The value
of that franchise goes up considerably if the Valley is a separate
city."</TE>
<TE>   Daily News circulation has dropped 16.5% from its 1993 high,
according to figures the paper has given the Audit Bureau of
Circulation. Larry Beasley, an executive with the St. Petersburg,
Fla., Times, says that when he was publisher of the Daily News from
1994 to 1998, "we felt strongly that our circulation base would
rapidly increase" if the Valley seceded. "We thought we could profit
in terms of circulation, which would translate into more
advertising."</TE>
<TE>   William Dean Singleton, president and chief executive of Media
NewsGroup, which owns the Daily News, says the impact on national
advertising revenue in particular would be positive, and several
media advertising analysts agree that the national identity of the
paper would improve if it were serving a large, independent city.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives of the Daily News say possible financial gain has
played no role in their news or editorial coverage of secession.
Indeed, they insist that so far, the paper has editorially endorsed
only the right of the people to vote on secession and has not yet
decided whether to support secession. They also deny that the paper
has been biased in its news coverage of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to be fair and balanced while being aggressive and
assertive," Butler says.</TE>
<TE>   But the Daily News leadership feels so deeply about what its
editors call "the right of self-determination" for people in the
Valley that in 1998, under a previous publisher, Ike Massey, the
paper gave $60,000 to Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment
(Valley VOTE), the organization that led the campaign to put
secession on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution amounted to almost one-third of the
organization's funding at that time, and many Daily News staffers
objected, saying it would damage the paper's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   One editor compared the news of the contribution to discovering
that her spouse had cheated on her.</TE>
<TE>   Butler says that though he would have recommended against the
contribution had Massey asked him--"which he didn't"--he understood
Massey's reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   City airport officials had prohibited Valley VOTE volunteers from
circulating petitions at the Van Nuys air show when they were trying
to gather the signatures required to authorize a study of the
financial viability of a new city, a prerequisite to any citywide
vote. The city gave Valley VOTE $50,000 in compensation, and the
Daily News contribution, Butler says, was also intended to help
Valley VOTE compensate for that interference by enabling it to hire
more people to circulate the petitions before an impending deadline.
(The petitioners wound up with more than enough signatures--202,000
of them.)</TE>
<TE>   But giving voters the right to decide the issue is the beginning
of the process, not the end, Butler says.</TE>
<TE>   "We have maintained diligently our position that there was a
process that needed to be followed and that as that process
developed, we would make a decision ... whether this paper endorses
secession or not," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Daily News editorials have not said, in so many words, that the
paper favors secession. But secession supporters and opponents alike
agree that any reasonable reading of those editorials leads to that
inevitable conclusion, and Singleton says flatly that the Daily News
editorial page is "adamantly in favor" of secession.</TE>
<TE>   Even past and present secession supporters say the paper's
editorial page support influences its news coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "They're more like cheerleaders than objective news reporters,"
says Bob Scott, a Los Angeles planning commissioner who also serves
on the executive board of Valley VOTE. "That's fine for the editorial
page but not for the front page."</TE>
<TE>   Fleming says, "There's no question the Daily News coverage has
been biased."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Calemine, a leader in an earlier Valley secession drive and
now executive officer of LAFCO, says the Daily News is "completely in
favor" of secession and has "slanted" its coverage accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, Fleming and Calemine are certainly not unhappy with Daily
News secession coverage, and they are even more critical of The
Times, saying its coverage has been biased against secession. Many
secession proponents agree.</TE>
<TE>   Times editors and reporters say they've covered secession fairly,
but at both papers, the strident--at times harsh--language of their
editorials has helped color the perceptions of their critics. Over
the years, Daily News editorials have used such words as "lunacy"
"absurd," "pathetic," "ripped off," "phony," "tyranny" and
"oppression" in discussing the issues and players involved in
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The Times--which had a separate editorial page in its Valley
edition until last year--used such words and phrases as "ludicrous,"
preposterous," "whine," "destructive crusade," "army of mercenaries"
and "zealots pursuing this folly" in Valley Edition editorials on
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Editors at both papers defend their language as precisely the sort
of forceful, persuasive prose that editorials should have. But given
the tone of many editorials on the subject, "I can understand why
people have trouble seeing through that to the news coverage," says
Jim Newton, deputy metropolitan editor for government and politics at
The Times. "We in the news business don't realize that people outside
the business may not see the separation that we know exists. They
think we're more monolithic than we really are, and I'm sure that
affects people's views of the news coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Daily New has a "very strong pro-secession message"
and The Times has a "very strong anti-secession message" in their
respective editorials, "both papers are perceived by many as being
partisans in the debate," says Ken Bernstein, director of
preservation issues for the Los Angeles Conservancy and chairman of
the Civic Forum, an organization devoted to providing "balanced
substantive information on secession issues."</TE>
<TE>   The potential for "a blurring of the lines between the advocacy of
the editorial page and what should have been the objective coverage
of the news pages" has been an especially serious problem at the
Daily News, says Mark Barnhill, a reporter and editor at the paper
from 1986 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   At most newspapers, the editor of the editorial pages reports to
the editor or publisher of the paper, but at the Daily News, there is
no editorial page editor. Ron Kaye, the managing editor, has direct
supervision of the editorial pages and the news pages.</TE>
<TE>   Butler says that he supervises Kaye, edits all the editorials and
writes many of the Page 1 headlines. "Everyone knows that Ron Kaye is
not going to do one ... thing that Dave Butler doesn't approve of,"
Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   But Butler has been at the paper just five years. Kaye has been
there for 17 years, having worked previously at the Herald Examiner,
Associated Press and the National Enquirer. Though Butler is clearly
the boss, Kaye is widely regarded as the driving force behind the
paper's secession coverage, on the news pages and the editorial
pages.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be no secession movement if there were no Ron Kaye,"
says Doug Dowie, who was business editor, then managing editor, when
he worked at the Daily News from 1985 to 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Lacter, an editor at the Daily News from 1986 to 1996 and now
editor of the Los Angeles Business Journal, says Kaye "has lots of
opinions and at some point in the process, those opinions are played
out on the front page.... A disinterested observer would have a tough
time making the case that the Daily News has done a fair and
straightforward job of covering the secession issue."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters and editors who have worked with and for Kaye praise his
intelligence, imagination, aggressiveness and leadership. They say he
is an excellent editor, extraordinarily adept at finding holes in a
story, sharpening its focus and giving it an attention-getting bite.</TE>
<TE>   They also say that neither he nor Butler nor any of their
subordinates has ever explicitly told them to write stories that
favored secession or downplayed anti-secession arguments.</TE>
<TE>   But they say Kaye cares so passionately about secession--and is so
hostile toward the downtown Los Angeles power structure--that his
views have long filtered through to the staff. At times, they say,
the beginnings of their stories have been changed and/or headlines
have been put on their stories that they thought went beyond what
they had written.</TE>
<TE>   Charges of Crossing</TE>
<TE>   Over the Line</TE>
<TE>   "He violates the fine line between giving a story an edge, an
angle, and editorializing--crossing over the line to put opinion in
it," says John Corrigan, a Times editor who worked at the Daily News
from 1981 to 1996 as a reporter, editorial writer and editor.</TE>
<TE>   Most critics of the Daily News, including the most ardent
opponents of secession, praise the paper's reporters, especially
Harrison Sheppard, who covers secession full time.</TE>
<TE>   Their stories, they say, are generally fair and comprehensive.
Sheppard is widely seen, even by secession opponents, as having
provided more intelligent and comprehensive coverage of the issue
than any other reporter.</TE>
<TE>   But the headlines and placement for his and others' stories--on
secession as well as other issues--are often sensationalized and
slanted, they contend, and several say that Sheppard and other Daily
News reporters have sometimes complained that the first few
paragraphs of their stories have been "juiced up" to make them more
critical of the downtown power structure or to favor pro-secession
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Sheppard declined to be interviewed for this story or to comment
on those allegations, but Beth Barrett, a 16-year Daily News veteran
and acknowledged "Ron Kaye fan," calls Kaye "a genius, a fabulous
editor ... the most intellectually honest editor I know.... He only
tweaks stories to make them better."</TE>
<TE>   Barrett says she's never heard Kaye say he supports secession,
"and I wouldn't put my money on how he'd vote at the ballot box....
He just loves a good story and he sees this as a good story, so he
latched onto it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Katches--the former Daily News reporter now at the Orange
County Register--said he decided to quit in 1996, after an editor
rewrote the first paragraph of one of his stories to reflect Kaye's
view of, and preoccupation with, secession.</TE>
<TE>   Katches says his story, a straightforward account of partisan
political wrangling threatening the legislation that ultimately
eliminated the city's power to veto secession, was rewritten so that
it began, "Rejecting the right of San Fernando Valley residents to
decide their own political future...."</TE>
<TE>   That day's story actually "had nothing to do with Valley rights,"
Katches says. "It was politics. The editor injected tone into my
story and distorted what the real story was that day." Katches says
this was part of a pattern that included a Daily News policy that the
legislation not be called a "secession" or "city reorganization" bill
but a "right to self-determination" bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the last straw," he says. "I was furious. I went home that
night, started tuning my resume and in two months, I was gone."</TE>
<TE>   Butler said he and Kaye would not discuss criticisms of any
specific stories or headlines, but they denied distorting or slanting
any coverage. Kaye says the paper's only "crusade" has been "to let
people control their political destiny," and he says that was the
focal point throughout on the 1996 legislative battle.</TE>
<TE>   He says he can't recall any reporter "coming up and saying 'I'm
going to quit' over his editing. Nor, he says, has any reporter "ever
asked to have his byline taken off" a story because of his editing.</TE>
<TE>   But other former Daily News reporters recounted similar
experiences with their stories, and several say they left the paper
about that time for similar reasons.</TE>
<TE>   They said the Daily News was a more editor-driven paper than any
other they had worked for or known about--and, on secession, Kaye was
(and, under Butler's supervision, remains) the editor who does the
driving.</TE>

<HD>Bush Curbs Oil Drilling in Florida Coast Tract</HD>
<DH>Energy: The government will pay $235 million to cancel
unused oil and gas leases, White House says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and EDWIN CHEN</AU>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush, whose administration has emphasized
increasing domestic energy production, moved Wednesday to prevent oil
and gas drilling in a large tract off the Florida coast and in parts
of the Everglades.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government will pay $115 million to oil companies to
drop their fight to drill about 30 miles off the Florida Panhandle.
The companies bought drilling rights in the 1980s but faced obstacles
put up by Republican and Democratic state officials who objected that
drilling could wreak havoc on the white-sand beaches in the Panhandle
and on the state's vital tourism industry.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government will spend an additional $120 million to
buy oil and gas drilling rights held by private individuals in three
sensitive areas of the Everglades.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's decision to preserve what he termed "some of our nation's
most beautiful natural treasures" should bolster his environmental
credentials in Florida, as well as help his brother Jeb, who is
seeking reelection there as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush, who visited the White House on Wednesday, conceded that
he stands to benefit from his brother's move. "But more importantly,"
he added, "it is good public policy, and when there's a convergence
of good politics and good public policy, I don't think we should be
ashamed about it."</TE>
<TE>   The White House denied that politics played a role in the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   The president's action also triggered calls from California
officials for his administration to take similar steps to end a fight
over undeveloped offshore oil and gas leases off the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "What's good for Florida certainly is good for California," said
Steve Maviglio, Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time that Bush, a former West Texas oil man who
has pushed for oil and gas exploration in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, has scaled back potential drilling off the Florida
coast. In July, the administration reduced by 75% the size of a new
offshore tract in another part of the Gulf of Mexico in response to
objections from Gov. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's decision drew rare praise for the president from
environmentalists, and criticism from his usual allies in the energy
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction also underscored the difficulty the administration
and Congress have experienced in developing a national energy policy
in the wake of California's power crisis last year.</TE>
<TE>   "National energy supply has certainly been handed a setback
today," said R. Skip Horvath, president of the Natural Gas Supply
Assn. He noted that the now-abandoned offshore drilling tract in
Florida potentially contained large natural gas reserves--as much as
2.6 trillion cubic feet. The nation consumes almost 22 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas annually.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot continue to chisel away at America's own resources and
expect to continue to be self-sufficient in filling future demand,"
Horvath said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who has supported the president's
efforts to open the Arctic refuge to drilling, said: "Once again
politics is deciding energy policy.... Surely the administration that
supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should find
a way to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have been successfully
drilling for the past 60 years."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ferrulo, director of the Florida Public Interest Research
Group, a pro-environment group based in Tallahassee, called the White
House announcement "one of the most significant victories in the
20-year battle to keep Florida's coast rig-free."</TE>
<TE>   But some environmentalists were skeptical of the administration's
motives.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the total cost of the decision, Phil Clapp, president
of the National Environmental Trust, called it a "$235-million
campaign contribution to the Reelect Jeb Bush Committee, courtesy of
U.S. taxpayers. It's a great move for Florida, and clearly any state
that wants to protect its environment ought to follow suit and elect
a Bush."</TE>
<TE>   The president's aides sought to downplay the impact of the
decision on energy supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said the deal resolves a
"long-standing stalemate" between the oil companies and Florida
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The money paid to the companies under the settlement can be used
to make investments elsewhere to help meet the nation's energy
needs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Everglades land is estimated to contain only about 40 million
barrels of oil, a two-day supply for the nation, Norton said--far
less than what is thought to exist in the Arctic refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional approval is not required for the administration to
buy back the Gulf leases from Chevron, Conoco and Murphy Oil in the
area known as Destin Dome. But Congress will need to approve the
purchase of the drilling rights in three sensitive areas of the
Everglades ecosystem--the Big Cypress National Preserve, the Florida
Panther National Wildlife Refuge and the Ten Thousand Islands
National Wildlife Refuge. All are in southwestern Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress were already talking about additional
actions they plan to seek from the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Bush saying his
announcement is welcome news for Floridians, but it "ignores the
fight that Californians have been waging since a devastating oil
spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969."</TE>
<TE>   Although state and federal moratoriums prohibit new offshore oil
leases in California, those bans do not apply to 36 undeveloped
leases issued from 1968 to 1984. They lie more than three miles off
the coasts of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians do not want these leases developed, and the oil
companies that hold the leases want out of a protracted legal
battle," Boxer wrote Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Oil companies holding the undeveloped California leases have filed
a breach of contract lawsuit against the federal government because
of procedural hurdles that have prevented drilling from proceeding.
It was a similar lawsuit that led to settling the drilling dispute
off the Florida coast.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has yet to take a position on whether the
government should buy back the California leases.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, deputy press secretary Scott McClellan
insisted there is no inconsistency in the president's policies toward
the leases in Florida and California.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes it's important to consult with local and
state communities to address local concerns, whether in Florida or in
California," McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional sources said that the purchase of the California
leases could be far costlier--in excess of $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While the president's actions Wednesday clearly could enhance his
own reelection chances in Florida--which determined the outcome of
the 2000 race--the chief short-term beneficiary is likely to be his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Jeb Bush said that, while some might believe that politics were a
consideration in the decision, "I don't really care."</TE>
<TE>   The governor insisted it is not hypocritical to support energy
exploration in Alaska while opposing such action in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The president has labored to get an energy bill out of Congress
that would allow drilling in the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   While the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would
authorize Arctic drilling, the Senate, controlled by Democrats,
approved legislation that did not and instead was geared more toward
promoting conservation.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, one year after the president unveiled his national
energy policy, energy legislation remains in doubt.</TE>

<HD>Terrorist Signs Were Missed, FBI Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: As more 'red flags' come to light, Mueller
disagrees with Bush team's assertions that nothing could have
prevented attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III acknowledged Wednesday that in the
weeks before Sept. 11 the bureau missed "red flags" in Minnesota and
Arizona that could have led investigators to the terrorist hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller's sobering concession was at odds with the Bush
administration's previous assertions that authorities could not have
done anything to disrupt the attacks. And it came even as the FBI
disclosed that it had unearthed two additional memos indicating that
authorities may have missed terrorist warning signs.</LD>
<LD>   In a 1998 memo, an FBI pilot in Oklahoma City reported to his
supervisor that he was suspicious about the "large numbers" of Middle
Eastern men receiving flight training at area airports. The pilot
said the "recent phenomenon" could be related to "planned terrorist
activity." The supervisor who received the memo did not report the
suspicions to Washington at the time, and the matter was never
investigated, a senior FBI official said.</LD>
<TE>   In a second memo, intelligence officials reported that a Middle
Eastern nation had tried to buy a flight simulator in violation of
U.S. restrictions. FBI officials on Wednesday did not divulge the
date of that memo or the country that tried to buy the simulator.
They did say that both documents had been forwarded to members of
Congress who are examining why the U.S. intelligence community failed
to detect the Sept. 11 attacks in advance and whether warnings were
missed.</TE>
<TE>   Although FBI officials downplayed the significance of the two new
memos, they appear to fit a pattern of what Mueller described as
missed opportunities and lax counter-terrorism analysis.
Acknowledging that "we must change," he unveiled an FBI
reorganization plan that he said was aimed at developing a more
aggressive, proactive approach to pursuing terrorism leads and
preventing future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not a specific warning [before Sept. 11] about an
attack on a particular day. But that doesn't mean that there weren't
red flags out there, there weren't dots that should have been
connected to the extent possible," a contrite and sometimes defensive
Mueller told reporters in an extraordinary two-hour briefing. He
acknowledged that he himself had unwittingly misspoken last fall in
denying the existence of pre-Sept. 11 warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury's still out" on whether the FBI could have done anything
to detect what was going to happen on Sept. 11, he said. Had the
bureau done a better job of following up on leads around the country,
he said, "I can't say for sure that there wasn't a possibility that
we would come across some lead that would have led us to the
hijackers."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has come under blistering attack in the last several weeks
following disclosures that bureau officials in Washington failed to
act last summer either on a warning from an agent in Phoenix about
suspicious Middle Eastern flight students or on efforts by agents in
Minneapolis to get a search warrant for the computer and personal
belongings of flight student Zacarias Moussaoui, who was being held
on immigration violations.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Mueller last week that has stoked the flames,
Coleen Rowley, the general counsel for the FBI in Minneapolis, said
officials at headquarters had set up a "roadblock" that prevented her
office from pursuing suspicions that Moussaoui was a terrorist.
Moussaoui, who authorities now think was planning to be the "20th
hijacker," was charged after the attacks with conspiracy and faces
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In his briefing Wednesday, Mueller thanked Rowley repeatedly for
her critique and said her letter "points squarely to a need for a
different approach" toward counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, a longtime prosecutor who took over the FBI a week before
the attacks, continued to insist that no single episode in Minnesota,
Arizona or anywhere else could by itself have led investigators to
the Sept. 11 plot. But, he said, "putting all the pieces together
over a period of time, who is to say?"</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix and Minneapolis investigations were both routed
through the same FBI office in Washington--the Radical
Fundamentalists Unit--but authorities say the unit chief never saw
the Phoenix flight-training memo before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix memo, recommending that the FBI canvass flight schools
around the country to search for suspicious Middle Eastern students,
was remarkably similar to the Oklahoma memo disclosed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   That memo, dated May 18, 1998, was titled "Weapons of Mass
Destruction." In it, an FBI pilot in Oklahoma City warned that he had
"observed large numbers of Middle Eastern males receiving flight
training at Oklahoma airports in recent months."</TE>
<TE>   The agent, described in the memo as being the chief FBI pilot in
the Oklahoma City Division, "states that this is a recent phenomenon
and may be related to planned terrorist activity," said the document,
which was released by the FBI late Wednesday after Mueller referred
to it in comments to reporters. Before releasing the memo, the bureau
removed all names, including that of the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The agent, the memo added, "speculates that light planes would be
an ideal means of spreading chemical or biological agents."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the title's reference to mass destruction, the memo was
stamped "routine," and FBI spokesman John Collingwood said it was
never sent to Washington for analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui attended the Airman Flight School in Norman, about 20
miles from Oklahoma City, early last year but left after having
trouble obtaining a private pilot's license. In August, he traveled
to Minnesota, where he aroused suspicion at another flight school
when trying to pay cash.</TE>
<TE>   The Norman school has trained an average of 600 pilots, many of
them foreigners, each year since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official who asked not to be identified said
the Oklahoma memo was "very troubling" and raised new questions about
what the FBI knew before Sept. 11 and what it did with that
information. "It goes back to the cultural issue; their mantra was
solving crimes that had occurred, not preventing terrorism," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller hinted that still more missed warning signs are likely to
surface as the FBI continues turning over hundreds of thousands of
pages of documents to Congress. And he said the FBI's failure to
piece together the events in Phoenix and Minneapolis--as well as the
warning in Oklahoma three years earlier and another one in the
Philippines in 1995 concerning the threat of hijackings--reflected
inadequate attention to the analysis of terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   "Our analytical capability is not where it should be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the Phoenix warning, he said, "We should have had
mechanisms in place so something like that goes up to the top." That
warning should have been linked by officials in Washington to the
Minnesota concerns that also involved flight schools, he added.</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, "we should have been more aggressive I think here
[in Washington] in supporting [the Minneapolis field agents], and in
the future I think we will be."</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization plan announced Wednesday by Mueller and Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft would deploy a permanent staff of more than 3,700
federal, state and local law-enforcement agents, most of them from
the FBI, to work on counter-terrorism--an increase of about 70% from
pre-Sept. 11 levels.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would also create a new Office of Intelligence to be
headed by a CIA analyst, and it would centralize more authority in
Washington for counter-terrorism oversight. At the same time, it
would give field offices more flexibility and power to initiate
investigations and "remove bureaucratic barriers," Mueller said.
Ashcroft is expected to detail new procedures today for loosening the
reins on field offices.</TE>
<TE>   The shift at the FBI toward an intelligence-gathering agency in
which prevention of terrorist attacks is the top priority will come
at the expense of other traditional crime-solving functions of the
FBI, officials conceded.</TE>
<TE>   The war on drugs could be the biggest casualty, with 400 agents
out of a staff of 2,500 expected to be reassigned to
counter-terrorism and related fields. White-collar crime and violent
crime will each lose 59 agents, making a total of 518 agents
redeployed to the war on terrorism, Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress who are pushing for greater reforms at
the FBI said Wednesday that they do not believe Mueller's plan goes
far enough in changing a complacent mind-set at the bureau, but the
director's acknowledgment that "red flags" were missed is likely to
win a favorable response with Capitol Hill critics.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like he's coming clean," said one congressional aide.
"It seems as if the Rowley letter has forced him to change his tune."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller told reporters that he bears responsibility for putting
out erroneous information shortly after Sept. 11 in saying that the
FBI had no warnings about a possible attack or about suspicions
surrounding flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Those comments incensed Rowley, prompting her to fire off her
letter to Mueller, in which she accused him of skewing the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said he had not seen the Phoenix memo in September when he
denied any previous warnings about flight schools, but he says he now
realizes that he was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Have I made mistakes? Yes," he said. But despite Rowley's charge,
Mueller said he never intended to "skew the facts."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Gives Green Some Protection</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With two out in the first inning Wednesday, right fielder Shawn Green
walked on four pitches. With one out in the fourth, Green walked on
four pitches. With one out in the sixth, Green walked on four
pitches.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't take a Gallup Poll to detect a trend here.</LD>
<LD>   The Brewers wanted no part of Green, who shredded Milwaukee for
seven home runs, 11 hits, 11 runs batted in and nine runs in five
previous games, and the Brewers were determined not to let Green beat
them Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   So Brian Jordan did. Batting cleanup because catcher Paul Lo Duca
was given the day off, Jordan followed Green's second walk with a
two-run homer to left field, his ninth homer of the season but first
in Dodger Stadium since April 20. That turned a 1-0 deficit into a
2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's a slap in the face," Jordan said of the Brewers'
decision to pitch around Green so they could get to him. "I take it
as a challenge. You like to come through in those situations."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also doubled after Green's sixth-inning walk, and the
Dodgers loaded the bases on Eric Karros' walk, but Adrian Beltre
bounced into an inning-ending double play. Jordan's sore left knee
began to act up after his double, and he was replaced by Marquis
Grissom.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had trouble adjusting to his new surroundings after his
trade from Atlanta in January and was batting .167 (nine for 54) at
home going into the Brewer series.</TE>
<TE>   But he has six hits in his last 11 at-bats in Dodger Stadium and
is batting .438 (14 for 32) with three doubles, a triple, three
homers and 11 RBIs in his last nine games, raising his average from
.256 to .291.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca is batting .315 with 22 RBIs, and Karros, the No. 5
batter, is hitting .311 with 21 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "It appeared they didn't want to pitch to Green, and we may see
more of that," Manager Jim Tracy said. "If that's the case, we're
going to need more step-up performances from guys like Jordan, Lo
Duca and Karros."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts turned in the key defensive play
Wednesday, racing far into the right-center field gap to catch Eric
Young's drive with runners on first and second to end the seventh
inning.... Reliever Jesse Orosco, sidelined since May 14 because of a
strained ribcage muscle,  was activated from the 15-day disabled list
Wednesday. To make room on the roster, the Dodgers designated
knuckleballer Dennis Springer for assignment. If Springer clears
waivers, he will report to triple-A Las Vegas this weekend. The
Dodgers decided to keep reliever Bryan Corey, who was recalled from
Las Vegas on Monday, because Tracy believes the right-hander can
provide the kind of long relief Springer provides, while also
pitching short relief.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: A protester holds a board displaying the various
bills of Argentina's currency during a demonstration near the
National Congress in Buenos Aires, the capital. The country's
4-year-old recession has driven the unemployment rate up to 20%.
Economists announced that real wages had hit a 50-year low. Other

<HD>2 Attacks Target Jews in Russia</HD>
<DH>Europe: Incidents come just days after Bush praises nation
for its religious tolerance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Just days after President Bush praised Russia for religious
tolerance, two anti- Semitic attacks have sent shock waves through
the country's Jewish community.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, a hand-lettered sign containing a hateful message
toward Jews was erected along a highway about 20 miles outside
Moscow. It exploded when a driver stopped her car and attempted to
tear the sign down.</LD>
<LD>   Tatyana Sapunova, 28, who is not Jewish, was severely injured in
the face by fragments from the booby trap, which police said had the
explosive force of several ounces of dynamite.</LD>
<TE>   Then on Tuesday, the 16-year-old son of a rabbi was jumped at 8
a.m. near the center of Moscow by two skinheads shouting anti-Jewish
epithets. They struck him and broke his nose in two places.</TE>
<TE>   The young man, who was headed to a synagogue, frightened off the
attackers when he reached into his backpack to look for something
with which to defend himself. The victim, Yakov Vershubsky, is a U.S.
citizen and the son of a rabbi in Voronezh, a city 300 miles south of
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks follow a speech by Bush on Sunday at the Choral
Synagogue in St. Petersburg in which he congratulated Russians for
shedding much of the legacy of anti-Semitism from the czarist and
Soviet eras.</TE>
<TE>   In the same speech, and earlier at a meeting Friday with civil and
religious leaders in Moscow, Bush spelled out the U.S. view that
religious and ethnic tolerance is essential to Russia's progress.</TE>
<TE>   Hate crimes by nationalist skinheads have grown frequent in Russia
in part because of the lax response of police, according to Jewish
groups and representatives of other minorities, such as African and
Asian students.</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on non-Russians, especially Africans, have become so
intense that the diplomatic corps last month made a rare joint
complaint to the Russian Foreign Ministry demanding protection of
foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   An official familiar with the Vershubsky case said the youth
immediately went to two police stations to report the attack. He was
turned away both times by police who told him that it would be
impossible to find the assailants.</TE>
<TE>   One day after the attack, Interior Ministry spokeswoman Yelena
Perfilova said on state-controlled RTR television that it was
"premature" to call the incident anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League said anti-Semitic
violence is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent months, there has been an increase in anti-Semitic
incidents, including physical attacks on Jews, the defacement of
synagogues with swastikas and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries,"
Alexander Axelrod, director of the Moscow office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. "Unfortunately, the
failure to take these incidents seriously has led to an environment
where such attacks are more acceptable in Russian society."</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has spoken out clearly against
hate crimes but that a draft law to toughen legislation has stalled
in the Duma, the lower house of parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "The statements have been very strong and very positive and
encouraging," the diplomat said. "The question is, can they be
implemented?"</TE>

<LD>   Iraq and the United Nations extended the "oil-for-food"
program--allowing the nation to sell oil to buy humanitarian
supplies--for six months, despite a new overhaul of sanctions, U.N.
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq had accepted the new regulations, which aim to streamline
delivery of civilian goods to Iraq but also require U.N. reviews of a
300-page list of supplies that could have military uses.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the new memorandum is based on a 1996 program setting
up the food plan, an exception to the sanctions imposed after the
1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>

including Los Angeles-based Anschutz Entertainment Group for
development as a 20,000-seat sports and entertainment complex under a

<TE>   Meridian Delta Ltd., which consists of AEG--manager of Staples
Center in Los Angeles--and two partner companies, is to take over the
dome and a surrounding, 190-acre site on the Thames River, a British

spectacular waste of money when it did not draw expected crowds.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Recovers Hijacked Cyanide</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Authorities on Wednesday recovered most of nearly 10 tons of highly
toxic sodium cyanide that had been hijacked from a truck in central
Mexico nearly three weeks ago, easing security concerns in Mexico and
the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The truck was stolen with the cyanide in 96 drums on May 10 in
Hidalgo state. Authorities found the abandoned vehicle and 20 of the
drums about a week later along a highway in Zacatlan, about 120 miles
southeast of Mexico City in the state of Puebla.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the remaining drums were found Wednesday dumped in a ditch
in a small town in Puebla, about 50 miles northeast of where the
truck was stolen. The Mexican defense department said 70 drums had
been found. But a spokesman for the Puebla state government said the
number was 60.</LD>
<TE>   The theft of the sodium cyanide had caused concern in Mexico City
and Washington about a possible terrorism link. The chemical is used
legally in silver mining in Mexico and is a key element in
gas-chamber executions in the United States. The theft raised alarm
because several men with suspected ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist
network were arrested this year in Rome: They were carrying a
cyanide-based substance and maps showing the U.S. Embassy and the
city's water supply system.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the search would continue for the drums that are
still missing, containing white briquettes about the size and shape
of a bar of soap. Police in the area have been conducting
door-to-door searches of warehouses, along with land and air searches
for the missing chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Flores Nunez, chief spokesman for Puebla state, said the
drums appeared to have been dumped hastily into the ditch. Officials
said all the drums were intact, but one witness told Associated Press
that at least two of the drums had opened.</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports Wednesday about how the drums were
found. The Mexican Defense Department said they were discovered by
soldiers. Flores said they were found by a local man.</TE>

<HD>Showdown in Europe: Soccer vs. Business</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Employers are torn over whether to heed
fanatical workers or the bottom line.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Will DaimlerChrysler autoworkers turn out a better car than rivals at
Volkswagen if they are given a lengthened lunch hour to cheer on
Germany during World Cup soccer instead of being forbidden from
tuning in?</LD>
<LD>   Can London Stock Exchange traders still make smart deals after
having a few beers with their eggs and bacon at the local pub for
England's 7:30 a.m. start against Nigeria?</LD>
<LD>   Is changing midday shop closures in Spain to coincide with key
game times going to please soccer-crazed consumers--or upset so many
non-fans that sales will suffer during the tournament's monthlong
run?</LD>
<TE>   It will probably take months to calculate the economic
consequences of World Cup contests airing in the middle of Europe's
workday. But the broad range of employers' preemptive plans for
managing the conflicts--from keep-noses-to-the-grindstone edicts to
company-financed let's-root-together fests--suggests much confusion
about whether it's best to be rigid or to patriotically roll with the
disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   The five- to eight-hour differences between Europe and the soccer
venues mean the games played at prime time in Japan and South Korea
will be on television, radio and the Internet when most fans of the
Continental contenders are supposed to be slaving away.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies and even some governments have conceded that few
minds will be on the job when the national side is on the field, and
they have caved in to workers' demands.</TE>
<TE>   Giant TV Screens</TE>
<TE>   Erected in Paris</TE>
<TE>   Paris City Hall and the La Defense business district on the city's
outskirts have installed giant outdoor screens for public
broadcasting of all the main games. The flexible 35-hour French
workweek allows public servants to take off two weekdays per
month--an opportunity expected to be invoked en masse Friday when
"Les Bleus," the defending champions, take on Senegal in the
tournament's 1:30 p.m. opener.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will stop during the games. Everything that can be
postponed, that is," says Enrico Antonini, head of a Rome medical
clinic that has rescheduled all nonemergency cases so that nothing
avoidable conflicts with game times. "Only the emergency room will be
working during Italy games."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the mass night-shift sickouts staged during the 1970
World Cup, when Italy made it to the final against Brazil, major
Italian manufacturers such as Fiat and Pirelli have revised their
assembly line schedules on game days and installed big-screen TVs in
worker lunchrooms. The Italians play Ecuador on Monday at what will
be 1:30 p.m. in Central Europe.</TE>
<TE>   For most German blue-collar workers, though, the bosses are
unbending. Despite appeals from politicians for flexibility--it is an
election year in Germany--most big companies informed soccer fans
months ago that they would have to take vacation if they wanted to
watch the workday games.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of 500 major German employers by the Wirtschaftswoche
business magazine found that 84% had expressly prohibited employees
from following World Cup play while at their jobs. The German
national team's first game, against Saudi Arabia, is Saturday, but
the more eagerly anticipated clash with Ireland falls smack in the
middle of the workday for both countries Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bayer, the pharmaceutical and chemical giant that sponsors
the Bayer Leverkusen team, which is one of Europe's perennial
Champions League contenders, has banned its employees from watching
in laboratories, offices or warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   "We work in sequential processes that can't just be stopped on a
whim," says Meinolf Sprink, Bayer's executive for sports matters. To
make things fair, white-collar workers are also prohibited from
tuning in or taking extended lunch hours. "And the Internet is
supposed to be used only for work purposes," Sprink adds.</TE>
<TE>   Fever Takes Hold in</TE>
<TE>   Southern Germany</TE>
<TE>   In the somewhat more relaxed southern regions of Germany,
employers are showing a little more understanding. DaimlerChrysler
not only set up TVs in its lunchrooms, but has gotten into the spirit
with a special exhibition of sports photos at its main manufacturing
site near Stuttgart.</TE>
<TE>   At the SAP software company near Heidelberg, co-founder Dietmar
Hopp, who sponsors his own local team, is allowing any fan to follow
weekday games on a big-screen TV erected in the company cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, sports fans' demands have been heeded in the highest
circles. The British High Court issued a historic ruling April 12
allowing pubs to extend opening hours to provide the traditional
venue and libations for England fans when the national team meets
Nigeria on June 12 at what will be 7:30 a.m. in London.</TE>
<TE>   Several big British employers are bracing for a general exodus
when England plays Argentina at lunchtime June 7 in a game likely to
fuel national passions that have been fierce since the Falklands War
two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Workplace.com, a major online recruitment company, has surveyed
the potential effect on business of World Cup mania, estimating a
loss to British business of almost $200 million. The survey predicts
that 1.4 million men between the ages of 21 and 44 will call in sick
on crucial game days.</TE>
<TE>   With unemployment in Poland around 18%, those with jobs worry more
about keeping them than they do about watching soccer, industry
leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   "A steelworks is a place where you simply cannot interrupt work,
so such a suggestion seems absurd," says Ewa Karpinska, spokeswoman
for the Lucchini plant in Warsaw, where vacation requests have hardly
increased for key Polish game days.</TE>
<TE>   But in countries where soccer fever overcomes rational business
judgment, managers who are loath to endorse wasting company time
appear willing to at least look the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Although those charting the potential threats to Europe's already
troubled economies are watching the workday contests with most
concern, even some weekend games are problematic.</TE>
<TE>   The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has urged vicars to
take parishioners' sporting needs into consideration during Sunday's
10:30 a.m. England-Sweden game, suggesting that weekly services might
be rescheduled around it.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop himself, though an ardent fan, will have to skip
the first national contest because it coincides with Queen Elizabeth
II's jubilee celebration at Windsor Castle, perhaps the only event
not subject to postponement to indulge Britons' penchant for soccer.</TE>

<HD>A New 'Lawrence of Arabia' Intrigue</HD>
<DH>History: Records show that the famed British adventurer
paid two-thirds of his salary to a mysterious woman for more than a
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>T.E. Lawrence, the adventurer immortalized as "Lawrence of Arabia"
for leading an army of desert warriors, paid two-thirds of his salary
to a mysterious woman for more than a year, according to newly
released files.</LD>
<LD>   The information, contained in confidential Royal Air Force records
made public this week, is renewing speculation about Lawrence's
little-known private life, which has been the subject of fierce
debate among historians and biographers.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Edward Lawrence was a British archeology scholar, military
strategist and author known for his legendary war activities in the
Middle East during World War I, and for his memoir about them, "Seven
Pillars of Wisdom." During the conflict, he helped lead Arab
guerrillas fighting Turkish forces allied with the Germans.</LD>
<TE>   Lawrence was wounded many times, captured and tortured. He endured
hunger, the extremes of desert life and disease. He also took part in
atrocities against the enemy, which were common on both sides then.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed to have been the victim of a brutal rape after being
captured in Arab dress by the Turks in 1917, and it was believed to
have left him physically and emotionally scarred.</TE>
<TE>   After Lawrence's death in a motorcycle accident in 1935, a friend,
John Bruce, told reporters he had been paid to beat Lawrence with a
birch branch over a period of 12 years because of a "flagellation
disorder" he had developed.</TE>
<TE>   The new files contain medical records describing scars.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed with his country's strategies in the Mideast,
Lawrence turned down honors and was demobilized in 1919.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to disappear from public view, enlisting in the Royal Air
Force and the Royal Tank Corps as a low-ranking serviceman under the
assumed names John Hume Ross and T.E. Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   But the press found out, and the newly released files raise more
questions about his private life. They describe payments he made to a
woman in Newark, England, in the mid-1920s while serving under the
name Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of his meager 3-shilling daily salary (about 22 cents
today) was paid to a Miss Ruby Bryant. The payments occurred while
Lawrence was serving at a nearby British military base. Bryant and
the reasons for the payments have never been mentioned in any of his
biographies.</TE>
<TE>   The files also show how unhappy Lawrence was about the fame his
heroics generated, especially regarding Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In one letter to Sir Philip Sassoon, then undersecretary at the
Air Ministry, Lawrence was furious about a proposal by Alexander
Korda in 1934 to make a "Lawrence of Arabia" film.</TE>
<TE>   "I have sent him word that perhaps he ought to discuss his
intentions with me before he opens his silly mouth again," Lawrence
wrote.</TE>

<HD>British to Bolster Afghan Border</HD>
<DH>Asia: Troop operation aims to prevent enemy forces' return
from Pakistan, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Seeking to prevent Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters from returning to
Afghanistan or disrupting the country's efforts to choose new
leaders, hundreds of British troops Wednesday began a new operation
near the border with Pakistan, military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   British officials described the mission near the eastern city of
Khowst as a stabilization effort, and said Royal Marines would be
conducting patrols through villages as well as launching covert
operations into nearby mountains lined with trails into Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   The operation comes at a time when U.S. military officials say few
Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are left in Afghanistan. U.S. Army Maj.
Bryan Hilferty, spokesman for coalition forces, on Wednesday likened
the country to a house that has been rid of pests by an exterminator.</LD>
<TE>   Operations continue, he said, because "you need the exterminator
to keep coming back to make sure the cockroaches don't return."</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty said U.S. officials believe that between 100 and 1,000 Al
Qaeda operatives are hiding in Pakistan, which might be shifting its
resources toward the disputed Kashmir region in the nation's conflict
with India. He declined to say whether the United States had added
patrols or adjusted plans to compensate for any troop shift by
Pakistan away from the Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   The British operation appears to mark a change in tactics from
recent--largely uneventful--missions in which troops have typically
been deployed by helicopter to comb remote, unpopulated regions for
Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   In Operation Buzzard, as it is being called, about 200 soldiers
traveled to the Khowst area in a highly visible, 32-vehicle convoy.
They are to spend much of their time patrolling large swaths of
territory, trying to gather information from villagers on the
militants' hide-outs and weapons caches.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making a big effort to engage with village elders in the
community," said a British military leader who discussed the
operation on condition of anonymity. The operation is expected to
last longer than previous missions--spanning a month or more--with
the number of troops deployed ranging from 350 to 700.</TE>
<TE>   The mission is timed in part to discourage interference by Al
Qaeda and Taliban loyalists with the planned June 10-16 meeting of
the loya jirga, or grand council, to select a new transitional Afghan
government.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what terrorists do, they try to disrupt the process,"
Hilferty said, adding that they might try "typical terrorist attacks"
such as suicide or car bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The British officer said Al Qaeda fighters "need some kind of
symbolic victory" after being driven from Afghanistan. Regional
warlords and Islamists opposed to Western intervention also might
seek to disrupt the election, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The operation is something of a public relations campaign in a
territory where many remain uncomfortable with the foreign military
presence. Much of the population is illiterate, the British official
said, and unaware of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   British Brig. Roger Lane explained the mission on Afghan radio
Wednesday. "We have no strategic self-interest in staying here in
Afghanistan," he said in a broadcast that was translated into the
Pashto and Dari languages. "We are here because Al Qaeda harbored
terrorists who killed 3,000 people in New York on Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   A small American civil affairs military unit accompanied the
British troops to arrange for delivery of drinking water and other
humanitarian aid.</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Aims to Revive Pipeline Plans</HD>
<DH>Energy: Officials in Kabul say Unocal is the best choice
for the natural gas project, but the California firm says it's no
longer interested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>For the last eight years, as Afghans fought one another on the
battlefield, foreign companies waged a back-room war for the right to
build a pipeline to tap the vast energy riches of Central Asia.</LD>
<LD>   El Segundo-based Unocal Corp. and Argentina's Bridas Corp. headed
two competing groups that hired diplomats skilled in the gentle art
of persuasion and offered Afghan warlords tempting incentives in
pursuit of a prize worth billions.</LD>
<LD>   But like so many Afghan dreams dashed in 23 years of war, the
$1.9-billion natural gas pipeline project never got past the talking
and enticing. When rivalries were fully inflamed, the vision quickly
vanished. Unocal pulled the plug on its involvement in 1998, after
the Clinton administration ordered airstrikes on suspected terrorist
camps in the country.</LD>
<TE>   Now the leaders of Afghanistan and neighboring Turkmenistan and
Pakistan hope to revive the venture at a summit today, and as the
intrigue starts to swirl again, this shattered country desperate for
foreign investment risks getting sucked into another bitter round of
pipeline politics.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government expects a pipeline would create 10,000 jobs
and bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in transit fees
alone. Warlords want to grab a cut of the profits, but they also hope
that natural gas running through their regions will help fuel local
industries.</TE>
<TE>   Before Unocal pulled out, the company was accused of secretly
supporting the radical Islamic Taliban regime to secure a safe route
for the pipeline from Turkmenistan through western Afghanistan and to
market in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Now that U.S. bombers have reduced the Taliban to roving bands of
guerrilla fighters, the new government sees Unocal as the
best-qualified firm to lead a project that would give an enormous
lift to a ruined economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the company says it isn't interested, at least "not for the
foreseeable future," spokeswoman Teresa Covington said from Sugar
Land, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything beyond that is speculation, and I don't think it would
serve me to say 'forever,'" Covington added. "But I can tell you that
our management's position is that we have no plans or interests in
that pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition to withdrawing from the pipeline consortium [in
1998], we also closed all of our offices in Central Asia, with the
exception of Azerbaijan. Our view was that our capital and future
growth, at this point, lay elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   But after all the expense and trouble Unocal went through, Afghans
such as Mohammed Ebrahim Adel, deputy minister of mines and
industries, find it hard to believe that the firm doesn't want to win
the right to build the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "Business has its secrets and mysteries," said Adel, a mining
engineer. "And maybe, before there is a real contract, they don't
want it to be disclosed in the media."</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. development official, who also speculated about Unocal's
true intentions, said that although Afghan leaders are saying little
in public about the pipeline, it's at the root of political
maneuvering in the run-up to next month's loya jirga, or traditional
grand assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Turkmen, Pakistani and Afghan Leaders to Meet</TE>
<TE>   Interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf and Turkmen President Saparmurad A. Niyazov are
expected to sign a broad agreement to build the pipeline when they
convene in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. Their meeting comes just
days before the loya jirga is to decide who will rule Afghanistan for
the next two years. That government will be asked to honor any
agreements Karzai makes.</TE>
<TE>   The new government would have to find foreign financing and firms
willing to take on a complex project in a nation still not completely
at peace. If Unocal made a bid, it would be hard to beat, said Adel,
the deputy minister.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, Unocal is economically and technically stronger" than
other companies that have expressed interest, he said, adding, "We
are sure Unocal will win, because it has big potential and can work
better."</TE>
<TE>   To some here, it looked like the fix was in for Unocal when
President Bush named a former Unocal consultant, Zalmay Khalilzad, as
his special envoy to Afghanistan late last year.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Khalilzad, who is also a key advisor on Bush's
National Security Council, was a special advisor in the State
Department on the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq War. He
became a consultant to Unocal in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Just 10 days after the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 1996 and
began its vicious crackdown, Khalilzad argued in a Washington Post
opinion piece that the U.S. should try to work with the mullahs and
form a broad-based government that included other factions.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, one of the paper's front-page headlines declared,
"Kabul Women Under Virtual House Arrest." On the opinion page,
Khalilzad argued: "The Taliban does not practice the anti-U.S. style
of fundamentalism practiced by Iran--it is closer to the Saudi
model....</TE>
<TE>   "We should use as a positive incentive the benefits that will
accrue to Afghanistan from the construction of oil and gas pipelines
across its territory," he added. "These projects will only go forward
if Afghanistan has a single authoritative government."</TE>
<TE>   Unocal announced in October 1997 that it would lead a seven-member
consortium, called Central Asia Gas Pipeline Ltd. The group planned
to build a 790-mile pipeline from the Turkmen-Afghan border to
Multan, Pakistan. A $600-million extension to supply an even bigger
market in India was also under consideration, Unocal said.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Miller, then a Unocal vice president, cautioned at the time
that the project faced "significant economic, political and
commercial challenges" but added, "It has exceptionally sound
economic fundamentals, given the presence of proven gas reserves in
Turkmenistan and the market needs of Pakistan and India."</TE>
<TE>   At least two groups of Unocal officials from the U.S. visited
Afghanistan in 1997 and '98, headed by a Unocal vice president, Chris
Taggart, said Khodainoor Mandar Khail, who met them as president of
Afghan National Oil Co.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's interim government has allowed Mandar Khail to keep his
job, but so far there is little for him to do. He sits at an empty
desk, reading and rereading an old copy of the Economist, and
reminisces.</TE>
<TE>   Mandar Khail said he accompanied both Unocal delegations to the
southern city of Kandahar, where the Taliban's reclusive--now
fugitive--leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, made all the important
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Mandar Khail said he didn't know whether Omar granted a rare
audience to the Americans, but said that "at that time, he was
available" to join in such important negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal was so confident that it would sign a deal, it opened a
school in Kandahar to train workers in pipe-fitting, welding and
other skills required for the project, Mandar Khail said.</TE>
<TE>   When Unocal announced it was suspending its involvement in the
bidding in August 1998, the company denied it had trained Afghan
workers for the project.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1997, a month after rival Bridas announced it was
close to signing a pipeline contract with the Taliban, Unocal
welcomed a Taliban delegation, including several government
ministers, to its offices in Sugar Land.</TE>
<TE>   The trip included a tour of offshore oil wells, and Khalilzad
helped entertain the visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's Bridas proposed a pipeline through western Afghanistan
in 1994, the same year the Taliban emerged as a small militia of
ethnic Pushtuns in Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal presented plans for a similar pipeline the following year,
and in 1996, Bridas tried to sue in a Houston court. The lawsuit was
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Aug. 7, 1998, bombing of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa, Unocal announced it was suspending all activities
related to the pipeline project in Afghanistan. Its news release
blamed "sharply deteriorating political conditions in the region."</TE>
<TE>   Previous Contracts Are Now Void, Official Says</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Alem Razm, Afghanistan's minister for mines and
industries, says any contracts signed by previous governments or
commanders are now meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Razm was an intriguing choice as minister of mines and industries
in a country that has little of either. A former general under ethnic
Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, Razm has spent most of his adult
life in the military.</TE>
<TE>   His appointment to what has become a key post in Afghanistan's
government appears to have more to do with pipeline politics than
professional qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   Dostum, a ruthless commander with a reputation for abandoning
allies and offering his services to the top bidder, was in Bridas'
corner in the competition to build the pipeline and even signed a
deal with the Argentine firm in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   After the Taliban's collapse last year, Dostum opposed the interim
government until Karzai paid him a visit in his northern stronghold
of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, an ethnic Pushtun, not only persuaded the Uzbek commander
to change his mind, but appointed him deputy defense minister and
Kabul's chief representative in the north.</TE>
<TE>   Now Razm, one of Dostum's closest commanders, is responsible for
what could be one of the country's most important development
projects. Afghan officials hope the pipeline could be expanded to
carry oil as well as natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Like his deputy, Adel, Razm also said this week that Unocal was
the best company for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever ends up building the pipeline shouldn't follow the
shorter, western route that Unocal and Bridas proposed, but instead
ought to make it run a much more expensive and difficult southern
route through Kabul and then into Pakistan, Adel said.</TE>
<TE>   That would benefit the national interest, he said. Of course, it
would also ensure that the lucrative pipeline passed right through
his boss' home turf.</TE>

<HD>Putin Balks at Visa Plan for Kaliningrad</HD>
<DH>Europe: Nations abutting the enclave are set to join the
EU, which wants to preserve strong borders. Some Russians fear losing
more territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin took a tough stance Wednesday against
European Union plans to require visas for Russians crossing EU
countries on their way to and from the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad, underscoring Moscow's fears that the isolated, formerly
German territory might one day be wrested from it.</LD>
<LD>   The EU has said that visas will be needed after Poland and
Lithuania, which lie between Kaliningrad and the main part of Russia,
are brought into the EU in the next few years.</LD>
<LD>   But the prospect of Russians needing visas to travel from one part
of their country to another touches a delicate nerve in Moscow. Even
an EU promise Wednesday to build closer economic ties and to regard
Russia as a "free-market economy" did not mollify Putin at the start
of an EU-Russian summit in Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   "It is no exaggeration to say that our overall relations with the
European Union depend on how this issue of vital importance to
Russians is resolved," Putin said, referring to Kaliningrad.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has suggested that there be visa-free transit aboard sealed
trains, or that some sort of corridor be created in which Russians
could travel without visas. But neither Lithuania nor Poland likes
the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute was a note of discord in what had been a love fest
between Putin and the West in the past week. It follows Putin's
successful summit with President Bush last weekend and the formal
establishment Tuesday of a Russia-NATO council designed to give
Russia a strong voice in Western security decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Launching talks with European Commission President Romano Prodi
and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Putin said Russian
residents and goods must be allowed to travel freely into and out of
Kaliningrad even after Poland and Lithuania join the EU.</TE>
<TE>   But for the EU officials, preserving strong borders for the union
is a fundamental issue.</TE>
<TE>   They fear that if Russian citizens could travel into the EU
without visas, a path might be opened for illegal immigration and the
smuggling of drugs, weapons, prostitutes and other contraband into EU
member states.</TE>
<TE>   A European Union spokeswoman in Moscow, Silvia Kofler,
acknowledged that the issue of Kaliningrad remained thorny. "We have
agreed to disagree," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin's stance is likely to be a hit with Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "What the president has said is that not only will we keep
Kaliningrad, but we will continue to go there freely," said former
Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. "He should be given credit."</TE>
<TE>   Another analyst said that losing Kaliningrad could set off a
domino effect, with other regions of Russia wanting to break away.</TE>
<TE>   "Kaliningrad is not so valuable to Moscow as a territory, but more
as a precedent that will determine whether Russia disintegrates or
remains within its present boundaries," said Dmitry Furman at the
Institute of Europe, an affiliate of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that if Kaliningrad breaks away, then at some point
in the future the maps of Russia and Moscow will end up showing
precisely the same territory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Russian news media have reported on budding separatist
sentiments inside Kaliningrad, even though the territory is almost
totally ethnic Russian.</TE>
<TE>   The German-speaking population was ousted and ethnic Russians
settled there after the region was captured from Germany in World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<LD>   Two climbers died in a raging snowstorm atop Mt. Rainier and
rescue workers were searching for another lost climber, park rangers
said.</LD>
<LD>   Two men and two women were camped at the 14,410-foot summit in a
snow cave that collapsed, prompting one man to hike down to 7,800
feet and call for help from a cellular phone, said Maria Gillett at
the Mt. Rainier National Park Ranger Station. He was airlifted to
safety.</LD>
<TE>   The caller said the other man had become disoriented in the
blizzard and fell to his death, while the two women stayed behind to
wait for help.</TE>
<TE>   Gillett said one woman was found dead and that searchers were
looking for the other woman.</TE>

<HD>Boston Archdiocese Is Ordered to Surrender Files of 11
Priests</HD>
<DH>Courts: The lawyer for alleged sex abuse victim says church
routinely moved suspected clerics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has been ordered to turn
over personnel files of 11 more priests suspected of sexual
misconduct with minors.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Raymond L. Brassard gave church officials
until Friday to deliver the records to attorney Roderick MacLeish
Jr., who represents a family suing the archdiocese and Cardinal
Bernard Law. Gregory Ford, 24, has contended that for six years,
beginning when he was 6, Father Paul Shanley raped him after weekly
religious education classes. MacLeish contends that the archdiocese
records will show Boston church officials routinely moved priests
suspected of child abuse, including Shanley, from parish to parish.</LD>
<LD>   MacLeish is scheduled to depose the cardinal next week. (Law was
questioned earlier this month in connection with a lawsuit involving
former priest John Geoghan, who was convicted in January of fondling
a child.)</LD>
<TE>   In the Shanley case, MacLeish also will depose Bishops John B.
McCormack of New Hampshire and Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn, N.Y. Both
prelates oversaw Shanley at various times.</TE>
<TE>   Brassard's ruling late Tuesday requires that written and
audiovisual transcripts of the three church leaders' depositions be
made public as soon as they have been certified by a court clerk.</TE>
<TE>   While individuals who are deposed normally are granted the right
to review transcripts, Brassard ruled that "the standard on
depositions is different when the defendant is an important public
figure. Such a figure has a diminished privacy expectation. There is
a vital public interest involved."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese lawyer Wilson D. Rogers III, speaking in court
Tuesday, branded the request to release the transcripts as an attempt
to "harass, annoy and embarrass the diocese."</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, now retired, for decades was well-known as a priest who
worked with drug users and street people. He also served as pastor at
a now-defunct parish in Newton, Mass., where the Ford family
worshiped.</TE>
<TE>   Boston church officials recommended Shanley, now 71, as a priest
"in good standing" when he transferred to St. Anne's parish in San
Bernardino in the early 1990s. After he was arrested May 2 in San
Diego, he was extradited to Boston. Shanley has pleaded not guilty to
three charges of child rape involving another plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,600 pages of previously released church documents
concerning Shanley contained shocking revelations about his
endorsement of man-boy love, his history of venereal disease and his
apparent threats to blackmail church officials.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 priests named in Tuesday's ruling all are dead or have been
removed from their posts.</TE>

<HD>Thinking Behind FBI Plan Faulted</HD>
<DH>Reform: Reorganization centers on centralized analysis. But
modern management techniques focus on decentralized power, sharing of
data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Is the FBI pursuing a 20th century solution to a 21st century
problem?</LD>
<LD>   That question likely will be at the heart of the debate over the
sweeping reorganization plan that FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III
announced Wednesday to sharpen the agency's focus on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller's ambitious plan, responding to searing criticism over the
FBI's failure to correlate leads before Sept. 11's terrorist attacks,
strives to improve the analytic capacity at the agency's Washington
headquarters. But some critics question whether that model is the
best way to ensure that the FBI avoids the breakdowns that prevented
agents in Phoenix and Minneapolis from becoming aware of each other's
suspicions about terrorist plots before Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Mueller's plan follows the hierarchical management approach that
major companies and government agencies typically employed through
most of the 20th century: It seeks to ensure that the right
connections are made by adding a new layer of centralized oversight
to process the information developed by local offices.</TE>
<TE>   But that solution runs against the dominant current over the last
decade in both business and governmental management
reform--accelerating efforts to decentralize power and control of
information so that organizations can react more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The tendency to centralize is a classic industrial-era, 20th
century habit; it happens all the time, in all kinds of
organizations," said David Osborne, a consultant whose book
"Reinventing Government" inspired much of the Clinton
administration's government reform agenda. "But if you read anybody
who is writing about 21st century organizations, they are all saying
decentralize, flatten, get more info out to the people who do the
actual work."</TE>
<TE>   With the FBI under fire for failing to link the clues developed in
Phoenix and Minneapolis last year, the argument is over the best way
to "connect the dots."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Mueller's answer is to create a new office, and
hire new analysts, who will specialize in connecting dots at one
centralized point. Many companies, though, have been moving toward
management structures that, in effect, encourage the dots to connect
themselves by increasing the freedom of employees to share
information with each other and then make decisions without approval
from the central headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   That's something the FBI remains reluctant to do--partly for fear
that sharing too much could allow sensitive information to end up in
the wrong hands.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the criticism the FBI has received in recent weeks for
failing to share information largely inverts the charges it faced
only a short time ago.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as April, a commission headed by former FBI and CIA
Director William H. Webster urged the agency to tighten controls over
information. That commission--formed in response to the arrest of FBI
official Robert Philip Hanssen as a long-time Russian spy--argued
that sensitive information within the agency should be less widely
available. Hanssen's easy access to such data, the commission
charged, showed that the FBI too often "violates the basic security
principle that such information should be circulated only among those
who 'need to know.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now, questions about the agency's actions before Sept. 11 have
raised the opposite problem: Agents with a need to know of other
terrorist leads were not aware of them.</TE>
<TE>   Critics on Capitol Hill have questioned why the FBI never linked a
Phoenix agent's warning about potential terrorists attending flight
schools with the Minneapolis arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui after a
flight school instructor grew suspicious of him. In a sharply worded
internal memo to Mueller, Minneapolis agent Coleen M. Rowley
complained that the Moussaoui investigators hadn't seen the Phoenix
memo.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller directly acknowledged the breakdown Wednesday as he
unveiled his reorganization plan. "We have to do a better job
managing, analyzing and sharing information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes that conclusion; the coming debate is likely to be
over the best way to achieve that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm Sparrow, a former British detective who now teaches public
management at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, praised Mueller's proposal. Only a centralized analytic
office, he argued, will have the scope of vision to assess the
international terrorist threat. "You can only see a problem from
above it," said Sparrow, who has conducted classes for FBI agents.
"Being organized at a lower level never works because you can't see
it."</TE>
<TE>   But in her memo, Rowley pointedly questioned whether increased
authority for FBI headquarters will produce better results. "If we
are indeed in a 'war,' shouldn't the generals be on the battlefield
instead of sitting in a spot removed from the action while still
attempting to call the shots?" she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI reform plan doesn't ignore those concerns; today Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft is expected to announce new guidelines that would
provide field offices more freedom to initiate terrorist
investigations without Washington approval. And Mueller went out of
his way to promise that new "flying squads" of specialized
anti-terrorist agents at headquarters would not "supersede" the work
of field offices in terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But the plan would maintain--and even intensify--centralized
control of information by establishing a new Office of Intelligence
to coordinate the analysis of terrorism leads.</TE>
<TE>   In that way the plan sustains the agency's current "hub and spoke"
organizational model, in which the field offices funnel information
into Washington, which then decides what to share with other offices.</TE>
<TE>   Making those links, Mueller said Wednesday, must remain a
"responsibility" for headquarters. "We cannot expect an office in the
field to know what other offices are doing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But that is precisely what much of the last decade's management
revolution in business--and to a much lesser extent government--has
attempted to do.</TE>
<TE>   Through "re-engineering" and other management reforms, most
Fortune 500 companies, led by innovators such as General Electric Co.
and Southwest Airlines, have attempted to "create much more seamless"
sharing of information across the organization, said Alan Webber, a
founding editor of Fast Company, a magazine that tracks business
innovation. "They are trying to break down the boundaries and the
barriers ... so it is not so much a hierarchy."</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, experts like Osborne say that while adding more
analysts in Washington might help discover patterns, even more
important may be finding better ways for the FBI's field
investigators to communicate with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Such horizontal communication would greatly increase the odds that
the right linkages are made, said Bob Stone, a former Pentagon
official who directed the National Performance Review, which sought
to increase government efficiency, under former Vice President Al
Gore.</TE>
<TE>   "If the guy in Phoenix hadn't made the connection, the woman in
Minneapolis might have gotten it," Stone said. "If neither of them
got it, maybe a guy in Boston would have got it."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "When you are sharing information, you have lots of
chances to get it right. If you are centralizing information, you
have only one chance to get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, some experts believe the challenge of mining the vast
streams of terrorist-related intelligence flowing into the government
will require not only better human connections but increased reliance
on "Web services" software that allow computers to automatically
search other computers for information--a possibility that Mueller
may have hinted at Wednesday when he said the agency needed to
increase its use of "artificial intelligence."</TE>

<HD>Revamped Osprey Takes Its First Flight</HD>
<DH>Military: Hybrid craft has been grounded since fatal
crashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>An overhauled V-22 Osprey took a modest first flight Wednesday, 18
months after the military grounded the Marine Corps' helicopter-plane
hybrid because of two fatal crashes.</LD>
<LD>   Pilots hovered the tilt-rotor aircraft up to 30 feet above the
runway and conducted maneuvers at the Patuxent River Naval Air
Station. The action was the first in more than a year of planned
testing before the V-22 is eligible for duty.</LD>
<LD>   While the Osprey has the ability to take off like a helicopter,
rotate its propellers 90 degrees and fly like an airplane, it stayed
in helicopter mode during its first flight.</LD>
<TE>   A cheering crowd of 200 technicians, engineers and military
officials watched the test.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone well beyond our expectations," Marine Col. Dan Schultz,
the V-22 program manager, said of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   The military will test seven modified V-22s at the station and
four at Edwards Air Force Base in California.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps hopes to replace its aging fleet of assault
helicopters with the Osprey, and has set its sights on having the
V-22 in service by December 2003, Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   Built by Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopters Textron, each V-22 costs
$89.7 million</TE>

<HD>Democrat Claims Victory In Ky. Senate Primary</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRANKFORT, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Kentucky's Democratic U.S. Senate primary remained in dispute
Wednesday, with political newcomer Lois Combs Weinberg claiming
victory over a former congressman who refused to concede.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprisingly close vote, the well-financed Weinberg outpolled
Tom Barlow by fewer than 1,000 votes out of more than 460,000 cast
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a canvass Wednesday by Associated Press of all but one county,
Weinberg held a lead of 616 votes in her bid to challenge three-term
Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell this fall.</LD>
<TE>   The AP tally showed Weinberg with 230,404 votes to Barlow's
229,788. The count by the secretary of state's office showed Weinberg
with 230,282 votes to Barlow's 229,302, a 980-vote difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to be a winner," Weinberg said. "George Bush showed us
whether you win by 100 votes or 100,000, you're still a winner."</TE>
<TE>   Barlow said he was leaning toward asking the state to re-canvass
votes cast in 3,416 precincts in 120 counties.</TE>
<TE>   "All Democrats would want to make sure that everybody's vote was
properly tallied," said Barlow, who declined to say when he would
make his decision.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Elections is scheduled to certify the vote June
14. Barlow has until Tuesday to ask for the re-canvass. McConnell has
apparently decided that Weinberg will be his opponent"I think it
would be safe to conclude that she kind of limps into the general
election with a very divided party behind her," said McConnell, who
has $4.1 million on hand for the fall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Idaho Democrats chose nominees to challenge two
popular Republicans, Sen. Larry E. Craig and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Craig will face Alan Blinken, an investment banker and a former
ambassador to Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   Kempthorne easily beat three challengers in the GOP primary and
will face Democrat Jerry Brady, publisher of the Post Register
newspaper in Idaho Falls.</TE>

<HD>Professors' Killer Gets Added Term</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVERHILL, N.H.</DL>
<LD>A teenager already serving life in prison for killing two Dartmouth
College professors received an additional 15 to 30 years on Wednesday
for conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence came in a plea bargain that also forbids Robert
Tulloch from profiting from the stabbing deaths of Half and Susanne
Zantop in January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Tulloch, 19, pleaded guilty last month to first-degree murder. He
also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, but sentencing on
that charge was delayed while prosecutors worked out the plea
agreement.</LD>
<TE>   James Parker, Tulloch's partner in the crime, agreed to similar
restrictions. Parker, 18, is serving at least 25 years in prison for
helping kill the couple</TE>
<TE>   "The agreement doesn't prohibit him from speaking about the
crimes. It prohibits him from gaining any financial profit from
having murdered the Zantops," prosecutor Kelly Ayotte said. The
maximum sentence for murder conspiracy is 30 years. Prosecutors
brought the charge based on information provided by Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Parker told prosecutors that he and Tulloch were bored with their
hometown of Chelsea, Vt., and decided to come up with $10,000 to move
to Australia. After spending months devising a plan, they decided to
kill people and steal their ATM cards and personal identification
numbers. They tried four homes at random before gaining admission to
the Zantops' house in Hanover by posing as students conducting a
survey.</TE>
<TE>   The teens stabbed the couple, and fingerprints on a knife sheath
left behind linked them to the crime. After being interviewed and
fingerprinted, they fled Chelsea and hitchhiked west. They were
arrested at an Indiana truck stop several weeks later.</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>A defendant who had just been found guilty of murder shot and wounded
a bailiff with his own gun in an attempt to escape from a Milwaukee
courtroom, but was shot dead by a police detective in front of
horrified jurors and witnesses, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting erupted in the third-floor Milwaukee County courtroom
after Laron Ball, 20, jumped onto the jury box toward a window. Two
bailiffs tried to subdue him. Ball bit one bailiff on the arm and
grabbed the other's holstered pistol, which discharged, wounding the
deputy in the abdomen.</LD>
<LD>   Det. Alfonso Morales, who had testified in the case and was
sitting in the courtroom, leaped onto the prosecution table and shot
Ball.</LD>
<TE>   The bailiff who was bitten by Ball was treated and released at a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The one with the gunshot wound was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Extra security had been assigned to Ball at the trial because of
tips that he might pose a threat, police sources said. However, he
was not handcuffed or shackled in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why the decision was or was not made to not staff
with more deputies than we had. But no matter how many we had, it
wouldn't have been enough to stop Laron Ball," Milwaukee County
Sheriff David Clarke told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Ball was convicted of a slaying during a robbery last December.</TE>

<HD>Skakel's Sister Wavers on Eyewitness Account</HD>
<DH>Crime: She told police in 1975 she thought she saw her
brother, now accused of murder, near scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>The older sister of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel testified Wednesday
that she saw a figure run across the family property the night Martha
Moxley was killed but does not believe it was her brother.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Skakel said that, although she at first thought it was
Michael and called out his name, the figure did not respond and she
now doesn't believe it was him.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came as the trial nears an end. The jury was excused
until Monday, when closing arguments are scheduled. Attorneys will
meet today to discuss jury instructions.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, is charged with beating Moxley with a golf club almost
27 years ago, when they were 15-year-old neighbors in Greenwich.
Skakel is a nephew of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel's attorneys argue that he left with a group of other teens
to take a cousin home about the time Moxley was killed, which a
medical expert for the defense estimated at 10 p.m. Oct. 30, 1975--a
time that conforms with Skakel's alibi. The state medical examiner
has said that the time of death could have been anywhere between 9:30
p.m. and 5 a.m. the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Skakel said she was standing in her driveway about 9:30 p.m.
that night when she saw a figure run past. She said she wasn't sure
who it was, but said, "I think I yelled out, 'Michael!'"</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors reminded her of statements she made to police in 1975
and her testimony before a grand jury in 1998. In the police
interview, she said she thought the running figure was her brother.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Skakel, who was 18 in 1975, said she first thought the
person might have been Michael because he was always out with friends
on "mischief night," the night before Halloween. But even at that
time, she was uncertain who she saw, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also reported seeing a figure run in front of her house later
that night after she returned from taking a friend home. "As I was
walking to the front door, someone ran in front of me," she said. "It
looked like it was holding something, maybe a bundle."</TE>
<TE>   She told defense attorney Michael Sherman that she was sure the
figure was not her brother "because of the size."</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Sherman established that many
neighborhood teenagers were outside playing pranks on "mischief
night."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also called to the stand a former classmate of Skakel
at a substance abuse treatment center in Maine. Jennifer Pease, 36,
backed up earlier testimony that Skakel had confessed to killing
Moxley while at the Elan School in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Pease said fellow student Gregory Coleman, who died last year
after using heroin, told her that Skakel had talked about killing a
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that he had beaten some girl's head in with a golf club
and killed her," Pease said.</TE>

<HD>For Some, Immunity to Smallpox Is Gone</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Adults who were vaccinated before the mid-1970s
no longer have the resistance to fight the disease, study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Adults given smallpox vaccinations as children before the disease was
eradicated in the mid-1970s have probably lost their immunity to the
highly infectious disease, new research indicates.</LD>
<LD>   "This study is, to the best of my knowledge, the only one since
eradication which tries to look at the durability of immunity,"
Michael Sauri, director of the Occupational Medicine Clinic in
Maryland, told New Scientist magazine Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's showing us that after 20 years, immunity is not going to be
there."</LD>
<TE>   The study of 621 microbiologists, who were vaccinated again from
1994 to 2001 because of the type of work they do, found that only
about 40, or 6%, were still immune to the disease from the
vaccinations they had received earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The new research heightens the debate about whether pre-emptive
mass vaccinations are needed or if "ring vaccination" of people in an
affected area could contain an outbreak of the disease following a
bioterrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta favors
limited vaccination because little is known about what determines
long-term immu- nity.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Bicknell of Boston University, a former public health
official, said he believes that selective mass vaccination may be the
best policy because of the threat of the terrorist use of smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   He said vaccination could minimize the impact of smallpox as a
weapon and the risk to the general population.</TE>
<TE>   "I am advocating vaccination of first responders--emergency
workers, hospital workers, doctors, nurses and other staff and wider
groups of people essential for the maintenance of civil society,"
Bicknell said.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested vaccinating about 100,000 emergency and hospital
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he said, the side effects of the vaccinations should be
studied and the situation reevaluated before deciding on expanding
the program to more emergency workers and later to the public.</TE>

<HD>Drug Found to Slow Onset of Diabetes</HD>
<DH>Health: Treatment can delay full-blown Type 1 form of the
disease in youths for at least a year, study says. Results called
'remarkable.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have delayed the onset of full-blown Type 1 diabetes in
young people for at least a year with a two-week drug treatment that
blocked a specific part of the youths' immune systems.</LD>
<LD>   Patients taking the drug continued to produce their own insulin
and required fewer and smaller insulin shots than those who were not
treated, according to a study published today in the New England
Journal of Medicine. Previous studies have shown that diabetics who
continue to produce at least some insulin have better control of
their blood-sugar levels and far fewer devastating side effects, such
as blindness and loss of nerve sensation.</LD>
<LD>   These results are "remarkable," said Dr. Robert Goldstein, chief
scientific officer of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   "For the first time, it has been shown that progression of the
destructive autoimmune response can be stopped with few side effects
and [insulin production] preserved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a second, much larger, study also published today in the New
England Journal of Medicine showed that another once-promising
approach to preventing the disease--giving regular insulin shots to
children in an effort to block the onset of diabetes--does not work.</TE>
<TE>   Type 1 diabetes, which affects at least 1 million Americans, is an
autoimmune disease in which a person's own immune system destroys the
pancreas cells that normally produce insulin. Once those cells have
died, the insulin must be supplied by daily injections.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, researchers have made great progress in
detecting the early signs of such an autoimmune attack, enabling them
to identify people who are at high risk of developing the disease.
Identifying them while they still have some insulin production makes
it possible to consider interventions to block the disease process.</TE>
<TE>   Brute-force approaches, such as shutting down the immune system
with steroids and other immune-suppressing drugs, have been shown to
delay the onset of full-blown diabetes, but the severe side effects
produced by the drugs proved worse than the disease itself.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have thus been searching for other ways to trick the
immune system into breaking off its attack.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from UC San Francisco and Columbia University attacked
the problem using a new drug with the unlikely name of hOKT3-gamma-1
(ala-ala). This artificial antibody, developed by Dr. Jeffrey
Bluestone of UCSF, attacks the immune cells that are targeted at
pancreatic cells.</TE>
<TE>   "It sets up a regulatory network that keeps these cells in check,"
preventing them from destroying pancreas cells, Bluestone said.</TE>
<TE>   The team led by Bluestone and Dr. Kevin Herold of Columbia
University studied 12 patients, ages 7 to 27, who had recently been
diagnosed with diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks, the patients received daily injections of the
antibody.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve carefully matched patients who had also been diagnosed with
diabetes did not receive the drug and served as controls.</TE>
<TE>   One year after the treatment, nine of the 12 patients who received
the antibody had little, if any, loss of their ability to secrete
insulin. In contrast, 10 of the 12 in the other group had a
significant loss of insulin production.</TE>
<TE>   The treated patients also showed improvements in other clinical
symptoms of the disease, the team reported.</TE>
<TE>   The new drug will now be studied in at least 80 more patients,
Bluestone noted. The drug will be administered at the beginning of
the study, at six months, and after one year in the hopes that a
stronger, more prolonged response will be observed.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers cautioned against undue optimism about the drug,
citing the disappointing results with insulin injections.</TE>
<TE>   That approach looked very promising in animal studies and in a
small human trial similar to the new antibody study.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was that the injected insulin would allow the body's own
insulin-secreting cells to "rest," thereby making them less
susceptible to the immune attack.</TE>
<TE>   To test this idea, a network of researchers in the United States
and Canada screened more than 84,000 relatives of diabetics, looking
for patients in the early stages of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   They ultimately identified 339 children, with an average age of
about 12, who had at least a 50% chance of developing diabetes in the
next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Half were given twice-daily doses of insulin, while the rest were
merely observed. After nearly four years in the study, 69 of those
receiving insulin had developed diabetes, compared to 70 of those in
the observation group.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the intervention didn't work, said Dr. Jay S.
Skyler of the University of Miami, who headed the study.</TE>
<TE>   Skyler noted that his group had encountered some difficulty in
enrolling patients in the study because many physicians were already
administering insulin to the potential subjects based on the results
of the small preliminary study and the results in animals.</TE>
<TE>   That is why it was important to conduct the larger study, he said:
"The history of medicine is littered with wrong conclusions drawn
from pilot studies."</TE>
<TE>   Although researchers were disappointed at the study's findings,
they were encouraged by the fact that the team was able to identify
people at high risk of diabetes and make an effort to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   Even though this particular study was not successful, researchers
now have a clinical network in place to conduct future studies of
other potential treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "The landmark importance of his trial is related not to the
outcome, but to the fact that it could be conducted at all,"
according to Dr. Edwin A.M. Gale of the University of Bristol in
England.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a really important trial because it enabled us to get
together a consortium of people across North America to work together
on common protocols to try to prevent diabetes," said Dr. Francine R.
Kaufman of USC, president-elect of the American Diabetes Assn. "It
was a beginning. Now we can go on to look at other drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two other major prevention studies are nearing
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   A European group has been administering the antioxidant
nicotinamide to high-risk children and is expected to report their
findings in September.</TE>
<TE>   The North American network is also conducting a second large
insulin study in which the hormone is consumed orally.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of this approach, which has also proved successful in
animals, is that exposure of the hormone to the broad variety of
immune cells in the gut will interfere with the autoimmune attack.</TE>
<TE>   Those results are not expected for another year.</TE>

<HD>Angels Run On and Over the Royals</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They execute Scioscia's 'little ball' to
perfection, stealing six bases in 12-2 victory over Kansas City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The only catcher who could slow the Angels' running game right now
might be their own.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels stole six bases Wednesday, and Angel catcher Bengie
Molina threw out yet another runner, highlights from a night at the
races. With home runs from Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus, with four hits
apiece from Salmon and Alfredo Amezaga, and with eight terrific
innings from Ramon Ortiz, the Angels routed the Kansas City Royals,
12-2.</LD>
<LD>   In the most unlikely statistic of the evening, and the one that
perhaps best illustrates the 2002 Angels, Salmon stole two bases.</LD>
<TE>   "How about that?" Salmon said. "Two bags? Did that tie a career
high for me?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it set a career high for the 10-year veteran. He even
stole third base once, making him something of a poster child for the
budding track team of Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives you the freedom to be aggressive," Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   And Molina takes that freedom away from the other team. Molina has
thrown out 55% of opposing runners, the top mark among major league
catchers. He threw out 24% last year, amid injuries to a hamstring
and to his throwing shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all a matter of confidence," he said. "I couldn't throw the
ball last year. I had my shoulder all messed up, and I didn't have my
legs. I couldn't throw anybody out, so my confidence was down."</TE>
<TE>   With perennial Gold Glove winner Ivan "Pudge" Rodriguez on the
disabled list, Molina might be the catcher striking the most fear
into the hearts of opposing managers.</TE>
<TE>   "Pudge is still at the top of the class as far as release, arm
strength, accuracy and glove-to-glove times," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bengie is not far behind that. He might be a tick behind Pudge
... but he's throwing at such a high level and [doing it] so
consistently he can be almost as effective as Pudge, and the stats
are bearing that out."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City ranks second in the American League in stolen bases,
but Molina threw out two of four Royals trying to steal in this
series.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rank third in the league in stolen bases, a byproduct
of the aggressive running tactics Scioscia and his coaches installed
in spring training. The six stolen bases Wednesday, one shy of the
club record, included a double steal in a five-run fifth inning and
two steals of second in a four-run sixth.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels could get faster next season. Amezaga, who stole
one base Wednesday, served notice that his time as the starting
shortstop might not be far in coming. The swift switch-hitter had two
hits from each side of the plate, a timely reminder to leave in the
heads of the coaching staff as he returns to the minor leagues. With
veteran infielder Benji Gil completing his rehabilitation assignment,
the Angels returned Amezaga to triple-A Salt Lake after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said he enjoys the running game and appreciates that the
coaches teach such nuances as getting proper jumps, determining which
pitches to run on and decoding pickoff moves to all the players, not
just the fastest ones.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really learned it," Salmon said. "With this coaching
staff, they're on top of those things."</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels are to win, they must run, or so Scioscia says.
Statheads insist that the "little ball" Scioscia preaches--stolen
bases, hit-and-run plays, sacrifice bunts--costs a team more in outs
than it gains in runs.</TE>
<TE>   But, on a team with little power generated by its catcher, first
baseman, second baseman, shortstop and center fielder, Scioscia says
he is simply employing the offense most appropriate for his roster.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do is look at the assets we have as a team and use them
where we see the best fit," he said. "If you have nine home run
hitters and you can't steal bases, you'll implement a different
offense than a running game.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to use it to your advantage, and not run yourself
mindlessly into outs. But I think it all falls under the umbrella of
understanding your team."</TE>

<LD>Perhaps he was emboldened by the 68 runs the Dodgers scored while
pounding 115 hits, including 24 home runs, in their previous nine
games, or maybe he just had a hunch, but Manager Jim Tracy stuck that
little-ball approach in his back pocket Wednesday afternoon and
decided to think big for a change.</LD>
<LD>   After showing bunt on the first pitch with a runner on first in
the seventh inning of a tie game, reserve infielder Alex Cora lined a
hit-and-run fastball over the wall in right field for his first home
run of the season, a two-run shot that helped catapult the Dodgers to
a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers before 26,399 in Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Cora's blast--his first home run since last June 13--was his
second hit of the game and one of only four Dodger hits on the
afternoon. Brian Jordan had the other two hits, including a two-run
homer in the fourth, and that was enough to cap a three-game sweep of
the hapless Brewers on a day the Dodgers were outhit, 13-4.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger starter Odalis Perez (5-3) gave up only two runs despite
giving up 10 hits in seven innings for the win, and closer Eric Gagne
survived a turbulent ninth, giving up a home run to Jose Hernandez
before striking out Eric Young on three straight 96-mph fastballs
with runners on second and third for his major league-leading 18th
save.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers wouldn't have won for the sixth time in eight
games had they not received a power boost from a most unexpected
source.</TE>
<TE>   "Give a lot of credit to that kid," Tracy said of Cora, who lost
his starting shortstop job to Cesar Izturis in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at his circumstances and the way he's handled himself
from day one of the season, and you have to give kudos to him,
because every role I've given him, he's done."</TE>
<TE>   Cora has made the most of his limited opportunities; he leads the
Dodgers with five pinch hits, including a key RBI single in a two-run
ninth inning Sunday in Arizona, when the Dodgers tied a game they
eventually lost, 10-9, in 10 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cora has only 48 at-bats but has 15 hits--three of them
triples--for a .313 average. With second baseman Mark Grudzielanek
slowed by a sore left big toe, Cora made his eighth start of the
season Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We get here early, run, hit and take extra ground balls because
you never know when you're going to start," Cora said of his
transition to a reserve role. "If someone goes down, you have to be
ready. You always want to play every day, but that situation didn't
happen for me this year. Instead of looking at it as a negative, it's
been a great learning experience. You just have to go out and
perform."</TE>
<TE>   That, Cora did, especially after Chad Kreuter drew a leadoff walk
from Milwaukee starter Jamey Wright in the seventh inning of a 2-2
game. Cora squared to bunt on Wright's first pitch but took it for a
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy then morphed into Earl Weaver, scrapping the bunt. Cora
turned on an inside fastball and belted it for his homer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [Wright] wanted to go 2-and-0 on Cora, and I had a
lot of confidence that he would put the ball in play and get the
runner to second base, but I didn't expect a home run," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping for a grounder to the right side, runners on first
and third and no outs. But I've always said we want the hit-and-run
to be an offensive weapon. We don't want guys to temper their swing."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger reliever Paul Quantrill retired the side in order in the
eighth, but Gagne's first pitch of the ninth was plastered by
Hernandez, who sent it over the wall in center for his 10th homer of
the season, trimming the Dodger lead to 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Belliard flied to center and pinch-hitter Lenny Harris
struck out, but pinch-hitter Tyler Houston singled to left.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Geoff Jenkins hit a slow roller to the mound, but the
ball handcuffed Gagne, who missed it.</TE>
<TE>   Cora charged and made a nice bare-hand grab, but his off-balance
throw sailed past first for an error, allowing the runners to advance
to second and third. The play--and the situation--seemed to ignite
Gagne, who blew three straight fastballs by Young to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a little [ticked] off," Gagne said. "These guys played a
great game, they had a chance to sweep the series, and I didn't want
to mess it up. I decided I had to get aggressive with the last couple
of hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Kind of like his manager.</TE>

<KH>MARK HEISLER ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Switch in Time</HD>
<DH>Lakers' attitude of playing only when it counts may finally
have run its course</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the bright side, this is doing wonders for the Lakers' humility.</LD>
<LD>   That was the one thing they were missing as they pursued their
third NBA title in a row their way, mailing in the season while
continuing to proclaim their greatness.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that was how they did it last spring so who was going
to tell them it wouldn't always work that way from now on?</LD>
<TE>   That would be the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Lakers were deemed "unbeatable," but if there's
one thing we've learned lately, that time is over. If you want to
know how they got into this predicament, it wasn't referees, flops or
poison burgers. They got themselves into it.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it hard to predict, or, as it proceeded to unfold,
difficult to see.</TE>
<TE>   It was that way from the get-go. In a preseason meeting, Coach
Phil Jackson asked his players to predict their win total. One by
one, they went to the board and wrote their numbers, running as high
as 73, which would have been a record, with a bunch in the 70s. The
lowest, says one of them, was 63.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they started 16-1, hit a lull, otherwise known as the
rest of the season, and finished 58-24, second in the Western
Conference. That's why they had to play Game 5 of the conference
finals in Arco Arena and have to go back for Game 7, in the event
they're still among us.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, things could be worse. Well, a little.</TE>
<TE>   "If you talk about surviving an earthquake, which definitely they
brought in Games 3 and 4, we feel stable now," forward Rick Fox said
Wednesday. "We were really pretty much blitzed ... and shaken and
gathered ourselves....</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we did a lot of those things that we needed to do in
Game 5 to give ourselves a chance to win, but the same thing that
makes you laugh makes you cry. Rob [Horry] hits a shot, [Mike] Bibby
hits a shot."</TE>
<TE>   And he who laughs last has a better summer than he who goes on
vacation crying.</TE>
<TE>   By the regular season's end, "unbeatable" had been replaced by
"vulnerable" as the operative adjective, even if the Lakers, and
everyone else, expected them to hit their magic switch.</TE>
<TE>   And besides, someone still had to be found who was big enough to
take them out.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio Spurs couldn't do it, but it wasn't like last
season's romp. Under pressure, rifts opened. The whole deal between
Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal looked as if it might melt down, after
Jackson zinged O'Neal in the media after Game 2 and they argued
during Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Anything might have happened if they had lost that one, but Kobe
Bryant bailed them out with his 11-point fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they knew they were better than the Kings, too, having
won six of their last seven in Arco.</TE>
<TE>   In March, with the Lakers moldering as far south as No. 4 in the
West, Jackson was asked how he planned to overhaul the Kings while
giving O'Neal his much-discussed time off. Jackson suggested, as
usual, it wasn't that big a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Kings] still haven't proven themselves as a real quality
road team yet," he said. "We know they're really solid on their home
court. They have a bandbox and they play in front of their fans very
well. They just got over .500 as a road team in this last month and I
think the jury's still out on them."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings then finished 13-5 on the road and ran away with the
West.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone one in L.A. lost any sleep over it. The Lakers
finished No. 2 last season, too, and then rocked the Spurs twice in
the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the Lakers won Game 1 in Arco. Then Bryant ate that
burger, Shaq was called for a couple of charges in Game 2 and they
lost.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they were coming home so what was the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, that was the problem.</TE>
<TE>   If this doesn't end well for them, the Lakers will wince when they
remember Game 3. O'Neal, who'd become serene as a buddha in first
quarters at Staples Center, paced himself through another one, taking
four shots, missing three, scoring two points, leaving late in the
period with the Kings up by 14.</TE>
<TE>   When he got back in early in the second quarter, the Kings were up
by 21, making it a little late for the Lakers to start playing.</TE>
<TE>   In the really bad news for the Lakers, Shaq came ready in Game 4,
scoring 10 points in the first quarter. The Kings didn't seem to
care, running up a 24-point lead before halftime, even if it got
away.</TE>
<TE>   The imp wasn't going back in the bottle. The Kings were tougher,
their confidence was soaring and then there was Bibby, considered
little more than competent before Peja Stojakovic was hurt,
opportunity dawned and stardom arrived.</TE>
<TE>   This was even a surprise to the Kings. After acquiring Bibby,
General Manager Geoff Petrie put off giving him a big-money
extension. As a consequence, Bibby, an upcoming restricted free
agent, will soon be working for an even bigger-money extension.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Kings will object to paying it, if the sight of
co-owner Gavin Maloof dancing on the press table after Game 5 offers
any clue to their state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very good team," said Fox. "I'll comment on how
impressed I am if they win the series....</TE>
<TE>   "Last year there really wasn't a team that competed to our level.
This year has been a little different in the sense that we're meeting
a team that plays a different style, is very good at what they do but
has made plays. They haven't wilted in stretches when we've made runs
at them. They've been there to make the kind of plays teams that have
been here before do....</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it has to do with the addition of Bibby, who's played
big basketball at the college level and is now rising to the occasion
of playing big and making big shots."</TE>
<TE>   Rising to meet the threat, Shaq has started to score in double
figures in the first quarter. The Lakers aren't done yet, even if
their cakewalking days are over, at least for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   Some years, it goes like this. Most years, as a matter of fact.
Last season was the aberration, the Lakers just learned.</TE>

<KH>GAME 6: SACRAMENTO AT LAKERS FRIDAY, 6:30 P.M., CH. 4</KH>
<HD>Lakers Retain Their Faith</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: On the verge of elimination by the Kings,
L.A. is optimistic because of its play in Game 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you thought the Lakers would be a little down about being one
defeat away from summer vacation after their one-point loss in Game 5
of the Western Conference finals at Sacramento on Tuesday, think
again.</LD>
<LD>   "We're feeling pretty good about ourselves because we feel that
we're back to playing Laker basketball," center Shaquille O'Neal said
after practice Wednesday at the Lakers' HealthSouth training facility
in El Segundo. "I think that we'll step up to the challenge."</LD>
<LD>   The challenge for the two-time defending NBA champions, who trail
three games to two, is simple. Win Game 6 at Staples Center Friday
night and then win Game 7 at Arco Areno Sunday, or go home.</LD>
<TE>   "We get excited about these type of challenges," said guard Kobe
Bryant, who's averaging 25.8 points but only 4.6 rebounds and three
assists while shooting 41.3% against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the type of team we are. We're not the type of team that
hangs their heads after a tough loss. That's not us, we get excited
about the next one."</TE>
<TE>   The main reason behind the confidence is that even though
Sacramento finished with the league's best record during the regular
season and is one victory from reaching the NBA Finals, the Lakers
still believe they are the better team.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson did not have a hard sell getting his players to
feel this way. After getting embarrassed in a Game 3 loss at home to
the Kings and then falling behind by 20 points in the first quarter
of Game 4, the Lakers feel that their overall play has improved over
the last seven quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Elimination is not the best place to be but ... we feel good
about how we're playing; we wish we could play today actually,"
Jackson said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding our way back as a basketball club where we feel
confident about what we're doing and how we're executing our game
plan. Our defense was good in the second half [in Game 5]."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Lakers lost a five-point lead in the game's final
minutes, they gain confidence from knowing that the Kings rallied
after O'Neal picked up his sixth foul with 3:22 remaining. Although
he was in foul trouble all game, O'Neal finished with 28 points,
seven rebounds and two blocked shots in 32 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the game and felt like we outplayed them," Jackson
said. "We put some pressure on them and got some things to go our way
but we just didn't finish it out.</TE>
<TE>   "[But we feel good] with just the way the game went last night.
Shaquille having the ability to get loose, get free and playing the
way we anticipate him playing; getting good play out of our team and
having an opportunity to win the game with 11 seconds to go."</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers also know that they still have some holes in their
game. Not only does it seem as if O'Neal and Bryant can't stay out of
foul trouble, but missing 13 of 17 three-point attempts as the Lakers
did Tuesday definitely does not get it done.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who said that only three of his six fouls in Game 5 were
credible, does not plan to let up on his assault on the Kings' big
men. Vlade Divac and Chris Webber did not put up much resistance on
Tuesday and Scot Pollard is getting less playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to get the ball and take high-percentage shots
like I've been taking. I want to continue to have a good game like I
did Tuesday night," said O'Neal, who attempted one free throw in Game
5. "Play aggressive and hopefully, I get to do what everyone else is
doing."</TE>
<TE>   With Sacramento playing a sagging-type defense that sometimes has
five players with at least one foot in the paint, O'Neal said that he
hasn't been forcing shots as he has in past playoffs. Partly because
of nagging injuries to his feet and hands but mainly because of the
Kings' ability to draw him into offensive fouls, O'Neal has been
looking to get more of his teammates involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been trying to keep everybody involved. Maybe I have to take
more shots," O'Neal said. "They've done a good job of doubling and
tripling Kobe and myself.... The other guys just have to step up and
hit a few shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's as much as what they're doing. It's more of
what we're doing. For example, four of 17 from three-point land. We
knock a couple of those shots down and it's a different game."</TE>

<HD>Steroid Problem Is Divisive Issue</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Management is in favor of drug testing, a stance
the players' union vehemently opposes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID and LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league baseball players and management agree that steroid use
is one of the biggest problems facing the sport, they just cannot
agree on how to fix it.</LD>
<LD>   And that's a luxury they might not be able to afford anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball has lagged behind the NFL and NBA in efforts to crack
down on steroid use but recent revelations by former stars Ken
Caminiti and Jose Canseco may force the league to act and prompt the
union to soften its long-standing opposition to testing.</LD>
<TE>   "Is that possible? I don't know, but the way the situation has
exploded now it probably should," agent Tony Attanasio said. "With
the apparent rampant use of steroids, maybe it's time to take a more
comprehensive approach."</TE>
<TE>   Caminiti told Sports Illustrated he used steroids during 1996,
when he was selected the National League most valuable player for the
San Diego Padres, adding, "At least half the guys are using
steroids." In a radio interview, Canseco estimated that 85% of major
leaguers use steroids, and said he planned to write a book about drug
use in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who believe Caminiti and Canseco are overstating the
scope of steroid use acknowledge there is a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there is some usage," Dodger physician Frank Jobe said.
"There are some athletes using it [in the majors], but I haven't seen
any suggestion that those numbers are correct."</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office included a drug-testing proposal in its
latest offer to the Players Assn., but the union has strongly opposed
testing and is not expected to change its stance during negotiations
for a new collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball definitely needs to be more proactive, and in my
judgment that requires testing," Commissioner Bud Selig said. "We
have a program that includes education and testing in the minors. But
in the best interests of the health and welfare of major league
players, we need to do testing."</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Greg Bouris declined to discuss the group's
position on testing, and responded only generally to the steroid
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that has been raised in collective bargaining,
and it will continue to be discussed as the process unfolds," he
said. "The association regards the issue as a serious and complicated
one, and will treat those discussions accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   Players, meanwhile, accuse owners of failing to do what they can
to promote testing or discourage steroid use because it's not in
their best interest: As players got bigger and stronger, fans reveled
in the explosion of home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say you go out there and hit .270 with 12 homers and 50 or
60 [runs batted in]," Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Then the
next year, you come out and hit .320 with 45 homers. Do you really
think the front office is going to say, 'Well, he's using steroids.
We've got to release him.' It just doesn't happen like that.</TE>
<TE>   "In baseball and sports, it's a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately
world. Do you think the baseball owners and the baseball fans who
worship these guys really care if they use steroids? Maybe some
people do, but the majority, if a guy hits 60 home runs, are just
happy he did. It's all about the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brewer first baseman Richie Sexson agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a guy on your team who hits 50 homers with 140
[RBIs], nobody is really going to want to say anything," he said. "If
he does that and you win the World Series, then you know no one is
saying anything."</TE>
<TE>   General managers and managers are reluctant to discuss steroid
use, but some believe that unless steroids are banned, players should
not be criticized for trying to improve their performance.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's a dead issue unless you make it a rule," said Brewer
Manager Jerry Royster, who spent parts of 16 seasons in the majors.
"Don't get on a guy for doing something to make himself better if
it's not against the rules. To be honest, until they make it a rule,
I don't care what anybody does."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball contends it educates big leaguers on the dangers of
steroids, which increase muscle mass by elevating the body's
testosterone. Players are informed about the risks of heart and liver
damage, strokes and sexual dysfunction, among other things, during
counseling sessions in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike players in the majors, minor league baseball players are
tested for the substance--illegal in the United States unless
prescribed by a physician for medical reasons. Under the policy,
players also undergo testing for other human-growth and stimulant
drugs, including ephedrine and amphetamines.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball also differs from other leagues, such as the
NFL, which is considered to be at the forefront of steroid testing.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL began with an annual steroid test during training camp in
1987, collecting the results for informational purposes, before
implementing a suspension penalty to those who failed the one test in
1989.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the NFL ushered in year-round random testing--penalty for
a first violation was a four-game suspension--without formal approval
of the NFL Players' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It was done in the best interests of the players, and the fact it
was not challenged by them showed they believe in it," said Greg
Aiello, vice president of public relations for the NFL. "One of the
comments we heard from a player was, 'Thanks for eliminating guards
in a bottle.'"</TE>
<TE>   Seven to eight players per team are tested each week during the
season and there are periodic off-season tests, Aiello said. The
testing resulted in three four-game suspensions last year: Chicago
defensive tackle Henry Taylor, Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs and
Detroit safety Tommy Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   There were no positive tests in 2000, but four in 1999: Chicago
quarterback Jim Miller, New York Jet nose tackle Jason Ferguson, New
York Giant special teams player Lyle West and San Francisco running
back Travis Jervey.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning July 1, the NFL will also begin testing players for
ephedrine and those who test positive will be subject to the same
penalties as steroid users.</TE>
<TE>   In the NBA, steroids are a prohibited substance. Rookies are
subject to random tests once during their final 15 days in training
camp and three times during the season. Veterans can be randomly
tested either during the final 15 days of training camp or during
their first 15 days after reporting to the team.</TE>
<TE>   If the NBA declares reasonable cause for a player to be tested and
an independent expert agrees, any player is subject to four tests
during a six-week span.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty for one positive test is a five-game suspension. It
escalates to 10 games for a second violation and 25 games for a
third. If a veteran player is convicted or pleads guilty to a crime
involving the use or possession of steroids, he will be dismissed
from the league for a minimum of two years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite union opposition, Selig's office hopes to extend an
anti-steroid policy to the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important issue from our standpoint, it has been
long before the recent media attention we're seeing right now about
it, and it's a topic we've been working on for some time," said Rob
Manfred, baseball's executive vice president of labor relations. "We
included a comprehensive proposal on drug testing, including
steroids, to [the union] in February as part of our formal offer.
They have not made a response yet."</TE>
<TE>   Caminiti's and Canseco's allegations have accomplished one thing.
No one in baseball can claim to be unaware of steroid use any longer.</TE>
<TE>   "When clubs say, 'Wow! We're shocked by all this,' the truth is
they've known about it for years," said Attanasio, the agent. "Ever
since they started taking blood tests as part of spring physicals,
they've been aware of [which] players are actively involved in
substance use. Whether they've taken action or not is another matter,
but the point is that they've known about it. I've had clubs call me
for years and say this player or that player showed up with possible
liver problems and may be involved in [steroid use]."</TE>

<HD>Asian Embrace Warms Cup</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Japan and South Korea are hosts, but the entire
continent is excited about tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Most of the world has never heard of Tran Thien, but to judge by what
he has been up to lately, Tran Thien has certainly heard of the rest
of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Thien is a potter by trade, one who hails from the village of Bat
Trang on the outskirts of Hanoi, Vietnam. What his hands have been
shaping during the last few weeks and months are small porcelain
figurines that he sells for about $1.30 apiece.</LD>
<LD>   It's not the price that makes them hot sellers, it's the subject.</LD>
<TE>   In a country that is mad about soccer and especially the World
Cup, which kicks into gear Friday when defending champion France
plays Senegal in the opening game, Thien has found a way to cash in
on the fervor.</TE>
<TE>   He has made and sold hundreds of tiny replicas of England's David
Beckham, Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta, Brazil's Ronaldo and many of
the other players whose names are likely to decorate the sports
headlines during the monthlong extravaganza.</TE>
<TE>   This World Cup differs from the 16 that preceded it in two
significant ways: It is the first to take place in Asia and it is the
first to be jointly staged by two countries--South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The region has taken the 32-nation tournament to heart and has
imbued it with a color and flavor all its own. Even countries that
failed to qualify have found ways to be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   There, at Klong Prem prison in Bangkok, those in charge of keeping
the peace have come up with a unique way of doing so. They have
organized a soccer tournament of their own, dividing the inmates into
teams by nationality and staging their own "World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the "host nation" Thailand, China, England, Germany
and Nigeria will all be involved in what surely must be the only
soccer tournament where no one wants to be in goal.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand is also the home of Umawadee Siriaksorn, one of many
fortune tellers and tarot card readers recently asked by Thai
newspapers to separate the World Cup winners from the losers.</TE>
<TE>   "Italy, France, Germany, Argentina and Brazil will fare well,"
Umawadee said, "but ultimately France will win because it drew the
sun card."</TE>
<TE>   Zinedine Zidane will be pleased.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane, the elegant and influential midfielder who led France to
the title four years ago in Paris, has been sidelined by a muscle
tear in his thigh and will sit out Friday's opener and possibly other
games too.</TE>
<TE>   The loss hurts France's chance of becoming the first nation since
Brazil in 1962 to repeat as champion. Others favored in the May
31-June 30 event are Argentina, Italy, Brazil, England and Portugal,
the first of three teams the U.S. will face when it opens play June
5.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, meanwhile, was thrown off track a little itself this week
when French-born starting midfielder Khalilou Fadiga was caught on a
security camera allegedly trying to liberate a $240 gold necklace
from a jewelry store in Daegu, South Korea. He faces criminal charges
but will be allowed to compete.</TE>
<TE>   The opening match pits France against one of its former colonies,
but there is goodwill between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Senegal's players play professionally in the French
league, while one of France's standout players, Patrick Vieira, was
born in Senegal.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira will be taking over the playmaking role from Zidane.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to live with it because there's nothing we can do,"
Vieira said of Zidane's injury. "Injuries can happen to anyone,
anytime. But we can still win without him."</TE>
<TE>   Among the visitors in the sellout crowd at Seoul's World Cup
stadium Friday evening will be Japan's Prince Takamado and his wife,
Princess Hisako.</TE>
<TE>   The pair arrived Wednesday, the first members of Japanese imperial
family to make an official visit to Korea since the end of World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament, evenly split between the host nations, will
feature 64 matches and will climax with the championship final on
June 30 at Yokohama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the 1,093-foot Tokyo Tower, a city landmark for almost
half a century, probably no longer will be lit up in blue, the color
worn by Japan's World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Neither host nation is expected to go very far in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Both, however, will be more than pleased if the event passes
without the hooliganism that has marred previous World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   And if it does, Japanese railway workers can go back to freeing
the stones along their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   They had glued them down to prevent them being used as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In Asia, the build-up to the World Cup has been strange, to say
the least.</TE>

<HD>Council District Plans Would Cross the Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH GALANTER</AU>
<BD>Ruth Galanter represents the 6th District on the Los
Angeles City Council, which includes parts of the Westside and
Crenshaw.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If disenchantment with Los Angeles city government has people in the
San Fernando Valley on the verge of secession, wait until they get a
load of what's happening with redistricting.</LD>
<LD>   In order to ensure equal representation, the Los Angeles City
Council redraws its political map after each decennial census. It
always has been a crass process, more about incumbency and personal
agendas than what the community really wants or needs.</LD>
<LD>   This year, things were supposed to be better. Instead, they got
much worse. And despite the rhetoric of those running the
redistricting show, the most negative effects will be felt in the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Part of a new day in Los Angeles politics, the new City Charter
called for a citizen commission to hold an open process of
redistricting and to forward to the full City Council a proposed map
that incorporated community needs and desires for effective and
sensible representation.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the citizens commission, appointed by elected
officials, dutifully held hearings throughout the city, solicited
public input, listened carefully and then promptly ignored the wishes
of the community when those wishes conflicted with their own.</TE>
<TE>   Communities from across the city testified. Van Nuys residents
asked to keep Cindy Miscikowski as their councilwoman but will lose
her to the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Sun Valley asked to be kept in a single council
district; they will be split between what remains of the 2nd District
with Wendy Gruel and a new 6th District.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester and Venice constituents asked to stay in my district
but will find themselves in the 11th District with Miscikowski. In
fact, all of my 240,000 current constituents will have a new
representative--in the 11th, 10th or 5th districts.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, the political musical chairs game is even worse. By
next year, tens of thousands of Valley residents will have had four
different council members in two years: Joel Wachs, Greuel, me and
whoever wins the spring 2003 election for my current seat.</TE>
<TE>   There is a better way.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council can approve the new district lines but require
them to take effect after the next round of elections--in 2003--as is
also done with congressional boundaries. Fewer voters would suffer
unexpected changes, ongoing projects could be completed and elections
would take place on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   It would be simple, more efficient and far less confusing--all
qualities that Valley residents find too often lacking in Los Angeles
government.</TE>
<TE>   City government is going to have to demonstrate that even
reapportionment is really about the people and not just about the
politicians.</TE>

<HD>Apocalyptic Tales Can Come True</HD>
<DH>From Verne to Clancy, authors have prophesized the
unthinkable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So what will the Big One be like? Will it be like a hunt for a "loose
nuke," as in the new movie "The Sum of All Fears," based on the Tom
Clancy novel? Or will it be an atomic barrage, between, say, India
and Pakistan--an exchange that analysts say could kill 12million
people?</LD>
<LD>   Throughout history, works of imagination--written and filmed--have
helped ordinary people anticipate future events, including future
conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   During the Cold War, when new technology offered a not-so-distant
early warning that human action could bring the world to an end,
millions of people became involved in test ban and arms control
causes. They were inspired in part by novels such as Nevil Shute's
"On the Beach" (1957), Peter George's "Red Alert" (1958) and Eugene
Burdick and Harvey Wheeler's "Fail Safe" (1962). These books were
turned into apocalypse-portending movies as well; "Red Alert" became
the lethally funny "Dr. Strangelove."</LD>
<TE>   But did all this popular reading and movie-watching help? It's
impossible to unbraid the tapestry of the past, but since we got
through the Cold War without firing a nuclear shot in anger, it's
hard to deny that whatever we did, we worked it out well enough.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, continued pressure from national and international public
opinion helped spur the U.S. and Russia this month to sign a
two-thirds reduction in their nuclear arsenals over the coming
decade, further lightening the atomic shadow of the last
half-century.</TE>
<TE>   But other kinds of threats, not all of them nuclear, continue to
lurk.</TE>
<TE>   The question before humanity is whether the doom-laden
speculations of fantasists will become the gory death-plans of
madmen--and then, whether society can look ahead and forestall such
horror shows.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the record of looking ahead is not encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   French author Jules Verne imagined chemical warfare--"asphyxiation
bombs"--in his 1889 short story, "In the Twenty-Ninth Century." Yet,
disastrously, his own countrymen didn't think to factor this warning
into their own war planning. They were clueless when the Germans used
gas clouds on World War I's Western Front 26 years later. Perhaps it
might have been some consolation to those gassed soldiers that, after
the fact, chemical warfare was banned and has mostly stayed banned
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, bans can be broken as new situations arise.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, based in Los Angeles, recently
reported that a West Bank Palestinian militant, arrested by the
Israelis on May 9, confessed to plans to add cyanide, made in
clandestine local labs, to suicide belt-bombs. And near Mexico City,
truck hijackers made off with nearly 10 tons of sodium cyanide on May
10. Most, but not all, of this toxic cargo has now been recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to chemical weapons, biological killers have long been
a fictional preoccupation, as seen in stories such as H.G. Wells'
"The Stolen Bacillus" (1895) and in movies such as Terry Gilliam's
"Twelve Monkeys" (1995).</TE>
<TE>   And yet with a century's worth of advance warning, how good a job
have the nations of the world done in preparing for a future
bio-strike?</TE>
<TE>   If last fall's mail-borne anthrax attacks are any indicator, even
small assaults can wreak huge amounts of economic, psychic and
physical damage. Congress just passed a $4.6-billion
anti-bioterrorism bill, which would allocate $640million to produce
and stockpile smallpox vaccines.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe the emerging science of the human genome is about to
leapfrog the old mechanisms of biodefense.</TE>
<TE>   Who says so? One possible prophet is Walter Mosley, best known for
his Easy Rawlins crime novels. Last year, Mosley published
"Futureland: Nine Stories of an Imminent World." In one of his tales,
set in the middle of this century, war escalates from nukes to
race-based viruses. One bug, Mosley writes, "was 100% fatal and
everybody got it; everybody but those with at least 12.5% African
Negro DNA."</TE>
<TE>   The notion of a disease targeted against a specific ethnic group
is abhorrent on every level. Americans have not even begun a
discussion about dealing with such a threat. Yet as history proves,
if somebody can think up a weapon, somebody else will think up a way
to use it.</TE>
<TE>   And it's everybody's responsibility to help fend it off.</TE>

<HD>Wrong, as a Matter of Law</HD>
<DH>FBI agent Coleen Rowley ignores our constitutional rights
in her memo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley teaches constitutional law at George
Washington University and has served as counsel in a variety of
national security and espionage cases.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The media and the public love a reformer. This may explain the
reaction this week to a 13-page letter from FBI agent Coleen Rowley
criticizing the investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   Rowley has been portrayed by national publications like Time
magazine in almost breathless terms as a cross between Martin Luther
and Annie Oakley.</LD>
<LD>   What is astonishing is how little of her memo actually has been
read or quoted beyond its most sensational suggestions, like the
notion that Rowley and her colleagues might have been able to prevent
one or more of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Rowley's criticism of the FBI largely turns on disagreement over
the meaning of probable cause. Rowley insists that there was probable
cause to secure a search warrant for Moussaoui's computer and
personal effects. The FBI headquarters disagreed, and it was right.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 15, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested by the Immigration and
Nationalization Service on a charge of overstaying his visa. At that
time, the Minnesota office only had an "overstay" prisoner and a
suspicion from an agent that he might be a terrorist because of his
religious beliefs and flight training. If this hunch amounted to
probable cause, it is hard to imagine what would not satisfy such a
standard.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley believes that the FBI was wrong because a warrant was
ultimately signed on Sept. 11 after the attacks. That warrant
contained the same information that was deemed insufficient before
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley rejects the notion that the attacks in any way "improved or
changed" the basis for probable cause. In her view, if probable cause
existed on Sept. 11, it must have existed before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   This is simply wrong as a matter of law. The attacks were
obviously material to establishing probable cause against Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley also places importance on a French report that "confirmed
[Moussaoui's] radical fundamentalist Islamic" affiliations. This
report was extremely vague and discounted by the FBI and other
intelligence and foreign agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Rowley notes that suspicions in her Minnesota field
office were magnified by Moussaoui's refusal to permit a search. But
Moussaoui's assertion of a constitutional right cannot be used as a
"signal [that] he had something to hide."</TE>
<TE>   What emerges from the memo is a disturbing view of constitutional
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley states that she believed that agents should not have been
deterred in their interrogations by Moussaoui's invocation of his
right to remain silent and to have counsel. Instead, she suggests
that a limited "public safety exception" should be expanded to
virtually negate those protections of the 6th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The Rowley memo does contain some new and important information.
One such fact relates to the use of a controversial secret court that
is little known to most Americans.</TE>
<TE>   It has long been suspected that agents have used the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act court in cases where they lack evidence
to secure a constitutional warrant. Viewed by many as
unconstitutional, the FISA court allows the government to search
citizens without a showing of probable cause. The citizens never know
that their homes and computers were the subject of a search.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, this court cannot be used as an alternative to
a conventional warrant simply because there is insufficient evidence
to meet the constitutional standard.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, however, confirms this unlawful practice. When it was
determined that the Minnesota office lacked probable cause, she
suggested that it simply file for a FISA secret search as a tactical
option.</TE>
<TE>   We are gradually shifting searches from the 4th Amendment process
to a secret court that is neither mentioned nor consistent with the
Constitution. This is the one aspect of the memo that has received no
attention in the media or in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The Rowley memo is now being used to support reforms announced
Wednesday by the FBI. Ironically, these "reforms" cut back on
"reforms" implemented after such scandals as the Richard Jewell and
Wen Ho Lee investigations. Those abusive investigations involved
hunches that were allowed to mutate into full investigations with
disastrous consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do such investigations produce terrible abuses, but they
diminish the agency's effectiveness and resources in pursuing more
substantial leads.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Rowley's criticisms of the FBI incompetence are well-
established. There is need for structural reform, but we should not
allow the FBI to "reform" itself into a prior image.</TE>

<HD>Deliver Us Not Into This Particular Sex Scandal Case</HD>
<DH>In church furor, don't confuse pedophilia with adult
homosexuality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the plaintiffs in every frenzy of high-profile lawsuits, there
often seem to be a few charlatans masquerading as victims.</LD>
<LD>   This is happening to the Catholic Church in the current sexual
abuse scandal, which has spanned decades and continents.</LD>
<LD>   The latest accuser is Paul Marcoux, 54, who is claiming to have
been sexually assaulted by the now retired-in-disgrace archbishop of
Milwaukee. Marcoux's "case" is a blight on the cause of retribution
for the innocent and threatens to further muddy the distinction
between pedophilia and homosexuality and between abuse and consent.</LD>
<TE>   Amid all the talk of betrayed trust, few critics have made the
obvious and all-important distinction between the many cases of child
abuse--wherein priests molested underage boys--that have come to
light, and this case, in which a 30-year-old graduate student appears
to have entered into an adult, consensual homosexual relationship
with another grown man.</TE>
<TE>   Need we reiterate that pedophilia and homosexuality are not the
same thing? One is a crime and a sickness, the other is not.
Homosexuals are not pedophiles. There was no child involved in this
case and no crime. No sickness. Just indiscretion.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland broke his vow of celibacy and,
horror of horrors, turned out to be a homosexual. That's the extent
of the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   To the church, this would have been eminently worth paying
$450,000 to cover up. Marcoux received this sum four years ago as a
settlement on condition he sign a confidentiality agreement that said
he would never speak of the matter again.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but here Marcoux is speaking freely and loudly on television
and to newspaper reporters, breaking his contract without a thought.
What good are such contracts if they can be broken with such preening
alacrity? Is no one concerned about Marcoux's character? His
greediness? His dishonesty?</TE>
<TE>   The church has grounds to sue him for the cash dispensed, but it
is unlikely to do so because that would be perceived as blaming the
"victim," and Rome has enough to worry about right now.</TE>
<TE>   But just who was the victim here?</TE>
<TE>   If you perused the published letter that Weakland wrote to Marcoux
back in 1980, when the two were allegedly involved, you'll find that
it sounds a lot like Marcoux, far from being assaulted, had a
relationship with Weakland and may even have entered into that
relationship with the sole purpose of trying to wring money from
church coffers to finance a project he was working on called
"Christodrama."</TE>
<TE>   The problem came, apparently, when Weakland didn't come up with
enough money. Consider this passage from the 11-page handwritten
letter, which surfaced this month:</TE>
<TE>   "Paul, I really have given you all that I personally possess. The
$14,000 is really my personal limit: it was the money I got from my
community when I became a bishop, and I simply do not have private
funds. What I can now do personally to help you will be minimal. I
know you are pushing me for church money, for some sort of church
support for the Midwest Institute of Christodrama. I feel you are
putting me in an impossible situation here. I consider all that
church money as a sacred trust; it represents the offerings of
faithful and I must be accountable to them for how it is all
spent.... I simply do not see how I can authorize money for your
project. It is not because I don't love you."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Marcoux's game or Weakland's weaknesses, this case should
not and must not be lumped together with all the others.</TE>
<TE>   First, because Marcoux was an adult at the time of the alleged
abuse. He was not a child. There was no pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   Second, because according to the evidence that has surfaced, there
was no sexual assault but merely a consensual relationship that,
according to Weakland's letter, it seems Marcoux pursued. Weakland
writes: "You had made me promise earlier not to withdraw [apparently
from a planned trip to Nantucket] but how to open up to you? I was
frightened to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Does this sound like abuse? Assault?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, Paul Marcoux violated his confidentiality agreement
by speaking publicly about something he agreed, for a handsome sum,
never to talk about.</TE>
<TE>   So let's bang the gavel on this and give our attention to one of
the many worthier cases.</TE>

<LD>Does California really need the advisory board to the Bureau of Home
Furnishing, if it still exists? Is there a legitimate role for the
Strawberry Processing Council when there's also a California
Strawberry Council? The Celery Research Advisory Board?</LD>
<LD>   The state has more than 400 boards, commissions, authorities and
councils in addition to some 150 regular state agencies and
departments. The boards and commissions--most of them advisory
only--consist of nearly 4,000 members, most of them appointed by the
governor.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) wants to establish a
commission to study the labyrinth of state government and report back
in 2005 with a plan for "realigning or closing outdated or
ineffective and inefficient governmental agencies, bureaucracies,
boards and commissions."</LD>
<TE>   The report would go to the governor and Legislature for acceptance
or rejection without amendment. McClintock got the idea from the
federal commission formed to recommend the closing of surplus
military bases around the country.</TE>
<TE>   As with Congress and individual bases, state legislators protect
their favorite agencies from elimination or consolidation. Putting
all the bad eggs in one basket dissipates the political shield.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good idea. The Legislature should pass the measure and send
it to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature. The bill, SB 1428, passed
the Senate this week by a vote of 33 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   But McClintock's proposed eight-member commission should do more
than just look for places to save a buck. It should also look for
ways that government can serve the public better. A commission must
not just consider the Dry Bean and Avocado advisory boards but major
agencies like the duplicative and overlapping Department of Personnel
Management and the State Personnel Board.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first attempt to streamline government. California
long has had its Little Hoover Commission, which seeks efficiency and
economy, and has had various sunset laws to end programs and
agencies, with scant success. The Legislature's Joint Legislative
Sunset Review Committee has done valuable work. But the base-closure
approach might work where others have failed because lawmakers
wouldn't have to take the blame for cutting programs dear to special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   One other point: McClintock is so stingy with the public's tax
money he's proposing to limit the commission to $250,000 in the first
year and $500,000 over its lifetime of two to three years. That's
about enough for an office, an executive director and a few low-paid
aides. It may take a bigger bureaucracy than that to really attack
the bureaucracy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While narco-guerrillas and paramilitary armies burned voting
materials in distant rural areas, millions of Colombians lined up in
scorching heat and soaking rain Sunday to reaffirm their commitment
to democracy by electing a new president. Defying violent
intimidation, the people showed their resilience. But in selecting
conservative Alvaro Uribe--who campaigned on a promise to get tough
on the terrorists who had kept the country at war for almost four
decades--they also showed that their patience was thin.</LD>
<LD>   For almost four years, President Andres Pastrana tried to bring
peace by negotiating with Colombia's leftist rebels. The experiment
failed. The Switzerland-size piece of land ceded by the government
was used by the guerrillas to produce illegal drugs, launch
offensives on civilians, hide kidnapped citizens and stash weapons
bought with drug money. Not once did the rebel leadership sit down
with the government to discuss peace. The electorate's message to
Uribe: Restore order and return this country to civility. Pronto.</LD>
<LD>   Which is, of course, easier said than done. Colombia's economy is
stagnant and its external debt hovers around $40 billion.
Unemployment is about 20%, and half the population of about 42
million lives in poverty. Meanwhile, the guerrillas have paralyzed
much of the country's economic activity by continuing to blow up oil
pipelines, bridges and roads.</LD>
<TE>   Uribe, whose inauguration is in three months, has yet to send the
United States an official wish list. But he has made clear that he
wants to keep alive the trade pact that eliminates tariffs on certain
products from Andean countries. He's also seeking a continuation of
American military aid, but, like Pastrana, would like the U.S. to
lift the restriction that it be used only to fight drugs. This makes
sense, as it is impossible to separate guerrilla narco-trafficking
from guerrilla war.</TE>
<TE>   Critics vaguely accuse Uribe of ties to paramilitary groups, but
by surrounding himself with such respected people as former national
Police Chief Rosso Jose Serrano and Vice President and former civic
leader Francisco Santos and by keeping Luis Alberto Moreno as
ambassador to the U.S., Uribe bolsters his legitimacy. Now his
actions must prove that he stands as opposed to the paramilitary
armies as he does to leftist drug terrorists.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nate Holden is certainly beyond shame and, due to term limits, beyond
the reach of Los Angeles voters for his blatant influence- peddling
at City Hall. But his constituents and his colleagues on the City
Council should be wary of who comes next.</LD>
<LD>   The councilman, who for years railed against liquor stores and
bars in South Los Angeles because of their tendency to generate
crime, apparently has no problem pushing plans for new bars and
nightclubs in Koreatown, on the northern edge of his district. As
local retail and service businesses faltered after the 1992 riots,
liquor filled the void. More than 40 zoning permits allowing alcohol
sales have been granted in the Koreatown portion of Holden's district
in the last five years alone. With Holden supporters--and registered
voters--concentrated elsewhere in the district, the councilman did
not need to fear voter retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   Liquor businesses are not automatically allowed under city zoning
codes. Support from the council member of the involved district is
often critical to approval, and Holden lobbied hard for his
colleagues' votes.</LD>
<TE>   Case in point: a huge nightclub called Le Prive, which doesn't
open until 9 p.m., and then for only selected big spenders. The
cheapest drink is a $200 bottle of whiskey. Hardly the "family-style"
restaurant Holden's aide represented to nervous council members and
city regulators before final council approval was granted in early
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood around Le Prive, at Western Avenue and Wilshire
Boulevard, now has twice as many liquor establishments as state
guidelines call for. Koreatown residents blame the bars, karaoke
clubs and pool halls for the late-night robberies and other
alcohol-fueled violence that make the area one of the city's most
crime-ridden.</TE>
<TE>   So what's in this for Holden? Times staff writer Peter Y. Hong has
detailed a long list of quid pro quos from grateful nightclub owners:
generous campaign contributions to Holden and his son, who lost an
election campaign to become Pasadena's mayor, a $15,000 interest-free
loan to a Holden deputy, even a $12,000 gold watch for the
councilman. Holden has a history of playing fast and loose with
campaign rules. The Los Angeles Ethics Commission has found that
during his career he has taken money beyond permissible campaign
limits 334 times, for a total of $164,789.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of "the-rules-don't-apply-to-moi" imperiousness is not
confined to Holden. Think of Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria
Molina's permit problem. She and her husband built a swimming pool at
their Mount Washington home without obtaining a city permit or paying
the necessary fees and ignored city requirements that they upgrade a
retaining wall near the pool. But Molina's hubris pales before
Holden's outstretched palm.</TE>
<TE>   Holden's last term ends next year. But if he is able to anoint a
successor who will follow his advice and share his disregard for
constituents, he will hardly be forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Holden's fellow City Council members, who too often blindly
support colleagues' zoning decisions, are also part of the problem.
The presence of new members on the council offers a chance to adjust
this practice. Lawmakers new and old should temper their deference to
colleagues on zoning matters with more regard for the good of the
city.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Refusal to Extradite Criminals</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Killers Slip Away to Mexico," May 27: Mexico refuses to extradite
wanted murderers, rapists and other criminals to the U.S., does
nothing to stop the flow of drugs or people across our border and
evicts American retirees from their beachfront properties, but at the
same time wants us to open our border and legalize millions of its
citizens who broke our immigration laws? Clearly, Mexican officials
are exacting a methodical revenge for past historical events by
slowly but surely eating away at the sovereignty of the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The shocking thing is that the U.S. continues to appease a country
that has complete contempt for us, that demands much and gives little
in return. Our foreign policy with the rest of the world is generally
quite reasonable, but Mexico always seems to make us look like a deer
caught in the headlights.</LD>

<TE>   Your article touches on an issue that has concerned me since I
crossed into Mexico a couple of months ago at Otay Mesa, an
alternative to the incredibly busy Tijuana crossing a few miles to
the west. I was dropped off by a friend on the U.S. side and walked
(pulling my suitcase) through a deserted, open expanse of concrete
with a high turnstile that afforded one-way access into Mexico. To my
amazement, I encountered not a single Mexican or American until a
group of taxi drivers appeared, one of whom drove me to the Tijuana
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Back in California, I phoned the Border Patrol to point out that I
could have been a fugitive with a body in my suitcase--or worse.
Their response was, "What goes into Mexico is their problem, not
ours." At a time when we are supposedly on national alert, this seems
to me a hell of a way to run a railroad.</TE>

<LD>"A Policy In From the Cold" (Opinion, May 26) is truly remarkable. If
President Bush's foreign policy is a return to the Cold War
mentality, why was he in Russia embracing the leader of Russia? And
what was wrong with a foreign policy in Bush's first six months in
office that reversed course from the Clinton years, since the Clinton
years had no discernible foreign policy?</LD>
<LD>   For all of his moral shortcomings as president, Clinton's biggest
failure was in foreign policy. The world was a much more dangerous
place for the United States when Clinton left office than it was when
he entered office. Bush is repairing that damage quickly with a very
experienced team. William Arkin's opinion piece is remarkable for his
inability to perceive the big-picture differences between Bush and
Clinton in foreign policy.</LD>

<TE>   Although Bush was successful in concluding a nuclear arms
reduction with Russia, he was unsuccessful in persuading Russian
President Vladimir Putin to stop supplying Iran with nuclear
potential. It is no secret that Iran is actively supplying terrorist
groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas with sophisticated weaponry. What
is to prevent Iran from supplying these terrorist groups with nuclear
weaponry?</TE>

<LD>Re "Agency Won't Back Off Assisted Suicide Ruling," May 25: Justice
Department lawyers declared that there is not "a legitimate medical
purpose" to physician-prescribed suicide, which Oregon voters passed
as law on two separate occasions. The law prescribes that two
physicians must concur that death is imminent, within six months, and
the patient must be of sound mind.</LD>
<LD>   What about a legitimate humanitarian purpose? It seems that Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft has his own agenda regarding states' rights.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Visitors Bureau Spent Lavishly," May 25: For people not familiar
with the convention business, it seems that the spending is indeed
"lavish." However, if you want to compete in the convention market
with an inferior package such as Los Angeles, you need to do
extraordinary things just to get attention. L.A. has been a "near
last choice" for conventions for years. The competition from San
Francisco, Anaheim, San Diego and Las Vegas for the western cycle of
convention groups outranks L.A. in every category. Even Honolulu has
entered the arena with a much better package.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel situation in Los Angeles is totally unsatisfactory for
major conventions and an overwhelming negative to bringing large
groups to the city. It is a tribute to the bureau that anyone books
L.A. at all. Without a major convention hotel near the center, L.A.
will continue to lag behind the rest of the West and the Convention
Center will depend more and more on local shows that bring few
overnight visitors to the city.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Jack Weiss does not understand "the logic of showing
someone a good time at a fancy foreign location." On a foreign
mission, you obviously cannot entertain at home. Maybe he should go
on a mission and help promote Los Angeles with dinner at McDonald's.
He will quickly realize that he would be the only one chewing on a
Big Mac!</LD>

<LD>Re "Our Bookshelves, Our Selves," by Susan Giesberg, Opinion, May 26:
What a delightful account of a sweet, older woman who so enjoyed and
used her public library. This mini-biography only confirms my
long-held suspicion that the people who create the graffiti in our
public library books are "sweet old ladies and gentlemen" who cannot
resist reading with a pencil (or even marking pens) so they can mark
their territory with checks, underlines, margin comments and grammar
and spelling corrections.</LD>
<LD>   These stealth destroyers of public property should be banned from
the use of our great libraries, but no one can catch them. They and
the others who cut up our books to take out the part or photo they
want are worse than the people who just take the books outright. This
article just confirms what happens to selfish, probably retired
teachers, editors and proofreaders. They don't just fade away, they
leave their marks in our public libraries for the rest of us to
erase.</LD>

<LD>Re "You Can't Be on the Phone and in the Moment," Voices, May 25:
Since his father died suddenly 14 months ago, our son has voluntarily
called me every day, twice a day, morning and evening. He calls while
in the grocery checkout line, the school auditorium, the gas
station--wherever and whenever he can on his cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   He manages a large business and is a single parent of three
children who does the laundry, the cooking, the home maintenance,
supervises homework, etc., so I appreciate that he can and does take
advantage of any moment he can to communicate with me. I think
Christopher Nyerges should look at the broader picture before
labeling cell-phone users "zombies."</LD>

<LD>It was interesting to read "Thrill Rides' G-Forces Also Being Felt in
Court" (May 27), about the brain and G-forces. However, I found it
strange that it did not say that sports (such as boxing, hockey,
football and even basketball) where intentional or accidental impacts
create many times greater G-forces than those at roller coasters lead
sometimes to sad consequences. Look, for instance, at Muhammad Ali,
or other boxers. No doubt, human tolerance toward G-forces is
limited, while greed is not.</LD>

<LD>Re "Moussaoui Memo Says FBI Stalled Probe After Attacks," May 27: I
have just read the redacted letter sent by Coleen Rowley to FBI
Director Robert Mueller.</LD>
<LD>   While we were told by Mueller and the White House that 9/11 came
as such a surprise, and yet not told that a supervising special agent
at FBI headquarters had almost single-handedly thwarted any
possibility of preventing the tragedy, it strains credulity for the
FBI to have actually promoted the same supervisor after 9/11. Who was
he protecting? The next man up the chain? Or the next?</LD>
<LD>   One hates to use the term "cover-up" when this term has been so
abused, but I can think of no other term to adequately describe
post-9/11 actions, statements and reactions by the Bush spokesmen,
top FBI officials and particularly the Justice Department under Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft. That Rowley even relayed jokes that a mole or
double agent could have done no more damage than this single
supervising special agent is telling.</LD>
<TE>   Prior to this disclosure, I was sleeping pretty well at night,
thinking our administration officials were on top of things. It seems
all they were on top of was political damage control. I'm sleeping
with one eye open tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sadler</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't wait to hear the Republicans in Congress and in the Bush
administration question the motives and patriotism of the FBI agents
in Phoenix and Minneapolis, as they have every other person who has
dared to criticize or to question anything the administration has
done.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they will simply release another spate of terror alerts to
distract us from their mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Pat Joy</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When outgoing Clinton White House staffer Sandy Berger was filling
in incoming Bush staffer Condoleezza Rice on the intricacies of his
job, he showed her a huge pile of Al Qaeda documentation and told her
that she would be spending more time on this issue than any other.
But, alas, such was not to be, as the new Bush administration scaled
back Bill Clinton's emphasis on counter-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes Rowley with her explosive memo to Mueller, wherein she
states that interference from above, perhaps politically motivated,
led to a watering-down of warnings concerning terrorist attacks
involving flight school students. This is an astonishing charge, if
true, because it would indicate that under Mueller, the FBI has
become even more politicized than it was when Louis Freeh, whom
Clinton had appointed as a peace offering to the GOP, repaid
Clinton's generosity by spending more time aiding and abetting Ken
Starr's multimillion-dollar anti-Clinton witch hunts than he did on
rooting out domestic terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Coleen Rowley, for daring to come forward with your
story. America needs more people like you.</TE>

<LD>Assertive treatment of the mentally ill based on psychiatric and
family request, per AB 1421, should be supported ("Shield the Sick,
and Society," editorial, May 28). If some people's mental capacity is
impaired so much that they are a danger to themselves or others,
their civil rights should be restricted until they are able to make
rational judgments.</LD>
<LD>   This approach protects the afflicted's rights in the long run.
While medicated, many may feel negative effects, but if given time,
normal functions can return. Bottom line, what is more important:
exercising the power to treat someone who is unstable or allowing the
risk of self-inflicted harm and the risk of harm to society? Where
does the exercise of civil liberties impair society? Do civil rights
include the right to be deranged?</LD>

<HD>Clinton Adams, 83; Led Renaissance of Lithography in U.S.</HD>

<LD>Clinton Adams, the printmaker and painter who was the longtime head
of the Tamarind Institute at the University of New Mexico, has died.
He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Adams, who was also a teacher, art critic and art historian, died
May 13 of cancer at his home in Albuquerque.</LD>
<LD>   "He wore many hats and all of them well," said Marjorie Devon,
head of the Tamarind Institute, which, along with its forerunner the
Tamarind Workshop, is credited with resuscitating fine arts
lithography in this country.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Glendale, Adams studied art at UCLA in the early 1940s,
earning his bachelor's and master's degrees before serving in the
Army during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to California after the war and began his work in
lithography. He also taught at UCLA through the mid-1950s before
taking an academic post at the University of Kentucky and later at
the University of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Adams became involved with the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in
the early 1960s. Started in Los Angeles by artist and printmaker June
Wayne, the Tamarind Lithography Workshop's mission was to develop
American artists working in several media into masters of
lithography.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne was the institute's first director, and Adams--then the dean
of the college of fine arts at the University of New Mexico--was the
workshop's associate director. A Ford Foundation grant helped the
institute get started.</TE>
<TE>   During its first 10 years, Tamarind printed more than 2,900
lithographs by a diverse collection of artists from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   After its Ford Foundation funding ran out in 1970, Adams--with
Wayne's blessing--helped pave the way for the workshop to move to the
University of New Mexico, where its name was changed to the Tamarind
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   It continued its mission of training master printers and
publishing the works of established printmakers and painters.</TE>
<TE>   Adams headed the institute until 1985, when he retired from the
institute and from teaching at the University of New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   As a historian, Adams wrote two of the most influential books on
lithography: "American Lithographers 1900-1960: The Artists and Their
Printers" and "The Tamarind Book of Lithography: Art and Techniques."
The Tamarind book, written with Garo Z. Antreasian and published
three decades ago, is still considered a standard work on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   A fine artist in his own right, Adams exhibited his work in more
than 60 solo shows.</TE>
<TE>   His paintings and lithographs are included in many public
collections, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Mary, son Michael and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Builder's Proposal on Flower Assailed</HD>
<DH>Development: Fish and Game report calls plan to save rare
species at Ahmanson Ranch vague, subject to interference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A developer's plan to protect an endangered flower on the site of the
proposed Ahmanson Ranch subdivision does not meet state requirements,
according to a new state report.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the 3,050-home project say the 20-page report by C.F.
Raysbrook, regional manager of the Department of Fish and Game, is a
major obstacle for the landowner, Washington Mutual Bank. But the
company reiterated its resolve to begin construction next year.</LD>
<LD>   The report is part of a supplemental environmental review the
project must undergo. The Department of Fish and Game is the third
agency in recent months to criticize the environmental review of the
2,800-acre property in southeast Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   Raysbrook wrote that Washington Mutual's plan to protect the San
Fernando Valley spineflower is vague and subject to human
interference, and his department "will require additional, specific
detail."</TE>
<TE>   The developer proposes an on-site preserve and planting the
spineflower elsewhere, as well as protections for the endangered
California red-legged frog, also found on the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Game Department is one of four agencies whose
concerns must be addressed before the development can be built. The
state water quality board and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have
also expressed concerns about the project. The fourth agency, the
Army Corps of Engineers, is expected to deliver its opinion within
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGarry, a Washington Mutual vice president, said the company
views the latest report, and the criticisms of the two other
agencies, as constructive rather than a setback.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the environmental review process is going exactly as it
should," he said. "We will do everything we can to make sure that the
concerns of the agencies are fully addressed."</TE>
<TE>   Raysbrook said in his report that although his department has
concerns regarding the supplemental environmental report, "We believe
that each of these issues can be addressed during preparation of the
final document."</TE>
<TE>   But Tsilah Burman, executive director of Rally to Save Ahmanson
Ranch, said the Fish and Game report is a major setback for the
developer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is very significant because it's one more
responsible agency that is calling into question the adequacy of the
environmental impact report," she said. "It says to Ventura County
that they really need to reject this report and start from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   A Ventura County committee reviewing the environmental issues will
hold a hearing June 19.</TE>

<HD>Mildred Benson, 96; Author Gave Life to Nancy Drew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm so sick of Nancy Drew I could vomit."</LD>
<LD>   --Author Mildred Wirt Benson en route to the first Nancy Drew
conference in 1993, as quoted in the New York Times</LD>
<LD>   Mildred Augustine Wirt Benson, original author of the Nancy Drew
series of mysteries, which have intrigued and inspired generations of
adolescent girls who identified with the spunky heroine, has died.
She was 96.</LD>
<TE>   Benson died Tuesday in Toledo, Ohio, after becoming ill while
writing her weekly column, "On the Go with Millie Benson," for the
Toledo Blade. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer in 1997 but
never stopped working.</TE>
<TE>   The Nancy Drew books, as most women who read can tell you, are
written by Carolyn Keene. Benson, whose identity became known only
when she testified in a court case in 1980, was the first Keene, who
had created Nancy Drew half a century earlier and wrote 23 of the
original 30 books.</TE>
<TE>   To Benson, a journalist for 58 years at the Toledo Times and later
the Blade, and author of about 130 books for young people, concocting
16-year-old Nancy Drew was just a job or, as she told The Times in
1991, "just a part of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of subsequent authors have added to Benson's creation,
writing a total of more than 200 Nancy Drew books, which have sold
more than 200 million copies in 17 languages.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Benson who gave the enduring wish-fulfillment heroine
her character--independent and daring, not unlike herself--in the
first Nancy Drew book, "The Secret of the Old Clock," published in
1930. Benson and Nancy Drew shared many interests: Both flew planes,
golfed, participated in archeological digs and radiated
self-confidence in the man's world of the early 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Every six weeks, for $125 a book, Benson churned out a mystery
starring a widowed lawyer's blond daughter who drove a blue roadster,
was the envy of her many friends and liked to unravel clues. Drew
controlled her own budget for clothes sufficient to cover a mink coat
(providing she could make her existing supplies of makeup and
stockings last all year).</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Benson is the quintessential feminist of the 20th century,
and yet she's almost completely unknown," David Farrah, publisher of
"Farrah's Guide to Nancy Drew Books and Collectibles," told The Times
in 1991. "Gloria Steinem is a pea compared to this woman."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, after she was discovered as Nancy's originator,
Benson scoffed at theories of Nancy Drew's purported lesbianism and
didn't much care for the character's 1990s persona as a
Mustang-driving, gloveless journalism major. Never mind that Benson
was wearing turquoise pantsuits and had been the first woman to earn
a master's degree in journalism from the University of Iowa, which
prides itself on training writers.</TE>
<TE>   Benson's job of developing Nancy Drew was given to her by Edward
Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, who created a
publishing empire by hiring ghostwriters to produce series of books
based on continuing characters and aimed at a specific young
audience. Among his productions were the Hardy Boys, the Bobbsey
Twins, Tom Swift and the Dana Girls.</TE>
<TE>   Stratemeyer, who provided the character and brief plot
suggestions, offered Benson the opportunity to create Nancy Drew
because he liked her work on his Ruth Fielding series. Under the
collective pseudonym of Alice B. Emerson, Benson wrote eight Ruth
Fielding books published from 1927 to 1930.</TE>
<TE>   For all such series, Benson and other writers had to sign
agreements forgoing royalties and promising not to divulge their
identity. "You couldn't get any work in those days unless you signed
a release," she said a few years ago. "It never bothered me."</TE>
<TE>   Despite downplaying her role and her occasional exasperation over
the cult following of Nancy Drew, Benson told Associated Press in
December:</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew the series would be successful. I just never
expected it to be the blockbuster that it has been. I'm glad that I
had that much influence on people."</TE>
<TE>   After Stratemeyer's death, his daughter Harriet Adams took over
the series, and when she died in 1982, Nancy Drew became the property
of Simon and Schuster.</TE>
<TE>   Writing scores of books, Benson used a dozen or so pseudonyms and
versions of her own name. In addition to Keene and Emerson, she
contributed to series of titles under the names Julia K. Duncan,
Frances K. Judd and Helen Louise Thorndyke.</TE>
<TE>   As Mildred A. Wirt, she wrote her own series of youth books,
including the Ruth Darrow Flying Stories, the Mildred A. Wirt Mystery
Stories, the Trailer Stories for Girls, the Penny Parker Mystery
Stories, the Brownie Scout Series and the Dan Carter Series, as well
as individual novels.</TE>
<TE>   Other pen names were Dorothy West, Don Palmer, Frank Bell, Joan
Clark and Ann Wirt, as well as Mildred Augustine and Mildred Wirt
Benson.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Ladora, Iowa, she recently said: "I always wanted to be a
writer from the time I could walk. I had no other thought except that
I wanted to write."</TE>
<TE>   She began writing children's stories in grade school, received her
first writing award at age 14, and earned undergraduate and graduate
degrees from the University of Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Then she set off for New York, where she introduced herself to
Stratemeyer and others who hired her to write books, short stories
and articles.</TE>
<TE>   She married two journalists--Associated Press newsman Asa Alvin
Wirt, who died in 1947, and George A. Benson, editor of the Toledo
Times, who died in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The author went to work for the Toledo paper in 1944 and over
nearly six decades covered city hall, federal and courthouse beats
and wrote columns including "Millie Benson's Notebook" and her
current one about daily life and senior citizens. Until her death,
nothing--neither a broken leg nor cancer nor failing eyesight as she
aged--kept her out of her beloved newsroom for very long.</TE>
<TE>   Benson is survived by her daughter, Peggy Wirt of Logansport,
Ind., and her immortal creation, Nancy Drew.</TE>

<HD>Fear of Trouble Cancels 2 Events</HD>
<DH>Bikers: After deadly violence between rival clubs in
Nevada, permission is denied for charity ride and vintage race in
Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two summer events that bring thousands of motorcyclists to Ventura
have been canceled over fears that they would serve as a backdrop for
violence between rival groups of biker clubs.</LD>
<LD>   State parks officials have denied a permit for the annual Beach
Ride, a July gathering that raises money for a children's charity,
according to the organization's director.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Ventura County Fairgrounds officials have canceled one
of the West Coast's biggest vintage motorcycle races.</LD>
<TE>   The actions were taken after a brawl that escalated into deadly
gunfire last month between members of the warring Hells Angels and
the Mongols in Laughlin, Nev. Three people died and at least 16 were
injured in a late-night melee at a Laughlin casino.</TE>
<TE>   Citing that bloody episode, Seaside Park director Roger Gibbs said
Wednesday that he called off Ventura's vintage bike race after
conferring with local police. The race and an associated swap meet
were set for June 29 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't an easy decision to make," Gibbs said, "but if
something were to happen, I'd have to live with it."</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, police officers, fairgrounds officials and the
race's promoters met to discuss the possibility of violence erupting
at the event. Police were anxious about a large gathering of bikers
but had no specific indication of any planned threat, said Sgt. Brock
Avery, a department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on what we know happened in Laughlin, we just had a general
concern for the public's safety," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This would have been the 10th year for the Outlaw Vintage Short
Track Motorcycle Race, which draws 150 riders and about 6,000
spectators, according to Dave Hansen, one of the race's promoters.</TE>
<TE>   "People come from all over the country for it," he said. "We've
had racers from as far away as Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Promoters said their loss would be substantial but they didn't
contest the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like Sept. 11," said Jim Naylor, Hansen's partner in
the event and the operator of the Ventura Raceway. "With this much
fear, this is what we need to do."</TE>
<TE>   The sponsor of the Beach Ride said the cancellation would cost the
charity for developmentally disabled children as much as $100,000 in
donations.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Bowling, president and chief executive officer of the Los
Angeles-based Exceptional Children's Foundation, said the event is
his group's biggest fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   The ride has drawn motorcyclists to San Buenaventura State Beach
since 1991. Last year, more than 10,000 people showed up for music
and beer, with actor Larry Hagman serving as grand marshal.</TE>
<TE>   Bowling said Richard A. Rojas, a state parks district
superintendent, told him Wednesday that the permit had been denied.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the incident in Laughlin, there is a concern that some
type of repeat incident could happen in Ventura," Bowling said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hells Angels and the Mongols both have contingents in Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Bowling said park officials asked him to guarantee there would be
no violence. Although the event has been marred by nothing more
serious than a fistfight in the past, he said he could not make that
promise.</TE>
<TE>   "I am extremely disappointed," Bowling said. "I feel like they are
trying to take what happened with a small minority of individuals in
Laughlin and generalize it to a whole community."</TE>
<TE>   Bowling said the foundation's board will discuss an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Rojas said he denied the permit for several reasons in addition to
the Laughlin melee.</TE>
<TE>   "It started as a friendly mix of different motorcycle enthusiasts
... a cross-section of different riders out for a day of fun," Rojas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since about 1999, though, there have been increasing problems,
including drunkenness and a motorcycle theft, Rojas said.</TE>

<LD>The leader of the San Fernando Valley secession movement told a
gathering of African Americans in South-Central Los Angeles on
Wednesday that their clout would increase if the city breaks apart.
But some at the town hall meeting worried that the city's resources
would be reduced as well.</LD>
<LD>   Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close said Valley secession would
create a smaller Los Angeles in which minority groups would have more
council districts and better access to City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   "A smaller L.A. will allow more groups to participate in the
government," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks told the audience that a
smaller city could increase minority clout, but he added, "The other
side of the issue is more political clout over what, if you have
fewer resources." Parks said he is studying the issue and hasn't
taken a position on it.</TE>
<TE>   Close said studies have shown that the rest of Los Angeles would
not be harmed in the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   More than 250 attended the forum hosted by black leaders at the
Brookins Community AME Church in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was the second in a series exploring the pros and cons
of the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood--which together account for
about 40% of the city's population--breaking away.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley cityhood measure is on the Nov. 5 citywide ballot. A
state commission will decide next week whether to put the Hollywood
independence attempt on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's forum also drew pro- and anti-secessionists from the
Valley. The Local Agency Formation Commission decided earlier in the
day to keep a harbor area secession proposal off the ballot this year
so that financial problems in the plan can be analyzed further.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists are working hard to cultivate alliances in the
African American communities south of Mulholland Drive, arguing that
a split would increase black clout and representation on the Los
Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Close said his group is challenging Mayor James K. Hahn to 10
secession debates, with the first to be held July 4 in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a South-Central community activist and
author, said he worries that voters in the area are uninformed about
secession and might support it to protest Hahn's decision earlier
this year to oust Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession is absolutely an unmitigated disaster for the African
American community" because it would decrease black political power
and economic resources, said Hutchinson. But the Rev. Frederick O.
Murph of Brookins Community AME Church said: "We're not listening
more to any one group. We're listening to everyone so we can make an
intelligent move forward and decide what's best for the community."</TE>
<TE>   Murph also said he has encouraged Hahn to take part in future
forums in South-Central.</TE>

<LD>SBC Pacific Bell crews were working around the clock Wednesday to
restore telephone service to as many as 1,700 homes and businesses in
Van Nuys, officials said. Customers--about 70% of them
residential--lost service at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday when city workers
laying conduit for a traffic signal severed a phone cable line at the
southwest corner of Gilmore Street and Kester Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Repairing the cable requires splicing 2,400 pairs of line back
together--a time-consuming process, spokeswoman Jennifer Langan said.
Service is expected to be fully restored by 9 p.m. Friday.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   The body politic has a strong immune system that is stubbornly
resistant to pesky, reform-minded voters.</LD>
<LD>   It is a self-preservation system, preserving corruption as a way
of life in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Corruption is a harsh word. But it fits, even if uncomfortably.
I'm not referring to bribery or graft, necessarily, but rather to the
subtler influences of moneyed special interests that corrupt
decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Interests such as labor unions--especially teachers and prison
guards--and the medical profession, tobacco companies and now Indian
tribes. All greasing lawmakers' hands with political money. Engaged
in mutual back-scratching.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make voters even more cynical and reluctant to
participate in elections. And it does.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, Californians have voted for political reforms only
to have them tossed back in their faces by courts. There was
post-Watergate Proposition 9 in 1974. Then Props. 68 and 73 in 1988,
after an FBI sting had exposed Capitol corruption. In 1996, voters
approved Prop. 208, which contained extremely low contribution
limits.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature feared that Prop. 208 actually would be upheld by
the courts, so it hurriedly passed Prop. 34 and placed it on the
November 2000 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Prop. 34 reeked from the start: Its true purpose was to head off
the tougher Prop. 208. It was rushed through without public
testimony. It had sham opposition arguments in the "Official Voter
Information Guide." And it created a "soft money" scheme in
California similar to the loophole-laden federal system that Congress
now has voted to abolish.</TE>
<TE>   But Prop. 34 did impose realistic campaign contribution
limits--$3,000 for legislative candidates from individuals and $6,000
from multi-donor special interests, such as a labor union.</TE>
<TE>   Right there in the proposition language, it stated that Prop. 34's
purpose was "to minimize the potentially corrupting influence ...
[of] large contributions by providing reasonable contribution ...
limits."</TE>
<TE>   Voters were reminded by proponents in their official ballot
argument that "officials should work for the people who elect them,
not for special interests."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody could dispute that. Prop. 34 was passed in a landslide, by
60% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Then the body politic's immune system kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   The state Fair Political Practices Commission--created in the
post-Watergate era to be the watchdog over campaign financing--issued
a stunning interpretation of Prop. 34. It ruled that contributions to
a politician's campaign committee created prior to Prop. 34 are not
restricted by the proposition. Sky's still the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Those old committees can stay in existence, the FPPC ruled, as
long as a politician is serving the term the committee was created to
win.</TE>
<TE>   So the committee of Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco)
will exist until he is termed-out in December 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) will retain his old
committee until after next November. There's a caveat: He must run
for reelection using a new committee restricted by Prop. 34. But he
and Burton, and other legislators, can use their old committees for
non-campaigning purposes, such as political party donations.</TE>
<TE>   OK, this is far too complicated. But the central point is that the
FPPC gave a helping hand to politicians--particularly Democratic
legislative leaders--and the back of its hand to voters.</TE>
<TE>   People weren't voting about committees, after all, they were
voting to control politicians. The FPPC narrowly interpreted a small
section of the law and created a wide loophole, as if going out of
its way to help Democratic leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was handed down last September. The Times reported
Tuesday that legislators--especially Wesson and Burton--have used the
loophole to raise nearly $3 million above Prop. 34 limits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an outrageous decision by the FPPC that turns logic on
its head," says Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), the GOP's political
reform expert who helped draft Prop. 34. "It's an Alice in Wonderland
kind of interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   He's just one of many critics. Political reformers also are
dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   Responds FPPC Chairman Karen Getman, an appointee of Gov. Gray
Davis and a former political lawyer for Democrats:</TE>
<TE>   "What people vote on is an idea. They hear 'campaign finance
reform.' With that idea comes pages and pages of tiny type. We have
to take those pages and somehow make a statute work. And it never
works exactly the way people think ...</TE>
<TE>   "You get this wonderful simplistic idea and wave a magic wand and
suddenly the world changes. I wish to God it could be that nice and
simple, but that's not how it works."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the voters know. What works is the immune system.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The woman whose speeding sport utility vehicle collided head-on with
a minivan carrying autistic adults in Van Nuys last week and killed
two people pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular manslaughter
Wednesday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Bonnie Yvonne Lee, 28, of Van Nuys is accused of causing the May
23 crash that killed two people from Tierra del Sol, a center for
developmentally disabled adults in Sunland.</LD>
<LD>   Tierra del Sol client Robert Hawthorne, 38, and employee Tauheedah
Brown, 25, died last week from injuries suffered in the crash,
authorities said. The other four van passengers were treated at
hospitals and released.</LD>
<TE>   Lee was driving 71 mph in the 6800 block of Woodley Avenue about
11:20 a.m. when her white 2000 Ford Explorer swerved into oncoming
traffic and hit the van, according to Los Angeles Police Det. Jose
Viramontes.</TE>
<TE>   There were no signs that she was under the influence of drugs or
alcohol, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee was charged with two counts of felony vehicular manslaughter
with gross negligence and one felony count of endangering the life of
her 2-year-old son, who was riding in the back seat but was
uninjured, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea C. Thompson. Lee was also
charged with driving without a license, a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Each felony count carries a maximum sentence of six years in state
prison, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who suffered a broken leg in the crash, is being held at the
Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles in lieu of
$300,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are asking anyone who witnessed the collision or saw
Lee's vehicle before the crash to call Viramontes at (818) 756-8391.</TE>
<TE>   The detective is also seeking the public's help in locating Lee's
passenger, whom he identified as Tom Merino, 49, of the San Francisco
Bay Area.</TE>

<HD>Coho Salmon 'Endangered' Listing Urged</HD>
<DH>Environment: The fish could disappear from wide swaths of
California's coast, a state agency contends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State biologists recommended Wednesday that coho salmon from San
Francisco north to the Oregon border should be protected under the
state Endangered Species Act, concluding that the once-plentiful fish
could vanish from the area.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Fish and Game report contains one of the most
comprehensive reviews to date of the increasing scarcity of coho
salmon in the region's coastal rivers and streams. Adding the coho to
the state endangered species list would require timber companies,
farmers and other landowners to take special steps to ensure that
their operations do not harm the fish.</LD>
<LD>   The coho report is drawing considerable attention, in part because
it covers such a large area, encompassing North Coast timberlands,
inland ranches and some of the most spectacular coastal wilderness in
the state.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that coho populations have declined to these levels is
highly significant," said biologist Gary Stacey, Fish and Game's
fisheries program manager for the Northern California/North Coast
region. "Once that downward spiral begins, it can be very difficult
for these animals to recover."</TE>
<TE>   The report goes to the state Fish and Game Commission, which is
due to decide in August whether the coho should be added to the list
of 77 animals and 217 plants protected under state law. The prospect
is already stirring acrimonious debate, with environmentalists and
sportsmen's groups calling for a listing, while logging companies and
farmers question whether the coho's plight is as serious as
biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have to question if they have the science to support
their recommendation," said Mark Rentz, vice president of
environmental and legal affairs at the California Forestry Assn. He
noted that the coho is already protected by the federal Endangered
Species Act and said a second layer of regulation could subject
timber companies to costly and unwarranted paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state act, species in the most dire straits are labeled
"endangered" while others are listed as "threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups applauded the report, saying it would require
more strenuous review of plans for such activities as timber
harvests. However, some are disappointed that the state is
recommending a less stringent "threatened" status for coho north of
Punta Gorda, an area that includes the Klamath and Trinity rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Although coho salmon now occupy only about 61% of their historic
streams, the decline appears to have slowed in recent years,
department biologists wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Coho salmon closer to San Francisco are in more precarious shape,
with the fish disappearing or nearly vanishing in large areas: the
Gualala and Russian rivers and their tributaries; the Sonoma County
coast; and streams feeding San Francisco Bay, the report states.</TE>
<TE>   It calls for the more stringent controls that come with an
"endangered" listing for these fish, saying they are in serious
danger of disappearing from the area.</TE>
<TE>   The report may be just another incremental step in the
long-simmering salmon controversy.</TE>
<TE>   State Fish and Game officials have been meeting quietly with
environmental and sportsmen's groups, trying to draft a compromise.</TE>

<CX>   Coho salmon--A story in some editions of Thursday's California
section misstated the California Department of Fish and Game's
recommendation regarding the coho salmon. The agency recommended that
the fish be granted protection under the state Endangered Species Act
from San Francisco to the Oregon border. Populations of coho salmon
from San Francisco to Punta Gorda in Humboldt County would be listed
as endangered, while those from Punta Gorda to Oregon would be listed
as threatened.</CX>

<HD>O.C. Church Finds Broad Support in Land Battle</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cypress' decision to take land from Cottonwood Christian Center for a
Costco or other "big-box" retailer mobilized religious activists
across the nation who vowed Wednesday to back the church's fight to
keep its property.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington, D.C.-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty
issued a written statement describing the city's move late Tuesday
night to take the church's 18 acres by eminent domain as a
"stunningly unethical ... abuse of governmental power."</LD>
<LD>   Church leaders labeled the action an affront to the Constitution
and an abuse of redevelopment law. But city officials defended their
move, saying the city depends on sales tax revenue such a retail
development would generate.</LD>
<TE>   "I speak on behalf of many pastors in saying we will not allow
this to continue," said Jim Cobrae, pastor of the 10,000-member Rock
Church and World Outreach Center in San Bernardino. "There are
millions of dollars that will go toward Cottonwood's aggressive fight
from churches, synagogues and mosques that could be subjected to the
same abuse."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a worldwide effort," he said after the contentious,
four-hour hearing over the site where Cottonwood wants to build a
"megachurch" campus with an arena-sized auditorium, gymnasium,
day-care center, classrooms and other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   An Oklahoma firm recently sent 50,000 glossy mailers lambasting
Cypress officials, and legal organizations in Washington, D.C., and
Colorado are drafting motions on behalf of the church. A state
legislator sent the City Council a letter just before the vote
telling them they should be ashamed of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Despite it all, city officials remain defiant. "Our legal staff is
just as confident, if not more confident than the attorneys for
Cottonwood, that the law is on our side," City Councilman Frank McCoy
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Another council member also blasted Cottonwood officials before
the 11:10 p.m. Tuesday vote for their "malicious" international
propaganda campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says 'Gosh, how can you stand up against a church?'"
Councilman Tim Keenan said. "You need to look at this as a land-use
issue and take the church out of it. Everyone needs to follow the
rules. I don't see why a church needs special treatment."</TE>
<TE>   The rules Keenan and other city officials say they are following
are those guiding redevelopment. The city plans to fold the
church-owned property at Walker Street and Katella Avenue into a
300-acre shopping and entertainment district to stimulate the local
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look out for what our goals are for the entire
community," Keenan said just before approving the condemnation.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say they know of no other case in the country where
a city successfully seized church property unless it was for a public
use or right of way.</TE>
<TE>   The city also has another hurdle to jump: the federal Religious
Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which prohibits
local land-use decisions that pose a "substantial burden" on the
practice of religion.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say they will prevail because they notified the
4,000-member church before it bought the land that this could
happen--something church officials deny.</TE>
<TE>   They added that redevelopment remains one of the only viable
options they have to raise revenue since the state slashed $2 million
in annual funding to Cypress in the mid-1990s and never restored it.</TE>
<TE>   A Costco alone can generate as much as $900,000 in sales tax
revenue annually, according to city projections.</TE>
<TE>   Given the cuts in state funding, officials of the city of about
50,000 were incensed at a scolding letter from Assemblyman Ken Maddox
(R-Garden Grove) received just before the Cottonwood vote, accusing
Cypress officials of "outrageous" behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "He is just part of the problem," McCoy said. "He should be
working on solutions that would make cities less dependent on sales
tax."</TE>
<TE>   Maddox dismissed the remarks as frustration from a group of
officials who have backed themselves against a wall. He has enlisted
the support of several other state lawmakers on Cottonwood's behalf,
but conceded there is little the Legislature can do to block the
city's action.</TE>
<TE>   Amending redevelopment law, he said, is like "trying to herd
cats."</TE>
<TE>   However, Maddox said no judge could find the paved lot where
Cottonwood has filed plans to build its campus a blighted area, as
required by redevelopment law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just plain wrong," Maddox said. "If the church doesn't
want to sell, so be it. This is their land."</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood's attorneys said Wednesday they will seek an injunction
this week to stop the city from going any further before a judge
rules on their lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The length to which this city is willing to trample on
constitutional rights is extraordinary," said Pat Korten, vice
president of the Becket group, which is providing legal assistance to
Cottonwood. "It has implications for churches all over the country.
They are realizing that if this can happen to Cottonwood, it can
happen to anyone."</TE>

<HD>2 Visitors Killed in Couple's Dispute</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Placentia man and his wife are fatally shot after
their host's estranged husband breaks into the Camino home, El Dorado
County deputies say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Placentia couple were killed Memorial Day weekend while visiting a
friend in Northern California, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Richard Hunsaker, 39, and Kimberly Ann Hunsaker, 31, died
from multiple gunshot wounds early Monday after they apparently were
caught up in another couple's domestic dispute, El Dorado County
sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Edwin Hull, 48, broke into his estranged wife's
three-story home in Camino, a rural community about 40 miles east of
Sacramento, and shot the couple with an assault-style semiautomatic
pistol, said Lt. Kevin House of the El Dorado County Sheriff's
Department. House said that Hull believed the Hunsakers were
interfering in his marriage.</LD>
<TE>   Hull broke into the home at about 4:30 a.m. Monday by smashing a
glass window in a door and then confronted his wife, who had a
restraining order against him, before bursting into the Hunsakers'
room, House said. Hull's wife ran out of the house and called 911 on
a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, Hull called 911 on his own cell phone and
told dispatchers he had just shot and killed two people.</TE>
<TE>   He surrendered without incident a short time later and was booked
into El Dorado County Jail, House said. Hull was arraigned Wednesday
on two counts of murder. He is being held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   The Hunsakers had a 3-year-old daughter, Katie, and 10-year-old
son, Hans, from Thomas Hunsaker's previous marriage. Hans was in the
house at the time of the shooting but was unharmed, House said.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles-based Iranian dancer who returned to his homeland for
the first time in two decades was jailed in Tehran on charges that
his dancing was corrupting the culture, according to friends and news
reports.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamad Khordadian's arrest earlier this month as he arrived at
the airport to return to the United States has outraged some Iranians
in Los Angeles and elsewhere, said Shahram Hashemizadh, owner of Los
Angeles-based Melli TV network, which broadcasts in Persian on
several cable stations.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason they hold him is because he is a man who dances," said
Hashemizadh, whose station has daily updates on Khordadian's
situation and has broadcast his performances. "The poor guy. He is
not political. He is just a dancer."</LD>
<TE>   Hashemizadh said Khordadian was arrested two weeks ago and sent to
Tehran's Evin prison. He was set to be freed after paying a $25,000
bond, but could face a trial, Hashemizadh said.</TE>
<TE>   An Iranian artist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
arrest was for setting up dance classes for women in Iran</TE>
<TE>   Iranian officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Khordadian was raised in Tehran and studied dance in England and
Iran, according to his Web site. As a young man, he joined the
National Folk Company of Iran, but fled his country after the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   He built a new life in Los Angeles, and enjoyed success as a
teacher and performer who incorporated salsa and other Latin moves
into traditional Persian styles, friends said. He made several
videotapes and his performances were broadcast on satellite
television.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this spring, he performed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
and then decided to go to Iran to visit family and pay his respects
to his mother's grave, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   He had not returned sooner because of fears that the hard-line
regime would punish him for his career as a performer. He decided to
return home after friends told him that Iran had changed.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought it was safe," said Mohammad Parvin, who runs the
Mission for Establishment of Human Rights in Iran from Rancho Palos
Verdes. "He was there for three weeks, and then when he wanted to
leave, they arrested him."</TE>
<TE>   Parvin said opponents of the Islamic regime that has held power in
Iran since 1979 see Khordadian's arrest as proof that the government
has not opened up enough. Sweeping social restrictions imposed after
the revolution have gradually eased since the election of reformist
President Mohammad Khatami in May 1997, but women must still wear
head scarves and mingling of unrelated men and women is frowned upon.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been outraged at the way the Islamic Republic
behaves," Parvin said. "We are all very upset, and very upset that
the world doesn't see."</TE>
<TE>   Hashemizadh said many expatriates who are watching Khordadian's
situation may conclude it is not safe for them to return to visit
relatives either. "It is a sign that they cannot go back," he said.</TE>

<HD>Businesses Miss County's Tax Deadline</HD>
<DH>Finances: Despite strong housing market that helped the
vast majority pay on time, delinquent property owners owe $18.9
million in all.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County property owners, riding the crest of a housing boom,
paid more of their taxes on time than at any point since the 1980s.
But real estate investments didn't pay off for several big business
owners who failed to remit their taxes by the April 10 deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The county tax collector has received more than 97% of the $680
million owed by local property owners for 2001-2002, up slightly from
last fiscal year and far ahead of payment rates during the recession
of the early 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Tax Collector Larry Matheny credited a real estate
market that is among the hottest in county history. Low mortgage
interest rates also fueled a loan refinancing frenzy that contributed
to the high rate of payment.</LD>
<TE>   "Loan and purchase escrows typically pay any property tax due,"
Matheny said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the owners of about 16,000 parcels missed their most recent
tax payments last month, leaving about $18.9 million unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got delinquency notices out on the streets now, so things
are really cooking," Matheny said. "It flushes out all kinds of
issues. It's, 'Hey, I never got a bill,' or, 'I got a corrected
bill,' or, 'I got a supplemental bill,' or, 'I thought they were all
the same thing.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'Property Tax 101,'" he added. "And it's not an easy class."</TE>
<TE>   Among the top property tax debtors this fiscal year are the owners
of a giant music recording company, a hothouse tomato farm in
Camarillo, an aging Simi Valley shopping center, a new east county
golf course and a former baseball star's carwash.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for tardiness range from a simple memory lapse in the
case of an executive for Lost Canyons golf course in Simi Valley to
reorganizational bankruptcy by the builder of a new housing tract
near the ocean at Oxnard's Mandalay Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big oops," said Todd Yuba, controller at Lost Canyons, a
$120-a-round club in the picturesque Santa Susana Mountains. "It was
just an oversight. Our [financial officer] in Maryland was working on
a project in Mississippi, and it just fell through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   The oops cost Maryland-based Big Sky Country Club a $12,411
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen next year," Yuba said. "I've put Dec. 10
and April 10 on my calendar."</TE>
<TE>   Matheny said the county has no way to collect from the delinquent
owners until they fall five years in arrears. Only then can county
officials seize the property and sell it to the highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the tax collector has not made an effort--other than
mailing the semiannual tax bill and a recent delinquency notice--to
collect from those who still owe. But before the end of the tax year
June 30, those owners, already facing a 10% penalty, will be notified
of an extra 1.5% penalty each month from then on.</TE>
<TE>   That progressive tax penalty--and a 1999 Moorpark growth-control
initiative--caught up with an Irvine firm that had planned
construction of a 3,221-home subdivision in the hills north of
Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Messenger Investment Co., which also owns property as Strathearn
Ventura Partners and Hidden Creek Ranch Investors, owes nearly
$375,000 in property tax.</TE>
<TE>   That will be paid, said a spokesman for a Newport Beach firm,
Village Development, that now manages the Hidden Creek property.</TE>
<TE>   Village Development has proposed a smaller project of 1,500 homes.
If approved by the city, the project would be placed on the ballot
for voter consideration, spokesman Kim Kilkenny said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with the community doing surveys, trying to get a
feel for what the voters of Moorpark want," he said. "In due course,
all tax obligations will be satisfied, regardless."</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley carwash and auto repair business owned by former
major league player Lenny Dykstra is also behind on its taxes--about
$34,000 this year and about about $100,000 for the two previous
years, according to the county.</TE>
<TE>   Matheny said he is not aware of any contact the Dykstra firm has
made with his office. "Nothing has been brought to my attention," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Dykstra nor his business manager could be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime delinquent owner is the Vineyard Gardens Assn., a
group that owns a 62-unit, low-income apartment complex in Oxnard.
Vineyard Gardens owes about $49,000 for this year and $63,759 from
before, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The owner could not be reached for comment. But a spokeswoman for
the Century City company that manages the complex said she thinks the
debt is not valid.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the properties for low-income housing are tax exempt.
They have welfare tax exemptions, so I'm sure that's probably the
case with this property," spokeswoman Michele Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The largest debtor for this tax year is Houweling Nurseries, a
tomato farm owned by a Canadian firm that owes $211,122. Owner Casey
Houweling did not return telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The second-highest tax debtor is Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Corp. The
music company failed to pay $197,910 on a 200,000-square-foot
warehouse in Simi Valley, and millions of dollars worth of property
inside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always amazing to see these [big] companies on the list,"
Matheny said. "It's just probably a lack of management in the
financial office."</TE>
<TE>   Burnham Pacific Properties, the former owner of one of the
original shopping centers in Simi Valley, recently sold Mountain Gate
Plaza as part of a companywide divestiture. But the San Diego firm
still owes about $139,000 on an adjacent shopping center, Matheny
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything about these delinquent taxes," said Michael
Rubin, chief operating officer for Burnham Pacific. "We're in the
process of liquidating."</TE>
<TE>   Burnham Pacific owned 61 shopping centers in five western states,
before the company began a liquidation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sedell, city manager in Simi Valley, said the buyer of
Mountain Gate Plaza has pledged to modernize and rebuild the center,
built in the late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Next on the debtors' list are owners of two Oxnard business park
complexes and the owner of a construction and self-storage facility
in east Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Other top debtors included GE American Communications, which
Matheny said is delinquent on a statewide Board of Equalization
assessment of which Ventura County receives a $42,471 portion.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas owner of a store out of which Kmart operates in Santa
Paula also failed to pay an April installment, as did homeowners
associations in Thousand Oaks and Ventura and the owner of a Santa
Paula medical office building.</TE>
<TE>   "We see a lot of sincere, good people who just got tripped up on
the complexity of the system," Matheny said.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Foils Runoff Effort, Groups Allege</HD>
<DH>Environment: The state agency is spending millions to
undermine a storm-water study instead of remaining neutral as
required, their court filing says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two environmental groups Wednesday accused Caltrans of waging an
aggressive propaganda campaign to sabotage a court-ordered study of
treatment methods that could reduce the flow of polluted storm water
from the state's vast highway system.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of remaining neutral as required during the research, the
Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica BayKeeper charged
that Caltrans spent tens of millions of dollars in an effort to
discredit an array of pollution controls designed to keep toxic
runoff from reaching waterways and the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The allegation was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
where the organizations have waged a nine-year legal battle to force
the giant transportation department into complying with the
storm-water provisions of the federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<TE>   "Like a nefarious cigarette manufacturer, who knows that the facts
are against it, Caltrans has embarked on a campaign of deceit
designed to sell the unsuspecting public a pack of distortions and
half-truths," NRDC attorneys charged.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Caltrans' Sacramento headquarters declined to
comment, saying the agency has not reviewed the latest court filings.
In the past they have said the department is committed to improving
its storm-water programs and developing effective pollution controls.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans was ordered in January 1998 to work with NRDC and
BayKeeper on a five-year study to determine the effectiveness and
cost of devices that could filter highway runoff--a potentially toxic
brew of oil, hydraulic fluid, exhaust particles, brake dust and
metals that can harm aquatic life.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Edward Rafeedie required both sides to remain neutral as
they studied 38 treatment sites, including roadside strips of sand
and vegetation, detention basins, vaults of compost or minerals, and
simple devices to catch trash before it enters storm drains. The
results are due out within a year.</TE>
<TE>   But NRDC attorneys charged in legal papers filed Wednesday that
Caltrans has engaged in a multimillion-dollar campaign to undermine
the very methods now under consideration in the court-supervised
demonstration project.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans' in-house research has concluded that many of the
treatment devices are too expensive and impractical to install on a
widespread basis. The department has estimated it could cost as much
as $54 billion to retrofit highways in Los Angeles County alone, not
to mention the annual maintenance cost of $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Caltrans' studies, the California Transportation
Commission warned in a 2002 report that the cost of treating highway
runoff could have catastrophic effects on the state's highway
construction budget.</TE>
<TE>   Court records state that, rather than remain neutral on the
matter, Caltrans publicized its cost estimates and criticized
storm-water treatment at professional conferences in California,
Minnesota, Nevada, Florida and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have identified is an effort by Caltrans to discredit
storm-water controls at a time when the department is supposed to be
reviewing them in a neutral way," said David Beckman, an NRDC
attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The groups want a court order forcing Caltrans to retract its own
research, publish corrections in trade journals and refrain from
releasing any new storm-water reports until the court-supervised
study is completed.</TE>
<TE>   An NRDC comparison with other states indicates that Caltrans has
grossly overestimated the cost of storm-water controls, as much as 10
times for certain methods. Highway departments in Maryland and
Washington have installed the controls without paralyzing their
ability to build or repair roads.</TE>

<TE>   NRDC attorneys complain that some of Caltrans' own research
amounts to "hit pieces chucked full of unsupported assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   While Caltrans spread its anti-treatment gospel around the
country, NRDC attorneys allege the agency was shelving research from
UC Davis showing that certain controls, such as mesh bags, screens,
grates and drain inserts, were cost-effective in controlling trash,
debris and other pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   Court records state that Caltrans never finalized the August 1998
study from UC Davis. As one department official put it in a sworn
deposition, "We didn't feel it warranted further investigation."</TE>
<TE>   NRDC and BayKeeper officials say Caltrans' anti-treatment campaign
has been picked up by municipal governments, the petroleum industry
and groups opposed to current storm-water regulations, such as the
Construction Industry Coalition, the Building Industry Assn. and the
Coalition for Practical Regulation, a group of 42 Southern California
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's legal complaint is the latest salvo in what has become
a protracted debate over whether Caltrans is making the best effort
to comply with federal law.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the agency has violated regulations
designed to protect streams, rivers and oceans from toxic storm water
and sediment that washes off highways, bridges, construction sites
and maintenance yards.</TE>
<TE>   Last week in Orange County, Caltrans District 12 was issued a
notice of violation for discharging sediment into the Santa Ana Delhi
Channel from a bridge project that will help link the San Diego and
Costa Mesa freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Beeman, a Caltrans spokeswoman, said the agency reported the
problems to the water board and quickly took action to correct the
violations, which carry fines of up to $10,000 per day. The project,
she added, now complies with all storm-water regulations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drain Dispute Dates to 1993</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, Caltrans has repeatedly been the target of lawsuits
and government complaints alleging violations of federal and state
laws to control storm-water runoff. A timeline of major actions:</TE>
<TE>   * October 1993: The Natural Resources Defense Council sues the
Caltrans director and the Los Angeles Caltrans office, arguing that
the agency has failed since 1991 to comply with the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   * December 1994: A federal judge rules in favor of the plaintiff,
saying Caltrans consistently failed to comply with the Clean Water
Act at construction sites and highways in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   * 1994-95: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency files a formal
administrative complaint against Caltrans headquarters related to
storm-water compliance problems.</TE>
<TE>   * September 1995: The federal court overseeing the Los Angeles
case finds that Caltrans failed to comply with the permanent
injunction requiring monitoring programs and annual storm-drain
cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   * March 1996: A Los Angeles federal court orders Caltrans to show
it is in compliance with drain cleaning and monitoring requirements,
calling the agency's effort "wholly inadequate." Under the threat of
contempt, the department begins cleaning about 30,000 freeway drains.</TE>
<TE>   * March 1997: A Los Angeles federal court orders Caltrans to
monitor effectiveness of storm-water control methods. The court also
extends its supervision of the case.</TE>
<TE>   * 1997: Environmental groups in the Bay Area sue Caltrans over
erosion problems related to the reconstruction of the Cypress
Freeway, which collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake. More than 500
violations are documented, including lack of adequate berms, silt
fences and sheet covers. The case is quickly settled with a consent
decree that orders corrections and a "stand-down day," with
contractors put on notice to halt work until all problems are
addressed.</TE>
<TE>   * December 1997: Caltrans agrees to pay $430,000--the largest sum
to date--as part of a settlement in a lawsuit filed by EPA and San
Diego BayKeeper over some of the same allegations made in the Los
Angeles case.</TE>
<TE>   * April 1998: The Federal Highway Administration issues a report
critical of storm-water controls at construction sites in four
Caltrans districts, noting Caltrans' inability to police its
contractors.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998: EPA inspections of Southern California sites lead to a
$55,000 fine related to storm-water violations during construction of
State Route 126 in Santa Clarita and a $11,145 fine related to the
widening of the Santa Ana Freeway in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   * November 2000: The state water quality control board issues a

<HD>Bill Urges O.C. to Fly Its Share</HD>
<DH>Politics: Assembly measure tries to ensure low-income areas
don't shoulder a disproportionate burden of noise, traffic and
pollution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill that would strengthen regional efforts to pressure Orange
County to provide more airport capacity passed the Assembly on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance) calls for
Southern California's regional planning agency for transportation
projects to distribute future airline passengers and cargo based on a
"fair-share" basis among Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, AB 2333, also would require the Southern California
Assn. of Governments to create its five-year regional transportation
plan so that low-income and minority neighborhoods would not shoulder
a disproportionate burden of noise, traffic and pollution from
aviation.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, which passed 42 to 24, now goes to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation advanced in March after lawmakers near Los Angeles
International Airport said they were frustrated by Orange County
voters' defeat of plans for an airport at the closed El Toro Marine
base. The regional association's five-year plan called for El Toro to
handle 30 million airline passengers by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   Nakano originally proposed withholding transportation funds if
Orange County refused to handle its share of airport traffic. His
bill was later amended to give funding preference to compliant
counties--a section removed from the bill last week.</TE>
<TE>   As worded now, the bill would forbid bundling future air travel at
only one or two airports, or concentrating the growth of aviation
facilities in minority neighborhoods, said Becki Ames, Nakano's chief
of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is "forcing the state to really look at what its role is
in regional planning. That's something the state hasn't touched in
aviation planning in 25 or 30 years," Ames said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Assembly delegation opposed the bill, including
former El Toro airport proponent Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana).</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors voted last month to let Irvine take the
lead in redeveloping the base. The city wants to annex the bulk of
the 4,700-acre property.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also voted to raise capacity at John Wayne Airport
from 8.4 million passengers a year to 9.8 million, pending Federal
Aviation Administration approval.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG five-year plan capped Los Angeles International Airport
at 78 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast for Ontario International Airport, which handled
about 6.5 million passengers last year and is owned by Los Angeles,
was 30 million.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Archdiocese Enlists Services of Top PR Firm</HD>
<DH>Publicity: Sitrick &amp; Co., advisor to Enron and other
troubled clients, takes on priest scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of headlines about abusive priests, the Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles has engaged Sitrick &amp; Co., a prominent and
expensive public relations firm specializing in high-profile clients
with big troubles.</LD>
<LD>   Known for navigating clients through bad publicity, Sitrick has
represented Enron after the energy giant's fall, talk show host Laura
Schlessinger after her negative comments about gays, actress Halle
Berry after her traffic accident, comedian Paula Poundstone after her
child-endangerment case and Orange County during its 1995 bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The nationwide priest scandal reached Los Angeles in January, with
the disclosure in The Times that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony had fired
as many as a dozen priests for alleged sexual misconduct with
children in the past. Now, more than 30 current or former priests of
the archdiocese are under investigation by law enforcement
authorities.</LD>
<TE>   The Century City-based company was technically hired by the
archdiocese's new attorney, J. Michael Hennigan. "We're really proud
to be involved in this," said Michael Sitrick, 54, head of the
company. "We're confident the church is taking proactive measures to
make sure this doesn't happen again. I don't have to be Catholic to
be anxious to help them work through this."</TE>
<TE>   Sitrick is handling the case with two other members of his firm.
He said he will soon announce details of preventive measures by the
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two months, the archdiocese had been advised by
public relations firm Weber Shandwick. But when Hennigan was hired,
he chose to bring in Sitrick, who worked with the attorney during
Orange County's bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Sitrick, who has worked for his new client for about a week, said
he has met several times with Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   "First we determine what the facts are," said Sitrick, explaining
his strategy. "We determine what is the perception. Is the perception
equal to the reality? We're trying to get perceptions to equal
reality. You can't do anything about what was, only what is and what
will be."</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan said he hired Sitrick because the archdiocese "was not
doing well in the press. I thought the press was focusing on the very
negative aspects without the whole story coming out."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said, "We're pleased and
grateful to have someone like Mike Sitrick with his understanding of
the media market.... What we find in media coverage is the past
mixing with the present. Trying to cut through all that with the
clear pastoral message of the cardinal has proven difficult for us."</TE>
<TE>   Sitrick's help doesn't come cheap. He declined to say exactly how
much it will cost the archdiocese but said "our rates are comparable
to lawyers' rates."</TE>
<TE>   When Sitrick has dealt with companies in bankruptcy--which he
often has--he has reportedly been known to ask for a $100,000
retainer. Sitrick's company was criticized for charging Orange County
$450,000. Later he reduced that figure by $40,000 in exchange for the
county expediting payment. Sitrick defends his bill, saying the
county audited all the fees and concluded that they were appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company has about 200 clients, the firm has made its
reputation with people and companies facing trouble or controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The book "Spin: How to Turn the Power of the Press to Your
Advantage," written by Sitrick with Allan Mayer, who heads the
entertainment practice of the company, says, "Correcting a problem is
necessary but, alas, rarely sufficient; that is where spin comes in."</TE>
<TE>   Crisis management is an increasingly common form of public
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Sitrick's clients have ranged from government officials in
Riverside County after the police slaying of black motorist Tyisha
Miller to Universal Studios, which was accused of glossing over
negative aspects of Nobel laureate John Nash's life in the film "A
Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   The firm also represented actor David Duchovny when he sued 20th
Century Fox Film Corp. alleging breach of contract regarding "The
X-Files" TV show.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought he was being cheated," said Mayer. "His lawyers felt
Fox had no incentive to settle. We arranged for a big article in
Forbes explaining the nature of Fox's vertical monopoly, and that was
very embarrassing to Fox. Maybe it was a coincidence, but not long
after that, they decided to settle."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding his job representing the archdiocese, Sitrick said, "I
call it getting the truth out. Some other people call it crisis
management. But I don't think anybody would disagree that it's a
crisis."</TE>

<HD>Feds Allege Real Estate Fraud Ring</HD>
<DH>Crime: Thirty agents, others are accused in $10-million
scheme involving FHA loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. attorney's office on Wednesday charged 30 real estate
agents, mortgage brokers and others in an elaborate scheme involving
more than $10 million in government home loans for low-income
residents.</LD>
<LD>   The indictments are part of an FBI crackdown on mortgage fraud
involving government loans. The loans have a significantly higher
default rate in the Los Angeles area than in other parts of the
country--50% higher two years ago. This prompted officials to
question whether fraud is occurring.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that the defendants bought about 50 homes and
then sold them to low-income residents at inflated prices. Many of
the residents didn't earn enough to qualify for Federal Housing
Administration loans, so the defendants allegedly forged pay stubs,
tax forms and bank statements to make it appear they could afford
their mortgages.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, many of the homeowners in Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties defaulted on the mortgages and
lost their homes.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government was left with houses that were worth far
less than the amount paid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a veritable cottage industry of fraud," said John
Hueston, the U.S. attorney for Orange County. "The FHA loans are a
lifeline to the poor. These people abused it."</TE>
<TE>   The defendants will enter pleas in Santa Ana federal court.
Several defendants named in indictments Wednesday said they were
unaware of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what you're talking about," said Valencia Bray, a
Rialto real estate agent named in the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Hueston and others said that low-income loans have became a target
for fraud because the FHA offers a ready supply of money. The FBI,
IRS and U.S. attorney have been working across Southern California to
examine questionable real estate deals and uncover scams. Two smaller
rings were broken within the last year, resulting in 20 indictments.</TE>
<TE>   The FHA has also been trying to improve regulations and oversight
of loans after studies showed certain parts of Southern California
have much higher default rates than the region and nation.</TE>
<TE>   "This problem is a lot more widespread than it should be, and
people should take note that we're watching them," said Assistant
U.S. Atty. Greg Staples.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments handed down Wednesday focused on homes in Anaheim,
Compton, Corona, Los Angeles, Norwalk, San Bernardino, Santa Ana and
about a dozen other cities. Prosecutors said that not only were
federal and private lenders victimized, but also those who tried to
buy the homes at inflated values and later defaulted.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly doesn't make their lives any better by defaulting
and ruining their credit," said Staples, who declined to release the
victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 defendants have been charged with wire fraud. Two face
additional charges of bank fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty for wire fraud is five years' imprisonment and
a $250,000 fine; the maximum penalty for bank fraud is 30 years'
imprisonment and a $1-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the defendants committed the fraudulent
activities for at least three years. They avoided detection in part
because the alleged conspiracy involved professionals at all ends of
the mortgage process, from real estate agents to mortgage and loan
brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend this provided effective cover because no one
questioned whether properties' values were inflated or whether the
buyers were creditworthy.</TE>
<TE>   To make the home buyers seem wealthier than they were, the
defendants allegedly wrote fake gift letters purported to be from
family members.</TE>
<TE>   They also forged cashier's checks to make it look as if the home
buyers were putting more money down than they were, according to the
court filing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities began to scrutinize the operation last year after the
FBI received a tip.</TE>

<LD>   The arsonist, LaBonge said, has "a demented thought to ruin the
park." Since April 27, Los Angeles fire officials said, 10 suspicious
fires have been reported within Griffith Park, the nation's largest
urban park at 4,127 acres. Two fires, one of them that burned 15
acres, were snuffed out Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting with reporters at the Griffith Observatory, LaBonge and
fire officials asked for the public's help.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone is extremely concerned," LaBonge said. "I encourage
those who frequent Griffith Park to help put an end to this assault
on a historical city treasure."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the blazes, Los Angeles fire units have been placed
on heightened alert.</TE>
<TE>   To underscore the increased awareness, firefighters rushed to the
observatory minutes before LaBonge's news briefing because of a
report of smoke in the area. Five engine companies, one truck company
and a fire helicopter appeared at the scene, but it turned out to be
a false alarm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still early in the fire season, and there'll probably be
more fires here," said Battalion Chief John Miller.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, an avid hiker who walks each morning in the park,
theorized that the arsonist setting the fires may be a hiker since
the fires have occurred off several hiking trails in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be someone who knows the trails here," he said. "If any
hikers see anything, they should report it immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is growing anxiety among residents who live near
the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime there is a fire, we are concerned," said Christine
O'Brien, who lives in the Hollywoodland neighborhood on the park's
western edge. "We cherish the observatory and all of the landmarks in
the park. They have to be protected."</TE>
<TE>   She said some area ham radio operators are organizing to keep a
closer eye on activities in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Concern also is growing among the many hikers and joggers who use
the park. As many as 300 to 500 hikers meet there Tuesday and
Thursday nights to walk the trails.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the safety of the people and the hikers that I'm concerned
about," said Louis Alvarado, the acknowledged honorary mayor of
Griffith Park. LaBonge said he would bring up a motion to approve the
reward at Friday's scheduled City Council meeting. Fire officials
encouraged anyone with information about the fires to call the Fire
Department's arson unit at (213) 485-6095.</TE>

<HD>Bob Hope Honored on His 99th Birthday</HD>
<DH>Tribute: The L.A. National Cemetery's veterans chapel is
named for the comedian who entertained U.S. troops worldwide for 50
years.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Hope, who entertained 10 million troops over more than five
decades of globe-trotting USO tours, was honored on his 99th birthday
Wednesday in a way befitting the nation's only "honorary veteran,"
with the dedication of the Bob Hope Veterans Chapel at the Los
Angeles National Cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, President Bush, just back from his European
tour, signed legislation authorizing the renaming of the
Depression-era chapel in West Los Angeles. The act, passed by the
House and Senate this month, was necessary to get around some
hurdles, notably that the British-born honoree never served in the
U.S. military. Oh, yes, and he's still alive.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not ordinary to name national landmarks after living
persons, unless they are living legends," said U.S. Rep. Christopher
Cox (R-Newport Beach), who attended along with other dignitaries,
including Gen. William Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces in
Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   Hope was too frail to leave his Toluca Lake home, but his wife,
Dolores, who turned 93 on Monday, took the stage at the burial ground
known as "Arlington West."</TE>
<TE>   Provoking the same sort of laughter-and-tears response that was
the hallmark of a Hope show, speakers recalled that the comedian
seldom spent a Christmas at home, preferring to traipse the world to
entertain soldiers, sailors and Marines in places few people had ever
heard of.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Reynolds, who toured with Hope, said she spoke on behalf of
"Bob's fellow entertainers," noting, "I'm one of the few that's still
alive." She was one of several to close her remarks with "thanks for
the memories."</TE>
<TE>   Mort Lachman, a veteran of "Hope's Army" who wrote, directed and
produced such TV hits as "All in the Family," noted that the Hopes
were "married some 70 years, and that includes the three weeks he was
home."</TE>
<TE>   Lachman told the audience of more than 200 that Dolores Hope
raised her four children all by herself.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd point at the tube and say, 'See that man there, swinging
the golf club? That's your father.'"</TE>
<TE>   Among other celebrities present were Red Buttons, Cyd Charisse and
Connie Stevens. As Anthony J. Principi, U.S. secretary of Veterans
Affairs, was making the dedication official, he halted as seven World
War II-vintage Condor planes flew over in tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout more than 60 tours, Hope and an ever-changing band of
Hollywood gypsies performed about 10,000 shows, from Sicily to Danang
to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   With just two exceptions during World War II, all of Hope's radio
shows were aired from military bases and installations.</TE>
<TE>   His first trip into a combat zone took place in 1943, when he and
a small USO troupe visited facilities in England, Africa, Sicily and
Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   He was known as GI Bob, a moniker made more official in 1997, when
Congress designated him an honorary veteran for his indefatigable
efforts to boost soldiers' morale in faraway places. He is the only
civilian ever to have received that honor.</TE>
<TE>   The chapel that now bears his name was designed in 1938. It stands
at Wilshire and Sepulveda boulevards, part of 114.5 acres that serve
as the final resting place for 85,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The 4,558-square-foot Spanish Revival-style building houses
administrative offices, archival exhibits and a medal display. It now
sports a plaque, with a likeness of Hope and an inscription "on
behalf of all Veterans whose lives were touched by this legendary
performer."</TE>
<TE>   Largely unchanged since 1940, the building needs $2.1 million in
repairs, according to the Veterans Park Conservancy, a nonprofit
group founded in 1986 to help manage Veterans Park. The organization
plans to refurbish the chapel with a mix of public and private funds.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of the renaming ceremony, the conservancy mounted a
"Hope's Army" retrospective. It featured framed letters from
soldiers, sailors and others who had written to Hope over the years
to say how he had made them laugh when they felt like crying.</TE>
<TE>   One such letter was from a Minnesota mother who related what her
son had written from the Solomon Islands after Hope's entourage
stopped there in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Hope and the others were "a scream," the young man wrote, and the
female entertainers were "beautiful," but he couldn't figure out why
they would come "to a weather-beaten hole like this."</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old Marine died soon after, in his first battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I can never thank you enough," his mother wrote Hope, "for having
brought him those two hours of fun."</TE>

<LD>Here are tidbits from Bob Hope's monologues, told on USO tours over
five decades, from World War II to the Persian Gulf War:</LD>
<LD>   "Contrary to what you've heard, I did not entertain the troops at
Valley Forge."</LD>
<LD>   Opening line at many bases in Europe and the South Pacific:
"Welcome, fellow tourists."</LD>
<TE>   Opening line used when entering many a hospital ward: "OK,
everyone on their feet."</TE>
<TE>   In London, 1943: "Fellows, the folks at home are having a terrible
time about eggs. They can't get any powdered eggs at all. They've got
to use the old-fashioned kind you break open."</TE>
<TE>   At the Midshipman's School at Notre Dame, May 29, 1945: "Now I
know why they call this Notre Dame. There's notre dame in sight."</TE>
<TE>   "I asked one pilot how many successful parachute jumps he's made,
and he said, 'All of them.'"</TE>
<TE>   "The USO has taught me to say 'Kaopectate' in seven different
languages."</TE>
<TE>   In Naples, Christmas, 1963: "The last time I was in Naples, I
entertained on the USS Forrestal. They put that in mothballs ...
while I was onstage."</TE>
<TE>   Aboard an aircraft carrier, Jan. 18, 1967: "This ship stays at sea
a long time. They only go back to port when the chaplain asks to see
a chaplain.... To give you an idea how long these guys have been at
sea, they just made Phyllis Diller their pinup girl."</TE>

<HD>Tenet to Close Hospital in Marina del Rey</HD>
<DH>Health care: County officials say the shutdown of Daniel
Freeman facility will add to the burden on area emergency rooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. said Wednesday that it will close Daniel
Freeman Marina Hospital, just six months after acquiring the Marina
del Rey facility from a Catholic hospital chain.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of the 166-bed hospital and its emergency room--by
August at the latest--will add to the burden on nearby ERs, county
officials said. Nearly all of the county's 80 remaining emergency
rooms are crowded, and patients often are forced to wait hours before
they are seen by a doctor.</LD>
<LD>   But Tenet officials said they would keep Daniel Freeman Memorial,
the main 358-bed campus in Inglewood, open, and are seeking to expand
urgent-care services at a clinic at Los Angeles International
Airport.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Freeman Marina's closure is the second hospital shut by
Tenet in Los Angeles County this year. In January, Tenet announced it
would close St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena, along with its
emergency room, citing financial problems. St. Luke had 165 beds and
442 full- and part-time employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The net effect will be additional waits and longer transfer times
for paramedics," said Virginia Hastings, director of the Emergency
Medical Services Agency at the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Hastings acknowledged, though, that Daniel Freeman Memorial is far
more important to the county's emergency network than the Marina
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that all these hospitals are not going to stay
open," she said. "For us, it becomes a game of prioritizing."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Freeman Marina handled about 4,400 ambulance runs in 2001.
In the future, patients will have to be taken to five neighboring
hospitals, Daniel Freeman Chief Executive Harris Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, based in Santa Barbara, plans to put the Marina facility up
for sale in the next few days. At the same time, the firm will try to
find jobs within the Tenet system for the hospital's 350 employees or
help them find work elsewhere, Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet acquired the two Daniel Freeman hospitals in December for
$55 million from Carondelet Health System, based in St. Louis. The
two hospitals were losing $23 million a year, Koenig said, and the
Marina hospital treated only 40 acute-care patients per day.</TE>
<TE>   "This hospital has not been as successful as a lot of people would
like for it to be or thought it might be," Koenig said. "There are
not enough patients now, and there won't be enough patients in the
future to allow us to afford or attract the capital to do the
necessary upgrading of this hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates who fought Tenet's acquisition of Daniel
Freeman said the hospital chain has done exactly what they
feared--close the Marina hospital to sell the valuable land beneath
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The other shoe drops," said Maura Kealey, a health-care
coordinator with the Service Employees International Union, upon
learning of Marina's closure.</TE>
<TE>   "Marina hospital, while it's small, has an emergency room that is
vital-- vital to the people living in Marina del Rey, in Venice,"
said Kealey, whose union has frequently locked horns with Tenet. The
union fought to block the sale but does not represent Daniel Freeman
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the previous owners as a nonprofit, Marina was one of the
few places where the poor working people in Venice could go for
care," Kealey said. "This is a major loss for them."</TE>
<TE>   In approving the sale of the Daniel Freeman hospitals, California
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer required that Tenet operate the emergency
room at the larger Daniel Freeman campus in Inglewood for five years
and maintain the ER at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, which it
already owned, for the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is spending $7 million to enhance the Inglewood facility,
and has no plans to close it, even after its five-year obligation
ends, Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general did not require Tenet to keep the Marina
campus open. Tenet is required, however, to provide Marina-area
patients with transportation to other facilities until June 2005 to
ensure that they have continued access to health services, said
Sandra Michioku, the attorney general's spokeswoman. Details on how
that would work were not released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously disappointed about the closure," Michioku said.
"The concerns about possible closure did prompt us in our review to
require that residents in the area would continue to have access to
health facilities."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tenet also said Wednesday that it is working with the
county Emergency Medical Services Agency to begin accepting some
ambulance patients in stable condition at the Centinela Airport
Medical Clinic at LAX. If a final agreement is reached, the airport
facility would be the only urgent-care center in the county licensed
to accept 911 patients.</TE>
<TE>   If patients needed additional medical treatment in a hospital,
they would be transferred to the Daniel Freeman hospital in Inglewood
or Centinela Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Hastings said the airport facility would not play a major role in
the county's emergency network because it would only be able to
receive ambulances carrying patients with minor, non-life-threatening
injuries or illnesses. These conditions include minor cuts, broken
bones, nausea and diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect 911 to be using it very much because these
patients are so minor that often they're not transported," Hastings
said, adding that she envisions only five patients a day being taken
by ambulance to the airport clinic.</TE>
<TE>   But Koenig said the urgent-care facility could help alleviate some
congestion at emergency rooms. The clinic, opened in late 1986, sees
nearly 25,000 patients a year, but has the capacity for double that.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Doctor's Sexual Battery Conviction Is Voided</HD>
<DH>Law: Appeals court says former Laguna Niguel practitioner's
trial on sexual battery charges was compromised when the judge
questioned him in front of the jury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court Wednesday struck down the conviction of a
former Laguna Niguel doctor who had been accused of sexually
battering female patients.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th District Court of Appeals in Santa Ana ruled that Del
Dalton did not receive a fair trial because the judge unexpectedly
questioned him about the allegations in front of the jury.</LD>
<LD>   A jury convicted Dalton in 1999 of sexually battering three
patients.</LD>
<TE>   He was placed on probation and later lost his medical license.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Judge Pamela Iles brought the jury to Dalton's
office so they could view the alleged crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   It was during that visit that Dalton was sworn as a witness and
questioned by the judge in front of the jurors. Iles then allowed the
prosecutor, and even a juror, to cross-examine Dalton.</TE>
<TE>   At least part of the questioning took place outside the presence
of Dalton's lawyer, the appeals court noted.</TE>
<TE>   The former doctor maintained that his office was so small that it
would have been impossible to assault a patient without alerting
employees or other patients.</TE>
<TE>   The judge asked Dalton to explain why he had locks on his office
doors.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton's appeals lawyer, E. Nicholas Hansen, said the judge's
questioning was improper and violated his 5th Amendment protection
against self-incrimination. Dalton had no idea the judge would
subject him to questioning, Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   In its opinion, the appeals court called the questioning
"egregious" and noted that "there is no indication he was prepared
for questions by the court or the prosecutor at his office."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office has not decided
whether to ask the state supreme court to review the case, a
prosecutor said.</TE>

<LD>Police are trying to determine whether a Newport Beach woman who was
free on bail last week after fatally shooting a house guest killed a
second man before taking her own life.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives from three police departments are working the case.
Officials said the three dead people knew each other and at one point
all lived in the woman's apartment in a gated community of Newport
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Karen Mandilk, 41, was arrested May 16 in the shooting death of
Paul Emile Strazicich, 42, of Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Mandilk called police about 5:30 a.m. from her apartment and told
dispatchers that she shot Strazicich several times in self-defense
after he attacked her with a knife, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Steve
Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   Mandilk was held at the Orange County Jail but released after
posting $250,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office was investigating Strazicich's
death but had not yet filed charges against Mandilk, said Tori
Richards, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Mandilk called the Firing Line shooting range May 24 and asked for
directions and information on renting weapons at the range, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   She showed up at the public range about 9:45 p.m. and rented a
.38-caliber revolver.</TE>
<TE>   After half an hour of practice, a customer shooting near the woman
saw her fall. Police said Mandilk shot herself once in the head and
died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later at the Country Inn Suites in Costa Mesa, a cleaning
crew discovered the body of Neal Sheldon, 42, about 9:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   He had been hit in the head with an unidentified instrument or
weapon and died at the hotel, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Dale Birney said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon lived with Mandilk. He checked into the hotel for five
days and was killed May 23 or May 24.</TE>
<TE>   "All we know is that we have three people that have some
association with each other and they're all deceased," Birney said.
"We are looking at the possibility of her involvement in Mr.
Sheldon's death."</TE>
<TE>   According to records, Mandilk and Sheldon had moved to Newport
Beach from Florida in the mid-1980s and had been involved in at least
two lawsuits together in Orange County.</TE>

<TE>   "It was her first time there and the staff didn't notice any

said. "She was getting firing lessons and proper techniques from the
firearms enthusiasts."</TE>
<TE>   But after half an hour of practice, a customer shooting near the

<HD>Assembly OKs Tax Credits for Film Work</HD>
<DH>Capitol: As lawmakers rush to meet deadline for bills, the
Senate approves a $9-billion bond for a high-speed rail line and the
lower house passes a minimum wage measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Hoping to curb the exodus of movie and television shoots to Canada,
the California Assembly approved legislation Wednesday to give
smaller Hollywood productions a 15% credit against the state wage
tax.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate also approved a $9-billion bond to help build a
high-speed rail line down the middle of the state, and the Assembly
passed a measure to have the state's minimum wage automatically rise
to keep up with inflation.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous other measures were debated Wednesday as the lawmakers
rushed to meet the Legislature's deadline to pass bills from their
house of origin by month's end. All the bills still need to go
through the other house, then back to their house of origin for a
second approval, and finally must obtain the signature of Gov. Gray
Davis before becoming law.</LD>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, the Assembly passed legislation by Assemblyman
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) to allow welfare recipients to continue
going to college at public expense past a time limit imposed by the
state's welfare reforms, and the Senate approved a measure by Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) to create an Office
of Homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   The bill to target so-called runaway productions to Canada, AB
2747 by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), garnered strong
bipartisan support and passed the Assembly 68 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on the commercial shoots, television movies and
independent films that have been going north to save money, it would
give the wage-tax credit to California productions with employee
wages between $200,000 and $10 million, provided that at least 50% of
the production take place in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Runaway productions have cost California roughly 18,000 jobs in
the last year--a 12% drop in such employment, according to Wesson's
office, which has worked on the bill with organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is for the guy that moves the camera. This is for the makeup
lady," Wesson said in an interview, adding that his bill would not
affect "the Leonardo DiCaprio kind of movies" with big budgets and
high-priced stars.</TE>
<TE>   Because California is facing a $23.6-billion budget deficit this
year, the tax credit would not take effect until 2004; it would last
until 2009.</TE>
<TE>   The high-speed rail bill by Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno), SB 1856,
would ask voters to approve a $9-billion bond to start construction
of a 700-mile rail system linking all of the state's major
metropolitan areas and modeled on bullet trains in Europe and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds would help cover the first leg of the system, linking
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Supporters contend that with a
combination of state, private and federal funding, the trains, which
would travel at speeds of up to 200 mph, eventually could also link
San Diego and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents said such a rail line would help relieve worsening
congestion on California streets and at major airports. Other
countries have demonstrated that high-speed rail lines are among the
"most efficient, least costly and least polluting ways to move
people," said Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena).</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) charged the proposal
would gobble up money better spent on adding new freeway lanes. He
denounced it as an "outrageously expensive boondoggle."</TE>
<TE>   The minimum-wage bill by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West
Hollywood), AB 2242, would automatically increase the wage, currently
$6.75, to account for inflation. Koretz argued that slowly raising
the minimum wage would help businesses by shielding them from the
shock of the large wage hikes the state has imposed.</TE>
<TE>   But most Republicans opposed the measure, arguing that minimum
wage hikes inevitably drive up employers' costs, leading them to cut
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the liveliest debate Wednesday centered on a proposal to
increase the share of California's marriage license fee set aside for
county domestic violence programs. A portion of the fee, which ranges
from $45 to $70 depending on the county, already goes toward the
programs. The bill, SB 1618 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
would raise it by $10 to $33 per license. It passed 27-12.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said options to finance domestic violence programs are
limited.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans said the bill would only compound the financial
burdens facing young newlyweds.</TE>
<TE>   "How about a rebate?" said Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside). "If the
husband can go two years without beating his wife, he ought to get a
rebate."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Senate killed a bill that would have required pet
dealers and breeders to pay an unspecified "registration fee" on
every puppy and kitten they sell. Revenue from SB 1373 would have
financed local databases for use in identifying animals that had been
abandoned, stolen or lost.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach plastic surgeon is being investigated by the
Osteopathic Medical Board of California following the death of a
patient, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Maryellen Fleury, 44, of Santa Ana died at her home Monday, three
days after undergoing liposuction and breast augmentation procedures
by Amy Bandy, a certified plastic surgeon who also has an office in
Lawndale.</LD>
<LD>   Fleury died of bilateral pulmonary embolism--blood clots in the
lungs--said Deputy Orange County Coroner Cullen Ellensburg.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a complication that we find in all types of surgeries,"
Ellensburg said.</TE>
<TE>   The osteopathic board has begun an investigation to determine
whether there was any negligence.</TE>
<TE>   Officials will request patient records and obtain an independent
review from a board-certified plastic surgeon. If Bandy is found to
have been negligent, she could face disciplinary action ranging from
censure to a license revocation, said Linda Bergmann, executive
director of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury's family has not filed a complaint against Bandy, and there
are no early indications of wrongdoing based on the coroner's report.
Investigations are fairly common following a patient death, Bergmann
said.</TE>

<LD>The judge who ruled that a key method of assessing property in Orange
County is unconstitutional said this week that he will not hand off
the case to another judge.</LD>
<LD>   Judge John M. Watson denied Treasurer-Tax Collector John
Moorlach's request for a second opinion of the case to test Watson's
interpretation of the law before it is applied.</LD>
<LD>   In December, Watson found that Orange County Assessor Webster J.
Guillory violated Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 tax reform. He
ruled that Guillory illegally raised the assessed value of a home by
more than the 2%-a-year limit.</LD>
<TE>   County attorneys defended the practice, saying properties are
routinely assessed increases of more than 2% when values have dropped
and later rebound.</TE>

<LD>Rachael Pabis will rely on her cheeks, lips and teeth to form a smile
tonight instead of using her fingers to type one. And any pauses in
conversations will not involve her usual e-mail ellipses.</LD>
<LD>   Pabis, who lives in Lansing, N.Y., is a member of the first class
to graduate from Cal State Northridge's online master's degree
program in speech pathology. The online effort was designed to
attract more students to speech pathology courses, university
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which allows students to take all their master's
courses via the Internet, will graduate 24 students, many of whom
will meet one another for the first time at the ceremony on campus
tonight.</LD>
<TE>   "We get to know everybody's name and their family through their
[Internet] postings," said Pabis, 27, who has taken the Internet
classes since they began three years ago. Each class has a chat room
on the Web, she said, "that kind of made it like a classroom forum
online."</TE>
<TE>   While courses that do not require attendance on campus have been
popping up all over the Web, online degree programs are uncommon,
state education officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there are 16 master's or bachelor's degree programs
offered online at five Cal State campuses. An online master's degree
program in criminology is scheduled to start at UC Irvine in winter
2003, said Lavonne Luquis, director of educational outreach and
admissions communication for the University of California system.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of distance learning have argued that the experience is
impersonal, lacking in quality and too easy to taint by cheating.
However, students say they learn all the same information and still
manage to make friends in the process. Several said they hope the
master's degree will help them open a private speech therapy practice
or earn more money at their current jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Litchfield, 51, said the Northridge program was convenient.
"This program lets you work and go back to school," said Litchfield,
who has been working as a speech therapist since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   With the online program, Litchfield, who lives in San Dimas and
works for San Bernardino County schools, was able to attend her son's
out-of-state baseball and football games and get her schoolwork done.
"You wouldn't believe all the papers I wrote in hotel rooms," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Genie Stearns, 27, of Temecula said once she got into the practice
of doing the work on her own, it was a cinch.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a rough day at work I'd get into my PJs or sweats or
whatever and do my work," said Stearns, who works as a speech
therapist in Fullerton schools. Stearns said all the lectures are
online, so there's no note-taking. The students are mailed videos and
CD-ROMs that may contain lectures or demonstrate different speech
therapy techniques. And there's technical support available if the
students have any problems with their computer equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "My computer crashed once, but the professors were very
understanding," Stearns said. And when she was pregnant with her
daughter, she was able to continue with her classes despite feeling
ill at times. "It was just nice to curl up with the books in bed
instead of going into a classroom," she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the most recent data available from the National
Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of four-year public
institutions offering distance education courses rose from 62% in
1995 to 79% two years later. In addition, 12% more of the
institutions had planned to offer distance education by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Jana Everhart, 33, of Mentone, said she had originally applied to
CSUN's traditional speech pathology program. But the online program,
which was starting soon, allowed her to keep her job.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of apprehensive at first about what all it would
entail about using the computer," said Everhart, who, at the time,
was only familiar with word processing. But she soon got the hang of
it and was able to do group projects through e-mails, over the phone
and with occasional meetings with classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Pabis said she would not have been able to finish her studies if
she had had to attend classes on campus.</TE>
<TE>   She said she moved from Los Angeles to New York earlier this year
to take care of her ailing mother, who has since died. She has been
working as a speech therapist with the Ithaca City School District,
taking care of her three younger siblings and studying by home
computer. To get through her schoolwork, she said: "I would kind of
just shut the world out."</TE>

<HD>A Rising Tide of Typos Makes the Official Start of Summer
More Memorable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer--and therefore time
for our Special Jubilee Beach Edition. I just dived into the ocean of
items on my desk and all I can say is: Come on in--the typos are
fine!</LD>
<LD>   Today's selections (see accompanying) include:</LD>
<LD>   * A guarantee from an air-conditioning company that could be
accused of blowing a lot of hot air (submitted by Peggy Maher of
Mission Viejo).</LD>
<TE>   * Our yearly "Duh!" item about a certain windshield hindrance to
driving (from Suzan Moore of Lomita).</TE>
<TE>   * A tanning parlor's marquee in beach-deprived Houston (snapped by
Jackson Sleet of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   * And, for those worried about their physiques, a company that
will tighten your stomach, as well as repair your car frame (from
Harriet Klein of Palm Springs).</TE>
<TE>   What will they think of next? Margaret Smith of Mission Viejo saw
a mention of a bathing suit made of a fabric that was advertised as
being--get this!--"washable."</TE>
<TE>   For those who never want to leave the beach: Dan Huston of Laguna
Beach noticed that one cemetery was selling "ocean view" plots--just
the thing, Huston figures, "for the buyers of glass-topped coffins."</TE>
<TE>   Surf City North: Mention was made here of the Trade Winds' 1965
hit, "New York's a Lonely Town," about a Southland board-rider whose
family moves to the East Coast. The song implied that Pasadena was a
surf mecca.</TE>
<TE>   But Carlo Panno reminded me that it was unique for another reason.
The line "From Central Park to Pasadena's such a long way" was
followed in one version by the words "And there's no KRLA"--a
reference to a popular Pasadena-based rock station of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The same version of the song went on to say "I feel so out of it
walking down Broadway/Sure do miss KRLA."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the producers of the song were playing kissy-face with
KRLA," said Steve Propes, author of the book "L.A. R&amp;B Vocal Groups."
"That's the only song I can recall that mentions a station's call
letters."</TE>
<TE>   KRLA is now a talk station. Sure do miss the old KRLA.</TE>
<TE>   A name that doesn't hold a lot of water: In a Sunset magazine ad,
my colleague Paul Duginski noticed that the city of Costa Mesa brags
about its shopping sites, cuisine and "endless miles of breathtaking
beaches."</TE>
<TE>   Which is interesting because Costa Mesa has no beaches. Snooty old
Newport Beach is blocking its way.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, there's a movement afoot to change Costa Mesa's name.
To Not-on-the-Costa Mesa? Not on your life. Believe it or not, a
local citizens group wants to make it Costa Mesa By-the-Sea, further
misleading gullible tourists from such inland cities as Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   If the Costa Mesa group wants an eye-catching name, maybe it
should re-adopt the one the area was once known by: Goat Hill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Don't know if you heard, but Southland spots were
largely snubbed in the annual "Best Beaches" survey of Dr. Stephen
Leatherman, a professor at the International Hurricane Center at
Florida International University.</TE>
<TE>   The only local beach to make the list was Carpinteria, at No. 19.
Just by coincidence, I'm sure, the Florida professor included seven
Florida beaches in the Top 20. The survey made no mention of Costa
Mesa.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For the second time in a month, Gov. Gray Davis fired his director of
e-government Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation brings to four the number of administration
officials who have been forced to quit or have been suspended pending
investigations into circumstances surrounding the state's $95-million
software contract with Oracle Corp. and other matters related to
state contracts with high-tech firms.</LD>
<LD>   In a brief statement, Davis said he had "accepted the resignation"
of Vin Patel, interim director of e-government.</LD>
<TE>   The governor appointed Patel to the post May 5 after forcing the
resignation of the previous e-government director, Arun Baheti.
Baheti accepted a $25,000 donation to the Davis campaign last June
from an Oracle lobbyist shortly after the company won the $95-million
licensing contract.</TE>
<TE>   Davis gave no details on the reasons for seeking Patel's ouster.
Patel had worked in the administration since 1999.</TE>

<LD>Linda Grinberg, 51, a film collection librarian who became an AIDS
activist after she was diagnosed with the disease in 1991, died
Monday of complications from AIDS at her home in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A Cal State Northridge graduate with a degree in English, Grinberg
was chief executive and librarian of the Sherman Grinberg Film
Libraries, a Hollywood film collection started by her late father.
After the firm was sold, she worked as a film producer.</LD>
<LD>   Stricken with AIDS, Grinberg devoted her efforts to several
organizations to assist patients and established the Foundation for
AIDS and Immune Research to fund and promote research. She was also a
co-founder of the Fair Pricing Coalition, an organization that works
with the pharmaceutical industry to reduce prices of prescription
drugs for people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</LD>
<TE>   Because of her advocacy, writing and donations, she received the
Project Inform Activism Award in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Grinberg also volunteered for aggressive new forms of AIDS drug
treatment, saying in an interview that her constant goal since her
diagnosis had become "buying time, buying time."</TE>

<HD>Playa Vista School Plan Is Up in the Air</HD>
<DH>Growth: Contaminated land may scuttle the idea of a campus
in the massive development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Its planners say the new Playa Vista development on Los Angeles'
Westside will be a hip version of a small town, with its own fire
station, restaurants, public library, parks and exclusive ZIP Code:
90094.</LD>
<LD>   What it lacks, however, is space for a public school, usually a
touchstone for any real community.</LD>
<LD>   As the first 400 of as many as 30,000 residents move into the
nascent neighborhood, Playa Vista's developers face the task of
keeping their promise to provide four acres for a new elementary
school while meeting the stringent environmental standards required
for new Los Angeles Unified School District campuses.</LD>
<TE>   The first proposed school site at Playa Vista includes land where
Hughes Aircraft personnel used to drench plane fuselages with
flammable liquids in firefighting drills. If chemical solvents in the
ground can't be cleaned up, an alternative school site may be
offered. Another possibility is to scrap the Playa Vista school
proposal and, instead, add onto existing campuses outside the
development's borders.</TE>
<TE>   The Playa Vista school plan reflects the difficulty the school
district faces as it begins its 10-year campaign to build 150
campuses in a region pocked by abandoned oil fields and naturally
occurring underground gases. The district has become especially
cautious since environmental problems nearly derailed the Belmont
Learning Complex in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Playa Vista school is also a test of the district's resolve to
knit new schools into the fabric of their communities.</TE>
<TE>   "When you link schools to neighborhoods and neighborhoods to
schools, you build identity," said David Abel, chairman of New
Schools/Better Neighborhoods, a nonprofit organization. "Playa could
intelligently build a school that is at the center of the community
from the very beginning."</TE>
<TE>   But if the district can't make that happen in a neighborhood being
built from scratch, observers wonder, what chance does it have in
dozens of established communities around the city where homes and
stores might have to be demolished to make room?</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists have seized on the proposed school site to
advance their long-standing objections to the entire Playa Vista
development, which covers part of the former airplane production
facility at the edge of the Ballona Wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists unsuccessfully sought to block Playa Vista,
saying the area should be preserved for wildlife and flood control.
Still, the project's scale has been reduced in the past year, with
more acreage being designated as parkland even as the first
apartments are opening.</TE>
<TE>   In the neighborhoods just outside Playa Vista, residents worry
that the planned K-8 campus will not be enough to accommodate rising
student populations. Playa Vista developers estimate that the new
neighborhood between Culver City and Marina del Rey will be home to
1,300 school-age students by 2006. District demographers say that
number could be as high as 3,000 by the time the entire project is
done in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a debate over a four-acre site when we really
probably need two or three elementary schools and middle schools and
a high school around there," said David Tokofsky, a Los Angeles
school board member.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Robert Maguire first promised to provide about
$16million in developer fees and a four-acre property to the district
in 1993. Playa Capital, a group of investment bankers and lenders led
by Global Crossing founder Gary Winnick and former mayoral candidate
Steve Soboroff, now controls the property and says it will honor that
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed school site sits on the southwest side of the
1,087-acre Playa Vista project, east of Lincoln Boulevard near
proposed athletic fields and an ecological and cultural information
center.</TE>
<TE>   Kathi Littmann, a senior L.A. Unified building official, raised
early concerns about the property. She previously was a consultant
for DreamWorks SKG when that company considered establishing a movie
studio at Playa Vista. Littmann said her DreamWorks experience gave
her "specific information" about possible pollution problems at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   In an October 2001 letter to the district's general counsel, L.A.
Unified real estate consultant Edwin Van Ginkel wrote that the site
was "unacceptable ... due to acknowledged methane releases that have
been identified in portions of the Playa Vista site." In interviews,
district officials said they were even more concerned about chemical
solvents in the former fire pit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the district was trying to salvage the half-built
Belmont high school, where revelations about underground toxins had
halted construction for two years.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the school board approved an extensive remediation plan
to finish Belmont, ballooning that campus' cost to $375million.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days later, Littmann sent Playa Capital a clarification
letter suggesting that the proposed elementary school site would work
if it passed muster with the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone interview last week, Soboroff downplayed hazards posed
by methane and other toxins beneath the development, and said his
firm will eventually provide a school property "that will meet every
single standard for safety and environmental remediation."</TE>
<TE>   The developers also suggest that they might offer another nearby
4-acre site for a school. That second option would require some
environmental mitigation for methane, they said, but chemical
solvents are unlikely to be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   If neither property is acceptable, district officials said they
might devote developer fees from Playa Vista to pay for expansions
and 160 classroom trailers at nine existing Westside campuses. That
contingency plan calls for those schools to dramatically increase
enrollments--some would double--and go to year-round schedules.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say final decisions about the proposed Playa
Vista school can wait.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 80 schools to finish now," Littmann said. "This is not
going to be a priority school until 2006."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Marlene Canter, who represents the area, said
that if the site could be made safe, it would be a good idea to build
a K-8 magnet school with an environmental studies theme to take
advantage of the nearby wetlands preserve.</TE>
<TE>   But she said a bigger issue for her constituents is overcrowding
at nearby high schools. For example, Westchester High plans to set up
30 classroom trailers in its parking lot to absorb 700 additional
students in the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Tokofsky said Playa Vista should have been
required to set aside much more land for schools, even for a high
school.</TE>
<TE>   Playa Capital executives said they never considered a high school
because district negotiators never broached the subject. Canter and
other L.A. Unified officials said they might bring it up.</TE>
<TE>   Without any school there, Playa Vista's upscale homes, offices,
cafes and parks would still fall short of a real neighborhood,
stressed Abel of New Schools/Better Neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the perfect opportunity to make this school the public
center of this new neighborhood, where youth can interact with an
array of adults," said Abel.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively small schools close to homes strengthen community ties

<HD>UCI Students Pitch Tents to Protest Housing Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 125 UC Irvine students set up a tent city on campus Wednesday
to protest the university's plan to boost the number of heavily
recruited graduate students who get first claim to campus housing.</LD>
<LD>   Those special slots for an estimated 50 to 75 beginning graduate
students will mean an equal number of the university's current grad
students will continue waiting for cheap campus housing. Some already
have been on the list for more than two years in a community where
little inexpensive off-campus housing is available.</LD>
<LD>   "There are graduate students I know of who are literally sleeping
with friends and in their offices," said Michael Latner, a doctoral
candidate in political science and vice president of external affairs
for UCI Associated Graduate Students. "There's no affordable housing
in Irvine."</LD>
<TE>   UCI is using the lure of cheaper campus housing to attract
top-flight grad students at a time when the university, along with
other UC campuses, says a dearth of grad students is threatening its
academic rankings.</TE>
<TE>   A fact sheet circulated from UCI's graduate housing office said
the campus "has determined that recruitment of graduate students to
this University is among the highest UCI priorities."</TE>
<TE>   At dusk Wednesday, protesters gathered in Aldrich Park at the
center of campus. On one of about 20 tents, a sign read "Cicerone
Projects," a reference to UCI Chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone.</TE>
<TE>   As their children played, some grad student protesters barbecued
hot dogs, hamburgers and veggie burgers. No campus security was in
evidence, and few other students paid attention to the protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Some 1,150 UCI graduate students, or about 40%, live on campus.
That is the highest proportion of any UC campus.</TE>
<TE>   The university's plan means that about 20% of new graduate
students will jump to the front of the line for campus housing,
according to a May 21 letter from the housing office. The wait for
single students has been 13 to 18 months, and 22 to 24 months for
families, according to the housing office.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials acknowledge the housing shortage, but relief is two
to three years away, when two projects are expected to add more than
1,000 beds for graduate students.</TE>
<TE>   UCI rental units range from $574 a month for a studio apartment to
$1,332 for the most expensive three-bedroom. Average rents in Orange
County range from $893 for a studio to $1,750 for a three bedroom,
two bath, according to Realfacts, a Novato firm that tracks housing
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the concern the graduate students have, and I'm in
sympathy," said Jim Craig, UCI's director of housing. "I know the
housing market in Irvine is a difficult market. I understand the
concerns. We're building as fast as we can."</TE>
<TE>   The students are angry that of the 250 openings expected in
graduate housing this summer, 205 are reserved for recent recruits,
an increase of 50 to 75 spaces from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Davis, president of the campus' graduate student
organization, said the administration is considering increasing the
number of priority slots to 500. Craig said no decision has been
made, although discussions have been taking place.</TE>
<TE>   The housing office said no student housing for those on the
waiting list is expected until the fall semester.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Davis and other students said, is that they already
will have had to sign leases for privately owned housing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Cicerone and Manuel Gomez, UCI's vice chancellor for
student services, had agreed to come by later Wednesday to talk with
a small group of students.</TE>

<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District will scale back its plan to
build 11 elementary schools because of rising costs, but officials
said they can still meet capacity targets by increasing the size of
the campuses to be built.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a $145-million construction bond that passed in 1999 and
an expected $185 million in state matching funds, the district lacks
the money to build all the schools that were planned, district board
president John Palacio said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The district expects to cut two elementary schools from the list
and will increase the capacity of the nine remaining campuses from
650 to 850.</LD>

<HD>Women From Rehab Center in Oxnard Fear Eviction</HD>
<DH>Parks: City officials propose turning two old structures
used by the drug and alcohol program into a farm heritage museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the past 17 years, women of the Rainbow Recovery Center have made
two old farmhouses in Oxnard's College Park their home as they
battled alcohol and drug addictions.</LD>
<LD>   Now city officials are proposing to turn the structures into a
farm heritage museum as part of a $12-million upgrade of the park.</LD>
<LD>   Next month the city will unveil plans for the 75-acre property it
recently took over from the county. Plans include new soccer and
baseball fields, a dog park, jogging track and pool.</LD>
<TE>   At the park's north end, the Ventura County History and Art Museum
hopes to convert the farmhouses now occupied by the recovery center
into a museum celebrating the county's agricultural history, with a
collection of farm tools, machinery and photos. A children's
education center would also be included.</TE>
<TE>   Plans do not include the Rainbow Recovery Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Schiffer, executive director of the county museum, said
evicting the center's tenants was not his intention.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't enter this with the idea of 'let's get rid of these
Rainbow ladies and get rid of their house,'" said Schiffer, adding
that the controversy "has been passed on to us."</TE>
<TE>   Now the "Rainbow ladies," as they are known around town, are
fearful of what might happen to them should the city move forward
with its park plans. The City Council is set to vote on the matter
June 18.</TE>
<TE>   "The city needs us," Nancy Williams, a counselor at the center,
told the City Council last week. "We build human lives. You can't
replace that with machinery."</TE>
<TE>   Williams was among about 40 supporters who showed up at the
council meeting to voice their concerns. The supporters received
assurances from council members that they would explore alternative
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope would be that neither development hurt the other," Mayor
Manuel Lopez said. But if a compromise cannot be reached, Lopez said
he would suggest the museum find a different location.</TE>
<TE>   One possible site is the old Oxnard High School near the city's
historic district, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer to have the recovery center stay where it is
because they have been there 17 years offering rehab," Lopez said. "I
think any time you cause them to move, there is a possibility the
program could be disrupted."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the center where it is also appeals to county Supervisor
John Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard. "The Rainbow house serves
a nice purpose," Flynn said. "I think it should stay there. People
are more important than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn has written letters to the council in support of the Rainbow
center, but said that does not mean he wants to kill the museum idea.
There are enough spaces elsewhere in the city to house the museum, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This should not be put into the context of the Rainbow center
versus the museum," he said. "That's not productive to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The recovery center appears to have time on its side. The city has
yet to set a groundbreaking date and is still investigating ways to
pay for the park improvements, including tapping into a $2.6-billion
statewide bond measure approved by voters in March.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rainbow center women won't be at ease until they are
included in the city's official plan, center Executive Director
Kathleen McQuillan said.</TE>
<TE>   The center's two farmhouses--which date from the early 1900s--sit
at Channel Islands and Rose boulevards on the city's south side. A
huge red and white banner that hangs from the larger house reads:
"Save Rainbow, Save Lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Rainbow center provides treatment--from 30 days to six
months--for women who are alcohol- or drug-addicted. Services are
offered on a sliding scale pay rate, though many of the women who
approach the center are penniless, McQuillan said. No one is turned
away, and funding comes from the county, United Way and private
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "We serve the population that no one wants to serve. It's not just
a house," said Pat Williams, Rainbow's program director. Finding
another location for the center would be difficult because of the
stigma against people with drug addictions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve women now live in the larger house, which has more
intensive counseling, while six reside in the smaller house, where
they are expected to live sober and free of drugs on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The women have filled the houses with tables covered in lacy
cloths, pin-neat carpets and country throws draped over couches. The
bedrooms have twin beds.</TE>
<TE>   Next to each bed are photos of the women's children. Since many of
the women no longer have custody, the goal is to clean up and get the
children back, McQuillan said. The center's success rate of those who
remain free of drugs and alcohol is about 65%, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Sabrina Anne Garcia, 18, said she has lived at the center
for more than a month. She said she had been homeless and had nowhere
else to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my home," Garcia said. "It's all I have."</TE>

<HD>Baca Says He Will Release 400 Inmates</HD>
<DH>Safety: Sheriff calls the action necessary because of
looming budget cutbacks. A chorus of criticism greets his plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday it will
release jail inmates being held on bail amounts of $25,000 or less
beginning Friday to cope with budget cutbacks.</LD>
<LD>   About 400 inmates who are accused of committing misdemeanor crimes
such as burglary, vandalism and battery will be released on a written
promise to appear in court, sheriff's officials said. Inmates facing
domestic violence charges, crimes against children or probation
violations will remain in custody. The action by Sheriff Lee Baca is
reminiscent of ones taken by his predecessor, the late Sherman Block,
during similar budget spats with the county Board of Supervisors in
the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no choice," Al Scaduto, chief of correctional services
for the Sheriff's Department, said Wednesday. "If we don't have the
funds to operate these facilities, we have no options."</LD>
<TE>   The move was met with strong reactions from supervisors,
prosecutors and judges.</TE>
<TE>   "This action suggests that his lowest priority is keeping these
prisoners in jail," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "I can't believe
he is serious, and if he is, he'll have to deal with his
constituency.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 100 things he could do before releasing prisoners ...
like selling his airplane, canceling the training program for upper
management and a host of others," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   A commander from the Sheriff's Department called the Superior
Court on Wednesday afternoon to inform the judges of the plan. In a
letter to the court, Baca cited the county board's proposed budget
that would cut $100 million from the department this year.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising Criminal Judge Dan Oki wrote to fellow judges that the
court is researching whether the sheriff has the legal authority to
release inmates once bail has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Scaduto said state law gives the Sheriff's Department the right to
release inmates awaiting trial for misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Baca also wrote that he will soon be forced to
close the Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood, which houses
as many as 2,000 inmates daily. The Sheriff's Department has to make
room for those inmates elsewhere by releasing defendants with bails
lower than $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley responded Wednesday by urging his deputy
district attorneys to go to court and request higher bails for
defendants who they believe should remain in custody. Cooley said he
believes it is likely that many of the released defendants will
either become fugitives or will commit new crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he empathizes with Baca's budget problems, but that he
doesn't believe releasing inmates is the best response. Cooley said
the Sheriff's Department should not arbitrarily disregard judges'
decisions on bail. "That's not the way it's supposed to work," Cooley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Baca urged prosecutors not to ask for higher bails than usual, and
he said he would begin the early release of inmates who have been
convicted and are already serving time. Those inmates would be
released based on completion of a percentage of their sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "While these proposals may appear to jeopardize public safety and
compromise the legal system, my Department must find a way to provide
those services that are mandated by law and contractual agreements,"
Baca wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The policy could cause problems with some prosecutions if
defendants fail to show up for trial, said Mary McGuire, spokeswoman
for the Los Angeles city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "But we will make every to effort to ensure that those who need to
be in custody are kept in custody, even if it means requesting bail
in excess of $25,000," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. John A. Pasquariello, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department, said the inmates' release will not require any special
deployment of law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are convinced the sheriff will not release anyone violent or
under the influence of drugs or alcohol," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a concern any time inmates are released, but, given the
guidelines under which they will be released, we are not anticipating
any problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement caught county supervisors by surprise. Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said that if Baca does release the inmates,
"he has to bear responsibility for the crimes that these people
commit."</TE>
<TE>   Burke added that there are responsible ways to manage with the
budget. "I think this is very irresponsible," she said. "It does not
increase his credibility during this budget process."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Baca has launched an all-out public relations
battle to protect his resources and gather public support, including
packing a recent supervisors' meeting with hundreds of deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials have said they plan to cut staffing and
eliminate task forces on hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   They have also told key specialized units--including the family
crimes and narcotics bureaus, among others--that they would probably
have to reassign deputies to patrol jobs if the budget is cut.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the Sheriff's Department has planned to
release inmates because of budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1995, then-Sheriff Sherman Block announced the release of
about 3,000 inmates because of budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   The inmates released then were serving sentences for misdemeanors
and "low-grade" felonies, such as drunk driving and burglary.</TE>
<TE>   Block had repeatedly threatened to make such early releases and to
close jails during budget skirmishes with the Board of Supervisors.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana District Takes 2 Campuses Off Building List</HD>
<DH>Education: Rising costs prompt scaling back plans to nine
new schools. Target of 200 pupils at each facility will be met,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Unified School District will scale back its plan to
build 11 elementary schools because of rising costs, but officials
said they can still meet capacity targets by increasing the size of
the campuses to be built.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a $145-million construction bond that passed in 1999 and
an expected $185 million in state matching funds, the district lacks
the money to build all the schools that were planned, district board
president John Palacio said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The district expects to cut two elementary schools from the list
and will increase the capacity of the nine remaining campuses from
650 to 850.</LD>
<TE>   "What we can do with 11," Palacio said, "we can still do with
nine."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came during a board meeting Tuesday at which
trustees were updated about the progress of construction projects
tied to funds from Measure C.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana voters approved the bond initiative three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The district is expected to break ground on two high schools this
fall as planned.</TE>
<TE>   But district officials said they have been hampered by rising
construction costs, a scarcity of land in the city and time-consuming
state requirements.</TE>
<TE>   It takes months for the state to approve applications for matching
funds, Palacio said, and recent changes in environmental guidelines
for school sites have made it more difficult to find suitable land.</TE>
<TE>   "The bureaucracy is killing us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime, the price of property is going up."</TE>
<TE>   When Measure C was passed, the local real estate market had
experienced a downturn, but in recent years a heated real estate
market has driven up property prices and construction costs,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have alleged the board has not acted quickly enough on the
projects and is paying too much to consultants, including Los
Angeles-based project manager Del Terra Real Estate Services Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The company will receive 2.5% of the estimated $330 million worth
of Measure C projects.</TE>
<TE>   The pay, district officials said, is well below prevailing market
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, board member Nadia Davis last month called for an
independent assessment of the Del Terra contract after some district
officials received an anonymous letter alleging political payback.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. Al Mijares said Wednesday he had been aware of the
letter before Davis' request.</TE>
<TE>   He said he took the letter to the Orange County Department of
Education's legal counsel in March and that an outside lawyer has
been hired to evaluate the Del Terra contract.</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said other districts that have passed bond measures in
recent years also have had to reevaluate their projects because of
rising costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew from the start that Measure C was not going to meet all
of our needs, but we had to start somewhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The negative, of course, is you are going to put more kids in
each school," Mijares said, "but 850 is a good number, it is not
considered excessive," and is below average for the district.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio predicted all projects will be completed within five
years. Earlier this month, the district declared eminent domain on a
lot near the Santa Ana Freeway for an elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   The district will get land in the closed Tustin Marine Corps Air
Station, but that 22 acres will be enough for one school, grades
kindergarten through eight.</TE>

<HD>Harbor Secession Won't Be on November Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: Panel says plan isn't financially viable, but
could be revived for 2004. The decision might help L.A. in its effort
to defeat the Valley and Hollywood drives.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A three-year campaign to split the harbor area off from Los Angeles
ran aground Wednesday when a commission voted to keep the secession
plan off the Nov. 5 ballot and study whether fiscal problems in the
proposal can be fixed in time for the 2004 election.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision by the Local Agency Formation Commission
could have implications for similar cityhood bids by the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood. Secession backers in those regions had hoped
that a breakaway measure for the harbor area would help all three
proposals win on the same citywide ballot.</LD>
<LD>   LAFCO put the Valley secession plan on the ballot last week, and
is set to decide Wednesday whether to approve the Hollywood proposal
for the fall election. Commissioners said Wednesday that the panel
was likely to decide in favor of a Hollywood vote.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a feeling something will be on the ballot," said LAFCO
Chairman Henri Pellissier.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks promising," said Commissioner Beatrice Proo.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over Los Angeles' future is shaping up as a two-front
fight, with the biggest prize by far being the Valley, population
1.35 million. About 160,000 people live in Hollywood. Together, the
two areas account for about 40% of the city's residents and half its
land.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's decision spared Mayor James K. Hahn, who lives in San
Pedro, the uncomfortable prospect of having to stump against
secession by his own neighborhood. A harbor ballot measure would have
proposed a city comprised of San Pedro and Wilmington, with 141,000
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have hurt the [citywide] anti-secession campaign,"
political consultant Harvey Englander said. "Fighting a three-front
battle is almost impossible. Fighting a two-front battle is easier."</TE>
<TE>   All the secession bids grew out of petition drives that gathered
the signatures of 25% of the registered voters in each region. The
harbor petitions were submitted to LAFCO in 1999. Secession
sentiments in the area, however, have been simmering for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor cityhood supporters would not have to circulate more
petitions to pursue an election in 2004. State law requires that
secession elections be held only in even-numbered years, when
statewide contests are on the ballot and promise a higher voter
turnout..</TE>
<TE>   To win, each secession plan must capture a majority of voters in
the breakaway area and a majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   While secessionists said they would appeal the commission's
decision, LAFCO members offered little hope that the proposal could
be revived before 2004, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not ready for prime time. It's not ready for November 2002,"
said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a LAFCO member. "I'm not sure
they would be ready for prime time in 2004 either."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine concluded May 11 that a
harbor city would not have enough revenue to provide services on a
par with those delivered by Los Angeles. Under state law, a secession
measure that would create a city with such fiscal troubles cannot go
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine's study found that the harbor area generates $52 million
less in tax revenue than Los Angeles spends on city services there.
As a result, a new city would have to significantly cut services or
raise taxes to balance its budget, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The harbor secessionists revised their proposal with the aim of
reversing Calemine's determination. They proposed boundary changes
that would have added some tax-generating industrial areas to a new
city. They also said a harbor municipality could save money by
contracting for police protection with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, instead of the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine told LAFCO on Wednesday that he could not complete an
analysis of the secessionists' altered plan in time to get the
measure on the ballot this year. "It's impossible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists said they will press on for an election, even if
their appeal fails next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing because I'd like to see us go in November,"
said Andrew Rafkin, president of the Harbor Study Foundation. "But it
is more encouraging to have a delay than to have it all shot down and
lose three years of work."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the idea of harbor cityhood should be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, every analysis has shown that the harbor area would not
be able to survive on its own and more studies will only come to the
same conclusion," Hahn said. "Continuing to study harbor secession is
a waste of taxpayers' money."</TE>
<TE>   Some harbor area business people also urged LAFCO to reject the
cityhood proposal outright as infeasible. James Cross, past president
of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, said that leaving open the
possibility of a 2004 election prolongs uncertainty that could slow
business growth in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Calemine said a Hollywood city would have to pay
the rest of Los Angeles $21.3 million the first year to cover revenue
lost in the split, with the amount decreasing annually until the
payments end in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that so-called alimony burden, Calemine said, an
independent Hollywood would have a reserve fund of 10% of its
$183-million annual budget within three years. Calemine proposed that
a Hollywood city, if voters approve it, would begin operations on
July 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Los Feliz residents asked LAFCO to exclude their
250-home neighborhood from the proposed Hollywood city. The
commission asked Calemine to determine whether that would harm the
secession plan.</TE>

<HD>Milton Shedd, 79; Co-Founder of Sea World Began Marine
Institute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he was 5, he stood on the Santa Monica Pier and fished for
smelt, beginning a lifelong love affair with the sea and all the
creatures in it.</LD>
<LD>   Before he died Friday, he had spent more than 3,500 days on the
ocean and extracted untold numbers of striped marlin and white sea
bass. But he put back far more than the fish or the profits he took
out as an experienced angler and manufacturer of fishing tackle.</LD>
<LD>   Milton C. Shedd, one of the four fraternity brothers who founded
Sea World and the creator of its research institute, died at his
Newport Beach home of cancer. He was 79.</LD>
<TE>   Sea World opened March 21, 1964, on 22 acres of San Diego's
Mission Bay leased from the city. The park now covers 190 acres, has
welcomed more than 100 million visitors and is one of California's
leading tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   What the UCLA frat brothers first started talking about was not a
marine theme park, but a simple restaurant with an underwater
bar--perhaps an under-the-sea view they could add to the Long Beach
eatery already owned by George Millay, or maybe a whole new facility
they could build together in Mission Bay. Shedd, then a stockbroker;
Dr. Kenneth Norris, curator of sea animals at Marineland of the
Pacific, Dave De Motte and Millay weighed the problems of building
such an underwater attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the difficult engineering involved and their joint
interest in helping people better understand marine life led the
quartet to abandon the restaurant and concentrate on starting an
oceanarium. Shedd, Millay (who later created the Wet 'n Wild
waterslide parks), Norris and De Motte raised $1.5 million and built
Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, they acquired Shamu and became the first theme park to
exhibit a killer whale, an attraction that assured the park's
continuity.</TE>
<TE>   Shedd was president or board chairman of Sea World for nearly 20
years and helped create other Sea Worlds in Florida and Ohio. The
parks were sold in 1981 to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and later
to other conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   But Shedd's lasting legacy to marine science and education is
considered the nonprofit research foundation he created in 1963,
originally called the Mission Bay Research Institute and in 1977
renamed the Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute to honor Carl and
Laura Hubbs' contributions to marine science.</TE>
<TE>   "When you consider that there's been a huge population explosion
... and that our land resources are declining, you can see how
important sea research is," Shedd told The Times in 1981. "It's time
we learn enough to help mankind use the oceans' resources wisely."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Shedd's happiest days were collecting live specimens for
the theme park aboard his 67-foot boat, dubbed Sea World and built as
a marine research and fishery development vessel. He later donated
the boat, now called Sea World UCLA, to the UCLA Marine Science
Center, which he helped establish to prepare grade-school teachers to
instruct children about marine life.</TE>
<TE>   Shedd had also helped create a white sea bass hatchery in Carlsbad
and was recently promoting the use of obsolete oil platform rigging
as artificial reefs to serve as fish habitats.</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, Shedd acquired Axelson Fishing Tackle Manufacturing
Co., known as AFTCO, in 1973, and later developed such subsidiaries
as Bluewater Wear, which sells fish-printed camp shirts, fishing
shorts and other clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Even garbing and equipping fishermen, Shedd believed, could
illustrate the ocean's importance to mankind.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't aware that the oceans produce more than 50% of the
Earth's oxygen," he told The Times in 1995. "Our company is about
developing this awareness. The ocean is something we live and
breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Born in El Paso and reared in Southern California, Shedd earned a
degree in banking and finance from UCLA, where he played baseball and
football. His college years were interrupted by World War II, in
which he served as an Army officer in the Pacific, earning a Silver
Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Among the awards he earned for his oceanic endeavors were the
lifetime achievement award from the Audubon Society's Living Oceans
Program and the Professional Achievement Award from UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Shedd is survived by his wife of 58 years, Peggie; a daughter,
Carol McCarren of Denver; two sons, Steve of Mission Viejo and Bill
of Irvine; a sister, Ruth Orem, of Newport Beach; a brother, Irv, of
Newport Beach; nine grandchildren; and one great-grandson.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned for 3 p.m. today at the Leon Raymond
Hubbard Jr. Marine Fish Hatchery, 4200 Garfield St., Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations can be sent to the Hubbs-Sea World Research
Institute, 2595 Ingraham St., San Diego, CA 92109.</TE>

<HD>Border Patrol Makes 'Most Wanted' List Public</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are kingpins in the world of immigrant smuggling, eight elusive
men controlling rings that make millions of dollars each month by
illegally transporting thousands of people across the 14-mile San
Diego-Tijuana border.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the U.S. Border Patrol thrust their names and faces
into the public spotlight by announcing its first "Most Wanted" list
in California.</LD>
<LD>   "Years of intelligence work led us to focus on these people," said
Salvadore Zamora, supervising agent at the Border Patrol's San Diego
headquarters. "They call the shots in their organizations, and they
are all fugitives."</LD>
<TE>   Among the Mexican fugitives who authorities say specialize in
human cargo:</TE>
<TE>   * Vicente and Jose Peralta of the notorious Peralta smuggling
clan.</TE>
<TE>   * Alfonzo Zapien, nicknamed "Goat Herder," who skipped bail just
before sentencing on smuggling charges in 1999. Officials say Zapien
and his associate, Sivestre Rivera, nicknamed "Rambo," continue to
operate with impunity out of Tijuana's Hotel Guadiana.</TE>
<TE>   * Nicolas Frausto, a smuggler and suspected drug dealer and sex
offender whose evasive tactics include, on more than one occasion,
driving against the flow of traffic on Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the suspects are wanted by other law enforcement agencies.
Most are believed to keep homes on both sides of the border. All
routinely place their clients at risk of bodily harm, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The list, and a toll-free telephone number, will be posted in all
Border Patrol facilities. It also will be carried by the Border
Patrol's specially trained search, trauma and rescue teams.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say various initiatives to beef up patrols along the
U.S.-Mexican border have increased the cost and danger of sneaking
human cargo into the United States. The standard Tijuana-Los Angeles
fee for Mexicans hovers between $1,500 and $2,500--four times the
going rate a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The average fee for moving a Brazilian over the line is $4,000,"
said senior patrol Agent Robert Senior. "For Chinese nationals, it's
$25,000."</TE>
<TE>   Now, officials are banking on the notion that immigrants found
stranded in isolated terrains this summer will be eager to provide
information that could lead authorities to their smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   "When we find immigrants in distress, we'll show them the wanted
list," said Border Patrol spokesman Ben Bauman.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics of the Border Patrol, however, expressed doubts about
the strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Ramirez of the American Friends Service Center in San
Diego called it "almost comical."</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt that immigrants have any contact at all with these
particular smugglers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But patrol Agent Joe Rayball said critics miss the point. "If we
get lucky, rescued aliens will recognize a face or name on the list,
or at least give us the name of their foot guides," he said. "Then we
and federal prosecutors will lean on those guides to lead us back up
their own chain of command."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the suspected smugglers is
asked to call the U.S. Border Patrol at (800) 808-8727. Callers may
remain anonymous.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 200 health-care workers from five Watts Health Foundation
clinics, whose financial woes prompted state seizure last year,
launched a three-day strike Wednesday to protest a new contract that
slashes their benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Nurses, clinical assistants and clerical workers from the Lynwood,
Huntington Park and Compton clinics joined workers at the Watts and
Inglewood facilities in the county's third strike by health-care
workers in two weeks. The protesters all are members of Service
Employees International Union Local 399.</LD>
<LD>   State regulators last August took over the foundation--an HMO with
96,000 enrollees in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino
counties--citing financial mismanagement and nearly $60 million in
debt. The proposed union contract--which includes adding medical
co-payments--is necessary to keep the troubled foundation alive,
state officials said.</LD>

<HD>A Victorian Showcase Gleams Anew</HD>
<DH>Fancifully ornamented homes in little-known 1880s
development have been restored to their former splendor.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Murray Burns gave up driving, he took to touring Los Angeles by
bicycle and pedaled his way into Angelino Heights.</LD>
<LD>   It was the start of a long love story.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood of old Victorian homes southwest of Dodger
Stadium fascinated Burns, who had grown up in a tract of what he
called "cookie-cutter" houses. The Victorians were tall and strangely
ornamented. They all were different yet clearly of a style, with
their turrets and broad porches, gingerbread siding and lacy spindle
work. More than half the homes were faded and splintered. After dark,
you could imagine apparitions drifting through dim parlors.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it would be fun to live in a ghost house," Burns said,
recalling the day in the 1970s when he found one to buy. It was a
red, two-story place on Carroll Avenue. He grabbed the for-sale sign
and marched across the street to see Planaria Price, the owner.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the sign in my hand and said, 'I want to buy this house,'"
Burns remembered. "She said, 'Don't you want to see it first?'"</TE>
<TE>   He not only saw it and bought it, but he took a liking to Price
too. They got married and are now two of the people most responsible
for the gentrification of Angelino Heights, an 1880s development that
has become a showcase again. A century after they were built, the
rows of Victorians on Carroll and Kellam avenues and a few nearby
streets were declared part of the city's first historic preservation
overlay zone, meaning that buildings in the neighborhood are
protected.</TE>
<TE>   Houses cannot be torn down. A board of appointed volunteers,
acting as advisors to the city Planning Department, meets twice a
month in an old firehouse to review restoration plans. Although a
number of properties have been left in disrepair, most have been
meticulously restored--often at costs exceeding $100,000 apiece.
Original wiring, plumbing and masonry foundations have been replaced.
New glasswork and hardwood floors have been installed. Exterior walls
and trim have been painted in shades of lilac, gray, yellow, green
and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and Price have been the most ambitious renovators. They have
bought and refurbished 14 homes over the years, selling three and
renting out others. One is now on the market for $750,000. Burns
recalled one home they bought for about $100,000 in the mid-1990s.
Granted, they sank money into it, but it is now valued at $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Architecture," Burns said, "is like fashion. This neighborhood
got hot."</TE>
<TE>   Burns is 61 and wears his graying hair to his shoulders. He pads
around in bare feet and T-shirts. Though not a member of the
volunteer panel, he goes to meetings and voices strong opinions, said
Tracy Stone, a member and former chairman of the advisory group.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushes people," Stone said. "I think he'd like to hold
everyone to the same high standards of restoration [that he holds for
himself]. When we clash, it's usually momentary. I like him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting one afternoon in the "cozy corner" of the Queen Anne-style
Victorian that he and Planaria share on Carroll Avenue, Burns
reflected on his slow journey to aesthetic appreciation. As a
first-grader, he brought home a picture he had drawn of a horse. "My
father said, 'What ... is this? Horses aren't green.'" That stunted
him until he bought his first Victorian and left behind a one-room
apartment in Hollywood. He moved in with only a radio, some books and
a futon.</TE>
<TE>   At night he lay gazing at the high ceilings and strange features
of the home. He couldn't for the life of him figure out the purpose
of the lacy millwork that lined portions of the ceiling, forming tiny
fence-like borders to some of the rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while it dawned on me--it was art," Burns said. "The
milled wood creates wonderful shadows."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he noticed a similar effect in other features of the old
Victorians. The lace curtains, leaded glass and flickering gas lamps
all make wonderful patterns of light that change "subtly, constantly,
through the days and seasons," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's Queen Anne house, framed by turrets and filled with
arresting patterns in wood and wall and ceiling paper, was built in
1888. It is historic cultural monument No. 77 in Los Angeles, one of
more than a dozen homes on Carroll Avenue with that status. It is
described in a file in the downtown offices of the Cultural Heritage
Commission: "The turrets, verandas and generous proportions of the
architectural style were considered as charming as the good queen
herself."</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood, detailed in a separate file, was established in
1886 during "the first days of the great Los Angeles land boom that
followed the lowering of railroad fares from the East. Lots sold for
about $500, and the houses probably cost between $5,000 and $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   The upper-middle-class enclave "formed part of the first ring of
satellite suburbs around Los Angeles.... Cable cars operated from
1888 to 1902 and were replaced by electric street cars. The street
cars, which passed Carroll Avenue at 10-minute intervals, made the
run [downtown] in 16 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Burns, Price and seven neighbors formed the Carroll Avenue
Restoration Foundation in 1987. That year, Richard Collins became one
of several owners of Victorians who have moved a house to the
district because of its special status. Collins' hulking gray-green
home, accented with teal and 22-carat gold leaf, had been built in
1888 near Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "All kinds of [electrical] wires had to be raised and lowered" on
city streets to move it, Collins said. Among the house's features are
a cast-iron mantel, a porcelain stove and a proclamation
commemorating the election of his great- grandfather, Michael T.
Collins, to the Los Angeles City Council in 1886. "This is a unique
neighborhood in that it really is a neighborhood," he said. "We all
know each other."</TE>
<TE>   The Foy House, the city's first three-story home, was moved to the
neighborhood in 1992. Residents take pride in such things. Ron Ross,
a builder who has helped to refurbish 30 or 40 of the homes, shows
off photos of Angelino Heights in its infancy--when homes were built
with square nails and hand tools. "Some of the places I take apart,
I'm absolutely amazed they're still standing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Price, who discovered the neighborhood in the early 1970s while
looking for a shortcut to the Hollywood Freeway, remembers investing
$20,000 in the red house she later sold to her future husband. The
area has since become popular among Hollywood producers--"East of
Eden," "Inherit the Wind" and "Modern Problems" were shot here--and
the kids love it on Halloween. But otherwise, she said, "It's like a
real secret. People live [in L.A.] their whole lives and don't know
about this place."</TE>

<LD>A middle school teacher has been charged with helping three students
perform gang-related crimes, the Orange County district attorney's
office said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Cummings, 38, an English teacher at Portola Middle School
in Orange, was charged with making terrorist threats, contributing to
the delinquency of a minor and exhibiting an imitation firearm in a
threatening manner. If convicted, he faces up to eight years in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very unusual," said Tori Richards, a spokeswoman for the
district attorney's office. "No one can remember the last time we
charged a teacher with a gang-related crime."</LD>
<TE>   A man answering Cummings' telephone Wednesday would not identify
himself or comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and police said the charges stem from an April 26
incident in which a 14-year-old student got into an argument with a
19-year-old neighbor in Orange. The argument escalated into a
fistfight, and the student brandished a knife.</TE>
<TE>   The student left, police said, and returned 20 minutes later with
two friends in a car driven by Cummings. While he stayed in the car,
police said, the three students confronted one of the neighbor's
friends and threatened to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Called to the scene, police obtained a search warrant for an
apartment shared by Cummings and one of the students. Police said
they found gang-related paraphernalia and a replica of a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the students--Jose Salamanca and Jorge Medina, both
18--were charged with felony gang-related crimes and being active
members of a criminal street gang. Both are in jail and scheduled to
appear in court Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-year-old, whose name was withheld, was sentenced to 60 days
in jail after pleading guilty to a charge of making a gang-related
felony terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   Arraignment for Cummings, who posted $50,000 bail, is set for June
10.</TE>
<TE>   School officials said Cummings teaches about 150 students at
Portola, which has more than 900 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings, who has worked for the district since 1998, was placed
on paid administrative leave.</TE>

<HD>Aspiring Texas Rapper to Stand Trial in Death of L.A. Woman</HD>
<DH>Violence: Victim's chest was torn open, exposing her
internal organs, detective says at hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antron Singleton, an aspiring rapper charged with murdering a
southeast Los Angeles woman in April, was ordered to stand trial
Wednesday after a detective testified that there were teeth marks on
her face and on pieces of her lung, which had been removed from her
chest.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Det. Raymond Jankowski testified at Singleton's
preliminary hearing that when he found the body of the victim,
Tynisha Ysais, 21, in her apartment at 108th and Figueroa streets,
her chest was ripped open.</LD>
<LD>   Jankowski also testified Wednesday at the Compton Superior Court
hearing that a medical examination shortly after Singleton was
arrested found blood and flesh not belonging to him in his stomach.</LD>
<TE>   "Her chest was open, exposing internal organs," Jankowski said.
Pieces of her right lung appeared chewed and torn, he said. The
detective also said he found a broken three-inch knife blade near her
left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Ysais' friend Alisa Allen testified that about noon on
April 10, she saw Singleton--who goes by the stage name "Big Lurch"--
naked on the street.</TE>
<TE>   His chest, stomach and mouth were covered in blood, she said. "He
was looking toward the sky," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen flagged down a police officer, who arrested Singleton. She
then went up to her apartment and found her friend, whose nickname
was "Pocahontas," lying dead on her bedroom floor.</TE>
<TE>   "She was cut up really, really bad," Allen said slowly, holding
back tears.</TE>
<TE>   Ysais' boyfriend, Thomas Moore, testified that he and Singleton
had been smoking PCP in the apartment the night before.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's mother, Carolyn Stinson, sat in back of the
courtroom. "That's so gross," she muttered under her breath during
Jankowski's testimony. "[The police] told me not to believe the
rumors, but they were true."</TE>
<TE>   Singleton's attorney, Milton Grimes, said his client is originally
from Texas and had been in Los Angeles for a few months recording a
rap album.</TE>
<TE>   During Ysais' funeral, friends and family said she had dreams of
becoming a model. Ysais, who had two young children, was known for
her wide smile. "She was beautiful," said her childhood friend
Tanisha Lowe. "No matter what was going on in her life, she knew how
to keep smiling."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge John J. Cheroske ordered Singleton held
without bail pending his arraignment June 13.</TE>

<HD>2 Students Defend Actions in Bethlehem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two University of California students deported from Israel for
entering Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity during the recent siege
say they did so to try to relieve the suffering of the Palestinians
inside and to protect them from injury or arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Robert O'Neill, 21, and Nauman Zaidi, 26, who were released from
Israeli custody this week and flown to the United States, were among
about a dozen pro-Palestinian activists who rushed past Israeli
soldiers on May 2 and joined Palestinians who sought refuge in the
church.</LD>
<LD>   The students said their actions were aimed at trying to peacefully
end the standoff, not to prolong it, as Israeli officials have
suggested. They spoke in telephone interviews from the East Coast,
where they are staying with friends and relatives.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw it as almost black and white," said O'Neill, a UC Berkeley
student from Claremont, of the activists' decision to enter the
church, carrying food and supplies. "Regardless of anyone's political
views, these people were starving. They were suffering and somebody
had to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Israel views their behavior in similarly stark terms. Israeli
officials said the young men's actions helped militant Palestinians
in the church and risked the lives of noncombatants inside. The two
spent more than two weeks in Israeli custody after the siege ended
and, under terms of their deportation, are prohibited from returning
to Israel or territory it controls for the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   "They broke Israeli law, they aided terrorists in what became a
major standoff, and they put at risk the lives of innocent people,"
said David Douek, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles.
"It's a serious offense; it's not like they were shoplifting."</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi, a UC Riverside student from Rancho Cucamonga, said he and
the others hoped to prevent injury by standing between the Israelis
outside the church and the Palestinians within.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to achieve peace there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi, a student of religion and environmental toxicology, and
O'Neill, who is studying cultural anthropology and the Middle East,
had spent the academic year in a UC overseas program at the American
University of Cairo. Both said they plan to return to their home
campuses this fall to complete their undergraduate degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The two were notified by UC last week that they had been dropped
from the overseas program for putting themselves in danger, a
violation of the university's rules. They also will have to re-enroll
at their respective campuses, but university officials said that is
just a formality.</TE>
<TE>   They received good news from the university in Cairo on Tuesday,
when counselors told them that they will be allowed to receive grades
and credit for their coursework despite missing the final two weeks
of class. They will not be required to return to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting a lot of support there," O'Neill said of the
American University of Cairo. "People seem to be pretty happy with
what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, an assistant in the overseas program there said students
had demonstrated in support of the activists. Egyptian media accounts
also have applauded their actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand how these young men feel and we can sympathize,"
said the assistant, Dina Marks. "I think there's a great deal of
support for them."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she said, O'Neill and Zaidi had broken the rules of
the program and "that's why they're in the situation they're in.''</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi and O'Neill, who earlier in the school year had made trips
to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, decided to return over spring break
to work with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian
group.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidi said that upon arrival in the West Bank, they went first to
Ramallah and then to Hebron. There, they escorted Palestinians who
they said were fearful of walking outside during Israel's recent
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked well together. Both sides [Israelis and Palestinians]
were interested in us, these two guys working together, since he has
white skin and I have brown skin," said Zaidi, who is of Pakistani
origin. "We wanted to be liaisons, sort of intermediaries."'</TE>
<TE>   Then, when the solidarity group decided to try to send people into
the church in Bethlehem, they opted to take their activism a step
further.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said some details of the church siege now seem blurry; he
said he and the others were hungry when food supplies again ran low.</TE>
<TE>   But he and Zaidi said they were struck by the generosity of those
inside, who insisted that the activists have the largest portions.
Zaidi also recalled the peaceful scene of the men, most of them
Muslims, praying, their voices echoing through the vast space.</TE>
<TE>   When the siege ended May 10, they and the other activists were
taken first to Massiyahu Prison in the city of Ramle, then to a
second, more restrictive facility, called Nitzan. There, they were
held in cells apart from each other.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said he was housed with Israeli prisoners, who he said
were menacing until he shared food with them. Zaidi was housed with
Israeli Arabs and had an easier time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both students said they sympathize with the Palestinian cause. But
Zaidi said his contacts with Israelis and Palestinians have now
convinced him that both peoples want peace, but that their leaders
and governments may be standing in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad. Both people want peace, but they're scared of each
other, for obvious reasons. They don't know how to get there. We were
trying to help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Douek of the Israeli Consulate said the two students were at best
naive. "If they were really sympathetic to the Palestinian cause,
they wouldn't be supporting terrorists. That's what's holding
Palestinian society back, the support for terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill doesn't define his goals in those terms. He said he might
want to work one day for the U.S. State Department, and try to change
U.S policy in the Middle East, which he considers pro-Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could initiate a lot of change," he said. "If every
American just knew the realities on the ground over there, about what
happens to the Palestinians under occupation, I think the U.S. policy
would change tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Dickens, a State Department spokesman, said he could not
comment on U.S. policy in the region or O'Neill's beliefs. Otherwise,
he said, "I wish him the best of luck."</TE>

<HD>Westside VA Official Under Investigation</HD>
<DH>Veterans: Man directing development of 388-acre site is
suspended amid misconduct allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief architect of long-range development at the sprawling
Veterans Affairs hospital grounds in West Los Angeles has been
suspended from duty while federal officials investigate complaints of
misconduct, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the suspension of Philip P. Thomas, chief executive
officer of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, came two
days after Gov. Gray Davis announced plans to build a state nursing
home for veterans on a portion of the 388-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   Officials refused to describe Thomas' alleged wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas was named head of Los Angeles VA health-care services three
years ago with a mandate to put an end to squabbling over development
of the federal property, which spans Wilshire Boulevard west of the
San Diego Freeway. He had endorsed construction of a home for
veterans at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' announcement about the veterans home came during Memorial
Day services Monday at the nearby Los Angeles National Cemetery in
Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   The project, supported by state Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), quickly drew criticism. as veterans in Ventura
County and Lancaster complained that a home at the Westside complex
would probably cause such facilities planned for their areas to be
scaled back.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, advocates of the proposed Westside project wondered
how Thomas' suspension would affect the plan.</TE>
<TE>   VA officials were tight-lipped about the investigation, being
conducted by the department's inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   "They're looking at a number of allegations, and I cannot get into
details because it's ongoing," said Laurie Tranter, a VA spokeswoman
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   No criminal charges have been filed, said Barbara Fallen, a West
Coast VA spokeswoman. For now, Thomas has been given a desk job at a
VA office in Long Beach--although he was reported Wednesday to be off
work and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the VA in West Los Angeles indicated that the
investigation is centered on a worker's-disability claim made by
Thomas. They said the suspension was ordered in late April.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, 51, came to the Los Angeles job in 1999 from Syracuse,
N.Y., where he ran the VA Healthcare Network for Upstate New York.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles veterans groups that have criticized past development
of the VA land support the nursing home proposal, Odas Flake, a past
commander of the state Military Order of the Purple Heart, said
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>No Closed Hearings, Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Court: Jurist in N.J. terror cases calls secret deportation
proceedings illegal for detainees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Williams</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in New Jersey ruled Wednesday that the government's
policy of closing deportation hearings for individuals targeted in
its massive terrorism probe is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell is the second by
a federal jurist that sides against the government concerning the
thorny issue of closed hearings, but it is more sweeping because of
the large number of detainees still held in New Jersey jails.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an enormous decision," said Lee Gelernt, a senior staff
attorney at the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil
Liberties Union.</LD>
<TE>   The roundup of more than 1,200 immigrants and the subsequent
secret hearings have been a prominent part of the government's
reaction to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. The fate of many of those taken into custody
remains unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bissell's order, the government no longer can close those
immigration proceedings based on a Sept. 21 directive issued by chief
U.S. Immigration Judge Michael Creppy. If the government wants to
close a portion of any such hearing in the future, it may do so only
on a case-by-case basis where the government has specified concrete
evidence demonstrating a need for closure.</TE>
<TE>   The government is expected to appeal the ruling, although no
Justice Department lawyer was immediately available for comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The government already is appealing a similar ruling made April 3
by a federal judge in Detroit. That case concerned only one detainee,
and the government's effort to get an emergency stay in that case has
been rejected by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will
hear the full case Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Bissell said a preliminary injunction was "an extraordinary
remedy," but he said the plaintiffs--three New Jersey newspapers--had
demonstrated a reasonable probability of success in a full trial
concerning the issue.</TE>
<TE>   He said the plaintiffs clearly would be irreparably harmed--one of
the key standards for obtaining a preliminary injunction--if they
could not attend the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no precise figures because of government
secrecy, there have been reports that the government detained more
than 1,200 people in roundups after the terrorist attacks and that
327 of the detainees--the largest concentration anywhere in the
country--were held in jails in Hudson and Passaic counties in New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Gelernt and other sources said there still are 104 people being
held by the government in the post-Sept. 11 probe--the bulk of them
in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   There Must Be 'Public Scrutiny of the Process'</TE>
<TE>   Gelernt said hundreds of the detainees have been deported, without
ever having a public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are finding out that many of the detainees have waived all
their rights, including their rights to further review," Gelernt
said. "Where an individual's liberty is at stake and they are
unrepresented, there has to be public scrutiny of the process to
ensure that the government is complying with the Constitution," said
Gelernt, who worked on the case along with the Center for
Constitutional Rights and a New Jersey law firm--Gibbons, Del Deo,
Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione.</TE>
<TE>   In the Detroit and New Jersey cases, the government contended that
it was entitled to implement new procedures in so-called "special
interest" cases lodged after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the government contended that Bissell, who was appointed
by President Ronald Reagan, did not have the jurisdiction to consider
the case. Bissell rejected that contention, as well as the
government's arguments on the merits of the case.</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged that Congress has the power to determine
who may enter and remain in the U.S., but he also stressed that "it
is equally established that this power must be administered in a
manner that respects procedural safeguards of due process."</TE>
<TE>   Bissell also acknowledged that the government might have
legitimate reasons to close a deportation hearing of a suspect in the
wake of the "dastardly" attacks "and the continuing threat of their
repetition." However, the judge said that the blanket policy to close
all these hearings, put into effect by Creppy's Sept. 21 memo,
clearly ran afoul of the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The judge cited a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that
court hearings in the U.S. are presumptively open. He said
deportation hearings are no exception. In fact, Bissell noted, that
as long ago as 1903, the Supreme Court had ruled that there are due
process rights when the government seeks to remove a resident alien.</TE>
<TE>   Government Must Show a Compelling Interest</TE>
<TE>   "Furthermore, since 1964, federal regulations have expressly
provided a presumption of openness for deportation proceedings,"
Bissell emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   To close such hearings, the government has to show a compelling
interest that is narrowly tailored, Bissell wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The government argued that the New Jersey hearings should be
closed to avoid setbacks to its terrorism investigation and prevent
stigma or harm to detainees.</TE>
<TE>   In support of these claims, the government submitted declarations
from James S. Reynolds, chief of the Justice Department's terrorism
and violent crimes section, and Dale Watson, the FBI's executive
assistant director for counter-terrorism and counterintelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Bissell said the affidavits describe possible adverse consequences
of open hearings, including the possibility of deterring detainees
from cooperating in the event of their release; revelations that
might indicate to terrorists "the direction and progress of
[government] investigations; facilitating others in creating false or
misleading evidence; and revealing "sensitive investigatory
information."</TE>
<TE>   But Bissell said that "the problem with the Creppy directive [is
that] there is nothing in it to prevent disclosure of this very
information" by the detainee or that individual's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, he said that information might come out during an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said that, to the extent that the Creppy directive is
supposed to help prevent detainees from being stigmatized, "its
mandates sweep too broadly because it does not permit the individual
to elect such protective treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Bissell said it was clearly in "the public interest" to
enjoin government action that violates the Constitution.</TE>

<HD>NFL Player Will Take the Field for Army</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the National Football
League postponed a week of games and handed out a million American
flags at the turnstiles when play resumed. Many of the league's
players also did their part, contributing blood or making donations
to victims' funds.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Pat Tillman, a highly regarded safety who started the last
two seasons for the Arizona Cardinals, is contributing to the cause
in his own way: He's enlisting in the U.S. Army.</LD>
<LD>   Two years after setting a team record with 224 tackles, the
unconventional Tillman is believed to be the first NFL regular since
World War II to voluntarily leave the game for military service. In
doing so, Tillman, 25, is walking away from a multiyear contract that
would pay him an average of more than $1 million a season, to earn
between $1,022 and $1,443 a month as a soldier. It's a sacrifice that
has not gone unnoticed.</LD>
<TE>   "I was surprised and yet really very impressed by this kind of
dedication to serve the country at great personal expense," said Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.), a Vietnam War veteran who serves on the Armed
Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman and his younger brother, Kevin, a minor league baseball
player last season in the Cleveland Indian organization, aim to
become members of the highly trained Rangers, an elite force that has
played a prominent role in the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan,
training, advising and fighting alongside Afghan soldiers in the
battle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers have so far declined to be interviewed about their
decision, telling those around them that they do not deserve special
attention for doing what thousands of other men and women do without
fanfare. Also fearful their decision will be viewed as a publicity
stunt, the brothers have informed only family and close friends of
where they are headed for basic training. Most likely, they are bound
for Ft. Benning, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Although the decision caught many by surprise, few who know the
nonconforming, high-achieving Pat Tillman were shocked. And no one
doubts his determination to resume a pro career after fulfilling his
military commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "Pat is a very passionate person," said Jeff Hechtle, a longtime
friend who attended Leland High in San Jose with Tillman. "He's
always excelled in whatever he does. This is something he feels he
needs to do."</TE>
<TE>   While at Arizona State, Tillman talked like a surfer, dressed like
a slacker and graduated summa cum laude in 31/2 years with a 3.84
grade-point average in marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely proud of that," he said in a 1998 interview. "But
I don't think it's something that needs to be shouted from the
rooftops."</TE>
<TE>   Noted for his toughness, the 5-foot-11, 200-pound Tillman not only
survived as an undersized linebacker in the Pacific 10 Conference but
was named the conference's defensive player of the year in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He switched to safety in the pros and beat long odds by making the
Cardinals as a seventh-round draft pick. As a rookie on the second
day of the Cardinals' training camp, Tillman flattened a starting
fullback who outweighed him by 50 pounds, injuring him during what
was supposed to be a routine drill. The coach fumed. Teammates
marveled at Tillman's ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   He also warmed up for training camp last June by competing in a
70.2-mile triathlon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wealth his pro career brought him, Tillman maintained
the lifestyle of a college kid just scraping by. While other rookies
rolled around in BMWs and Land Rovers, Tillman pedaled to practice
every day on his trusty Schwinn beach cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   He has never bought a new car and only recently splurged for a
used Volvo station wagon.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody says, 'Those are the neatest shoes I've ever seen,'
he'll buy the exact opposite ones. In purple. Just to prove he
wouldn't cave in to fashion trends. He's an original," Hechtle said.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "He values his relationships more than anything in his
life. Relationships to Pat mean the world." That loyalty was evident
last year when Tillman turned down a five-year, $9-million offer from
St. Louis to stay with Arizona. He became a free agent this spring
and was expected to re-sign with Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   But Tillman informed the Cardinals of his decision last week after
returning home from Bora Bora, where the newlywed honeymooned with
his high school sweetheart, Marie.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of him," Cardinal General Manager Bob Ferguson
said. "His commitments and life go beyond the selfishness and greed
you see in pro sports these days."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson also said Tillman is deadly serious about this
commitment: "Pat wants those tunnels in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona linebacker Zack Walz, Tillman's roommate on road trips,
said Tillman told him the decision had been long in the making, and
solidified by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Time--and age--also played a role: The Rangers will not accept a
recruit over age 28. Tillman has enlisted for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I just called to see how his honeymoon went.... When he told me
about the Army. I was like, 'Are you crazy?' He just chuckled. This
is something I think he's been thinking about for a long time," Walz
said. "That's just Pat. He lives life by a whole different set of
guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   Tillman adds to NFL pride over its ties to the military. More than
600 NFL players served during World War II; 19 were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is there a strong tradition, but a strong kinship
between the NFL and the military," said Joe Browne, an NFL vice
president. "The military represents some of our biggest fans."</TE>
<TE>   Tillman and his wife spent Memorial Day weekend with relatives and
friends in the Bay Area. They attended a graduation ceremony at UC
Berkeley, talked until the wee hours with friends in San Jose and
kept clear of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   McCain, who has not met Tillman but has long admired him as a
football player, recalled days not long ago when it was "uncool" to
join or support the military.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps [those] last vestiges of the Vietnam War have disappeared
in the rubble of the World Trade Center," McCain said, adding: "I
don't think there will be any doubts about his capabilities as a
soldier but also as a recruiting tool. He'll motivate other young
Americans to serve as well."</TE>
