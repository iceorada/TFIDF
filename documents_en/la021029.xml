<HD>TNT taps familiar names for original films</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an aggressive maneuver to compete with its cable and network
rivals, TNT on Monday announced a development slate of dramatic
original movies, featuring A-list producers and writers. It's part of
the network's $300-million investment in original programming.</LD>
<LD>   The planned films include a remake of "The Goodbye Girl,"
adaptations of best-selling novels by Ken Follett and Scott Turow,
and a feature focusing on the creation of LAPD's original SWAT unit.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Wright, TNT's senior vice president of movies and
miniseries, said the development of the films is a reflection of
higher standards for original TV movies. "The stakes have been raised
in the last several years," he said. "It's a tough landscape out
there. There is too much product, both on network and cable, to offer
anything but the highest quality. The material is No. 1. Then there
have to be the quality people who can execute it."</LD>
<TE>   Wright said the films probably would start premiering in 2004. The
projects include:</TE>
<TE>   "Pleading Guilty," based on Turow's conspiracy thriller about a
former police officer turned lawyer who is ordered to investigate the
disappearance of a friend and colleague who embezzled funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Night Over Water," based on Follett's bestseller set at the onset
of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Simon's contemporary update of his "The Goodbye Girl." The
original 1977 film earned an Oscar for Richard Dreyfuss as an
aspiring actor forced to share an apartment with a divorcee.</TE>
<TE>   "I, Jesse James," the "untold" story of the notorious outlaw. John
Woo ("Face/Off") is one of the executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   "Evel Knievel," a new biopic about the daredevil.</TE>
<TE>   "SWAT," about the formation of the first SWAT unit during the
unrest of the 1960s. Jan de Bont ("Twister," "Speed") is one of the
executive producers.</TE>
<TE>   A new three-hour version of "She" about a lost African kingdom
ruled by a mysterious queen. Robert Halmi Sr. ("Gulliver's Travels")
will produce with Hallmark Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is the Mango Princess?," the story of a woman who attempts
to keep her family together after her husband suffers a debilitating
brain injury. Julianna Margulies will star and co-executive produce.</TE>
<TE>   "Wyatt Earp," the latest film about the famous lawman.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad Apple," starring Chris Noth ("Law &amp; Order," "Sex and the
City") as a hard-nosed FBI agent.</TE>

<HD>Pyramid Pal helps children make healthful food choices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hi, kids! It's me, Pyramid Pal, nutrition champion of kids. I like to
eat foods that are good for me. I try to eat foods from all five food
groups every day: grains, vegetables, fruits, milk and meat. Oh sure,
I like cookies and candy too. But foods that have nutrients help me
do better in school and in sports and to stay healthy. Today, I am
going to share with you two of my secrets for eating healthfully.</LD>
<LD>   First, I start by making good food choices. I eat a range of
servings from each of the Food Guide Pyramid groups: 6 to 11 servings
of grains a day, 3 to 5 servings of vegetables, 2 to 4 servings of
fruits, 2 or 3 servings of meat and 2 or 3 servings of milk.
Remember, sweets are not an official food group, so less is better.</LD>
<LD>   Then, I watch the size of the servings I eat. Sometimes, we eat
too much because we don't know what an ounce or a cup serving size
looks like. Here are some fun ways to help you figure out the number
of servings you are really eating:</LD>
<TE>   Grains: The size of one small fist equals one serving of pasta or
rice.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetables: The size of a baseball equals one serving of raw leafy
vegetables; half a baseball equals one serving of cooked vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Fruits: The size of a tennis ball equals one fruit serving for
apples or oranges.</TE>
<TE>   Milk: Four stacked dice equal one ounce of cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Meat: The size of a deck of cards equals one serving of meat,
poultry or fish.</TE>
<TE>   How do you know if you should have 6 or 11 servings of grain each
day? Well, this depends on how active you are and how many calories
you use up. But that's another story. I'll tell you about calories
next time.</TE>

<HD>'The Year There Was No Halloween'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Something's wrong with Jake's mom. She
doesn't know it's Halloween or even what Halloween is. Jake is
baffled!</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bobette Newcomer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a minute I thought I had it figured out. "Oh sure, Mom," I
laughed, "you can't fool me about Halloween! It's the only day of the
year when I'm allowed to eat all the candy I want. It's my favorite
holiday!"</LD>
<LD>   My mom just stared at me and said, "Jake, I still don't know what
you are talking about. I've never heard of Halloween. I'm going to
make breakfast now."</LD>
<LD>   So I went back up to my room, got dressed and went downstairs.
When I walked into the kitchen, my mom said to my dad, "Honey, listen
to this. Jake says there is a holiday called Halloween, when kids go
around the neighborhood from door to door and ask for candy."</LD>
<TE>   "I've never heard of anything like that!" he said. He went on
reading his newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's true, Dad," I said, "and you don't just go up to
someone's front door and ask for candy. You wear a scary costume and
say, 'Trick or treat!' "</TE>
<TE>   "How silly!" my mom and dad said at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't stop me. On the way to school, I told them I was
going to walk by the pumpkin patch lot down the street. That would
prove it.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," my mom said, "I didn't know there was a harvest market
today. Do you want me to make a pumpkin pie for you, Jake?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," I answered, "I want to carve a funny face in the pumpkin and
put a little candle inside when it gets dark like I do every
Halloween."</TE>
<TE>   "Jake, why do you keep talking about this silly Halloween that
nobody has ever heard of? I'm getting a little annoyed with the whole
thing," Mom sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, what are you up to, Jake?" my dad grumbled. "Your mother has
no idea what you are talking about and neither do I, so please stop
this foolishness."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not foolishness. I'm just telling you the truth! If you
don't believe me, just look at the calendar. Look at what it says for
Oct. 31," I said as I stomped out the door.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: What has happened to Halloween?</TE>

<LD>What if your favorite vacation haunt was indeed haunted? That's the
premise behind three hourlong installments of "Haunted Hotels,"
starting at 8 tonight on the Travel Channel, whose programming has a
Halloween theme all week.</LD>
<LD>   For those who believe in things that go bump in the night, these
three travelogues present 15 ghost stories through interviews with
hotel staff, reenactments and eerie effects. Even for skeptics who
think the supernatural is as groundless as the headless horseman of
Sleepy Hollow is headless, there is some interesting information.</LD>
<LD>   Each segment focuses on a specific building by providing
historical or architectural details one might expect to hear about
any quaint inn, whether it's in Oxfordshire, England, or Palm
Springs. Once the show discusses, say, the materials that went into
the construction of a room, it then delves into the secrets presumed
to lie within those walls.</LD>
<TE>   At the Snowball Mansion, an 1870s-era bed-and-breakfast near
Sacramento, innkeepers say the ghost of Lucy Snowball, a mother
tormented by a child's death, alerts visitors to potential danger. At
the Shaker Inn in Enfield, N.H., slain Shaker leader Caleb Dyer is
said to still roam the halls. And at the Moroccan-style Korakia
Pensione in Palm Springs, the spirit of a former owner, a model wed
to painter Gordon Coutts, supposedly pops in on fashion shoots.</TE>
<TE>   What's refreshing here is that even though the tales are spookily
told, there remains a certain detachment in the storytelling. The
husband-and-wife team of producer-writer Sarah Wetherbee and director
Emre Sahin is careful to attribute the hauntings to innkeepers and
visitors, never once asserting themselves that the locales are
haunted.</TE>
<TE>   As the programs note, the noises you could hear when staying at
these hotels are "probably just the wind ... but you might want to
leave the light on -- just in case."</TE>

<HD>A cautionary tale of love and betrayal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ha Jin, author of the 1999 National Book Award-winning novel,
"Waiting," a quiet love story dancing between human and political
tensions as set against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution, continues to mine this rich and historically relevant
territory in his newest work, "The Crazed."</LD>
<LD>   In spare yet radiant prose, Jin depicts the daily existence of
Jian Wan, a young man whose life is neatly ordered.</LD>
<LD>   A graduate student in literature at remote Shanning University,
Jian has been studying diligently under his beloved mentor, Professor
Yang, in preparation for the entrance exams for the doctoral program
at Beijing University. Once he passes the exam, he'll be reunited in
the capital with his fiancee, Meimei (Professor Yang's daughter),
who's in Beijing preparing for medical school.</LD>
<TE>   Their lives will then unfold as predictably and comfortably as can
be expected: he as an intellectual, balancing the exigencies of art
with the circumspection required under the Communist regime, she as
an ambitious physician.</TE>
<TE>   At least that was the plan before Professor Yang suffers a stroke
just weeks before the exam and Jian is expected, as "the only family
Professor Yang has here," to care for him every afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the only thing disrupted by the professor's illness is
Jian's study plans. It's difficult to get much intellectual work done
while sitting in a mangy hospital room, listening to the rantings and
hallucinations of one's professor. The more Professor Yang indulges
his outbursts of singing, poetry reciting, raving against Communism
and speaking to people not there, the more Jian is pulled into the
mysteries of his professor's life.</TE>
<TE>   He overhears stories of love and betrayal he hadn't anticipated
from his sedate teacher, depths of suffering he hadn't imagined and
ribald scenes reenacted before his eyes by the ailing man.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Yang appears to be focusing on the buried truths and
treacheries of his life, trying to make peace before he dies. "[H]e
appeared to be struggling to take possession of his soul, yearning
for some free, unsullied space," Jian notes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, student demonstrators are marshaling in Beijing and
steam is building on what will soon become the Tiananmen Square
massacre. The novel's tension is ratcheted up a level as the
political and the personal are about to merge in Jian's unguarded
life.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Yang, through his ravings, presents to Jian a cautionary
tale. "I've been a clerk all my life," he tells a colleague who has
come to visit him. "So have you. We're all chattels of the state."
Professor Yang urges Jian to renounce the intellectual life while
he's still able.</TE>
<TE>   Left deliciously ambiguous by the author are important questions:
Are Yang's railings only figments of a damaged mind, delusions not to
be trusted, or is Yang finally speaking the truth in a country where
honesty and defiance are harshly punished? Is Yang the "crazed" of
the book's title, or is it the society in which he lives? In this
slow-moving but beautifully layered tale, Jian must decide the nature
of truth for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Since much of the novel unfolds in a squalid hospital room, Jin
works his magic over the reader by way of accretion: Little by
little, the details build, as silently as a snowfall before it
becomes a blizzard, so that we, like the book's characters, fail to
recognize the full significance of the happenings.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, the weight of each event increases and Jin's plot gains
intensity until it erupts as deafeningly as the Tiananmen Square
demonstrations, the consequences as life-altering as that fateful
event.</TE>
<TE>   Determined "[n]ot to be a piece of meat on the chopping block for
others to cut," Jian wanders blindly onto a path he's not been
prepared to tread, and he finds himself astray of the university's
shelter, rejected by Meimei and thrust by happenstance into a
political role he'd never envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Repressive politics, treachery and hunger for power, viciousness
and desperation are at the heart of this tale, which Jin balances
tenuously against the redemption of love, the importance of art and
the vital need for narrative to make sense of our lives and our
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Yang tells Jian that he had survived the ordeal of
persecution during the Cultural Revolution with help from Dante.
"[D]uring the torture, I would recite to myself lines from 'The
Divine Comedy.' [The torturers] could hurt me physically, but they
could not subdue my soul."</TE>

<HD>A date with the Angels' other MVP</HD>
<DH>The most valuable primate, the Rally Monkey, is willing to
take the credit for his team's heavenly ascension as World Series
champs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every once in a generation or so, a World Series, Olympics or other
sporting epic produces a legendary performer, someone with the looks,
personality, athletic skills and sheer animal magnetism to captivate
viewers around the globe. Such a hero emerged from the just-wrapped
Angels-Giants matchup, and his name wasn't Troy Glaus.</LD>
<LD>   We speak, of course, of the Rally Monkey, that elusive simian with
a knack for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat as if plucking
juicy nits off a mate's head.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare interview with The Times, the personable primate --
"R.M." to his friends -- spoke candidly about baseball, his role in
helping the Angels win their first World Series in their 42-year
history, the Darwinian nature of professional sports and the burden
of fame.</LD>
<TE>   At his suggestion, we met in a back room at the Coconut Teaszer
where, contrary to his reputation for making fashionably late
arrivals, the monkey was right on time. After being warned by his
publicist not to ask any question containing the phrase "missing
link," we began.</TE>
<TE>   The Times: So your team just won the World Series. Are you going
to Disneyland?</TE>
<TE>   Rally Monkey: What, are you nuts? Have you been on the Jungle
Cruise lately? I mean, I've seen a few tacky rainforests in my time,
but at least they don't make you wait in line for two hours to get
in! Naw, the kids and the missus have been begging me to take 'em to
the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Anything to keep the peace at home,
ya know?</TE>
<TE>   Times: Are the rumors true about Game Six that you got stuck in
traffic on the 405, and that's why you didn't show up until the
seventh inning with the Angels down 5-0?</TE>
<TE>   RM: Absolutely not. I just figured it'd make the game more
interesting if I let the suspense build. Plus, it's a long series and
you've got to pace yourself. Remember, I helped lead more than 40
Angels' comebacks during the regular season. Who else are you going
to call when you're in a jam -- the San Diego Chicken? Please!</TE>
<TE>   Times: How'd you get into this line of work?</TE>
<TE>   RM (wrapping his tail around the light fixture): I guess you could
say that show biz runs in our family, which for the record is
Hylobatidae. My great-grandfather stole the show from Ronald Reagan
in "Bedtime for Bonzo." An aunt had a cameo in "Planet of the Apes"
-- she was a child star. And my second cousin once removed was the
guy with the bone in "2001: A Space Odyssey." Like they say, the
banana doesn't fall far from the tree! (Laughs)</TE>
<TE>   Times: We hear that you're a free agent next season. Any danger
you might be lured East by some big-money owner? The New York
Yankees, for instance?</TE>
<TE>   RM (glancing uneasily at his agent): It's true. George
Steinbrenner and I have had some discussions. Nothing formal. But
what could he offer me that I don't already have in Orange County?
The penthouse suite at the Empire State Building? I've seen what they
do to apes in that town. Besides, believe it or not, I don't like
heights. And have you ever seen a palm tree in Central Park?</TE>
<TE>   Times: So what are your off-season plans?</TE>
<TE>   RM: Survival of the fittest, you know. Gotta diversify. Michael
Eisner offered me a part in a "Mighty Joe Young" sequel, but I'm
holding out for "The Barefoot Executive" remake.</TE>
<TE>   Times: Aren't you, um, kind of small for that role?</TE>
<TE>   RM: Hey, watch it, fella! I may be small, but I think my work on
the Jumbotron screen speaks for itself. Plus Curious George, my only
competition, is demanding 20% of the overseas grosses. One thing I've
learned from being a Disney employee: Never monkey around with an
800-pound gorilla.</TE>

<HD>Maternity wear heads to the gym</HD>
<DH>Nike and Reebok are forming alliances to create
form-fitting yet comfortable clothes. The guiding philosophy:
Pregnancy doesn't mean losing a sense of style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sarah Jessica Parker teetered around New York this summer in spiky
heels, stylishly with child. Kate Moss flounced about as well, in
flowing bohemian garb that bared her bump (she gave birth to Lola in
early October). And Cynthia Nixon appeared very pregnant at the Emmys
this fall in a strapless gown by Chaikin. It's maternity chic: With
so many celebs flaunting their big bellies, pregnancy is starting to
look like the latest fashion accessory.</LD>
<LD>   Now several major athletic brands are branching out into
form-fitting workout wear for mothers-to-be.</LD>
<TE>   Liz Lange and Nike began marketing athletic wear for pregnant
women last spring, and babystyle has just teamed up with Reebok on a
new maternity collection. Reebok brought to you by babystyle, which
first appeared on www.babystyle.com this fall, includes workout
basics: bootleg pants, bike shorts, V-neck T-shirts, a racer-back
sports bra and a tank top with a built-in sports bra. The breathable,
antimicrobial cotton-Lycra fabric is made by Reebok; the designs are
by babystyle. The Nike-Liz Lange collection includes workout pants
and tops, a zip-front jacket and a yoga catsuit, all in Nike's DriFIT
fabric, which wicks moisture away from the skin. "Just because you
are pregnant does not mean you lose your sense of style or
lifestyle," said babystyle Chief Executive Laurie McCartney, whose
online company will open its first store in Manhattan Beach on
Thanksgiving weekend. "A big part of that is being active, feeling
good, looking good and having a wardrobe of alternatives you can feel
like yourself in."</TE>
<TE>   These days, most doctors advocate low-impact exercise such as
yoga, swimming and walking throughout pregnancy. But what to wear to
the gym as the body balloons?</TE>
<TE>   "Women no longer have to wear their husband's gym shorts and
T-shirts," McCartney said. "They can wear body-hugging workout wear."</TE>
<TE>   Lange says the Liz Lange for Nike line is so comfortable that any
pregnant woman would want a few items as kick-back basics.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, active wear is much more than just active wear," she
said. "It has truly become streetwear. I envision my line both in the
gym and out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Lange just announced that she will be teaming up with Target to
release Liz Lange for Target, a collection of simple, interchangeable
-- and affordable -- maternity clothes. The collection, to be
manufactured by and sold only at Target, will be available later this
year.</TE>

<HD>Gasp! It's how much?</HD>
<DH>Want to scare the devil out of someone for Halloween? It
could cost you a lot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roy Rivenburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until recently, the only way to create a proper haunted house was to
orchestrate a heinous murder on your property and then thwart justice
so the dead spirits would have a reason to hang around and cause
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to technology to eliminate such hassles. This Halloween,
homeowners can spookify their abodes with expensive Hollywood-style
special effects, including walls that come to life, toilets that
explode, "industrial strength" attack alligators and a "Deep Fryer"
electric chair equipped with a thrashing mannequin who screams,
sizzles and spews "authentic foamy drool."</LD>
<LD>   For added terror, customers can also buy a $3,400 "vomit barrel"
(vomit not included), a $2,000 haunted mirror and a $35,000 animated
ogre that stands 11 feet high.</LD>
<TE>   Traditionally, such props were built primarily for theme park
Halloween haunts. But as consumer spending on the holiday has surged
from $2.5 billion in 1995 to a projected $6.9 billion this year, some
of the prop manufacturers are branching into the home market.</TE>
<TE>   Prices are still way beyond most people's budgets, but that's
changing. Ed Edmunds, whose Colorado company, Distortions Unlimited,
designs creepy props for Six Flags amusement parks and rock star
Alice Cooper, hopes to introduce a $400 version of his $6,900
electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   "The home market is growing very quickly," says Edmunds, a
born-again Christian who also specializes in blood-squirting
guillotines ($7,950) and dismembered space aliens ($1,130). "We're
shifting our Web site toward that."</TE>
<TE>   Smarthome.com, an Irvine-based purveyor of home automation
gadgets, has also jumped on the haunted bandwagon with a catalog of
"extreme Halloween" products. Company bigwigs came up with the idea
at a Halloween industry trade show as a way to boost interest in
their less-expensive Halloween paraphernalia, such as a $20 talking
skull and a $70 fog machine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's eye candy to pull people through our catalog," says Leo
Soderman, Smarthome's marketing director. And because the big-ticket
items have to be custom-ordered, Smarthome loses nothing if they
don't sell.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some choices</TE>
<TE>   The high-tech props, which are made by Edmunds' company and
several other theme park suppliers, include:</TE>
<TE>   The Living Wall, which can be used to freak out sleeping house
guests. Place it behind a bed, turn on the switch and the wall roars
to life with two hands and a head trying to push through it. Price:
$3,000.</TE>
<TE>   T rex, a shrieking 6-foot-high dinosaur head that springs out of
the bushes with jaws snapping. It's yours for pocket change:
$9,999.99.</TE>
<TE>   The fake car crash, a simulated brick wall that suddenly gives way
to a realistic car front with working headlights and blaring horn.
Price: $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Satan's spawn, a 13-foot-tall animated demon that writhes and
jumps out at visitors ($8,000).</TE>
<TE>   The Explode Commode, a slime-covered toilet that erupts with a
25-foot geyser of air and water.</TE>
<TE>   The automated gator, which lunges forward along a metal track.
"It's a real steady seller for swamp scenes," says Edmunds, who cast
the critter using a frozen reptile shipped from Florida. "It took us
two years to legally get a real alligator," he says. After two days
of thawing, the gator was placed in a fiberglass mold, which took a
couple of days to set. By the time it was ready, the animal was
decomposing and the smell was horrific, he says. Price: $14,000 from
Smarthome.com; $8,508 from distortionsonline.com.</TE>
<TE>   A few items were deemed too gruesome for Smarthome's catalog. The
Ghoul Grinder, in which a mannequin is lowered into a whirring
machine that sends fake blood and guts spilling out the bottom, was
rejected because the only photo available from the manufacturer
featured a bound and gagged female mannequin dangling above the
device. "We thought that would be offensive," Soderman says.</TE>
<TE>   Smarthome execs also vetoed vials of oil formulated to smell like
a rotting corpse. The stench was a little too realistic, Soderman
says: "If FedEx broke one of those vials during shipping, they'd come
after us with machetes."</TE>
<TE>   Although the catalog has garnered considerable media attention, it
hasn't generated many sales. As of late last week, the only high-end
item that Smarthome had unloaded was a $2,000 haunted mirror, which
flashes the image of a talking skull when someone steps on the
pressure-sensitive floor pad.</TE>
<TE>   Be patient, advises Edmunds. "Certainly you're not going to sell
as many electric chairs as blenders, but we've had good results," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Parties get more elaborate</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds traces the rise in Halloween spending to the Tylenol
poisoning scare a few years back. "Parents started doing parties for
their kids instead of trick-or-treating," he explains. Each year, the
parties got more elaborate, and adults got more and more into the
spirit of the holiday, he says.</TE>
<TE>   All sorts of entrepreneurs have pounced on the trend.</TE>
<TE>   A company that makes anatomical skeletons for universities now
sells its rejected bones to Smarthome, Soderman says: "We buy them by
the pound and sell them as our 'Bag of Bones.' "</TE>
<TE>   However, it isn't always easy to satisfy America's hunger for
haunting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've raised a generation on $50-million and $100-million budget
movies, so it's tough to manufacture things that will impress a
teenager," Edmunds says.</TE>
<TE>   But he's got a few ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have trouble dreaming up what would be next," says his
wife, Marsha, quoted on the company's Web site. "Now we have trouble
crossing off things we just do not have time to produce."</TE>

<HD>Garfunkel, with two new partners, hits the high notes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The velvety tenor of Art Garfunkel hasn't always been put to good use
over the years. He is capable of taking a song to epic vocal heights,
as in the career-defining Simon &amp; Garfunkel hit "Bridge Over Troubled
Water," but in the course of an entire concert, the soft, ethereal
nature of his voice benefits from some vocal contrast.</LD>
<LD>   At the Wiltern on Sunday, Garfunkel found some with the help of
two new musical partners, Maia Sharp and Buddy Mondlock, who have
collaborated on his new album, "Everything Waits to Be Noticed."</LD>
<LD>   The trio and a four-piece band performed new songs and Simon &amp;
Garfunkel hits, riding whispery harmonies and delicate
instrumentation. New songs included "The Thread" and others that
marked the debut of Garfunkel as a songwriter. Like others on Sunday,
they were best when stripped down to a direct, mostly acoustic
approach.</LD>
<TE>   Voices don't necessarily fade with middle age. Rocker Robert Plant
may not be able to hit the old high notes, but Mick Jagger sings in a
growl that's richer and fuller than ever. At the Wiltern, 60-year-old
Garfunkel hit those soft, high notes just as easily.</TE>
<TE>   Since the '70s, Garfunkel has frequently tapped the songwriting of
Jimmy Webb, whose "Skywriter" was unraveled Sunday with layers of
emotional intensity. Not everything was tastefully performed. The
tempo jumped for Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "Cecilia," but with an overly
busy tropical instrumentation that was more Club Med than memorable.</TE>
<TE>   But when the singer once again tackled "Bridge Over Troubled
Water," ending to an earned standing ovation, it was clear that with
the right material, Garfunkel wasn't in need of any help at all.</TE>

<HD>Building a shrine to Hollywood</HD>
<DH>A hall of fame for the movies is glaringly absent here,
says a group of entrepreneurs trying to fill the gap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball has one. So do rock 'n' roll and country music. And, if all
goes well, the film industry will soon have a venue honoring its own
heavy hitters and star-studded past: the Motion Picture Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Located in the 75-year-old Broadway Building, at the corner of
Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, the $25-million project is
scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2004. The three-story,
45,000-square-foot "commercial-themed attraction," as its backers
call it, will have halls commemorating comedy, horror and science
fiction, interactive rotating and permanent exhibits, a restaurant
and a theater seating 50, the average number of people on the tour
buses they anticipate will make up 20% to 30% of their business.</LD>
<LD>   Each year, 10 new inductees, nominated by critics but selected by
the public, will be named in seven categories: movie, actor, actress,
producer, director, writer and film score. To whet people's appetite,
a two-hour TV show, "Motion Picture Hall of Fame Honors," is in the
works, but no outlet has been lined up. Winners will walk away with a
statuette called the Max.</LD>
<TE>   At a press conference this morning, Johnny Grant, Hollywood's
honorary mayor, is expected to hail the venture -- designed by the
Glendale firm Troxtel Design -- as a crucial component in the effort
to revive the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of our vision, of course, " said Robert Alexander,
co-founder and chief executive of the hall of fame enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   "But our statement of purpose is to honor those people who've had
a profound impact on the art form," he added. "Hollywood is known as
a dream factory around the world. But when people get here, there's
no shrine dedicated to the process of filmmaking and those who
created the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander and attorney Steve Godwin came up with the idea 2 1/2
years ago and focused first on the bottom line. Rounding up an
entrepreneurial team that included a special-effects lighting
director and specialists in promotion and fund-raising, they came up
with $5 million for the first phase, to cover the cost of setting up
the building, signing a 20-year lease and creating the TV show. By
the end of five years, they hope to raise the requisite $25 million

Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has its own movie-related

<TE>   A spokesman for the academy declined to comment, saying the

monumental task. We're not the first to think of a hall of fame --
just the first ones to take action."</TE>

<HD>Music to be consoled by</HD>
<DH>While San Francisco dealt with a Giant disappointment, the
city's 20th jazz festival eased the misery with its own brand of
mystique.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Just at the pause of intermission Sunday night at
the McCoy Tyner-Elvin Jones show, capping off the first weekend of
the San Francisco Jazz Festival, the word came over radios and
pagers: It would have to be another year.</LD>
<LD>   For five days, rabid jazz and Giant fans had had their attention
split -- running out to catch the score at some overstuffed bar
across the street; plugged into MP3s set to radio mode; phones placed
on vibrate.</LD>
<LD>   But about 8:20 p.m., just as Tyner's lush big band set was
coasting to a close, the news was final: The Giants had lost the
World Series. Ear buds were removed. Palm Pilots went back into
purses and breast pockets.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, the good news is," said one fan, leaning back into the
plush of his orchestra seat, putting his cell phone away, zipping his
pocket with a crisp sense of finality, "now the city can get down to
singular business" -- deterred but undaunted: the business of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to master trapsman Jones to put all in perspective and
provide the balm. Jones, looking the part of a healer, in his long
white robes and matching pants, set about to raise spirits.
Intuitively he revisited a piece played at another show, just days
before, "It Don't Mean a Thing," and showered his shimmering high-hat
and ebullient smiles on downcast Giant fans.</TE>
<TE>   All of it is a far cry from the pumped-up mood of Wednesday, as
fans crushed into the city. At that point, no one was fooling
themselves. All those men in windbreakers clustered at the lip of
freeway off-ramps waving laminated orange-and-black signs declaring
"I need tickets" clearly meant Pac Bell Park, not the Regency Center
where opening festivities for the 20th anniversary of the city's jazz
festival were set to kick off.</TE>
<TE>   So be it. But the festival folks could dream.</TE>
<TE>   And by the weekend, the extrapolations on jazz are again
illustrated -- from Wayne Shorter and Branford Marsalis'
straight-ahead, no-sleight-of-hand prowess to Ruben Blades and his
fusion of pop rock and tropical sounds. It's jazz as a life force,
not a museum piece.</TE>
<TE>   While some might quibble that some of it might not meet our
textbook notion of jazz, it really is about what is being created in
a big dark room, the magic of watching something grow and push
forward. But attempting to launch a grand-scale event -- 18 days,
50-plus ensembles, 11 venues -- while an entire city is in the midst
of a collective teeth-clench seems an unfortunate set of
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Though jazz struggles -- in market share and with
attracting an audience of young fans -- it is seldom daunted over the
long haul. Its mystique goes a long way. And in a city known for its
finer things, from food to literature, and those who want to be the
first or only to have sampled them, hundreds of Bay Area residents
and jazz itinerants are leaving their easy chairs to see what it
looks like up close.</TE>
<TE>   They come, perhaps because jazz festivals too have their own
mystique, familiar images embroidered on them: a lone-wolf musician
with some bulky silhouette of an instrument slung across his back;
women in sleeveless summer sheaths relaxing with a picnic, eyes fixed
on the stage a la Bert Stern's watercolor-like time capsule, "Jazz on
a Summer Day," a documentary of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.</TE>
<TE>   While in reality today's jazz visual motif might be more a cross
of Birkenstocks and Banana Republic instead of stingy brims and
wingtips, SF Jazz indeed steps out with singular style. With an honor
roll of jazz dignitaries, Ellis Marsalis and Yusef Lateef, Shirley
Horn and Ornette Coleman, one would be hard pressed to find a weak
spot on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Opening night, the festival makes itself at home in the grand and
drafty set of ballrooms and amber-lit antechambers in the Regency
Center complex at the corner of Van Ness and Sutter. The christening
celebration, "New Orleans in SF," is a Chinese box sort of an event,
a party within a party within a party, progressing in three rooms
simultaneously, overlapping like good conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs in the Sutter Room, Mitch Woods' Big Easy Boogie
launches in. Woods, in a lilac suit and -- if you could believe it --
an even louder wide tie, cuts blusey turns, then kicks it up a notch
with breathless, thundering runs across the piano keyboard. The hope
is to coax movement out of the people marooned semi-motionless on the
dance floor, people like Joy Hawkins, from Berkeley, there in her
feathered Mardi Gras mask, which she alternately dons atop her head,
giving it the air of a feathered pillbox hat.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins watches Woods, with his head up, all black lacquer hair
and antic expression, pounding out something he calls
"rock-a-boogie." He's accompanied by a phalanx of men with big hats
and big horns who look like they just finished a good game of chess
in front of the old St. Louis Cathedral. Woods amps up the mood as
early arrivals, draped in carnival throws, line up for New Orleanean
specialties including jambalaya (both seafood and vegetarian, after
all it is San Francisco). He mixes a taste of the traditional --
Professor Longhair -- with some bobbing Jerry Lee Lewis-style shimmy
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Spell working, head bobbing, Hawkins explains she "wouldn't have
missed this for the world." A festival groupie, she travels from one
celebration to the next. This one though, was important for other
reasons: "This is the 20th year. Oh, I just had to be here for this
one."</TE>
<TE>   Important in that the festival has shot up like a weed. Run by the
nonprofit SF Jazz organization, co-founded by Randall Kline, it's
grown from a three-day-long event called "Jazz in the City" that took
place at two venues. Now, it is considered to be one of the most
important and influential jazz events on the West Coast. Its
relatively long history inspires Hurricane punch-fueled one-upmanship
tales: "Now, I don't know if you were here for Ornette Coleman's
cut-'n'-paste show in 1994?" ... "Were you here for Joshua Redman's
debut in '84? Now that was a show."</TE>
<TE>   SF Jazz has been long committed to a diversity of styles,
interpretations and orientations (yes, Merle Haggard indeed is set to
perform a Bob Wills/Texas swing tribute on Nov. 8). Proceeds from the
festival, and other year-round programming, are funneled into various
jazz education programs, helping to nurture the next generation --
players, aficionados, fans, the inheritors.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that schooling is going on here. One flight above, as if
we are watching evolution take place right before our eyes,
saxophonist Donald Harrison Jr., the "King of Nouveau Swing," snaps
up the musical baton and races forward.</TE>
<TE>   Son of a late great Mardi Gras Indian chief and informed by the
hip-hop generation, the junior Harrison knows a little something
about braiding the traditional squawk and strut of the second line
with smooth Ramsey Lewis grooves, tweaked with hip hop's relationship
to funk. The lagniappe: drummer Idris Muhammad, sitting behind his
kit as if behind a throne in his bright teal tam, knocking it out.
All of which eventually expands into its own miniature Mardi Gras
celebration: Harrison out of his suit, now draped in feathers; the
stage as dim as a bayou.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Dirty Dozen Brass Band commandeers the stage,
stretching and teasing rhythms, they've long reworked not just the
concept of "social and pleasure club," but the very definition of
social and pleasure. This post-modern benevolent society bends,
flaunts and works it. "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that
swing" becomes not a statement, but a taunt. They scratch out the
rules and rewrite them as they go; second-line rowdiness becomes
avant-praise music.They perform in jeans and T-shirts and coveralls,
sleeves rolled up. Why? Because jazz is work.</TE>
<TE>   The next few nights set the tone, elaborate on this idea of
inheritors and antecedents -- intersections and amalgamations. Jazz
is a high-wire act. It is that invisible thread that tethers musician
to musician, the audience to the stage, allowing all those
heart-in-the throat moments to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Thursday's evening of "Global Guitars," Malian guitarist
Djelimady Tounkara, leader of the legendary Super Rail Band, sits
shoulder to shoulder with the rest of his traveling ensemble -- as if
before a coffee table -- plinking out silvery, wind-chime notes.</TE>
<TE>   He reaches back to his early repertoire to tell griot stories,
shot through with flashes of flamenco, Western classical guitar --
fluid, borderless -- all the while a grateful smile hovering on his
face.</TE>
<TE>   Basking in the glow, guitarist Charlie Hunter and Idris Muhammad
share an intimate corner of that very stage. Muhammad sends up
rhythms from Cuba and Africa, some on his kit, others on a
hollowed-out log -- exotic flowers all of them. Hunter returns with a
tone so warm and fat and textured that the stage sounds as if it is
full of horns, vibes and a Hammond B3 -- just for starters.</TE>
<TE>   Like Harrison, Hunter has been shaped as much by funk, pop,
hip-hop and reggae as by jazz -- a stepping-stone in his own right.
The mood of the room reflects it.</TE>
<TE>   A younger crowd in flip-flops and cargo shorts fills up the main
space. By now the event has taken on the vibe of a good house party.
Music and diversion in many rooms. A joint fires up. Dancing solo is
not just allowed, but encouraged. Jazz band or jam band? Doesn't
matter what it's called, as long as the spirit is moved.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night at the Masonic Auditorium atop Nob Hill, Brazilian
national treasure Caetano Veloso struts out on a minimalist stage,
skinny and self-sure, ready to show this well-heeled
packed-to-the-rafters crowd how very much can be done with so very
little. Is he a god or rocker? A sambaista? A performance artist? All
of the above?</TE>
<TE>   Veloso defies categorization as does the music he has drifted
toward and then resculpted for decades.</TE>
<TE>   He underscores the blurred lines and abstractions, strumming an
open-bodied guitar rimmed in black that looks more like a charcoal
sketch, a dashed-off Picasso.</TE>
<TE>   He belts out a psychedelic-tinged anthem in Portuguese. Then dips
into a tiny, jewel-box version of "Stars Fell on Alabama" in bossa
nova pose, one leg draped over the other, toes tipped slightly upward
-- illustrating with little fuss that there is not as much of a
distance between jazz and its relations as we'd like to think.</TE>

<LD>If you were looking for a knee-jerk defender of artists' rights,
you'd find me first in line. So when I started hearing about
CleanFlicks, ClearPlay and the other Utah companies that have
developed technology to edit out profanity, sex and violence from
home videos, I was appalled by the idea of people chopping up movies
simply to fit their moral sensitivities. As director Michael Mann
recently told a Times reporter: "The idea that somebody else can
arbitrarily take our works apart and destroy them ... there's no
polite word for it -- it's stealing."</LD>
<LD>   Right on, Michael. When it comes to attacks on artistic freedom by
a bunch of philistines, I'm on your side. And then I had an
unsettling little epiphany.</LD>
<LD>   When it came to watching movies with my 4-year-old son, Luke, I
was -- ahem -- something of a philistine myself. One of Luke's (and
my) favorite movies is "The Lion King." But the film has one scene,
in which Mufasa dies trying to save his son in a stampede, that was
simply too intense for him to watch. "Dada!" he would shriek, holding
his ears. "Skip! Skip!" At first, we'd simply fast-forward to the
next scene. Then I had a friend dub a copy of the video with the
scene edited out.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, Luke has watched "The Lion King" about 900 times
without incident. But what about me? Have I painted a mustache on a
masterpiece? The Directors Guild of America firmly believes I have.
Joined by a group of prominent Hollywood directors that includes
Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, the DGA has taken legal action
to shut down a host of companies they say are illegally altering
movies. The DGA suit casts a broad net, going after such companies as
CleanFlicks, which sells reedited versions of Hollywood films, as
well as firms such as ClearPlay and Principle Solutions, which sell
software that operates more like a remote-control clicker, giving
parents the option of sanitizing otherwise unaltered DVDs and videos.</TE>
<TE>   According to DGA consultant Lon Sobel, who teaches entertainment
law at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, my "Lion King"
analogy is imprecise. Copyright law, he says, allows individuals to
fast-forward, skip or mute scenes, but companies can't sell software
that does it for us. But, I asked, doesn't Sony sell clickers that
fast-forward and mute for us? Yes, Sobel says, "but it's still the
consumer who's doing the fast-forwarding, not Sony doing it for us."</TE>
<TE>   He adds that according to a federal trademark statute known as the
Lanham Act, an outside company can't edit or create new versions of
someone's work without permission. "These companies are either
editing or creating software that reflects the editing made by the
company, not by an individual," Sobel says. "So when you see one of
their videos, the editing is so seamless that if you don't understand
[the narrative logic of the film], you have no idea whether the
editing was done by their program or by the original filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   The DGA believes it has legal precedent on its side. But with
nearly every advance in entertainment technology geared to consumer
choice, it becomes more of a struggle to put the genie back into the
bottle.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to an intellectual debate over artistic
integrity, the entertainment business, having made so many craven
concessions to self-censorship and commerce in recent years, has a
weak case. Parents are tired of being played for suckers. The more I
talked to my friends, especially parents who've spent years diving
for the clicker to fast-forward through a scary scene in a movie or a
repellent commercial on a kids' TV show, the easier it was for me to
side with consumer rights over copyright protection.</TE>
<TE>   When a studio buys a popular novel, as Universal did with Thomas
Harris' "Red Dragon," it's entitled to create or eliminate as many
scenes as it sees fit. Yet if I buy a copy of the same movie and use
a program to fast-forward through the scene in which a serial killer
tortures Philip Seymour Hoffman, rips out his tongue and set his
corpse on fire, it's suddenly a heinous trampling of artists' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasing the ratings board</TE>
<TE>   I might be more sympathetic to the DGA's case if someone were
willing to acknowledge the vast abandonment of artistic principles
that occurs daily in the movie business. Michael Apted, one of the
many distinguished directors who has joined the DGA's suit, recently
told The Times that if "any small interested parties are entitled to
change anything to suit their own particular will ... that leaves you
in anarchy and chaos. It's fascism to me."</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to Apted, if he wants to point fingers at
small interested parties that change film content to suit their own
particular will, why not start with the 13 anonymous parents who make
up the Motion Picture Assn. of America ratings board? Thanks to the
failure of studios or filmmakers to challenge their judgments, the
ratings board enjoys the absolute power to arbitrarily force
filmmakers to mutilate delicate works of art by cutting out scenes
that somehow offended the rating board's sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   As far as I can tell, the filters designed by companies such as
ClearPlay simply deputize parents to be ratings board surrogates.
With a flick of a switch, they can jettison sex or profane language,
instantly transforming an R-rated movie into a PG-13 film, or a PG-13
film into a PG. Here's the DGA voicing outrage over a digital tool
that gives parents the ability to cut out dirty words, and yet most
of these same filmmakers meekly kowtow to the capricious judgments of
a roomful of anonymous overseers, slicing and dicing their beloved
works of art to earn a PG-13 rating, giving their film infinitely
more profit potential.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to sympathize with the DGA's efforts to prevent parents
from cleaning up movies when it allows studios to do it every day. As
long as there's a buck in it down the line, filmmakers allow studios
to reedit their films for TV and airplane broadcast. If studio
research numbers come in low, filmmakers willingly change endings,
reshoot scenes, tone down sex and violence, cut out entire characters
and subplots, and even change the whole tone of a film to make it
more commercially salable.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers aren't the only ones who've ceded their right to the
moral high ground by placating moralists or grandstanding politicians
with self-censorship. When family-values activists attacked smutty
lyrics in the 1980s, the music business began labeling potentially
offensive CDs with parental warning stickers. And when Wal-Mart and
other retailers told record companies they wouldn't carry stickered
CDs, the record companies agreed to make "clean" CDs that had been
laundered of enough foul language to be sold without a warning
sticker. Nearly every artist has agreed to sanitize records, even
though it's Wal-Mart that sets the rules, not the artists -- no doubt
because Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 10% of CD sales.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, you can find plenty of "uncensored" versions of
popular films in video stores, meaning that studios have discovered
the value of offering dirtier edits. If studios, backed by
filmmakers, also provided "clean" versions of their big movie hits,
they might not be faced with such a grass-roots parental rebellion.
In today's culture, everything is about choice -- our national motto
should be "Have it your way." It comes as no surprise that ClearPlay
chief Bill Aho used to be a brand manager at Procter &amp; Gamble; he
recognizes the power of a consumer-friendly product.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone thinks Americans are going to allow film directors to
rip the remote control out of their hand, you're underestimating the
desire people in this country have for personal choice," Aho says.
"Technology enables lots of things that people don't like. I'm sure
directors would love to outlaw the mute button and the fast-forward
button if they could. But in the living room, it's Mom and Dad's
call, not the film director."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this skirmish between the DGA and parent-friendly
filtering devices represents only the latest salvo in a much bigger
war -- the ongoing battle between media companies and the technology
industry. Whether the war is over Internet file-sharing, MP3s or CD
burning, the fight essentially boils down to people who profit from
copyright (media conglomerates, filmmakers and recording artists)
versus people who profit from serving consumers (electronics firms
and Internet mavens). For the past several decades, the most popular
new technologies -- from the VCR, the CD and the Sony Walkman to the
DVD, MP3, iPod and TiVo -- have been designed to give consumers more
control and convenience in experiencing entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   When I play music on a CD or computer or MP3, I can reconfigure it
any way I want, adding or skipping tracks, mixing and matching music
from different artists. Thanks to DVDs, I can watch a movie in an
entirely different order than the artist intended, skip scenes I
don't like or listen to the director's commentary instead of the
original dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   If ClearPlay had a program letting you skip all the Jar Jar Binks
scenes in "Star Wars," wouldn't you jump at the chance to try it?</TE>
<TE>   For years, MPAA czar Jack Valenti and his counterparts in the
record business have provided ratings information and warning
stickers, but insisted that it's ultimately parents' responsibility
to monitor what their kids are watching. But now that someone has
come up with a way to make that unenviable task a little easier,
filmmakers are crying foul.</TE>
<TE>   They argue that if parents are given any control over the process,
their artistry will be threatened by chaos and fascism.</TE>
<TE>   My advice to the DGA: Watch your step. Whoever thought I'd be
paraphrasing Charlton Heston? But if you tell parents they're
lawbreakers when they try to do right by their kids, you're going to
find a lot of people daring you to rip those family-friendly filters
out of their cold, dead hands.</TE>

<HD>Quirky portrayal brings 'Galileo's Battle' to life</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Galileo's Battle for the Heavens," on PBS' "Nova" series tonight,
might well have been a boring video version of a Smithsonian
exhibition, drenched in sepia tones and wrapped in the dulcet tones
of narrator Liev Schreiber.</LD>
<LD>   It is rescued by British actor Simon Callow, perhaps best known as
the gregarious dandy who died dramatically in "Four Wedding and a
Funeral." He plays Galileo with a kitschy brilliance, convincingly
conveying Galileo's stubborn, even snobbish stance against the 17th
century Roman Catholic Church, which banned his books and put him
under house arrest for challenging the prevailing view of the Earth
as the center of the universe.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, of course, Galileo was vindicated, liberating future
generations of scientists to explore the universe we all know today.</LD>
<TE>   For all his brilliance -- including his widely acknowledged role
as "the father of modern science" -- Galileo's most profound
achievement may have been as a glass grinder. Had he not been capable
of shaping the first real telescope lenses, we might still be trying
to figure out why that big yellow ball in the sky keeps revolving
around the Earth. Able to peer through the first real telescopes,
Galileo got the world's first up-close peek at Jupiter, which he
discovered had its own orbiting moons.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his observation that the sun's light changed Venus from
an oval to a crescent that led him to conclude that it must be
orbiting the sun, rather than the Earth. This, in turn, led to the
revolutionary -- and dangerous -- conclusion that the Earth was not
the center of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   Galileo may be science history's most sympathetic figure -- as
well as, ironically, a faithful Catholic himself -- but he was no
angel. He had three children out of wedlock, a major faux pas at the
time, and reportedly liked to have a good time, much like Callow's
character in "Four Weddings." This lifestyle did not work in his
favor. But what really put him over the edge was his 1632 publication
of the book "Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems," which not only
espouses his theory of the solar system, but also has a simpleton
mouth the words of the then-reigning Pope Urban VIII. Callow's quirky
portrayal brings to life a Galileo who would wave his finger in the
face of the all-powerful church.</TE>
<TE>   But the astronomer clung to his views for far more powerful
reasons than a clash with the church. Galileo knew how important it
is for those of us who inhabit this planet to know our place in the
universe. In the program, which is based on science writer Dava
Sobel's book "Galileo's Daughter," one scientist says Galileo
believed that "the Bible was the true word of God. He just didn't
think it was a good astronomy textbook."</TE>

<HD>Playbox's goal: thoughtful theater for teens</HD>
<DH>The British company's productions, such as 'A Clockwork
Orange,' are intended to raise issues with young audiences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say "theater for young audiences," and the expectation is most likely
fairy tales and puppet shows for 5-year-olds. The reality is a world
of performance geared to all age levels, as far-reaching as theater
created expressly for adults.</LD>
<LD>   Case in point is Britain's well-regarded Playbox Theatre and its
new production for ages 14 and older: Anthony Burgess' shocker of a
1962 novella, "A Clockwork Orange," playing Wednesday and Friday at
the Santa Monica Playhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Adapted by Burgess, this unsettling drama about vicious teenage
"droogs" and brutal, state-sponsored rehabilitation, raising serious
questions of good and evil and the freedom of choice, is performed by
actors who range in age from 15 to 21.</LD>
<TE>   "Our society over here has been going through quite a difficult
time. There's a lot of urban violence," said Stewart McGill,
Playbox's artistic director, who feels that the stark drama's
underlying message of what happens when society loses its humanity is
a timely one. "We wanted a work that we felt could speak to young
audiences in the U.K. -- and in the U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences won't be subjected to the horrific, ever-haunting images
in Stanley Kubrick's film version, however, and "it doesn't have the
Kubrick kind of glam-rock design, either," McGill said. "We're
staging it as a very physical piece, almost a piece of musical
theater, set to Beethoven. The violence is tightly choreographed
within the music and the actors are nowhere near each other, so you
see the actions in isolation -- at no point are we aiming to
re-create what the violent act may be."</TE>
<TE>   An essential part of each performance is a discussion between
actors and audience about their perspectives on issues of urban
decline, the treatment of criminals and the responsibilities of
members of society.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel the work is complete until we've had that
dialogue," McGill said.</TE>
<TE>   This dramatic work, challenging for both actors and audience, is
part of a long-standing cultural exchange between the playhouse's
Young Professionals' Company, known for its original, life-exploring
dramas, and Playbox, with its varied repertoire of cutting-edge
dramas, classics and commedia dell'arte. It's a close, 10-year bond
that includes a third sister company, Japan's Model Language Studio,
which has done collaborative works with both.</TE>
<TE>   The British company's choice of the Burgess piece, said Evelyn
Rudie, who heads the playhouse with her husband, Chris DeCarlo,
resonated with their own youth company's passion for theatrical
explorations of "the deterioration of respect for humanity, for youth
in general. When young people are portraying these difficult emotions
and different possible futures," she said, "it becomes even more
effective."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Playbox is underscoring that solidarity of sentiment.
Its visit is part of the Santa Monica Playhouse's fund-raising
campaign, launched this year to help Rudie and DeCarlo purchase
partial ownership of the theater due to rising rents that threaten
its future.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give them a vote of our confidence and underline why
we think they're important," McGill said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all darkness and droogs at the playhouse this week;
Playbox is also serving younger audiences on Friday afternoon with
poet Ted Hughes' quirky version of "Beauty and the Beast."</TE>

<HD>Acting can be a long and winding role</HD>
<DH>In 'All or Nothing,' Timothy Spall builds another character
from scratch for British director Mike Leigh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Timothy Spall once described himself as a "decent, jolly fat guy."
But the British character actor is being unduly modest. As one of the
most versatile members of Mike Leigh's stock company of actors, Spall
has played everything from an outrageous chef in "Life Is Sweet" to a
decent, working-class husband in "Secrets &amp; Lies" to an effervescent
star of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan musicals in "Topsy-Turvy."</LD>
<LD>   In "All or Nothing," Leigh's latest examination of the
working-class denizens of contemporary England, Spall creates another
indelible character, Phil -- a despairing taxicab driver with two
overweight grown children and a common-law wife (Leigh favorite
Lesley Manville) who has grown out of love with him. It's a
heart-wrenching performance in a film that is considered grim, even
by Leigh's standards. Spall, 45, has little dialogue in it -- he
records Phil's anguish and pain through his silence and the hangdog
sadness in his face.</LD>
<TE>   In person, Spall is sweet and a little shy -- very much the kind
of decent bloke Leigh makes films about. During a recent visit to Los
Angeles, the actor recalled the screening of "All or Nothing" in May
at the Cannes Film Festival. "For this film to reveal itself to that
kind of chichi, chic crowd and to hear the Prada handbags opening and
the tissues coming out because they were moved, it was wonderful," he
says. "He's immensely versatile," Leigh says of Spall. "He has a huge
sense of society. He can play any sort of people. He has a sense of
where they are coming from and if they are accurate." Leigh recalled
that he and Spall immediately clicked when the actor walked into an
audition for his 1981 BBC movie, "Home Sweet Home." "He particularly
responds to the way I work," says the director. "He goes on the
adventure. The thing is I [say to actors,] 'Be in this film. I can't
tell you what it is about or what the character is. You will only
know what the character knows and you won't have an overview of the
film.' "</TE>
<TE>   Working on a Leigh film, says Spall, takes about a year, with the
rehearsal procedure lasting about six months. "Each actor chooses a
character usually based on someone from your life," he says. In the
case of Phil, he was based on three people Spall knew. Working with
Leigh one-on-one, Phil takes on a life of his own. "You start
inventing their life," says Spall. "It's almost a parallel universe."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Leigh brings all the characters together and puts them
into scenes. "You log every single moment of their development and
you develop in minute detail every aspect of their lives," Spall
explains. "You do improvisations, but you never get into an
improvisation unless you are completely in character. It takes 20
minutes to warm up before you enter an environment Mike has set up.
Sometimes improvisations go on for three or four hours. You could
just be sitting in front of a television or reading the paper or just
living as if you are these people. It's a very, very pure way to put
these characters in real time."</TE>
<TE>   Spall did a fair share of research into the life of cabbies in
London, speaking with them to find out about their day-to-day
existence. "I had to know about insurance and what you pay, all of
those specifics. Otherwise you are just inventing."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the characters who inhabit Leigh's movies, says Spall, are
people others would just ignore. "They definitely wouldn't be the
center of the drama," says Spall. "That is a unique side of Mike's
work. This character in another film would only have one line. He'd
be the guy who'd pick up the star of the film. Mike chooses all of
these people who are representative of most of humanity and
dramatizes that."</TE>
<TE>   Spall hasn't had any problems going from a Leigh film to working
in a more traditional method. "You always take some elements of what
you have learned in this process about creating multilayered
characters, knowing where they came from," he says. .</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, Spall didn't talk about his bout with leukemia
six years ago. "I can talk about it now freely because it was
something that happened to me," he says. The actor was about to go
with Leigh and the rest of the cast of "Secrets &amp; Lies" to the Cannes
festival when he was diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   "The day they walked up the carpet [into the screening] at Cannes,
I was getting my first chemotherapy. What happened was I was about 18
months out of work. I had to recover, I was weakened. But when I came
back, 'Secrets &amp; Lies' had been out there, so not only was I still
alive, I had a film career."</TE>

<HD>Mothers' Bill of Rights: a baby step toward radical goal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The money world and the mommy world are sorely out of balance. There
is no way to offer the care and nurturing most mothers would like to
lavish on their children and yet maintain the paycheck that allows
dignity, family and career to survive.</LD>
<LD>   Even for mothers who can afford it, there's no easy way to swap a
career for a stay-at-home life to raise kids. At least not without
feeling guilty that they are not contributing to the family coffers,
not contributing to society, not using the intellect, education and
opportunity that women fought so hard and long to achieve.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, women are not supposed to complain about this. They
fought for decades to win the right to vote, to equal education, to
equal work and equal pay. Now, the popular thinking goes, they have
to live with the results. Well, no they don't.</LD>
<TE>   Rumblings of dissatisfaction, subtle but persistent for the past
few years, now verge on becoming a roar. Essays, books and films are
being written by women who want to move forward to a society that
values the act of mothering as an option in women's lives and as a
way to better the future of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Enola Aird Carter, an affiliate scholar at the Institute for
American Values (a private nonprofit think tank in Manhattan that
focuses on family-related issues) and director of the institute's
Motherhood Project, has drafted a call for a new motherhood movement,
a kind of Mothers' Bill of Rights. She has organized a symposium
today at Barnard College in Manhattan. It is a step toward a distant
goal: "We want to change the way our culture is structured. Right now
it is structured so we live to work. We would like more balance, so
we can live to nurture our families as well. I am confident that the
debate, once joined by mothers across the country, will yield more
options and lead to major policy changes down the road."</TE>
<TE>   Carter is a Yale law school graduate who tried working in the
corporate world, staying home to raise her kids, and then going to
work again. Nothing seemed to satisfy. "I was happy to be with my
children but unhappy to be at home -- because I came face to face
with a culture that devalued what I was doing, which was mothering. I
went from being somebody important to someone invisible."</TE>
<TE>   Her "Call to a Motherhood Movement" asks society to start
"honoring and supporting mothers and the work of mothering"; to
ensure "the dignity and well-being of children"; and to "reorder the
priorities of our society ... that is losing touch with the essential
ethics of care and nurture indispensable for children and for a good
society."</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy. The traditional interests of mothers and their
children, such as education, safety and morality, are no longer
societal priorities, Carter believes. It is these big-picture issues
on which the panel will focus rather than on specific problems of day
care, financial need and the like, Carter says.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, many working mothers find they can discuss almost
anything in the office except the issue that consumes them most --
the lack of time and energy to cook, clean, find day care, stay home
with a sick child, help with homework, attend school meetings, teach
character and values -- and just have fun with their kids. To discuss
these things at work often makes them feel whiney, unprofessional and
inefficient.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many stay-at-home moms feel equally challenged. They
are often belittled by mothers with paying jobs, by husbands who
think they should have paying jobs, and by anyone who asks the
dreaded cocktail-party question: What do you do? "I take care of my
kids" is too often perceived as "I do nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the clever woman has learned to put a humorous,
self-deprecating spin on the whole 21st century mothering mess. The
dribble on the work clothes, altering store-bought food to look
homemade. Laughter masks the pain of mothering diminished and with so
many women in that situation, it could also bring in big bucks.
Miramax paid novelist Allison Pearson $2 million for "I Don't Know
How She Does It," her social comedy about a hotshot careerist mother
who finds that -- no matter what the early feminists believed --
women can't have it all.</TE>
<TE>   Humor won't suffice, says Janet Giele, professor of public policy
at Brandeis University, and member of today's symposium. She calls
the motherhood movement "the first serious attempt in 40 years to
reach a new plateau in women's lives. The attempt to restructure
society to acknowledge women's need to mother, and society's need to
have them do that," is a brilliant step ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We all recognize our own mothers and appreciate their
contribution to our lives," says Eileen Lindner, deputy general
secretary of the National Council of Churches and a member of the
panel. "But as yet we have not as a society recognized the importance
of mothering itself." It really doesn't matter whether a woman stays
home to raise children, works full time or does anything in between,
she says. "There should be no more debates about which is better. But
the act of nurturing -- in whatever time a woman has to do it --
should be acknowledged as a critical role."</TE>
<TE>   Panel member Jean Bethke Elshtain, professor of social and
political ethics at the University of Chicago, says women's suffrage
was achieved, in large part, because people believed the world would
be better if the maternal perspective was included in its shaping.
Nowadays, that perspective is rarely acknowledged or invoked, she
says. "It's time to reinforce the values of mothering, its impact,
and all that entails."</TE>
<TE>   Carter, 45, was the first in her family to go to college
(Barnard). At law school, she met her husband, Stephen Carter, who is
a Yale professor and author. After working as an attorney, she had
the first of her two children in 1985. But mothering was not valued.
"Women wanted to feel they were making a contribution -- and raising
children was not considered part of that. I felt I could give my
children a set of things other caregivers couldn't give them. But
people said: 'You spent so much time with your education, why would
you want to stay at home?' " Even members of her family told her she
should do more challenging work. So she went back but soon felt she
was shortchanging her children and came home again.</TE>
<TE>   She has spent the last 15 years as a part-time children's advocate
while raising her kids. "Whether mothers work outside the home or
not, their work as mothers -- in that space and time where they take
care of their children, and love and guide them -- that space must be
given honor and value."</TE>

networks are in PR mode. CBS touts its momentum; NBC notes its lead.</DH>

<LD>Forget mundane skirmishes over booking guests or conceiving the best
comedy bits. The late-night battle between "The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno" and "Late Show With David Letterman" this fall has boiled down
to back-and-forth salvos of public-relations spin.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the beauty of ratings is that both networks can use
them to support their respective points, prompting a weekly barrage
of news releases that draw different conclusions from the same set of
numbers.</LD>
<LD>   So CBS, which signed Letterman to a much-publicized contract
extension in March after he received overtures from ABC, is pressing
the point that its host has momentum and is closing the gap with the
front-running "Tonight Show," capitalizing on bigger audience
lead-ins into local news thanks to its new 10 p.m. dramas --
particularly "CSI: Miami" on Mondays and "Without a Trace" on
Thursdays.</LD>
<TE>   NBC, by contrast, has hammered home that Leno has maintained
"decisive margins," withstanding "Late Show's" gains on certain
nights and in selected cities.</TE>
<TE>   Where does the truth lie? Four weeks into the new TV season, "The
Tonight Show" is averaging 5.8 million viewers versus 4.1 million for
Letterman -- still a commanding advantage. Both shows are down
compared with the same period a year ago -- when late-night viewing
surged in the wake of Sept. 11 -- but Leno has fallen a bit more, so
the spread between them has narrowed ever so slightly.</TE>
<TE>   In short, on its face, not much has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Late Show" is exhibiting improvement on some fronts, with
producers of the show citing increased tune-in Monday as proof that
Letterman would equal or surpass "The Tonight Show" if the playing
field were leveled. NBC still enjoys a sizable lead at 10 p.m.
Wednesday through Friday, thanks to "ER" and two editions of "Law &amp;
Order."</TE>
<TE>   "Lead-ins have been, are and always will be the biggest factor in
late-night ratings," said "Late Show" executive producer Rob Burnett,
who is president of Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants. To bolster
his case, Burnett said that the two shows have been in a "virtual
dead heat" on Mondays, where the "CSI" spinoff handily beats NBC's
"Crossing Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   If the debate seems academic, Letterman's second-class ratings
status -- despite the show's greater critical acclaim and five
consecutive Emmys as outstanding variety or comedy series -- was a
major issue in the host's contract negotiations. Letterman has chafed
at trailing Leno, and his camp has consistently blamed the late-night
disparity on CBS' weaker prime-time performance.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concessions extracted from CBS, in fact, was a
commitment to run more "Late Show" promotions on Viacom-owned sister
properties, including MTV, VH1 and Infinity radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, CBS and a few media outlets focused attention on
Letterman before the season, projecting that higher ratings at 10
p.m. would spill over, benefiting late local newscasts and late night
-- all areas sure to be closely watched as a key period for stations,
the November rating sweeps, begins Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, NBC officials contend that nearly a decade into
the Leno-Letterman face-off, viewers have had ample time to make
their choice, dismissing the notion that prime-time results are
responsible for "The Tonight Show's" dominance.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Considine, executive producer of "Tonight" for NBC Studios,
conceded that "CSI: Miami" has had some effect, but said it requires
that sort of extreme to move the late-night needle in either
direction.</TE>
<TE>   This fall's ratings, he said, "just keep proving the point that
people know these two shows, they know these two hosts, and they know
how to use a remote control."</TE>
<TE>   Considine added that NBC officials were nervous about a shift
given the extra support for Letterman, but said thus far those
concerns have been unfounded. "The bottom line is there's no story,
and that's the story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-area ratings support the correlation of prime time,
news and late-night viewing, although even with KCBS-TV making
inroads in all three areas, Leno still has a sizable lead.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen Media Research, KCBS is up more than 20%
versus last year from 10:45 to 11 p.m. -- the window leading directly
into local news -- and its news has risen by a similar margin. That
has translated into a 15% ratings increase for "Late Show," to about
122,000 homes tuning in on average, or 2.3% of TV households in the
viewing area.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC-TV, by contrast, is down 15% across the board during the last
quarter-hour of prime time, its 11 p.m. news and "The Tonight Show."
The NBC-owned station retains a clear advantage on all three fronts,
however, and Leno still nearly doubles Letterman's audience locally,
averaging almost 235,000 homes nightly.</TE>

<LD>Raul Jauregui has been house manager for the Pantages Theatre for
almost five years now and he had long thought of himself as a patient
man. Two years ago, however, he realized he had not quite grasped the
full dimensions of the word "patient." Two years ago, "The Lion King"
came to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day, every show, there are kids," he says. "And it is great
to see, most of them love the show, but there are things we have to
deal with ... " he pauses for a diplomatic moment " ... differently."</LD>
<LD>   "The Lion King" differs from other theatrical performances in many
ways. The giraffes and hyenas, for instance, the 28-month run and, of
course, the merchandising -- funny how there's never been a gummy
worm tie-in to "The Cherry Orchard." But the biggest difference is
the sticky-fingered, never-quite-silent, chair-kicking-kid factor.</LD>
<TE>   In the lobby before a recent Saturday matinee, the high piping
voices of children sailed above the roar of adult conversation like
seabirds. Little girls in party dresses, little boys in creased
trousers and button-down shirts clutched parents' hands and programs
or darted through the crowd. "There must be a thousand kids here,"
said one middle-aged patron, gathering her skirts about her like a
woman threatened by a rampaging mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not a thousand on this particular day, but 2 million
people have seen "The Lion King" since it opened two years ago, and
at least a quarter of them were, and continue to be, children. In a
town where every financially strapped cultural venue is constantly
nagging families to expose their children to art early and often --
apparently an early understanding of Beckett and Van Gogh is a good
predictor of high SATS -- a trip to "The Lion King," for those who
can afford it, is a natural. It looks good on the parental resume and
the kids might actually enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   And the whole point of "The Lion King" is to get the kids in the
audience; why else faithfully re-create an animated movie hit?</TE>
<TE>   "We suggest that the show is appropriate for ages 8 and up," is
the refrain at the box office and among various Disney officials.
"But of course you know your child better than we do."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many of the accommodations Jauregui and his staff make are
necessities for the under-8 set. Lower-priced lap tickets are
available for smaller children, and booster seats, which one probably
would not see during a run of, oh, "Chicago," are stacked beside the
lobby doors. The Pantages has always allowed food and drink in the
theater, but for "The Lion King," there is a new no-soda rule. "It's
a new carpet," said Jauregui. "Kids, soda, new carpet ... not a good
mix."</TE>
<TE>   There are television monitors in the lobby, so parents who
discover they have misjudged a child's attention span or hyena
tolerance can sort of watch the rest of the show while the kid tears
up and down the red-carpeted steps.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids are pretty good during the first act," says Matt Creek,
head of guest services. "Because there are kids on the stage. But the
show is two hours and 45 minutes, and that is asking a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Creek has tapped the shoulders of hundreds of exasperated parents
as they dragged children into the lobby for the second or third time
and suggested that they might like to come back another time and
actually see the show, as his guests. "Although that is becoming more
difficult to do," he says, "as we get closer to the end."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, concession sales have skyrocketed. Creek sees plenty of
moms stumble out during the performance, like junkies in an alley at
2 a.m., looking for "one more bag of M&amp;M's, just to keep the kids
quiet." But it's not just kids wolfing down the Rice Krispies treats
and fudge-frosted brownies. "Usually during a show, you have a lot of
people on dates," says Jauregui. "Women won't eat on dates. But now,
they're with the kids and they just don't care."</TE>
<TE>   While Jauregui and his staff sometimes have to act the heavies
with the younger audience -- telling them to go to their seats, sit
down in their seats, stay in their seats and be quiet -- Creek is the
one who deals with the irate adult in the next row up. Yeah, he says,
he's had to move some people who complained about their seats being
kicked or the constant crinkling of candy wrappers. He's had to
soothe a few patrons who wanted to ban children from the audience and
possibly the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to accommodate people," he says. "But in the end, it's a
play based on a cartoon, so people have to be a little understanding.
I figure anyone who's really, really upset came into the theater with
a lot of baggage, and I can't fix that."</TE>
<TE>   As the show enters its final weeks, the child-to-adult ratio will
probably rise. Parents who have been waiting until the absolute last
minute, in the hopes that their children will experience a sudden
maturation spurt, are now handing over their credit cards and hoping
for the best.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why at intermission, wailing can be heard in at least
four pre-K keys, and the line for the bathroom is gridlocked by
emergency cut-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't hold it one more minute," one little girl insists.
Casting apologetic glances over her shoulder, the mother hustles the
girl to the front of the line, murmuring repeatedly: "She really
can't."</TE>
<TE>   One assumes that such scenes will not plague "The Producers,"
which opens in May.</TE>
<TE>   For all the added aggravation, Creek and Jauregui say that there's
nothing like seeing those wide, shining eyes. Which were plentiful as
the performance on Saturday ended. "Oh, Mommy," exhaled one little
girl who was all of 5, "that was the best thing of my whole life."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to miss the little guys," says Jauregui, as he surveys
the empty theater, with its litter of candy wrappers and cookie
remnants, of programs and Power Ranger legs. "I really am."</TE>
<TE>   Even with an all-adult audience, there will still be plenty to try
his patience in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to deal with other problems," he says. "Scotch instead
of Skittles."</TE>

<HD>Orchestra celebrates its youth</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Youth Symphony, under the inspired direction of
Alexander Treger, opened its 38th season Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall
with a typically amazing concert.</LD>
<LD>   The musicians, 16 to 25, played with freshness, precision and
sophistication whether in the poised rhetoric of Mozart's "Haffner"
Symphony or the sprawling, tumultuous, joyful paroxysms of Mahler's
Fifth Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   The orchestra showed elegance and style in Mozart, providing depth
of sound without sacrificing detail or balance, and accents without
stridency or edginess.</LD>
<TE>   The same transparency and balance could be heard when the textures
of Mahler's massive symphony thinned out, but the climaxes also rang
thrillingly. The passage in the third movement prefiguring heavenly
bliss as well as the movement's stop-on-a-dime ending were
breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   Trumpeter Timothy Hamon, trombonist Maciej Pietraszko and
clarinetist Aiko Oda deserve praise for their confident, assertive
solos in the Mahler symphony; then again, most of the young
principals -- not to mention whole sections -- contributed exemplary
work. Treger, as usual, gave 120%.</TE>
<TE>   The concert, dedicated to the American Youth Symphony's conductor
laureate Mehli Mehta, who died Oct. 19 at the age of 94, began with
an account of Barber's Adagio for Strings that expressed both deep
bereavement and consolation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS debuted its new team of four anchors on "The Early Show" Monday
in its latest effort to compete with more dominant morning rivals.
Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Rene Syler presided over a
typical morning mix of news and makeovers.</LD>
<LD>   Smith is an old hand, with nine years as host of an earlier CBS
morning show incarnation. Chen is a holdover from the Bryant Gumbel
days, Storm comes from NBC Sports and Syler from local news in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The four-person team, replacing Gumbel and Jane Clayson, is an
attempt to add a new wrinkle to the morning formula. Each took turns
reading the news and conducting inter- views.</LD>

<LD>Springfield, Mo., hasn't been in such a tizzy since native Brad Pitt
ascended to stardom. The center of attention this time is Aaron
Buerge, the 28-year-old bank vice president who is working his way
through the 25 contenders wanting to marry him on ABC's unscripted
dating show "The Bachelor."</LD>
<LD>   Faxes, resumes and letters with pictures from wannabe wives have
been coming in from across the country since Buerge began appearing
on the Wednesday night series. He is frequently greeted at local
restaurants and bars by squeals.</LD>
<LD>   First National Bank employees also have noticed more women milling
about. Some ask about loans or accounts, others sip from the water
fountain and leave, bank President Eric Piel says. Teller Tina Albert
has noticed more cars coming through the drive-through and outdoor
ATM. "I've had them come through the drive-through and stop and gawk
at his window," she says.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council has OKd a task force to explore the
possibility of setting up an L.A. Music Hall of Fame. Councilman Tom
LaBonge introduced a motion at a council meeting last week and
received approval for the task force, headed by Cultural Affairs
Department general manager Margie Johnson Reese, to look into the
feasibility of a facility dedicated to the study, preservation and
promotion of the city's musical heritage.</LD>
<LD>   LaBonge was approached with the idea by Art Fein, a rock
historian, promoter and author of "The L.A. Musical History Tour,"
who argues that "Los Angeles is overlooked as a music center because
it's in the shadow of the movie business."</LD>
<LD>   An L.A. facility, Fein says, would "not be in opposition to the
Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but as an adjunct -- a western
outpost." The goal would be to focus not just on the city's
contributions to rock history through L.A.-area based acts from
Ritchie Valens and Ricky Nelson to the Beach Boys and the Doors
through X, Los Lobos and Beck, but also from jazz, country, R&amp;B,
Latin, rap, classical and other fields. No specifics on a budget or
timetable have been established.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pascal Quignard won the Goncourt prize, France's top literary award,
on Monday for a collection of aphorisms, memories and reflections on
the past.</LD>
<LD>   "Les Ombres Errantes" (The Wandering Shadows) is the first book in
Quignard's three-volume series of literary fragments, "Dernier
Royaume" (Last Kingdom).</LD>
<LD>   The author has compared his collection to the whirlwind of
thoughts he had as a child when he couldn't sleep. He said he didn't
expect to win because his book cannot be easily defined.</LD>
<TE>   The Goncourt was first awarded in 1903. Past winners include
Marcel Proust, Simone de Beauvoir and Andre Malraux.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hard as it may be to believe, the Chamber Music in Historic Sites
series sponsored by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College
is observing its 30th anniversary this season.</LD>
<LD>   Anchoring the agenda, as always, is the series-within-the-series
-- six concerts in the ornate, glass-domed Pompeian room of the
Doheny mansion, where the Auryn String Quartet, from Cologne,
Germany, returned for the season opener Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   As in their local debut here in December 2000, the Auryn proved
that it cares more for energetic, visceral pushes through the
repertory than maintaining instrumental polish at any cost. This
time, though, the choice of music was more predictable -- including a
raw-boned, witty trip through the Haydn String Quartet, Opus 71, No.
3, that the Auryn led off with two years ago -- and the sacrifice of
precision for passion didn't always pay off.</LD>
<TE>   The foursome made their best showing in Dvorak's "American"
Quartet, turning the lyrical second movement into a long, seamlessly
flowing structure, the big tunes there and elsewhere singing out with
an in-your-face, perhaps "American," feeling of brashness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Beethoven's Quartet No. 12, the entryway into the composer's
then-avant-garde late quartets, was a mixed bag.</TE>
<TE>   While the long, heavenly second movement opened in a marvelously
hushed, meditative way and unfolded at a nice clip, the quartet's
playing turned very scrappy in the final two movements, and the music
lost its focus.</TE>

<HD>Music awash in red ink</HD>
<DH>One after another, major symphony orchestras feel the sting
of deficits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drumbeat started late in the summer, as one high-powered American
symphony orchestra after another made it clear that they had lost
money on the 2001-2002 season. For most of them, it represented the
first red ink in nearly a decade.</LD>
<LD>   In late August, the mighty Cleveland Orchestra announced a
$1.3-million deficit on a $34.6-million budget.</LD>
<LD>   In early September the Pittsburgh Symphony, which had burned
through a $2-million surplus fund, said it was more than $1 million
short and could end up in bankruptcy. A few weeks later, the
Philadelphia Orchestra posted numbers similar to Cleveland's.</LD>
<TE>   The latest casualty came just over a week ago, as the normally
sturdy Chicago Symphony Orchestra, with a $60-million annual budget,
was $6.1 million in the hole.</TE>
<TE>   And those are the big guys. Among smaller organizations, some
outcomes were worse. In June, the San Jose Symphony canceled its
2002-03 season, facing bankruptcy; in July, the Washington (D.C.)
Chamber Symphony folded.</TE>
<TE>   Jack McAuliffe, vice president of the American Symphony Orchestra
League, a service organization in New York City, says the beat will
go on. Once all the balance sheets are in -- by December or January
-- he expects that a majority of U.S. orchestras will show some sort
of deficit for 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   The trail of bad news prompts a worried question: What's the
problem with classical music?</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, all unhappy symphony orchestras are unhappy in
their own way, but the answer is surprisingly consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is 'the economy, stupid,' " says McAuliffe, pointing to
the general downturn and to the aftermath of Sept. 11. "It's
affecting all those revenue sources" -- especially corporate,
foundation, government and individual donations -- that are crucial
to an orchestra's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   One revenue source that has stayed relatively stable is ticket
sales. Just after Sept. 11, particularly in New York and New Jersey,
according to McAuliffe, ticket sales dropped enough to have a major
if mostly short-term impact on revenues. The New Jersey Symphony
Orchestra, which lost $1.1 million, saw its ticket sales down for
almost four months. But according to McAuliffe, an informal survey of
the nation's 50 largest orchestras showed ticket sales down only 1%
from the previous year. And in the big picture, sales are up:
McAuliffe reports that, nationwide, orchestra attendance in 2000-01
was 32 million people, a rise of 16% from a decade previous.</TE>
<TE>   But in bad economic times orchestras run into trouble because they
have high fixed costs -- long-term contracts with halls and their
musicians, guest artists booked years in advance. Joe Kluger,
president of the Philadelphia Orchestra, says his organization is a
case in point. He employs roughly 100 musicians, every week of the
year, with salaries and benefits determined by a competitive union
contract. In 2001-02, he says, the Philadelphia Orchestra increased
its ticket revenue by 27%, or $3.5 million, largely thanks to the
excitement around its new Verizon Hall, which opened in December.
But, given rising health-care costs, and staff and musician pension
funds that were pummeled by stock market declines, the orchestra
still posted a $1.3-million deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago was also hit by stock market problems; the market's fall
cut into its employee pension plans by almost $3 million, and a
slight decline in ticket sales didn't make things easier. The
orchestra also posted what it calls a "one-time, non-cash accounting
adjustment" of $2.3 million that included old debt.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the red-ink orchestras cite a downturn in corporate giving
in explaining their shortfalls. In Texas, where the Dallas Symphony
Orchestra posted a $877,000 deficit, many nonprofits took donation
hits tied to the Enron scandal, beleaguered energy companies, and
corporate mergers, according to McAuliffe. In Cleveland, similar
pressures have meant that corporations are leaving town. Thomas W.
Morris, the Cleveland Orchestra's executive director, says his
organization was hardest hit by a 29% drop in corporate
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that they're contributing less," Morris said, "it's that
they're not here."</TE>
<TE>   Foundation giving is also down, says Jim Ferris, director of the
Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at USC. Not only have
foundations seen their net worth fall with the stock market, since
Sept. 11, they may be more likely to give money to human services,
tolerance programs and international efforts than to the performing
arts these days.</TE>
<TE>   "The foundations are thinking, 'What are the lessons of September
11, and how should that affect our giving?' " Ferris says.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra endowments are another casualty of the stock market
decline. When there's a budget shortfall, a nonprofit can draw a set
percentage to cover deficits. But as the value of the endowment
falls, that percentage yields a smaller figure for the bottom line.
The Minnesota Orchestra, for example, has seen its endowment decrease
in value 30%, or $36 million, since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's orchestras have yet to reveal their 2001-02
numbers. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, which won't make its figures
available until December or January, has already been grappling with
deficits. For 2000-01, its shortfall was $1.3 million on a
$50-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Some of its current news is good. As was the case in Philadelphia,
the promise of a new venue -- Walt Disney Concert Hall is set to open
in fall 2003 -- has increased interest in the orchestra, especially
given that the only way to ensure a seat in the Frank Gehry-designed
structure is to subscribe now. Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's
managing director, says subscriptions have risen from 22,000 in
2000-01 to 27,000 for the current season, and ticket sales were up
about 10% at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Hollywood Bowl.
Last season, donations were $800,000 over goal. Still, she makes no
promises that the 2001-02 budget will be balanced.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra's president, John
Forsyte, paints an even rosier picture. "Fund-raising was at an
all-time high last year" -- especially personal philanthropy -- "and
ticket sales were at an all-time high," he claims, though he would
not release budget figures. "This fiscal year is going to be far more
challenging."</TE>
<TE>   The situation of the San Diego Symphony, which is in its fifth
season since rebirth after a bankruptcy, shows just how volatile
orchestra economics can be. With a long-term $120-million gift from
Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs and his wife, Joan, it's one of the few
U.S. orchestras posting a surplus for 2001-02: $700,000 on a
$10-million budget and an estimated 25% increase in ticket sales and
individual giving. But the summer season, and recent fund-raising,
have been disappointing, according to Douglas Gerhart, president and
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Each orchestra facing deficits has its own plan to balance the
budget. In most instances, they won't be changing their core
programming (as Philadelphia's situation shows, offering fewer
concerts does little to cut costs). Instead they will cut staff and
auxiliary programs, such as radio broadcasts, tours and chamber
series. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, for example, has trimmed
administrative positions, limited overtime and the use of extra
players and launched a more aggressive subscription drive to bring
the numbers into the black.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say, don't worry, this will correct itself,"
McAuliffe says; administrators and especially donors need to step up
to the plate. Still, of the dozen that have filed for bankruptcy or
ceased operation in the last 15 years, all but Sacramento and San
Jose have bounced back, he points out, and San Jose is reorganizing
and may return. "Orchestras have proved surprisingly resilient."</TE>

<HD>Arden Realty's Profit for Quarter Drops 36%</HD>
<DH>The L.A.-based office building owner cites the sagging
economy. But it reports that rents are up 9% on lease renewals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arden Realty Inc., one of Los Angeles' largest office building
owners, said Wednesday that third-quarter profit fell about 36% from
a year earlier as the Southern California office rental market
continues to soften.</LD>
<LD>   Arden made $15.1 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with $23.5
million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue at the Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust fell
1.5%, to $104.9 million, in the period ended Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   Arden's funds from operations, a key measure for many real estate
companies, also declined, to $43.2 million, or 65 cents a share, from
$50.1 million, or 76 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter occupancy of Arden properties slipped to 90% from
94% a year earlier. Average rents fell by 1% or 2%, Chief Financial
Officer Rick Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Arden usually was able to raise the rates on tenants
renewing leases they signed a few years ago, Davis said. Rents are up
9% on renewed leases.</TE>
<TE>   Arden's results are being dragged down by the flagging economy,
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenants aren't expanding," he said. "Tenants are just waiting to
make those leasing decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Arden shares fell 20 cents Monday to $21.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The firm announced its earnings report after the close of
financial markets.</TE>

<HD>BofA to Limit Execs' Severance</HD>
<DH>Policy prevents officers from getting more than double
their salary and bonus without shareholders' OK.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Burritt</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp., yielding to the demands of activist
shareholders, will restrict the severance pay offered to departing
executives, the Teamsters union said.</LD>
<LD>   The third-biggest U.S. bank's highest-paid executives won't be
able to pocket more than double their salary and bonus if they decide
to quit, unless shareholders give prior approval, Chief Executive
Kenneth Lewis told the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in a
letter Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The change only affects future severance packages offered by the
bank, the letter says.</LD>
<TE>   The union, whose pension fund owns bank shares, called for the
limits in the spring, citing severance payments it estimated at $50
million to $100 million to former Bank of America President David
Coulter, who quit in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Concern over executive pay has soared this year amid the wave of
corporate accounting scandals. Some executives have departed
companies with huge severance packages while their firms' shares have
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis wrote that the bank's directors adopted the policy in
September, after shareholders at Bank of America's annual meeting in
April approved the union's nonbinding proposal by a slim margin.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be responsive to our shareholders," bank spokeswoman
Eloise Hale said.</TE>
<TE>   With its severance limit of two times salary and bonus, the bank
adopted the Teamsters' proposal that is more restrictive than
severance packages at many U.S. companies, said Patrick McGurn, vice
president at Institutional Shareholders Services in Rockville, Md., a
shareholder advisory firm.</TE>
<TE>   Companies typically pay severance at 2.99 times executives'
compensation, McGurn said. At a higher multiple, executives would
have to pay higher income taxes, he said. Bank of America's lower
severance multiple "puts more impetus on bringing the standard down"
at other firms, McGurn said.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions don't cover current employment contracts of
executives such as Lewis and Chief Financial Officer James Hance,
Hale said. Only those executives who have negotiated severance
packages since April 24 and whose compensation will be listed in
future proxy statements will have to conform to the new limits.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who earned $1.33 million in salary and $5.2 million in
bonus in 2001, will fall under the policy when his current employment
contract expires Sept. 30, 2004, and he negotiates a new one, Hale
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis wrote in his letter that Bank of America directors had
worked for several months with an independent consultant to develop a
policy "that would balance the interests of shareholders with the
long-term interests of Bank of America."</TE>

<HD>Lula Vows to Pay Brazil's Debt</HD>
<DH>President-elect seeks to break pro-business policies, fight
poverty</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>His three decades as a rabble-rouser now behind him, President-elect
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took his first steps Monday as a statesman,
telling Brazilians he would be a responsible steward of their
nation's troubled economy and that his government would honor
Brazil's foreign debt.</LD>
<LD>   But the man most people here call Lula also promised that his
Workers' Party government would make a sharp break with the
pro-business policies of outgoing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
and that he would fight poverty and unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   "A majority of Brazilian society has chosen a new economic model,"
Lula said in a nationally televised address the day after winning the
presidency in a landslide. "I will not let the Brazilian people
down."</LD>
<TE>   Lula's triumph was part of a regionwide shift to the left that
also has boosted the fortunes of radicals and mavericks in other
South American countries, including Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, financial analysts and investors have long
feared the consequences of a Lula presidency, believing that he could
be forced to default on Brazil's massive debt to pay for the social
programs he has promised.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lula's election did not produce the meltdown on the
markets some had feared, although most of the country's financial
indicators were down. Brazil's currency, the real, dropped 1.3%,
backtracking after a weeklong rally. The Sao Paulo stock market, the
Bovespa, dropped 3.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The incoming government will face a host of economic difficulties
after Lula takes the oath of office Jan. 1. Analysts predict Brazil's
public debt will reach $340 billion by the end of the year, nearly
three-quarters of its gross domestic product. Unemployment stands at
8% after a yearlong economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   For many Bush administration officials, whether Lula and his
leftist Workers' Party are up to the challenge of rescuing Latin
America's largest economy remains an open question.</TE>
<TE>   "The markets are going to look very carefully at what he does
today, tomorrow and the next week, to provide reassurance that he's
not a crazy person," U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told
business leaders at a meeting in South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill added that he hoped that Lula would decide to keep many of
Cardoso's policies -- including an austerity package the government
agreed to in August as part of a $30-billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The country's debt load is so onerous that unless Brazil's
currency and markets recover soon, there is a risk that Brazil could
collapse even if Lula does what the IMF and world financial markets
want him to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The big worry is that default may be unavoidable, because the
devaluation is raising the cost of servicing the debt so much," said
Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington. "The debt dynamics, added to Brazil's
disappointing economic growth, become fatal."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street will be looking closely at whom Lula and the Workers'
Party appoint to key economic posts in his transition team over the
next few days and weeks, said Lisa Schineller, Brazil debt specialist
with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' worries about Lula have caused Brazil's bonds to dip as
his lead in preelection polls grew larger. Standard &amp; Poor's has
placed Brazil on its "negative outlook" list, meaning the rating firm
is poised to downgrade the country's bonds if Lula wavers.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil will need to come up with about $45 billion next year to
keep current on its public debt, a burden two or three times that of
countries with similar credit ratings, Schineller said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lula said several things that Wall Street wanted to
hear. He asked his followers to be patient and to give him time to
turn around the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Brazilian people know that what was done and wasn't done in
the last decade can't be fixed with a magic wand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As we said in our campaign, our government will honor the
agreements reached by the [Cardoso] government," he said. "The
difficult position Brazil faces demands austerity in the use of
public funds and an implacable battle against corruption."</TE>
<TE>   In his 20-minute speech, Lula also promised to create a "Ministry
of Social Emergency" to fight hunger. He said he would adopt a more
aggressive stance in trade negotiations with the United States. And,
sounding a lot like the trade union activist and radical he once was,
he paid tribute to the fallen "social fighters" who did not live to
see the party's moment of glory.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be loyal to their legacy of human dignity, personal
integrity, love for Brazil and passion for justice," he said.</TE>

<HD>United Technologies to Buy Stake in Capstone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capstone Turbine Corp. said Monday that industrial giant United
Technologies Corp. has agreed to purchase nearly 5% of the
once-highflying maker of power generators, which has been
short-circuited by a blackout of investor interest.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth-based Capstone also said its chairman and chief
executive, Ake Almgren, would retire and that it expects to post
another in a long string of losses when it releases its third-quarter
earnings Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Capstone shares shot up 36 cents, or 48%, to close at $1.11 on
Nasdaq. Capstone said it plans to repurchase up to $10 million of its
common stock, which at Monday's price represented nearly 12% of the
company.</LD>
<TE>   Almgren, 56, has guided the company since 1998 and oversaw its
initial public offering in 2000. But the Swedish engineer faltered in
transforming Capstone from a start-up business that developed
fuel-efficient microturbines into one that could successfully market
a commercial product, said Daniel Fidell, an analyst with A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone officials would not comment further about Almgren's
announced retirement except to say that board member Eliot G.
Protsch, president of Alliant Energy Corp.'s Interstate Power &amp; Light
Co., will become Capstone's new chairman. The company also said it
has begun the search for a new chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after going public in June 2000 at $16 a share, Capstone
stock traded close to $100 a share, riding investor hope that the
escalating California energy crisis would stoke demand for its
refrigerator-size generators, which run on natural gas and other
fuels. Capstone's smallest generator produces about 30 kilowatts,
enough to power a small store or fast-food restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   But Capstone did not effectively capitalize on its initial burst
of publicity and has never turned a profit. The company sells about
500 generators annually, too few to break even.</TE>
<TE>   The company's rate of sales has steadily declined for several
years. Capstone said Monday it expects to lose 14 cents to 16 cents a
share in the third quarter on revenue of $3.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although Capstone expects to lose less money than Wall Street
anticipates in the third quarter, Fidell noted that its sales were
projected to be far below the $6 million to $7 million expected by
the investment community.</TE>
<TE>   Fidell, who has issued a sell recommendation to Capstone
shareholders, said the company has been hurt by the falloff in
business spending and capital investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are just not going to spend major dollars for a new
alternative power product in this type of economic environment,"
Fidell said.</TE>
<TE>   Capstone is in an unusual situation in which its cash reserves are
substantially higher than its $86-million stock market value. The
company has about $144 million in cash, enough to last for several
years at its current spending rate.</TE>
<TE>   Its deal with Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies, however,
could provide Capstone with an entree into new markets, helping to
boost production of its generators.</TE>
<TE>   Jan van Dokkum, president of United Technologies' UTC Power, said
Capstone's microturbines will fit into the company's strategy to sell
energy- efficiency products to the operators of commercial buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Neither company disclosed how much United Technologies will pay
for its 4.9% stake in Capstone.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Clark, Capstone's chief financial officer, said more
information about the transaction will become available after
Capstone reports its earnings Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The investment also should help Capstone compete against two large
industrial companies interested in similar technology. Ingersoll-Rand
Co. has its own line of generators, and General Electric Co.
purchased microturbine patents and equipment from Honeywell
International Inc. in December.</TE>
<TE>   "While the United Technologies alliance does not change the fact
that there is no immediate catalyst to boost shipments of Capstone's
products, it does add some credibility when an alternative power
company aligns itself with a major power equipment company," Fidell
said.</TE>

<HD>Fed Approves Citigroup Purchase of Golden State Bancorp</HD>
<DH>The agency will continue to review banking giant's
sub-prime units. CalFed branches will be converted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve voted unanimously Monday to approve Citigroup
Inc.'s takeover of California Federal Bank parent Golden State
Bancorp, but said it would continue to review the banking giant's
much-criticized sub-prime lending operations.</LD>
<LD>   The deal will convert about 350 CalFed offices across California
and Nevada to Citibank branches, creating the third-largest
commercial banking company in both states, with 5.8% of California's
deposits and 11.4% of Nevada's.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, with $1.1
trillion in assets, will gain 1.5 million customers and a major
retail presence in the region with San Francisco-based Golden State.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed announced its decision at 6 p.m. in the East, and
Citigroup executives couldn't be reached for comment. But it was
welcome news for Citigroup, which is battling allegations that it
helped Enron Corp. conceal massive debts and that analysts at its
Salomon Smith Barney brokerage issued misleading reports in recent
years to lure investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Those controversies, corporate governance concerns and complaints
about lending practices weren't enough to derail the acquisition,
which the Fed said would benefit consumers by making more products
available.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Fed said it hasn't completed a review of lending at
CitiFinancial Credit Co. and other Citigroup sub-prime units that
lend to people with blemished credit records.</TE>
<TE>   It said Citigroup was making substantial progress in cleaning up
lending practices at the sub-prime units, but it required the bank to
provide quarterly reports on Associates First Capital Corp., a huge
sub-prime lender that Citigroup acquired in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup last month agreed to pay a record $215 million to settle
Federal Trade Commission charges of lending abuses at Associates
First, including charges that the company manipulated people into
buying credit insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups that have complained about Citigroup's lending
criticized the Fed's decision. Alan Fisher, head of the California
Reinvestment Coalition, said, "Predatory lending and monthly
corporate scandals show Citigroup is not a responsible corporate
citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gnaizda, policy director for the Greenlining Coalition, cited
federal home-loan data showing that 2.4% of the conventional
mortgages that Citigroup originated last year in Los Angeles County
were to Latinos, compared with more than 35% at Bank of America and
more than 15% at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange before the Fed's announcement,
Citigroup closed up 60 cents at $36.30, making its stock-and-cash
deal for Golden West worth about $4.8 billion. Golden West shares
rose 24 cents to $36.24 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Top EchoStar, DirecTV Execs Plead for Merger</HD>
<DH>The companies present a plan to the Justice Department to
offer satellite-TV slots to Cablevision, but it still may not save
the deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders and Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Leaders of EchoStar Communications Corp. and DirecTV's parent, Hughes
Electronics Corp., made a final plea to the Justice Department on
Monday to try to salvage their proposed satellite-TV merger, but it
may not be enough to save the deal.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar and DirecTV agreed to offer satellite-TV slots to a new
competitor in return for government approval, according to sources
familiar with the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar and DirecTV are hoping that their plan will win approval
from the Justice Department and that the Federal Communications
Commission, which rejected the deal this month, will reconsider it.</LD>
<TE>   But the changes may not satisfy officials at the FCC. "None of it
appears to add up to creating a viable competitor," said one FCC
official close to the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The changes also may not go far enough to satisfy Justice
Department officials, who before Monday's meeting were preparing to
reject the deal, sources said. The department could rule as early as
this week, said sources familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   A rejection by either the FCC or the Justice Department is enough
to kill the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The plan discussed Monday at the Justice Department had been
submitted a week earlier by EchoStar as part of a hastily arranged
deal with New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp. As previously
reported, the plan calls for EchoStar to give Cablevision satellite
slots that would allow its service to reach West Coast subscribers.
Specifically, Cablevision would receive a satellite from EchoStar and
a total of 51 satellite frequencies, which would in turn help it
launch a nationwide satellite-TV service next year, according to a
source familiar with the offer. Originally, Cablevision had been
angling for only 17 frequencies.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, the FCC blocked the $16-billion EchoStar-DirecTV
deal, declaring that a merger of the nation's two satellite-TV
companies, with more than 18 million customers, would be harmful to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Serious talks between Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar and
Cablevision began Oct. 14. Top Cablevision executives flew to
Colorado to meet with EchoStar Chief Executive Charles Ergen and
mapped out terms under which Cablevision could become a serious
competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the merger said Monday that they remain optimistic
that Justice Department officials are seriously considering the
offer.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea has gotten a lot of traction" with the Justice
Department, said a source familiar with the deal. "They're asking the
type of questions that are leading us to believe that they're really
looking at this."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of EchoStar, DirecTV and Cablevision declined to
comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's meeting in Washington included Ergen, DirecTV CEO Eddy
Hartenstein and Charles James, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge
of the antitrust division. Cablevision executives will meet with
Justice Department officials in the next day or two, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   James recently announced that he would leave his post to join
Chevron Corp. as general counsel. His decisions on the EchoStar deal
and the pending merger between AT&amp;T Corp. and Comcast Corp. are
expected to be his last big actions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Justice Department approves the restructured
EchoStar-DirecTV deal, it could increase political pressure on the
FCC to reconsider its ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), who has been supportive of the
deal, is urging regulators to closely review the restructuring, which
he hopes will improve service and enable the merged company to better
compete against cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   An FCC spokeswoman said that the commission's position on the
merger has not changed and that the companies have yet to formally
present any changes.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar and El Segundo-based Hughes have until Nov. 22 to submit
any proposed changes to the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street and regulatory analysts said the deal still faces long
odds. Key details have yet to be worked out, including how much
Cablevision will have to pay to use the satellite slots.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares fell 45 cents Monday to $19.80 on Nasdaq, and
Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., saw its stock close at
$10.15, up 3 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Cablevision fell
42 cents to $9.83 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The success of any deal may hinge on whether regulators believe
that Cablevision has the financial and technological wherewithal to
establish a nationwide satellite provider capable of competing with a
merged EchoStar-DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   For Cablevision, the government's concerns about the
EchoStar-DirecTV merger have provided a window of opportunity to
create momentum for its own satellite plans and perhaps win some
government-mandated assistance. But regulators have been skeptical
about whether cash-strapped Cablevision will be able to raise the
$300 million it plans to spend next year to launch its service.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision already is moving to sell assets and slash its work
force and is considering selling some of its cable channels,
including Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting the EchoStar- DirecTV merger, the FCC dismissed the
possibility that Cablevision might emerge quickly enough as a rival
in the satellite business.</TE>

<HD>Glaxo, Exelixis in $135-Million Deal</HD>
<DH>The alliance involves an unspecified number of drugs in the
areas of cancer, inflammatory disease, vascular biology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exelixis Inc., a small Bay Area biotechnology company, said Monday
that it would receive at least $135 million from British drug maker
GlaxoSmithKline as part of a broad collaboration.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, one of the largest early-stage deals ever, is the
latest example of how the industry's giants are teaming with
California biotechs to replenish their product pipelines. Last month,
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. agreed to invest as much as $325 million in San
Diego-based Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. for rights to an experimental
diabetes drug that is in late-stage development.</LD>
<LD>   The size of Monday's deal is significant, given that Exelixis has
a market value of $200 million, said S.G. Cowan analyst Eric Schmidt.
"The fact that GSK is willing to commit that much shows that Exelixis
is on to something ... and its stock is undervalued," Schmidt said.</LD>
<TE>   Exelixis shares closed at $3.58, up 18 cents, on Nasdaq. They
soared as high as $6.69 in early after-hours trading Monday. The deal
was announced at the market close. Glaxo closed at $38.50, down 27
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term collaboration involves an undetermined number of
drugs in the areas of vascular biology, inflammatory disease and
cancer. The agreement calls for Exelixis to conduct animal and
early-stage human studies on the drug candidates before turning them
over to Glaxo for late-stage testing and commercialization.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said Glaxo would pay Exelixis $30 million upfront
and buy 2 million Exelixis shares at $7 each, almost a 100% premium
from their closing price Monday. Glaxo agreed to pay Exelixis at
least $90 million in development funding over six years.</TE>
<TE>   Exelixis could receive milestone payments that range from $220
million to $350 million and a loan from Glaxo for as much as $85
million. In addition, Exelixis stands to receive royalties on sales
of products that result from the collaboration, and possible
co-promotion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Based in South San Francisco, Exelixis used genomics tools to
discover new drugs. For the six months ended in June, Exelixis had a
loss of $42.3 million on revenue of $21.4 million. It has $170
million in cash.</TE>

<HD>'Larry King' Loses to Fox for First Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CNN's last stronghold against the growing strength of Fox News
Channel has fallen: "Larry King Live," CNN's top-rated program, has
lost for the first time to the Fox show that airs at the same time,
"Hannity &amp; Colmes."</LD>
<LD>   Fox already beats CNN handily in prime time, but now the
domination extends even to the AOL-Time Warner Inc. subsidiary's
flagship show.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the Fox program has drawn an average of 1.65 million
viewers to King's 1.58 million, according to Nielsen Media Research.
Among top-rated cable news programs in prime time, "King" fell from
second to fourth, with Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" first (averaging
2.52 million viewers), "Hannity &amp; Colmes" second and "Fox Report With
Shepard Smith" third (1.59 million).</LD>
<TE>   CNN said, "Larry King continues to be invaluable for CNN. His show
gains more than 400,000 viewers from its lead-in, while 'Hannity &amp;
Colmes' loses almost a million viewers a night from its 'O'Reilly'
lead-in. Larry King continues to do great and was up 20% in October
from September," with guests that included Madonna.</TE>

<HD>A&amp;F Muscling In on Southland Surf Wear Firms</HD>
<DH>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's expansion of its Hollister stores has
long-dominant local companies shoring up their marketing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attention surfer dudes: The preppies are invading the beach.</LD>
<LD>   Having succeeded at spreading button-down East Coast youth fashion
nationwide and then turning it more racy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. is
making major inroads in a whole new genre: the laid-back Southern
California look. And the success of its chain of surfer-themed
Hollister Co. stores is threatening the handful of Southland
companies that have dominated the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Since its launch two years ago, Hollister has opened 71 stores in
33 states that target high-school-age youth. With the Ohio-based
company now stepping up its incursion into California -- the heart of
the surf wear market -- and vowing eventually to have its
tiki-hut-style stores in all 50 states, Hollister is emerging as a
major growth prospect for the industry.</LD>
<TE>   If its plans unfold, the number of stores could swell to 800 in
the U.S. in the coming years, eclipsing the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch chain
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister -- named after a stretch of gated coastal property north
of Santa Barbara that is coveted by surfers -- sells casual clothes
for boys and girls. Surfing and the "West Coast lifestyle" are at the
heart of the chain's designs, said Hampton Carney, an Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch spokesman."We're doing our own interpretation of this great
sport," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new board in the retail waters has put local surf wear
companies on notice that they must more aggressively market their own
brands to the rest of the country, said Randy Hild, who handles
marketing for the world's largest surf wear maker, Quiksilver Inc. in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "There definitely is a perception that Hollister is ripping us
off, and I think they are," Hild said. "But we have to, as an
industry, rally up and go to battle."</TE>
<TE>   Hollister illustrates the extent to which the surf apparel
industry -- which is concentrated in Orange County -- has moved into
the mainstream and onto the radar of companies with deep pockets. In
January, for example, athletic shoe giant Nike Inc. bought Hurley
International, a Costa Mesa youth-apparel brand favored by surfers.</TE>
<TE>   But surf wear isn't an easy industry to penetrate. The success of
the big players -- brands such as Quiksilver, Billabong and O'Neill
-- has been linked to the consumer's sense that they are "authentic,"
rooted in the sport of surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Surfers want clothes that were made by "somebody who still had
saltwater in their sinuses," said Evan Slater, editor of Surfing
magazine. They will be "totally suspicious of [Hollister]. It's
inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Sam George, Surfer magazine's editor, gets downright spiritual on
the subject. "Authentic" brands are "from within the church," George
said. "No one has come from the outside."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most of the people who buy the shorts, T-shirts and
sweatshirts sold by surf wear companies aren't surfers. And industry
insiders concede that Abercrombie has one important edge: its prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Sunwear store at Brea Mall was selling hooded Hurley
sweatshirts last week for $54.50 and ones by Quiksilver for $46.50.
Nearby in the mall, Hollister's hooded sweatshirt with "Pacific
League" on the chest sold for $39.50.</TE>
<TE>   Prices matter to 16-year-old Kristen Schirm, who was shopping at
the Brea Mall last week with two friends.</TE>
<TE>   "That's our favorite store," the Phillips Ranch resident said of
Hollister. "Their clothes aren't that expensive, so an average
teenager can afford them."</TE>
<TE>   Surf wear makers say Hollister can charge less for its clothes
because they are designed, manufactured and sold by the same company,
eliminating the markup that's added when the apparel is passed from
the wholesaler to the retailer.</TE>
<TE>   The new brand holds considerable promise for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,
according to a recent report by Brian Tunick of J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The upstart chain will account for 5% of Abercrombie's earnings
per share this year, double next year and eventually represent close
to 25% of Abercrombie's total profit, Tunick estimates.</TE>
<TE>   One risk: Hollister could find itself "cannibalizing" the
company's namesake stores because the new chain's prices are about
30% lower than those at Abercrombie stores, Tunick notes. Trying to
keep that from happening, management has attempted to differentiate
the two concepts and created a separate design and merchandise team
to focus on Hollister's younger customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollister brand is the brainchild of Abercrombie Chief
Executive Michael Jeffries, who in 1992 reinvented the
then-100-year-old company, which initially sold fly rods and camping
equipment. The 57-year-old Jeffries doesn't surf, but he is "a West
Coast guy" who attended Claremont McKenna College, said company
spokesman Tom Lennox.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands what it's like to be cool," Lennox said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries, who declines interviews, also understands what it's like
to be controversial. He's been at the helm as Abercrombie -- among
other things -- infuriated parents by selling thong underwear to
young girls at its abercrombie chain for younger kids; outraged Asian
Americans with T-shirts bearing cartoonish, slanted-eyed characters
in conical hats; and prompted a lawsuit from professional surfers who
said the company used their picture in its catalog without their
permission.</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie is again stirring debate in the surf wear industry, in
which companies that sell apparel are expected to participate in and
contribute to the sport. The major companies in the industry sponsor
surfers and surfing contests, something Abercrombie said it does not
plan to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the idea that parasites come into our business and
try to latch onto our coattails," said Billabong USA President Paul
Naude.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister is in some ways more like other mainstream specialty
stores than it is like a surf shop. For example, the stores don't
carry board shorts -- a staple of any surf shop -- in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the decor is impeccably planned.</TE>
<TE>   Surfboards lean against walls. Half a dozen hang from the wall
behind the cash registers. "They're fake," said a blond-haired
employee who declined to give her name.</TE>
<TE>   Fans blow continually, mimicking an ocean breeze. Comfy chairs
invite shoppers to sit awhile and flip through surfing, skateboarding
and snowboarding magazines. But a library it's not. Music blasts
throughout the store, causing one youngster in a stroller last week
to cover his ears.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver's Hild vividly remembers his first trip to a Hollister
store and his sense that Abercrombie had suddenly "upped the ante."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was it good, they were doing things we weren't doing,"
he said. "With product presentation, amazing lighting, for example, a
CD listening bar.... It just was good. The scary thing was their
price points."</TE>
<TE>   Hollister has a major drawback, Hild insists: its brand name.
Unlike Anaheim-based Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., a competitor
that sells all the major surf brands, Hollister sells only its own
label.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't bother Jessica Talancon, 20, who wore a red Hurley
sweatshirt and toted Nordstrom bags as she shopped at Brea Mall last
week. The Chino Hills resident, who manages a Victoria's Secret
store, frequents Wet Seal, Guess and Express stores but likes
Hollister for shorts and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "For everyday [clothes], it's Hollister," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Local surf wear makers say Hollister's splashy entry in the market
actually could help sell their brands because it could raise
awareness about surfing and make more young people want to buy their
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the surf wear industry is ramping up its own marketing
plans, Hild said. For example, Quiksilver expects to partner with
Pacific Sunwear to better promote its brand nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done, as an industry, very little marketing of our brand
out of our core area," he said. "We're going to be, I think, good at
getting our message to the heartland. But we've got our work ahead of
us."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Lose Steam as Investors Pull Back</HD>
<DH>Some analysts expect indexes to drift lower ahead of this
week's key economic reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors showed renewed caution Monday, driving major stock indexes
lower as the market continued a pattern of one step forward and one
step back.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, yields on shorter-term Treasury securities slid as some
investors bet the Federal Reserve will announce another interest rate
cut when policymakers convene next week.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street the Dow industrials fell 75.95 points, or 0.9%, to
8,368.04, as two rallies -- one at the opening and one in late
afternoon -- succumbed to profit-taking. The Nasdaq composite lost
15.30 points, or 1.2%, to 1,315.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased
0.8% to 890.23.</LD>
<TE>   The market has been in a pattern of one day up, the next day down
for the last six trading sessions, following a mid-month rebound
powered by better-than-expected corporate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Since hitting a five-year low on Oct. 9, the Dow has resurged more
than 1,000 points. But analysts say stocks are vulnerable to
profit-taking as investors fret about the economy's health and the
potential for war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Markets are overbought for the short term, and there just aren't
enough drivers to power through at this time," said A.C. Moore,
strategist at Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday, and by 17 to 15 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expect stocks to drift lower ahead of key economic
reports. On Thursday the government will give an estimate of
third-quarter gross domestic product growth. On Friday the government
will release data on October employment trends.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed reports on the economy in recent weeks have raised
expectations that the Fed could reduce its benchmark short-term
interest rate, which is already at a 40-year low of 1.75%. The Fed
meets Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably going to get a rate cut" in November or December,
said Robert Delucia, who helps oversee $47 billion at TimesSquare
Capital Management Inc. "The markets have been pressuring the Fed for
it," and policymakers will respond partly to ease concern that this
year's plunge in stocks may crimp companies' ability to fund
themselves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors rushed back into shorter-term Treasury securities
Monday in what appeared to be a bet on a Fed cut. The yield on the
two-year T-note fell to 1.89% from 1.98% Friday and now is at a
two-week low. Yields had resurged in mid-October as stocks soared,
luring money out of bonds and into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term yields were steady Monday as the Treasury announced
its borrowing needs for the near term. The Treasury said it will
borrow a net $76 billion during the final three months of the year,
the most for that period in nine years, as slow growth curtails tax
collections.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note was unchanged at 4.09% Monday. It
has rocketed from a 40-year low of 3.57% on Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * IBM gained $2 to $76.56 after announcing a new
customer-financing program. But Cisco Systems slid 88 cents to $10.90
after brokerage Morgan Stanley downgraded the shares to
"equal-weight" from "overweight," citing slowing growth.</TE>
<TE>   * Merck jumped $1.32 to $54.23 after the Food and Drug
Administration approved the cholesterol treatment Zetia, which the
firm is developing with Schering-Plough. Schering rose 78 cents to
$21.13.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks were broadly lower, in part on worries that some
of the companies face rising worker pension liabilities. Northrop
Grumman fell $3.08 to $101.98 and Lockheed Martin slid $1.18 to
$55.45.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Halts Imports of Mexican Cantaloupes</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. imports of cantaloupes from Mexico have been halted after a
series of salmonella outbreaks linked to two deaths and 18
hospitalizations in the United States, the Food and Drug
Administration said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigations of salmonella outbreaks since 2000 have found
unsanitary conditions at facilities that grow and pack the fruit in
Mexico, the FDA said.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said it stepped up testing of cantaloupes imported from
major growing areas in Mexico and found most regions tested positive
for the bacteria.</LD>
<TE>   Salmonella can cause such symptoms as fever, diarrhea and
vomiting. The organism can be deadly for small children, the elderly
and those with chronic diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA will keep the import restriction in place until the
growing, packing, harvesting and shipping conditions in Mexico have
improved to the point where we have confidence in the industry's
ability to provide a consistently safe product," an FDA spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. imported 104,000 metric tons of cantaloupe
from Mexico, the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA issued an alert in July on cantaloupe imports from five
exporters, and Monday's alert broadens the restriction to all Mexican
cantaloupe. Sources of the organism include human and animal feces,
insects and contaminated water or soil.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said it would work with the Mexican government to develop
a food safety program for growing, packing and shipping cantaloupes
before the ban is lifted. Mexico has proposed a certificate-based
system that would allow the FDA to determine which businesses have
adopted and implemented a food safety program.</TE>

<HD>Providian's Profit Falls on Bad Loans</HD>
<DH>Earnings at the credit card issuer drop 26% as
uncollectable charges rise. The firm will focus on better-off
customers.</DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp., the seventh-largest U.S. issuer of Visa
and MasterCard credit cards, on Monday reported lower quarterly
profit as it saw the value of bad loans and uncollectable charges
rise.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based firm said its third-quarter net income
slipped to $42.1 million, or 15 cents per share, from $57.2 million,
or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Third-quarter profit fell 26%.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings of 4 cents per share,
with their estimates ranging from 2 cents to 9 cents, according to
research firm Thomson First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Providian, which racked up huge loan losses by catering to people
with poor credit histories, is cutting jobs and reorganizing to focus
on better-off customers. The firm said it ended the third quarter
with 7,331 full-time employees, more than 1,000 less than at the end
of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it completed the previously announced
closure of its Sacramento operations facility in the third quarter
and that the planned closures of its Fairfield, Calif., and Salt Lake
City facilities are on track for the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Providian's non-interest income was cut by $77.1 million because
of a decline in the value of securities backed by credit card loans.</TE>
<TE>   The company also raised its estimate of finance charges and fees
that will go unpaid, cutting earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares rose 17 cents to $4.37 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares are up 23% this year, after falling 94% in 2001.</TE>

<HD>PUC May Tighten Rules on Natural Gas Storage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gene Laverty</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Utilities Commission may enact rules to prevent
companies that store natural gas in the state from manipulating
prices for the fuel, the commission's president said.</LD>
<LD>   The commission has recognized "that we needed to begin looking at
our rule-making regarding storage," Loretta M. Lynch said in an
interview at a conference in Calgary, Canada. "We have not put that
on the agenda yet, but I would expect it to be a priority for us next
year."</LD>
<LD>   Gas producers increasingly own storage facilities, raising the
potential for price manipulation. Storage companies were previously
exempt from rules prohibiting market manipulation because the
majority of storage had been owned by utilities and not gas
producers. The commission, which regulates storage companies, doesn't
approve the prices they charge or their customers.</LD>
<TE>   EnCana Corp., Canada's biggest gas producer, received approval
this year to more than double the capacity of its Wild Goose storage
facility to 29 billion cubic feet by 2003. Wild Goose, north of
Sacramento, currently holds about 14 billion cubic feet of gas in
underground caverns.</TE>
<TE>   During the Wild Goose approval process, the commission decided to
review the rule regarding storage companies, which had been set by
previous members, Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   "That rule is at least 5 years old, and we've seen all kinds of
market manipulation in the gas area," Lynch said. "It's time to
revisit that exemption" and "see if that works for California."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch was in Calgary to speak at a gas markets conference
organized by consultant Ziff Energy Group.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Probe Returns to Ex-CEO</HD>
<DH>Congressional investigators plan to re-interview Joseph
Nacchio to clear up inconsistencies about Philip Anschutz's role.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. former Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio will be asked again by congressional investigators about
company founder Philip Anschutz's role in the phone carrier's
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz was interviewed for more than three hours Friday by five
staff members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is
investigating whether the biggest local-phone company in 14 Western
states misled investors by inflating sales.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz and Nacchio gave different versions of Anschutz's role,
committee spokesman Ken Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still troubled by a lot of things," said Johnson, who
declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators are probing whether Denver-based Qwest and
rival Global Crossing Ltd. swapped network space and used the
transactions to boost revenue improperly.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach and Anschutz spokesman Jim Monaghan
didn't return calls seeking comment. Nacchio's lawyer said he would
consider the committee's request for an interview when and if it's
received.</TE>
<TE>   Nacchio testified before the panel's investigations subcommittee
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Qwest said Monday that it plans to reverse $531 million
in revenue that was improperly recognized and take nearly $11 billion
in charges for the reduced value of its telephone and fiber-optic
networks in its review of past accounting practices. The company also
said it might have to write down $30 billion in goodwill from
impaired assets related to past acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting changes, which were announced after the markets
closed, were made after Qwest executives consulted with their new
auditors at KPMG. Qwest shares rose 20 cents to $3.46 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department auctioned $18 billion in three-month bills at
a discount rate of 1.55%. An additional $17 billion in six-month
bills was auctioned at 1.515%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was down from 1.665% last week and was the
lowest since Sept. 30, when the bills averaged 1.54%. The six-month
rate was down from 1.665% last week and was the lowest since Sept.
30, when it was 1.475%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 1.578% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,960.80, and 1.548% for a six-month bill selling for $9,923.40.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for
one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in
adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 1.79% last week from 1.77% the
previous week.</TE>

<LD>Health insurer Cigna Corp. said it would spend $100 million to
restructure its health-care division and would take at least a year
to rebuild after a pricing miscalculation sent the company's profit
plummeting.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to stave off competition and win over dissatisfied
customers grumbling about poor service, Cigna offered some clients
deeper price discounts last year than the company had planned, or
could afford, officials said.</LD>

<LD>AES Corp. and Williams Cos. documents about power plants that shut
down during the California energy crisis must be given to California
state investigators by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a
federal judge said.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has been investigating the causes of
California's energy crisis in 2000 and 2001. His office sued FERC in
January to get information about why two AES plants didn't produce
electricity in April and May 2000. The investigation is looking at
whether plants were shut down as part of a scheme to inflate energy
prices.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Woodruff, president of AES Pacific, a unit of AES, said the
company denies any wrongdoing. Kelly Swan, a spokesman for Williams,
could not be reached.</LD>

<LD>Comcast Corp. posted third-quarter net income of $75.6 million, or 8
cents a share, an improvement over its net loss of $106.8 million, or
11 cents a share, for the same period last year. Revenue at the
Philadelphia-based cable television system operator was up 12.7% to
$2.7 billion for the period.</LD>
<LD>   Comcast also said that it expects to complete its merger with AT&amp;T
Corp.'s cable unit next month. The deal, which the companies value at
$47.5 billion, would make Comcast the nation's largest cable TV
provider.</LD>
<LD>   Comcast said its cable subscribers increased by 0.7% to 8.5
million during the third quarter and that cable division revenues
grew 12.3% to $1.55 billion. The new AT&amp;T-Comcast would have 22.3
million subscribers, significantly more than the current leading
cable company, AOL Time Warner Inc.</LD>

<HD>Game Sales Help Sony Beat Profit Expectations</HD>
<DH>The company credits its aggressive cost cutting, but it
trims its fiscal-year revenue forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham and Corie Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a soft economy that tempered sales of gadgets, Sony Corp. on
Monday posted a second-quarter profit that was higher than expected,
citing aggressive cost cutting and strength in its video games
business.</LD>
<LD>   The Tokyo-based media and consumer electronics giant also slightly
lowered its revenue forecast for its fiscal year, citing consumer
skittishness in the United States and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Spending on electronic gizmos, which constitute the bulk of Sony's
business, tends to rise or fall with consumer confidence, which hit a
nine-year low in the U.S. last month.</LD>
<TE>   "We are concerned that consumer confidence may deteriorate
further," said Nobuyuki Idei, chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter ended Sept. 30, Sony reported net income of
$361 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $14.7 billion. In the
same period last year, Sony recorded a net loss of $107 million on
sales of $14.6 billion. Analysts had expected net income of $141
million.</TE>
<TE>   "They're definitely doing better than they were a year ago," said
Morningstar Inc. analyst David Kathman.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting its cautious outlook, Sony took down its rev- enue
forecast by $819 million to $62 billion for its fiscal year ending
March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for the year, however, is expected to grow $245.9
million to about $1.5 billion. That gain primarily will come from a
weaker yen, which increases the value of sales from outside Japan.
Sony rings up 70% of its sales in non-Japanese markets.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in its consumer electronics division, which account for more
than two-thirds of the company's revenue, fell 5.5% to $8.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Brisk sales of Sony's Vaio computers, Cybershot digital cameras
and Clie hand-held computers helped offset deteriorating sales of
cell phones and computer monitors. The division contributed the
largest portion of Sony's profit: $215 million. The results, however,
reflect a tax benefit from its purchase of money-losing Aiwa Co.,
which added $296 million to Sony's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The company's PlayStation games division was the second largest
profit driver, contributing $203 million in the quarter, up fivefold
from the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for the division rose 3% to $2.02 billion. Sony boosted its
estimate for the number of PlayStation 2 consoles it expects to sell
this fiscal year to 22.5 million units, up 13% from prior estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's music business continued to lose money, its loss of $46
million topping last year's $43 million. Album sales, however,
increased, thanks to new releases such as Bruce Springsteen's "The
Rising" and the Dixie Chicks' "Home." Revenue rose 1.6% to $1.04
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the high cost of marketing its summer films, Sony reported
a 55% drop in operating profit to $81 million this quarter for its
movie business. Sales for Culver City-based Sony Pictures
Entertainment rose 26.6% to $1.5 billion on the strength of
late-summer releases such as "Men in Black II," "Mr. Deeds" and
"XXX."</TE>
<TE>   Sony dominated the U.S. box office this summer, generating $1
billion in ticket sales between the May release of its blockbuster
"Spider-Man" and the Labor Day weekend. It was the second-biggest
quarter ever for studio revenue after the quarter ended March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   While considered high even by Hollywood standards, Sony's summer
marketing expenses support two revenue streams -- theatrical and home
entertainment -- the company said, noting that it expects a surge in
sales when its summer movies are released on video and DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Sony has shipped 25.7 million copies of "Spider-Man" DVDs and
videos to go on sale Friday. "Men in Black II" will be released to
the home entertainment market in November, and "Stuart Little 2" and
"XXX" are set for December releases.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's American depositary receipts gained $1.23, or 2.8%, to
$45.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Shares Tumble 14% After Downgrade</HD>
<DH>An analyst's report raises questions about the hospital
company's Medicare reimbursements and whether it can sustain its
stellar growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's No. 2 hospital
operator and a favorite on Wall Street, were hammered Monday after an
analyst downgraded the stock and raised questions about the Santa
Barbara-based hospital company's Medicare reimbursements.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet's stock plunged 14% in heavy trading as the report, from Ken
Weakley of UBS Warburg, stoked investor fears about Tenet's future.
Weakley's report questioned whether Tenet could sustain its stellar
growth rate. Although some analysts called the investor reaction
overblown, others said shareholders were especially anxious because
Weakley's report seemed to raise the specter of Medicare overbillings
that have plagued big hospital companies in the past.</LD>
<LD>   "Absolutely, it's spooking investors," said Sheryl Skolnick, a
managing director at Fulcrum Global Partners, which provides investor
research. She said some investors she spoke with were asking whether
the company did something intentionally to overstate hospital bills
to maximize Medicare reimbursements, although that was not suggested
by Weakley's report.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet said it was confident that its hospitals were complying
fully with Medicare rules. Tenet said the Medicare reimbursements in
question represented just 5% of the company's revenue, and it
reaffirmed its prior earnings projection.</TE>
<TE>   The company's statement was issued after the close of markets. In
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Tenet shares lost
$6.81 to close at $42.50.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, which operates 113 acute-care hospitals in the nation,
including 40 in California, has been one of the most profitable
health-care companies in recent quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts recommend that investors buy Tenet stock. But
Monday, Weakley lowered his rating from "hold" to "reduce" and issued
a report analyzing Medicare's so-called outlier payments to Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Outlier payments are additional Medicare payments to hospitals for
inpatient services that are unusually costly, such as coronary bypass
operations. These outlier payments are intended to protect hospitals
from incurring a big loss on any case.</TE>
<TE>   Although outlier payments are based on a complicated formula set
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the greater the
increase in retail hospital bills, the greater the outlier payment.</TE>
<TE>   Weakley estimated that Tenet's outlier payments as a ratio of its
total Medicare reimbursements went up from 7.7% in the 12 months
ended in August 2000 to an estimated 23.5%, or $657 million, in
fiscal 2003. The average for all urban hospitals, he said, held
steady at 5.6% to 5.7% during that period.</TE>
<TE>   Weakley said Tenet's financial benefits from rising outlier
payments may be near an end because the government recently increased
the threshold for those payments and was set to scrutinize the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas B. Mackey, Tenet's chief operating officer, did not dispute
Weakley's estimate of outlier payment ratios. But he said those
outlier payments, even if government scrutiny were to affect Tenet,
still amounted to just 5% of the company's revenue for fiscal 2003.
He said Tenet's increased hospital charges reflect rising costs.
Tenet said its many teaching hospitals and higher acuity services
also affect outlier payments.</TE>
<TE>   Skolnick, the Fulcrum analyst, said she was comfortable with
Tenet's statement, noting that one important difference from the
Medicare billing problems of the past -- which often involved billing
Medicare for more expensive procedures than what were actually
performed -- is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
has much greater control over how outlier payments are distributed.</TE>

<HD>Employee Groups May Sell More UAL Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another blow to beleaguered airline shares, the employee stock
ownership plan of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. said it may sell
as much as 20% of its stock because of the risk of a bankruptcy
filing by UAL.</LD>
<LD>   State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., hired in August by a committee
representing the employee-shareholders, registered to sell as many as
11 million of the 58 million UAL shares the plan holds for company
workers, the machinists union said Monday. State Street has started
selling the shares, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The machinists, Unit- ed's largest union, told members that State
Street decided to sell some of the shares to diversify the plan's
holdings.</LD>
<TE>   A committee that includes the machinists, pilots union and UAL
representatives hired the State Street Corp. unit after the company
said Aug. 14 it might have to file for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Employee groups own a 55% stake via preferred shares that are
convertible to common shares. Besides those groups' stock, UAL has 57
million common shares outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   UAL said it may seek bankruptcy protection if it can't cut costs
and win a federal loan guarantee that would help it raise $2 billion
before year's end.</TE>
<TE>   UAL shares fell 9 cents to $2.50 in New York Stock Exchange
trading Monday. The price has plunged 81% this year. Though the
employee ownership plan is selling at a deeply depressed price, if
UAL were to file bankruptcy the stock could become worthless.</TE>

<HD>Venture Capital Activity Plummets</HD>
<DH>$4.48 billion was invested in start-ups for the quarter
ended Sept. 30, representing a 48% decrease from the year-ago period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With losses from their high-rolling days still piling up,
shellshocked venture capitalists continued to shun new risks in the
third quarter, dropping the industry's investment activity to a 4
1/2-year low, according to a report due to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Venture capitalists invested $4.48 billion in start-ups during the
period ended Sept. 30, the weakest quarter since the first three
months of 1998, according to a survey compiled by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Venture Economics and the National Venture
Capital Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The quarterly results represented a 48% decrease from the same
time last year, when venture capitalists poured $8.68 billion into
start-ups, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   It also marked the ninth consecutive quarter in which venture
capitalists curtailed their investments from the preceding
three-month period.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for the downturn have remained mostly unchanged since
the Internet gold rush turned into a financial blood bath during the
spring of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   As the stock market began to turn a cold shoulder to dot-coms and
other high-tech businesses, venture capitalists found themselves
stuck with unprofitable start-ups no one else wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, even promising start-ups are finding it increasingly
difficult to find customers interested in spending heavily on
technology, further reducing their chances of survival and saddling
venture capitalists with the worst losses in the industry's history.</TE>
<TE>   Most venture capitalists and analysts believe the industry's
investments will dwindle even more in the next few quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen the end of the decline," said Robert "Robin"
Bellas, a general partner with Morganthaler Ventures.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Wins Time to Plan Cegetel Step</HD>
<DH>Court gives media giant an extra month to decide whether to
wage a bidding war over the telecom company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debt-heavy Vivendi Universal received welcome news Monday as it moved
closer to selling off its U.S. publishing assets and won a legal
ruling in the battle to control French telecom company, Cegetel.</LD>
<LD>   A French court granted the media group an additional month to
consider its right to block a bid by cell phone giant Vodafone Group
to buy out other Cegetel shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Vodafone, which owns 15% of Cegetel, has offered to pay $12.6
billion for Vivendi's 44% stake in Cegetel along with stakes held by
two other shareholders -- BT Group and SBC Communications Inc. The
court extended Vivendi's right to make a counteroffer from Nov. 10 to
Dec. 10.</LD>
<TE>   The extension gives Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou time
to decide whether to wage a bidding war for Cegetel, which operates
the French mobile phone operator SFR. That option has been
complicated by delays in the sale of its Boston publisher Houghton
Mifflin, which would provide extra cash to the company.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday a consortium headed by private equity firms Blackstone
Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners made an undisclosed offer for
Houghton, and Vivendi's board could announce a deal as early as
today, said a source close to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts welcome the sale but say it's unlikely Vivendi will get
close to the $2.2 billion in cash and debt it paid for Houghton a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou is trying to sell off assets to stem a cash crunch left by
his predecessor who led a $77-billion acquisition spree that turned a
staid water utility into a global giant, with assets including
Universal's movie studio, theme parks and a major music company. But
the strategy puzzled investors and left the company with $19 billion
in debt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Westwood Village's largest landlords has put its remaining
retail and commercial properties up for sale.</LD>
<LD>   A joint venture that includes real estate investment and
management firm Madison Marquette and Credit Suisse First Boston is
selling a cluster of properties located primarily along Westwood
Boulevard that include about 160,000 square feet of space.</LD>
<LD>   The properties, which are being sold to take advantage of strong
demand for urban retail real estate, are expected to sell for at
least $70 million, according to people familiar with the sales
process.</LD>
<TE>   Madison Marquette, which manages the properties, in recent months
has filled some long-standing vacancies along Westwood Boulevard,
signing several leases with national chain operations, including
Office Depot and Chili's Bar &amp; Grill. Officials with Madison
Marquette declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Madison Marquette sold the nearby Westwood
Marketplace -- the former Bullock's department store -- to Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Assn.-College Retirement Equities Fund for
about $75 million.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Director Resigns Under Pressure</HD>
<DH>Stiles Kellett had been criticized for a deal that let him
use company aircraft for $1 a month plus a $400-an-hour usage fee,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CLINTON, Miss</DL>
<LD>One of WorldCom Inc.'s longest-serving directors, Stiles Kellett, has
resigned from the telecommunications giant, his lawyer said Monday,
after being pressured by the board to step down.</LD>
<LD>   Kellett, whose decision came Sunday night, had been under fire for
his use of company aircraft. He has agreed to pay $119,000 to settle
the controversy, as well as $3,000 an hour for use of the jet.</LD>
<LD>   "He wanted to save the company further distraction," his lawyer,
Stuart Pierson, said.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom had asked Kellett to resign after court-appointed
bankruptcy monitor Richard Breeden criticized a deal that let Kellett
use company aircraft for $1 a month plus a $400-an-hour usage fee,
the sources said. Breeden had pushed for Kellett's removal.</TE>
<TE>   Kellett and WorldCom's former chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers,
forged the aircraft pact without the full knowledge of the board,
sources have said.</TE>
<TE>   Kellett kept the Falcon 20 near his home in Atlanta under a
one-year lease, the Washington Post reported in July.</TE>
<TE>   Kellett, who was on the WorldCom board for 12 years, is chairman
of Kellett Investment Corp. and serves as a director on other company
boards. He was on WorldCom's compensation and stock option committee
when the Clinton-based company provided $408 million in personal
loans and pension benefits to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The company is trying to nullify Ebbers' pension deal, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in July, has
disclosed $7.2 billion in accounting errors.</TE>
<TE>   "I have decided to offer the company a monetary resolution of the
current controversy over my lease of a corporate aircraft," Kellett
said in a statement sent to Bloomberg News via e-mail by his
attorney. Because the payment "exceeds what was fair and reasonable
to the company -- which the company does not contest -- it removes
all possibility of criticism of the company, the board of directors
and me."</TE>

<LD>Two brothers who analyzed stocks for an investment firm were fired
Monday for obtaining confidential information about a San Diego drug

Biosciences Inc.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when Wall Street analysts' reputations have been sullied
by allegations that tainted stock advice was widespread in the late
1990s, the Risks' case is the first accusing analysts of using
confidential information gathered during a drug trial, said Michael
Shokouhi, a spokesman for NASD in Washington. NASD is the securities
industry self-policing group formerly known as the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers.</LD>
<TE>   NASD said Doug Risk enrolled in a clinical trial for an insomnia
medication being tested by Neurocrine in February. Using his
brother's name, he gathered data about the drug's alleged deleterious
effects on a patient "from a questionable source" that David, an
analyst, used in a report he co-wrote on the company, NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also contained other "inaccurate or misleading"
information, NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators ordered Sterling to hire an outside consultant to
review its research policies and suspended the firm's research chief,
Steven Kirsch, for 30 days. It said neither the firm nor the
employees involved admitted or denied its findings.</TE>
<TE>   Neurocrine Biosciences was not involved in the alleged misconduct,
NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Risks, who exercised extremely poor judgment and were the
cause of the problem, were terminated," said Sterling spokesman Jeff
Mustard.</TE>
<TE>   "David and Doug both fully cooperated with the investigation,"
said Andrew Cotzin, a lawyer for the Risks. "They've accepted this as
the punishment, and it's very much a lesson learned."</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Market's Earnings Rise 61%</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cost cutting helped the Nasdaq Stock Market boost third-quarter
earnings 61% despite the plunge in share prices in the period, the
No. 2 U.S. equity market said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq said third-quarter net income was $12.7 million, or 13
cents a share, compared with $7.9 million, or 7 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue edged up to $199.1 million from $197.7 million,
while expenses fell to $173.6 million from $191 million.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq is in the process of being spun off from its parent, NASD,
and hopes to make a public stock offering in 2003. A limited number
of shares now trade in the Bulletin Board market. Those shares
slipped 20 cents to $7 before the earnings were reported Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer David Warren said Nasdaq continued to pare
expenses. He said the market was in the process of reducing its staff
by 7% to 10% and expected to have about 1,250 employees by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   The long bear market is taking a toll on Nasdaq as the number of
firms it lists continues to decline, traders pull back and
competitors grab market share.</TE>
<TE>   Although average daily share volume in Nasdaq stocks rose 5.3% in
the quarter from a year earlier -- boosted by the record trading
activity in mid-summer, as prices tumbled -- Nasdaq said its share of
trades executed in its systems fell to 28.6% in the quarter from
39.3% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   That reflects the rise of so-called electronic communications
networks that trade Nasdaq stocks. To fend off that competition,
Nasdaq this month rolled out SuperMontage, an upgraded trading
system.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq said its market information services revenue, or fees
charged for access to stock quotes and other trading data, slid 15.6%
to $49.1 million in the quarter from a year earlier. But revenue from
annual and initial stock listing fees rose 12.2% to $44.2 million, as
Nasdaq continued to benefit from a fee increase implemented this
year.</TE>

<HD>City Studies Airfield Takeover</HD>
<DH>Air Force may shut the site in Palmdale, threatening
possible commercial air service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city agency that operates Los Angeles International Airport is
exploring a takeover of an Air Force plant at Palmdale Regional
Airport in hopes of heading off a shutdown that could jeopardize
plans to restart commercial air service there.</LD>
<LD>   Budget constraints led the Air Force earlier this month to curtail
operating hours at the airfield that serves the 5,600-acre Plant 42,
said Larry Magnon, an Air Force spokesman. The same constraints could
cause the closing of the facility next summer, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The Air Force uses the plant's two runways to fly finished
aircraft to other bases. The city's airport agency, which owns a
terminal and a parking lot on the site, has offered service from
Palmdale intermittently under a lease agreement with the Air Force.
Commercial flights there ceased when the last carrier pulled out in
1998, citing lack of interest in its service.</LD>
<TE>   If the Air Force limited or eliminated its airfield services --
such as fire and crash rescue operations, security, and runway
inspections and cleanings -- the airport agency could be forced to
pick up the slack or risk being unable to provide commercial service,
city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palmdale Airport is very important to us from a regional
standpoint," said Lydia Kennard, executive director of the city
agency that operates four regional facilities, including Palmdale.
"We're working with the Air Force to make sure it remains viable,
even should the Air Force pull out."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn directed Kennard last week to develop
contingency plans with the Air Force to address the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "The continued availability of the Plant 42 airfield is crucial to
our near-term air service marketing efforts and our ultimate ability
to provide commercial aviation service to the Antelope Valley," said
Hahn in a letter to Kennard.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force is willing to discuss various options, including an
agency takeover of the site, said Magnon, who is a manager at the Air
Force Aeronautical Systems Center in Ohio. It should know by the end
of the year if it will receive the funding it would need to keep the
facility open past next July, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force spends $12 million annually to operate Plant 42,
where 7,200 workers employed by defense contractors manufacture many
of the military's most sophisticated aircraft. The airport agency's
costs in taking over the facility would be less, although it is too
early to cite an amount, Kennard said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking over the plant could benefit the agency's plans to offer
commercial service in Palmdale in the long term. The agency's lease
agreement with the Air Force, which runs until 2017, limits the
airport's growth to 25 flights a day unless the agency completes
additional environmental studies. This cap presumably would be lifted
if the agency took over operations.</TE>
<TE>   The airport agency is drafting a master plan for Palmdale Airport
that addresses the effects expansion would have on traffic and the
environment and analyzes the demand for service there. The city owns
a 17,750-acre parcel next door to Plant 42.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force also leases portions of the site, which is 62 miles
north of downtown Los Angeles, to aerospace companies including
Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co.
Those companies also use the airfield. Leaseholders said they would
be open to talking about various options.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest concern is that we don't want any interruption of
service," said Dianne Knippel, director of communications for
Lockheed Martin.</TE>

<LD>A Sylmar man was sentenced Monday to two consecutive life terms in
prison without parole for the fatal shootings of his 19-year-old
daughter and 8-year-old grandson last year at his home.</LD>
<LD>   Claude Wright, 61, was found guilty earlier this month of shooting
his grandson, Kyle, four times in the chest on July 12, 2001. He also
shot his daughter Elizabeth -- Kyle's aunt -- who was home from
college on summer break. He then shot himself in the head in an
apparent suicide attempt, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   At trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn McNary played a tape that
Wright left for his wife, which said, "I took them out and I'm going
to take myself out." A San Fernando jury took less than an hour to
convict Wright on all counts. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Warren G. Greene imposed the sentence.</LD>

<LD>A decision on whether to retry a Los Angeles woman who had served 17
years in prison when her murder conviction was overturned has been
postponed until Nov. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Marva Wallace was freed from state prison Friday after Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge David S. Wesley ruled that the outcome of her
1985 trial probably would have been different if evidence of battered
women's syndrome had been allowed in her defense.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace's attorney, Michael Brennan, said after a hearing Monday
that he hopes to use the time to talk to prosecutors about the
possibility of dropping any further proceedings against her.</LD>
<TE>   The judge overturned the murder conviction two weeks after Gov.
Gray Davis denied Wallace parole.</TE>

week until the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   It's a familiar story for California Republicans. But many GOP
activists say they haven't given up hope of pulling off some election
surprises.</LD>
<LD>   The disparities between well-funded Democratic incumbents and
their Republican challengers are graphically illustrated in the
campaigns for attorney general and treasurer. But the Republicans in
both races -- state Sen. Dick Ackerman, the GOP candidate for
attorney general, and former Public Utilities Commission President
Greg Conlon, running for treasurer -- say they aren't conceding
anything yet to their heavily favored opponents.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, the incumbent Democrat, led Ackerman 49%
to 31% among likely voters in The Times poll released today. Nineteen
percent of voters said they were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's fund-raising lead was even more lopsided: The incumbent
reported $7.74 million in campaign cash on hand as of Sept. 30,
compared with $30,439 in the war chest of his Republican opponent,
according to state campaign disclosure reports.</TE>
<TE>   In the treasurer's race, incumbent Democrat Phil Angelides led
Conlon 42%-33% among likely voters polled by The Times, with 24%
undecided. Angelides reported $6.34 million in his campaign war chest
as of Sept. 30, compared with $39,193 reported by Conlon, according
to state reports.</TE>
<TE>   Down-ballot races typically don't kindle much excitement. But
party officials, political strategists and pundits are keeping a
close eye on Lockyer and Angelides because they are seen as leading
candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer, 61, and Angelides, 49, have established themselves as
front-runners in the 2006 race "by putting themselves out there on
issues," said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental
Studies at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Each has staked out high-profile issues in his respective office.
Lockyer has taken aim at corporate malfeasance; Angelides has made
California's pressing infrastructure needs a centerpiece of his
message.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman, however, says another issue dominates every statewide
race: Gov. Gray Davis. He contends there is a building voter backlash
against the Democratic governor because of alleged links between
campaign contributions and policy decisions -- links that Davis says
don't exist.</TE>
<TE>   Charge, Counter-Charge</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mood of Californians toward Davis and the Democratic
administration is [negative], as it should be," said Ackerman, 59.
"They're killing business in this state and people are starting to
see that."</TE>
<TE>   Killing business is a charge that Ackerman also levels at Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   Making his case mainly on talk-radio shows, Ackerman says Lockyer
has been more interested in pursuing such corporate giants as
Microsoft than in prosecuting gangs and other common criminals. He
accuses Lockyer of wasting resources by taking on developers in local
disputes, "because he wants to play his environmental card."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate also accuses Lockyer of lacking legal
experience and failing to investigate the fund-raising allegations
raised by Davis critics.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer brushes off the criticism, pointing to his record as a
state legislator and his past four years as attorney general -- "the
most satisfying job I've had," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer says his accomplishments include pursuing "energy pirates"
responsible for soaring electricity prices, strengthening crime
prevention strategies and upgrading the state criminal laboratory
system.</TE>
<TE>   He makes no apologies for having made environmental protection a
central theme of his tenure as attorney general, noting that one of
his first acts was to broaden the state's role in a dispute that
resulted in the banning of most self-propelled water skis from Lake
Tahoe. He similarly defends his pursuit of a high-profile case
against Microsoft's business practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you can't be pro-job and anti-business," Lockyer said. "We
want to prevent illegal business practices from providing an unfair
advantage against their honest business competitors."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer also insists that he isn't turning a blind eye to
allegations of links between Davis' policy decisions and campaign
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that is worse than not prosecuting criminal
behavior is prosecuting someone who is innocent for political
reasons, and I won't do that," Lockyer said. "We're going to be very
thorough and respond to these charges, even though they certainly
sound like campaign rhetoric at first analysis. If we find evidence
of a crime, we'll prosecute them."</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer's Contest</TE>
<TE>   In the treasurer's race, Angelides -- a former Sacramento
developer -- says his achievements include work on a high-speed rail
bond and school bonds and the creation of a low-interest loan program
for teachers in tough urban schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proudest of the fact that I have been a good custodian of
taxpayer funds, that even in tough economic times I've been a good
protector of the state investment portfolio," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A debt-restructuring plan he implemented to take advantage of low
interest rates will save taxpayers $2 billion, he said, "which is
important because it will mean less program cuts and less tax hikes,
neither of which are desirable in a tough economy."</TE>
<TE>   Conlon, 69, says the 30-plus years he has spent in the private
sector working as a certified public accountant and auditor have
given him the discipline and experience to perform the duties of
treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   "The main issue is the financial crisis," said Conlon, a former
military pilot who also served on the California Transportation
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the second-worst credit rating in the United States. I
just think Phil [Angelides] and the governor are responsible for not
using some restraint in spending."</TE>
<TE>   Conlon says the socially oriented programs championed by Angelides
are noble causes, but not the job of the state's chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I will spend the next four years trying to get the state out of
this mess, not running for governor, as my opponent is," Conlon said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Angelides' huge lead in campaign money, Conlon says the
incumbent doesn't enjoy a similar advantage in name recognition in
most of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that I've got a good chance to win against the
incumbent, which is some kind of miracle," Conlon said. "If Bill
Simon can get close [against Davis], I think I can win, with or
without Bill."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman similarly ties his chances to those of Simon, who was
trailing Davis by about 10 points in recent polls.</TE>
<TE>   "If Simon does well, most [Republicans] in the down-ballot races
will have a much better chance," Ackerman said. "In order for us to
be competitive in down-ballot races, Simon has to do well."</TE>

<HD>Federal Biologist Invokes Whistleblower Act</HD>
<DH>He says administration pressure led to river levels too low
to protect salmon. A U.S. official says decision relied on 'best
available science.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Invoking the Whistleblower Protection Act, a federal wildlife
biologist accused the Bush administration Monday of pressuring his
agency to accept inadequate protections for endangered salmon in the
Klamath River.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a month after an estimated 33,000 salmon died in the
river, Michael Kelly, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said the agency agreed last May to accept water flows in the
Klamath too low to support fish -- so that farmers upstream in the
Klamath Basin could receive their full allotment of water.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the fish that died were coho salmon protected under the
Endangered Species Act, which Kelly's agency is obligated to enforce.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly's accusation was included in a request for shelter under the
Whistleblower Protection Act. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel will
now open an investigation. The act shields Kelly from demotion or
termination by the fisheries service as a result of his complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry could result in a report of misconduct being sent to
congressional leaders and President Bush, if it's found that the
fisheries service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation failed to
adequately protect salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly "called me a month ago, after the fish kill began," said
Karen Schambach, the California director of the nonprofit Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which helped Kelly file
the complaint. "But he was thinking of this even before the fish were
killed. It's a huge decision and he agonized over it because he's a
young guy, not someone close to retiring, and we all know what
happens to whistle-blowers."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who has declined to be interviewed, has worked for the
fisheries service in Northern California for two years. Before that,
he worked as a biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
according to Schambach.</TE>
<TE>   Rod McInnis, the acting southwest regional administrator for the
fisheries service, said that Kelly will continue working on issues
involving the Endangered Species Act. "We don't have a lot of spare
people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Kelly was responsible for helping to write a
biological opinion of how much water should stay in the Klamath River
for fish. That report, in turn, determined how much water could be
diverted to farmers in the Klamath Basin along the California-Oregon
border.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, the Bureau of Reclamation -- the agency that diverts water
to farmers -- disagreed with the flows requested by the fisheries
service. So in late April, the two agencies agreed to sit down and
hammer out a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   According to Schambach, Kelly was angered that the Bureau of
Reclamation, under pressure from the Bush administration, wouldn't
budge from flow requirements that he thought favored farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCracken, a spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation, said
Monday that the agency used a report by the National Academy of
Sciences as a guideline for its plans for the river. "This was the
best available science ... from the top scientists in the country,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kelly was equally upset that the fisheries service, in his
view, rubber-stamped the flows that were approved. Schambach said
Kelly saw this is as a violation of the Endangered Species Act, which
requires analysis of any action that could harm fish.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the fish that perished in recent weeks were chinook
salmon, but some endangered coho salmon and steelhead also died.
California wildlife officials believe the salmon died of gill rot, a
disease exacerbated by low flows in the river. A federal report on
the die-off, the largest in recent years, is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists expressed little surprise at Kelly's claims.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a federal employee for a long time you get used to
this bastardization of science," said Kate Vandemoer, executive
director of WaterWatch in Portland, Ore., and a former hydrologist
with the fisheries service. "For the other folks who manage to retain
some degree of principle, it's pretty depressing."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dan Keppen, executive director of the Klamath Water
Users Assn., said that Kelly's complaint reinforces the incorrect
notion that providing water for farmers caused the salmon die-off. He
suspects the kill was a natural phenomenon due to drought.</TE>
<TE>   "The fish kill is being used to drive political agendas," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Stabbing at Series Tailgate Party</HD>
<DH>Man is attacked in an Edison Field parking lot. Police
report few other disturbances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid otherwise orderly World Series celebrations, a Garden Grove man
was fatally stabbed during a tailgate party in the parking lot of
Edison International Field, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Leopoldo "Polo" Bastida -- described by his family as
a lifelong Angels fan -- was found a few blocks from the ballpark
about 9 p.m. Sunday, just after the team defeated the San Francisco
Giants in Game 7. A man directing stadium traffic dialed 911 after he
saw Bastida bleeding near a commercial strip on West Orangewood
Avenue. Police identified Bastida, 27, as a gang member who spent
most of his adult life in and out of incarceration.</LD>
<LD>   The slaying was the one dark spot in what police said was a
largely peaceful celebration. A few revelers ignited trash cans and
tried to overturn cars, but further disobedience was quickly thwarted
by police. A few fans who ran onto the field after the game were
booked for trespassing.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators said Bastida's body was shirtless, but released few
other details. Authorities, who had no suspects or motive, asked
witnesses to help them piece together what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been anything -- a fan dispute, an argument over a
girl, a drunken brawl, or gang-related. We don't know," said Lt. Mike
Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   Records from the California Department of Corrections show that
over the last 10 years, Bastida had been sentenced to five years for
assault with a firearm, and 16 months for weapons possession. In
Garden Grove, where Bastida has lived for the last 15 years, the
Police Department's gang unit had numerous run-ins with him involving
drugs and weapons, said Lt. Scott Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives who gathered at Bastida's home Monday said he attended
many Angel games. His mother said the oldest of her three children
gave her a kiss and a hug before he left their home Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened last night should have never happened," said Amparo
Bastida, 50, holding back tears. "To me, he was a good kid."</TE>
<TE>   Bastida had called his girlfriend just hours before his body was
found and asked her to meet him, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many people there," said Gina Collazo, who is
married to Bastida's cousin. "It's hard to believe no one saw
anything."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Who says TV anchors do no preparation work? Fox TV's post-game
coverage of the Angels' World Series gave viewers a brief, and
unscheduled, behind-the-scenes look at the news biz.</LD>
<LD>   The telecast was jumping around from the locker room to the
playing field to the parking lot in Anaheim when all of a sudden the
camera inadvertently panned to the anchors back at the station --
before they were supposed to go on the air.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers had the thrill of seeing Susan Hirasuna, in her anchor
chair, looking at herself in a hand mirror and arranging her hair.
Her co-anchor seemed to be satisfied with his appearance.</LD>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's showings (see accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A house that sounds swell if you don't mind the walk into town
to take a bath (Dee Brandt of Pacific Palisades).</TE>
<TE>   * A property that is for the birds (photo by Jean Tuouhino of
Downey).</TE>
<TE>   * A condo in the San Fernando Valley that doesn't sound much
larger than a birdhouse.</TE>
<TE>   * And finally, speaking of small enclosures, an ad for a cage that
I printed the other day (from Billie Pearson). But as Pearson,
Kathryn Krumm, Jonathan Dowling and others pointed out, I forgot to
take note of the unusual dimensions, which were better suited for a
snake.</TE>
<TE>   That's Laguna! The police log of the Coastline Pilot in Laguna
Beach said "neighbors reported that a noisy hot tub was cycling on
and off in the 200 block at 5:16 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   Moving up the coast: Ready for a story to get you in the mood for
Halloween? The police log of UCLA's Daily Bruin newspaper said that
earlier this month, "an unauthorized individual was discovered
practicing dentistry without a license at the School of Dentistry
third-floor dental clinic."</TE>
<TE>   Identity crisis: Before the series began, you'll recall, San
Francisco Giants Manager Dusty Baker said: "Our focus is 'Beat L.A.,'
" then excused his error by explaining that Anaheim is "Southern
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   So it was left to Disney boss Michael Eisner to clear up the
matter after the series with this proclamation to TV viewers: "You
never count Orange County out."</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you're talking about Disney's hockey team, the
Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: I don't know about you, but while I was tuned in to
program-plugging Fox for the World Series over the last several days,
I felt as though I saw about 48 hours worth of commercials for its TV
show "24 Hours."</TE>

<LD>It could be no other way. What are the Anaheim Angels going to do
now? Yup, Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' World Series victory Sunday ended a 42-year quest for

daylong celebrations today in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The festivities begin with a 10 a.m. trip down Disneyland's fabled
Main Street. The celebration will continue with an 11 a.m. parade
from Arrowhead Pond to Edison International Field, followed by a
rally in the parking lot. The planned events will end with an Angels
appearance at Disney's California Adventure from 3 to 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   City officials are anticipating 300,000 fans along the parade
route and the Edison Field parking lot. "This is the first party of
its kind in Anaheim," said city spokesman John Nicoletti.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney marketing, the World Championship is a bolt of
lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had something on this scale," said Disneyland
spokesman John McClintock. "It helps that they're right down the
street from us. It might not have been a big deal if it were not the
hometown team."</TE>
<TE>   But it is. And the hometown is pulling out all the stops.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at Edison Field were busy Monday building stages for
today's ceremony, which will include speeches from Angels Manager
Mike Scioscia and many of the players. Police and city officials were
holding last-minute planning meetings to throw the biggest party this
city has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   And many Angels fans, although tired from celebrating late into
the night Sunday, were still walking on air.</TE>
<TE>   The lines were long Monday at the team store at Edison Field,
where people were snatching up pennants, bright-red World
Championship T-shirts, rally monkeys and the black caps the players
wore during their champagne-soaked clubhouse celebration Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting 42 years," said Brad Farrell of Anaheim, who
trudged out of the store with $250 worth of souvenirs. "We want it to
last as long as possible."</TE>
<TE>   But the keepsakes Farrell is most proud of are three autographed
guitar picks given to him late Sunday in the parking lot by Angels
first baseman Scott Spiezio, who plays in a rock band on the side.
"That was a special memory for me and my son," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Lawton of Australia, who had booked a flight home Monday,
was cutting it close when he braved the long lines to buy World
Series souvenirs. He had caught the Angels bug while visiting
Disneyland and watched Game 7 from his hotel room. "This is history
in the making," Lawton said standing in the hourlong line to enter
the store.</TE>
<TE>   National television ratings for this California Series were the
lowest ever recorded for a World Series by Nielsen Media Research,
but many who watched said it had all the drama of baseball's best
matchup. For Anaheim, the smallest city with its name on a Major
League jersey, the Series was a chance for recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the creation of a suburban legend. And legends are what make
places what they are," said baseball lover Scott Bollens, a UC Irvine
urban and regional planning professor.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on the Angels is also redefining people's views and
stereotypes of Orange County, said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at
the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University.</TE>
<TE>   "It's forced the haughty and more arrogant L.A. people to
recognize that Orange County has a lot to offer, as well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The national media have also been forced to examine outdated views
of Orange County "as a combination of right-wing, John Wayne guys
with shotguns on the one hand and a bunch of airheaded blonds on the
other," Kotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a sense that Orange County is a more
sophisticated place. In a way, the Angels themselves represent Orange
County's best image of itself -- tolerant, earnest and hard-working."</TE>
<TE>   That bodes well for Anaheim, which hasn't been in overdrive since
the Angels clinched a playoff spot in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Today, thousands of people are expected to line Katella Avenue and
pack the Edison Field parking lot to thank the team for an
unforgettable season.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds are expected to form early and police urged people to
carpool, bike, walk or take public transportation because of limited
parking.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about these kinds of numbers, you talk about a
once-in-a-lifetime celebration," Nicoletti, the city spokesman, said.
"Unless the Angels win another World Series -- then it's
twice-in-a-lifetime."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Bill Will Get His Shot at LAPD Stardom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I woke up Monday in no mood to take a shine to our shiny-new police
chief, Bill Bratton, who was being "pinned" that day with the LAPD
badge bearing no number, just four stars.</LD>
<LD>   He'd already been chief for three days. He was sworn in privately
last week in time to helicopter off on a retreat of city officials in
Lake Arrowhead, which meant this Monday ceremony at the L.A. Police
Academy was a retake, for public consumption. Swell, I think. Here
one weekend, and already he's doing retakes. Hollywood Bill has come
to town -- and where does he come from? Boston and New York, whose
residents believe they understand L.A. because they watch the Oscars
and "Dragnet" reruns, and think this is either an Eden populated by
morons with silicone for brains, or a hellhole filled with felons
wearing sun block. They didn't even watch our World Series.</LD>
<LD>   On top of that, I'd just seen the estimate for a retaining wall
for my hillside, which is slowly trying to flee the premises and
maybe take my house along with it, a Southern California nightmare
outside the ken of New Yorkers and Bostonians.</LD>
<TE>   So I was not in a frame of mind to cotton to someone who rides
into town like the Lone Ranger, saying, "Stand aside, folks, and let
a professional take care of this," who says fighting graffiti is Job
One, when just because getting rid of turnstile-jumpers and squeegee
men did the trick on bottom-up crime-fighting in New York doesn't
mean it'll work here in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood Bill worked his wiles on me at the "badge-pinning"
at the Police Academy on Monday, and had me eating the popcorn out of
his hand, at least for the duration of the show, because:</TE>
<TE>   He's married to a journalist -- well, an anchor for Court TV, and
she earns maybe four times what he does.</TE>
<TE>   He gave a pretty fair speech, adroitly, without notes (drawn in
part from his own book so it's all in his head).</TE>
<TE>   His hat looked too big and kept sliding forward on his head as he
spoke (say it, somebody -- maybe his head will soon grow to fit it).</TE>
<TE>   He spent part of his speech telling cops about their obligations,
among them to cut out the "waving and smiling" and get out of their
cars.</TE>
<TE>   He even used that slangy word "cop," which I don't think I ever
heard Bernard Parks utter. (The name "Parks" was not so much as
whispered on Monday, but when 10-years'-gone chief Daryl F. Gates was
introduced, it broke the applause-o-meter. That man still looks about
50; I swear he's sold his soul to Jack LaLanne.)</TE>
<TE>   He made a little jest about calling the paramedics when the badge
got pinned on him, and then joked again that the Police Commission
could "stick me any time, so long as it's not in the back."</TE>
<TE>   And that R thing, that missing-consonant JFK-Bostonian absent R.
To some mirth, Bratton did "solemnly sweah" to uphold the city
"chah-tah." Rocky Delgadillo, the L.A. city attorney, plundered his
kid's refrigerator-magnet alphabet that morning and gave Bratton the
letter R to replace his missing one. (Also missing: Councilman Nate
Holden, the only one of 15 to vote against Bratton and the only one
not to show up on Monday; too busy, he said, with his regular Monday
constituent meetings to spend three hours at a swearing-in for a man
who already was sworn in.)</TE>
<TE>   But even if Bratton hadn't been a nimble performer, I'd decided to
honeymoon with him. L.A. is one big bully pulpit and our public
figures have not been filling it. Anyone monitoring L.A. from another
planet must think Rob Reiner is the mayor and Arnold Schwarzenegger
the police chief, for all that the real ones seem to have abdicated
air time.</TE>
<TE>   So what if Bratton campaigned for the chief's job, sending out his
autobiography and press packets with him on the cover of Time
magazine? So what if he's been called showboater and grandstander? To
get to the dais on Monday, Bratton had to walk past the Jack
Webb/William H. Parker Education Center -- doesn't that suggest
something about this place? Beneath every LAPD badge beats the heart
of a star manque -- why not the chief's, too? (I don't mind if he
goes Hollywood, just so long as he doesn't move to Brentwood. Can
some real estate agent from Los Feliz please send him a flier and
point out that Madonna once lived there?)</TE>
<TE>   And there on the greensward at the Police Academy, I realized I've
grown pretty weary of the mystical brotherhood of LAPD stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, L.A. is a different sort of city, but that's a starting
block, not a roadblock. Joe Wambaugh is absolutely correct when he
says that a lot of the bragging rights Easterners have claimed, from
SWAT to community policing, came out of L.A., and right, too, that
any LAPD brass who'd have the brass to apply for the chief's job in
New York would get slow-roasted in the press for daring to think he
or she could lead the 212-PD.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm weary of the Parker Center pathology, where the sixth
floor has behaved less like part of city government and more like the
Kremlin with side arms. So I'll give the Bratton Show a chance, and
see how his numbers go, before I think of changing the channel. Just
so long as he's not opposite "The West Wing."</TE>

<HD>Priest Is Sought on 33 Counts of Molestation</HD>
<DH>A warrant is issued for Sigfried Frank Widera, who served
in Anaheim and Yorba Linda. He'd previously been convicted in
Wisconsin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell and Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors issued an arrest warrant Monday for a
priest formerly of Orange County, charging him with 33 felony counts
of child molestation involving four boys from 1978 to 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Sigfried Frank Widera has been a fugitive since May, when
Milwaukee authorities filed nine felony sexual abuse charges against
him for acts allegedly committed in the early 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they don't know where Widera is but said they
would seek bail of $1 million if they capture him.</LD>
<TE>   The priest was moved from Milwaukee to Orange County in 1976 even
though he had been convicted of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange insists it was not aware of the conviction
when it hired Widera. The Milwaukee archdiocese did tell Orange
County church officials in a letter that Widera "had a moral problem
having to do with a boy in school" years earlier and that "more
recently ... there has been a repetition."</TE>
<TE>   Widera is the fourth Southern California priest or former cleric
to be criminally charged with molesting children since September.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents filed Monday, the Orange County
molestations took place when Widera was a priest at St. Justin Martyr
Church in Anaheim and St. Martin de Porres Church in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Brea Police Det. Kortney Dodd, the lead investigator in the Orange
County cases, said she has been working on leads and interviewing
witnesses since May, when the first of the two alleged Yorba Linda
victims came forward. She informed one of the alleged victims about
the charges Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was happy," she said. The legal action represented a turning
point, Dodd said, for Widera's alleged victims "who've lived with
hell for all these years. Their final closure will be when he stands
before a judge. But just getting this far helps."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victims are listed as "John Does" in the criminal
complaint; The Times has a policy not to identify victims of
molestation unless given permission by the accusers.</TE>
<TE>   To track down Widera, Dodd is working with her counterparts in the
Police Department in West Allis, Wis., a suburban of Milwaukee. She
is also asking that anyone with information about Widera's
whereabouts, including Widera's family, come forward. His last known
address was in Tucson, where he has family. He also has relatives in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Widera's flight also has frustrated the alleged victims and church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "From the victims' point of view, the arrest and conviction really
means more to them than the civil suit," said Irvine attorney
Katherine K. Freberg, who represents four men, including one from
Milwaukee, who say they were molested as boys by Widera. "I wish I
could literally go out and see the police handcuff the guy. That will
give us some sense of satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maria Schinderlev, a spokeswoman for the Orange diocese:
"We're sickened and saddened at the pain caused to the victims. We
have absolutely no idea where he is, and we would certainly cooperate
with law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Widera was stripped of his ability to function as a priest in
1986, shortly after a boy's mother complained to the Orange diocese
about an alleged molestation. Widera was sent to a New Mexico
treatment center for eight months. He has not been defrocked; he
still is a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Widera is the second priest in the 31-year history of the Orange
diocese to rack up multiple felony molestation charges.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Andrew Christian Anderson was convicted on 26 counts of
sexual abuse while a priest at St. Bonaventure Church in Huntington
Beach. He received a suspended six-year prison sentence and was
placed on five years' probation. However, the sentence was reinstated
in 1990 when Albuquerque police arrested Anderson for allegedly
forcing a teenage boy into his car, assaulting him and attempting to
sodomize him.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a former Dana Point priest was arrested for allegedly
molesting a teenage girl who sang in the church choir.</TE>
<TE>   The latest felony charges further entangle the Orange and
Milwaukee dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Both defendants are named in a suit filed in May by an Orange man
who said he was sexually abused as a boy by Widera in 1985. He is one
of the alleged victims in the criminal case filed Monday. His civil
suit also accuses the bishops of Milwaukee and Orange, both now
deceased, of conspiring to move Widera, a convicted child molester,
to Orange County.</TE>

<HD>Funds Flow in Santa Ana Schools Race</HD>
<DH>In a tightly contested battle over control of the district,
candidates raise $40,000 in one month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With mere days left until election day, candidates for two Santa Ana
school board seats have turned up the heat by raising more than
$40,000 in political contributions this month, according to campaign
reports filed with the county registrar of voters.</LD>
<LD>   The amount represents nearly half of all the money raised by all
eight candidates during the year. That figure is likely to rise once
board President John Palacio, who is seeking a second four-year term,
files his Oct. 24 statement.</LD>
<LD>   Palacio said Monday he missed last week's deadline to report
financial contributions because he had been busy running his
campaign. He declined further comment. As of Sept. 30, Palacio had
raised $16,415.</LD>
<TE>   Candidate Roland Lujan, who had $2,000 by the end of September,
including a $1,000 loan he made to his campaign, also missed
Thursday's deadline. He could not be reached Monday for comment.
Candidates face fines of $10 for each day they fail to file.</TE>
<TE>   The Nov. 5 election represents the first battle in a war for
control of the overcrowded Santa Ana Unified School District's
governing board. Palacio and fellow trustee Nadia Maria Davis face
tough races next week. A third trustee, Nativo V. Lopez, is the
target of a recall campaign set for a vote Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Critics blame the three trustees for what they call the slow pace
of new school construction and poor academic performance in the
62,000-student district, one of the most severely crowded in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Palacio have dismissed their enemies as disgruntled
parents and affluent residents who resent the immigrant,
working-class constituency in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Of those who filed disclosures, Davis raised the most this month.
She collected $15,430 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, for a total of $34,559
for the year.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, newcomer Robert Munoz raised $15,941, the highest
among the challengers. This month he raised $1,870.</TE>
<TE>   Lupe Moreno, who ran unsuccessfully in 2000, raised $14,332 as of
Oct. 24, including more than $10,000 this month. Oscar Garza raised
$11,025 for the year, more than half in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   Former trustee Audrey Noji, who lost her seat in 2000, amassed
$7,165 this month and a total of $9,149 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Retired teacher Nina C. Brazelton did not file campaign
contribution records because she did not expect to raise or spend
more than $1,000.</TE>

<LD>An appeals court has ruled that a tenured Cal State Chico professor
cannot be told how to teach.</LD>
<LD>   Suleman A. Moosa made news when it was discovered he was being
paid to teach classes in which no students were enrolled. Students
and faculty claimed no one took Moosa's classes because his manner
was caustic and his approach was unusual.</LD>
<LD>   After giving Moosa a performance review, Cal State Chico President
Manuel Esteban demoted him to associate professor, and Moosa filed
suit in Butte County.</LD>
<TE>   The appeals court, however, ruled the demotion was illegal because
the contract between Moosa's union and the university doesn't allow
administrators to give orders to faculty.</TE>

urging people to vote against Dennis Cardoza, who defeated Condit in
the March primary.</LD>
<LD>   Chad and Cadee Condit detailed their spending in reports, made
public Monday, to the Federal Election Commission. The letter called
Cardoza an opportunist who betrayed Condit, for whom Cardoza once

<HD>All Reform Measures Have Failed, Secessionists Say</HD>
<DH>In a debate at USC, breakup opponent suggests that a
borough system would achieve goal of giving Angelenos more local
control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession leaders told a debate
audience Monday night that breaking up Los Angeles is necessary
because all other attempts to reform city government have failed.</LD>
<LD>   But Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), one of the
secession opponents appearing at the USC debate, said a borough
system should be tried because it would provide more local control
without the downsides of a municipal divorce.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't know what you're going to create at the end of the day"
with secession, said Hertzberg, standing beside a map that showed how
Los Angeles could be carved into nine boroughs.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Katz, Valley Independence Committee chairman, said similar
proposals for reform over the years went nowhere. He called the
charter changes adopted three years ago "reform-lite."</TE>
<TE>   "People have petitioned their government to respond to their
concerns and that has fallen on deaf ears," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg's debating partner on the anti-secession side, City
Council President Alex Padilla, responded to Katz, saying "the
structure of government isn't driving secession so much as the desire
for better city services."</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of what I hear from people supporting the breakup
of the city is about service delivery," Padilla said. "A new
leadership at City Hall is improving services."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the neighborhood councils created as part of the
charter reforms "allow people a formal voice to participate in city
government."</TE>
<TE>   But Katz said a smaller government promised by the Nov. 5
secession measures is the only real solution. "You talk about
governance as if it has nothing to do with delivering services," he
said to Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Independence Committee Chairman Gene La Pietra, who
joined Katz in speaking for secession, said the city has neglected
Hollywood for 75 years, treating the area like a colony.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is a poorly managed regional resource" for Los Angeles,
La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's university-sponsored debate drew about 150 people to
USC's Town and Gown.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council in July voted against putting Hertzberg's borough
plan on the ballot as an alternative to secession. On Monday,
Hertzberg said he will form a group after leaving office in December
to study potential new forms of government for the city, including
boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   The former Assembly speaker said he wants to eventually get a
borough plan before voters but doubts one would be ready in time for
the March 2003 election.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be revived if secession doesn't succeed," he said. "I
do believe the borough system is the future of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the money-strapped Valley secession campaign stepped up
its use of e-mail to spread its message citywide. Conventional
mailers have proved too expensive for the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain said secession supporters will
forward the latest "e-mailer" to an estimated 20,000 voters. "It's a
different way of reaching voters, but it is effective," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, the anti-secession group One Los Angeles
announced Monday that it is distributing fliers to 90,000 voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley also is mailing
more than 127,000 voting guides in the Valley, urging a "no" vote on
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Another anti-secession recommendation came from the American
Jewish Committee on Monday. The committee announced its opposition to
Measure F, the Valley secession proposal, saying it would not address
the need across Los Angeles for better city services.</TE>
<TE>   "The consensus was that splitting the city apart really just
creates new layers of bureaucracy and doesn't solve the problems,"
said Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, the committee's western regional
director.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Valley city council candidate Frank Sheftel filed a
small-claims action against Mayor James K. Hahn, accusing him of
misrepresentation and fraud and "intentional infliction of emotional
and financial distress."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate for the proposed 12th District filed the case in Van
Nuys Court. He contended the city improperly spent $40,000 on a
senior citizens fair Saturday that featured anti-secession literature
and speeches..</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the fair was not a political event, even though his
campaign passed out the anti-secession literature.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Valley council candidate Scott Svonkin
acknowledged that he no longer works as an aide to Assemblyman Paul
Koretz (D-West Hollywood). Svonkin, who is running for the 14th
District seat, said he left the staff voluntarily but wouldn't say
why.</TE>

it contends.</TE>

<HD>$240,000 in Support Owed by Candidate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School board candidate Walt Madrid owes his ex-wife more than
$240,000 in child support, but that should not influence voters in
the Nov. 5 election, he says.</LD>
<LD>   "This is my personal life," said Madrid, 51, a U.S. Census Bureau
employee in Simi Valley. "People that know me, know me as an
individual. And I'm just going to leave it at that."</LD>
<LD>   Madrid is one of four candidates running for the vacant District 4
seat, representing Simi Valley and Moorpark on the Ventura County
Board of Education. His responsibilities as a board member would
include approving the budget and reviewing audits.</LD>
<TE>   Madrid confirmed the debt to Irene Madrid, his wife until the
couple divorced about a decade ago after having three children.
Despite automatic reductions from his paycheck, he said the huge debt
is still growing.</TE>
<TE>   That is partly because his payments are based on a $50,000 annual
salary he received in a previous job at Litton Guidance and Control
in Woodland Hills. He now makes about $30,000 a year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly payment amounts to about 50% of his net pay, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Madrid said he meant to appeal to reduce the payment, but hasn't
done so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nobody's fault but my own," he said. "I should have taken
care of it."</TE>
<TE>   Irene Madrid said Walt Madrid owes $170,432 in child support and
about $69,600 in interest, and that he pays child support only when
the amounts are deducted from his wages.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Trom, director of county child support services, said
confidentiality laws prevent him from discussing the case.</TE>
<TE>   The average child support debt of a delinquent parent is $11,000,
which makes a $240,000 debt among the largest sums owed in the
county, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county maintains a list of the 10 most-wanted "deadbeat dads"
who have outstanding warrants for their arrest for willful failure to
pay child support. The top offender on the most recent list owed
$142,162.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, about $400 million in child support is owed in Ventura
County, Trom said.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Madrid said her husband has frequently changed jobs over the
last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't until he got the census job that he started paying
child support on a regular basis," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Madrid said she has given up on collecting all the money
owed. "I'll never get all of that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   County prosecutors file criminal charges in some delinquent child
support cases, but the amount owed is not the sole factor, Trom said.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't necessarily the amount of the arrears. If a person is
currently paying, we generally don't file charges," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Madrid said she and her husband remain on good terms. He
often drives their three children to school in the morning.</TE>

<HD>Road to Riverside Will Get Worse, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Work-here, live-there lifestyles mean canyon, mountain
links will be even more gridlocked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A critical imbalance of jobs and affordable housing between Orange
and Riverside counties is expected to increase over the next 10 to 20
years, further taxing the congested highways that link the two
regions, a new economic study concludes. The $50,000 survey was
conducted jointly by the Orange County Transportation Authority and
the Riverside County Transportation Commission to determine how much
the counties depend on each other economically.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an acknowledgment that we have people and business moving
significantly between the two counties as well as significant
gridlock between the two counties," said Orange County Supervisor
Todd Spitzer, chairman of the transportation agencies' board of
directors.</LD>
<LD>   "We can either put our heads in the sand, or we can deal with it
head-on and provide transportation improvements," Spitzer said.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from both counties hope the study released Monday will
help them solve mutual transportation problems. The counties are
experiencing severe congestion on the Riverside Freeway and
increasing use of the narrow, winding Ortega Highway from Lake
Elsinore through the Cleveland National Forest to San Juan
Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   The worsening traffic combined with projected population growth
and economic interdependence seem certain to bolster the argument for
another transit corridor through Santa Ana Canyon or the Cleveland
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has proposed a major route through the Santa Ana
Mountains, while the Irvine Co., Orange County's largest developer,
has suggested a second highway paralleling the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say Orange County has had a growing job market, but
because of its high housing costs, its supply of workers has not kept
pace.</TE>
<TE>   The study concludes that Orange County cannot meet its employment
needs without importing labor from areas with more affordable
housing, such as Riverside County, over the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The report also notes that Riverside County will see an increased
job market.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Orange County's population is projected to increase
from about 2.8 million to about 3.4 million by 2020. Riverside County
is expected to grow from 1.6 million people to more than 2.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "What the data seems to say is, if the situation is difficult now,
stay tuned, it will get worse," said John Husing of Economics and
Politics Inc. in Redlands, which helped conduct the study.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow you need to facilitate the movement of goods and people
between the two counties or both economies will end up with
problems," Husing said.</TE>

<HD>Operators Seeking to Extend Life of Landfill</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bradley Landfill, which towers over working-class Sun Valley, is
slated to close in the next 18 months. But today, some residents are
holding their noses over the operator's proposal to extend the life
of the dump and eventually transform it into a recycling center.</LD>
<LD>   The landfill, which has been owned since 1986 by Waste Management
Corp., receives much of the city of Los Angeles' commercial garbage.
Under its current city permit, the dump is supposed to shut down
either by April 2007, or when its mounds of trash reach 1,010 feet
above sea level.</LD>
<LD>   The dump's highest point is 990 feet, and with new trash arriving
daily, it probably will be forced to close in 2003 or early 2004,
said Doug Corcoran, Waste Management's director of operations for the
north Los Angeles area.</LD>
<TE>   To buy more time, the company has filed a request with the city's
Planning Department to raise its limit by 43 feet. Corcoran said that
should keep the 200 or so landfill employees working until Waste
Management can turn the site into a sorting and distribution point
for recyclable materials.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Mackey, a member of the mayor's Oversight Committee on
Landfills and a 10-year resident of the heavily Latino neighborhood,
said Monday that the landfill should be closed as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a neighborhood filled with kids being impacted by this
landfill. At my daughter's school, we call the [Air Quality
Management District] routinely to say we can smell the dump," Mackey
said. '"Sun Valley's been dumped on enough."</TE>
<TE>   The 10-member oversight committee will consider Waste Management's
proposal for Bradley at 7 p.m. today at Faith Bible Church in Sun
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The group, however, can act only in an advisory capacity. After an
environmental review, the decision will rest with the Planning
Commission. The Los Angeles City Council will have the final say if a
decision is appealed.</TE>

<LD>The Bradley Landfill, which towers over working-class Sun Valley, is
slated to close in the next 18 months. But today, some residents are
holding their noses over the operator's proposal to extend the life
of the dump and eventually transform it into a recycling center.</LD>
<LD>   The landfill, which has been owned since 1986 by Waste Management
Corp., receives much of the city of Los Angeles' commercial garbage.
Under its current city permit, the dump is supposed to shut down
either by April 2007, or when its mounds of trash reach 1,010 feet

Planning Department to raise its limit by 43 feet. Corcoran said that
should keep the 200 or so landfill employees working until Waste
Management can turn the site into a sorting and distribution point
for recyclable materials.</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran said developing a recycling center would provide a smooth
transition as Mayor James K. Hahn tries to make good on his promises
to close down Bradley and the controversial Sunshine Canyon Landfill,
a constant source of complaints for residents of nearby Granada
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the marketplace in L.A. isn't ready to just close the
landfills," Corcoran said. "This guarantees people won't have to
worry what happens to the trash in the short term. In the long term,
we'll be working on a recycling facility."</TE>
<TE>   At Bradley, Corcoran said, all dumping would stop once the new
limit was reached. He said the sorting of recyclable material would
occur inside a covered, three-sided building.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Mackey, a member of the mayor's Oversight Committee on
Landfills and a 10-year resident of the heavily Latino neighborhood,
said Monday that the landfill should be closed as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a neighborhood filled with kids being impacted by this

said. '"Sun Valley's been dumped on enough."</TE>
<TE>   The 10-member oversight committee, which has recommended closing
the Sunshine Canyon Landfill by June 2006, will consider Waste
Management's proposal for Bradley at 7 p.m. today at Faith Bible
Church, 12055 Wicks Place, in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The group, however, can act only in an advisory capacity. After an
environmental review, the decision will rest with the Planning
Commission. The Los Angeles City Council will have the final say if a
decision is appealed.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said she was strongly
opposed to the idea of extending the Bradley Landfill's life.
Bradley, she noted, is one of 16 active or retired dumps in her
district, which covers Panorama City and Arleta, as well as portions
of Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Sun Valley and Pacoima. For some
constituents, she said, the plan smacks of environmental racism.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has to do their share," she said, "and the people in
Sun Valley are already doing their share. This is not fair."</TE>

<HD>Airport a Key Issue in 10th District</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn Bailey, a candidate for the proposed San Fernando Valley city
council, was touting the 2,100-acre Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area as
a jewel in the 10th District when a jet taking off from Van Nuys
Airport drowned him out.</LD>
<LD>   "That's pretty loud," said Bailey, 47, a program coordinator at
Cal State Northridge, as he looked up at the offending aircraft.
Later, Bailey said the airport is important to the Valley's economy,
but "we do need changes to reduce noise."</LD>
<LD>   The future of the airport, the nation's busiest general-aviation
airfield, is one of the few talking points among the eight candidates
seeking the 10th District seat. The winning candidate will take
office only if voters approve Valley secession on Nov. 5.</LD>
<TE>   The sprawling 10th District is in the heart of the Valley and
includes the airport, which averages about 1,500 takeoffs and
landings a day. The district also includes million-dollar homes in
Northridge, Reseda's struggling business district, the Anheuser-Busch
brewery in North Hills, Balboa Lake, as well as portions of Van Nuys
and Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the campaigning has centered on secession itself,
some candidates have accused the presumed front-runner, Van Nuys
activist Terry Stone, of wanting to shut down the airport because of
the noise. Stone denies that.</TE>
<TE>   She said she would work to phase out older, noisy jets and place
restrictions on helicopters. Nearby residents frequently complain
that the copters, particularly those used by Los Angeles-area TV and
radio stations, fly low over homes.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, 55, was an aide to former Los Angeles City Councilman Joel
Wachs and served on an advisory commission for the airport. She also
was part of a citizens panel that worked on the airport's master
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Her opponents in the council race say she did little in those
positions to ease the noise problems.</TE>
<TE>   "To close it would be totally wrong," said candidate Norman
Huberman, 55, of Northridge, a building contractor who also teaches
at the West Valley Occupational Center. "We need the airport to be
economically viable."</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate, former city elections official Richard Perry,
49, of Van Nuys, added his support for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Perry also said he will not accept any money contributions from
big businesses or special-interest groups for his grass-roots
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This brand-new city is starting from scratch," he said. "I'm
putting my own money where my mouth is."</TE>
<TE>   Huberman criticized the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
for failing to tell Valley residents that the use of a second meter
at most homes could cut water and sewer costs.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants increased community policing to combat gang
violence.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest candidate, 32-year-old medical student Ali Malekniazi
of North Hills, takes the secession idea a step further. He favors
breaking the Valley into "five or six smaller cities."</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with smaller government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey wants greater public control of and access to the Sepulveda
Dam Recreation Area, which includes three golf courses, Balboa Lake,
a sports center, Japanese gardens, picnic grounds and a wildlife
area.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters of special events at the recreation area, such as July 4
celebrations, are given too much sway, sometimes limiting public
access, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The public needs to be better informed about use of the Sepulveda
Basin," said Bailey, who lives in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates in the district are:</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stachowiak, 46, an actor and graphic artist who lives in
Reseda. He favors light-rail lines that would connect the Valley's
western and southern neighborhoods to the Red Line subway station in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Lesko, 48, a charity events organizer and Van Nuys
businessman. He says he represents the everyday worker and would
bring "real-life" experiences to the new council. He also said he
would work to stop the transport of dangerous toxic chemicals through
the area.</TE>
<TE>   William McMahon, 49, an engineer and educator who lives in Reseda.
McMahon said he would work to ensure the new city supports gay
rights.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County residents should be wary of a new phone scam, the
county tax collector warned Monday.</LD>
<LD>   An 86-year-old woman in Camarillo's Leisure Village was contacted
by a female caller who told the woman that her property tax payment
was late and offered to drive to the intended victim's home to pick
up the money.</LD>
<LD>   But the resident, Eleanor Faulkner, drove to the tax collector's
office in Ventura, where she learned she owed no back taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Lawrence Matheney, the treasurer and tax collector, said Faulkner
would have received several letters if she had owed money. He advises
anyone who receives such a phone call to contact his office at
654-3744.</TE>

<HD>Research Involving Sonic Blasts Halted</HD>
<DH>Judge issues temporary order after activists contend the
sound used by ship off Baja killed whales. Scientists deny the
allegation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. District Court order Monday temporarily halted a scientific
voyage in the Gulf of California to map the sea floor using sound
blasts that may have caused the deaths of two beaked whales.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate Judge James Larson in San Francisco issued a
temporary restraining order against the National Science
Foundation-sponsored project to examine the yawning rift in the sea
floor caused by the movement in the Earth's crust.</LD>
<LD>   "We have turned off the sound. Everything is shut down on the
ship," said Curt Suplee, a National Science Foundation spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   The research involved firing powerful air guns into the seabed so
that researchers could map the area through acoustic signals that
bounce back. The technology has been widely used in other oceans,
Suplee said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have found no evidence that the sonic blasts caused
the whale deaths, Suplee said. But they will comply with the federal
court order, which ends the expedition scheduled to finish by Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's order came in response to a lawsuit by the U.S.-based
Center for Biological Diversity, which argued that the federally
funded project failed to comply with U.S. environmental laws and
posed potential irreparable harm to marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're delighted that the judge ordered a halt to this dangerous
and illegal project," said Brendan Cummings, an attorney with the
nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. "We needed to stop them
from carrying out seismic research that has been linked to whale
deaths."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 18, researchers aboard the 239-foot research vessel
Maurice Ewing began doing zigzag patterns in the ocean off the
eastern shore of the Baja peninsula to map a long-developing rift
caused by the shifting of continental plates.</TE>
<TE>   The ship, operated by Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, was operating on a $1.6-million National Science
Foundation grant.</TE>
<TE>   "To the best of our knowledge, there has never been a report of
injury to a marine mammal," Suplee said. "We are not interested in
slaughtering marine wildlife. That's not what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Yet on Sept. 25, vacationing marine scientists discovered a pair
of Cuvier beaked whales that had washed ashore dead on Isla San Jose
off the Baja coast. The scientists found no wounds or obvious cause
of death other than reddening of the cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   Other beaked whales that washed ashore in the Bahamas two years
ago and in the Canary Islands last month showed similar signs of
burst blood vessels in the head, according to expert analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the deaths of the whales in the Bahamas were blamed on
the U.S. Navy's deployment of powerful sonar that ripped apart the
delicate tissues of the animals' inner ears and brains.</TE>
<TE>   The suit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity alleged that
the federally funded research in the Gulf of California violated the
National Environmental Policy Act, which requires the government to
analyze in advance any program that could have significant ecological
impact.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also argued that the research violated the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, which bans activity that carries the potential of
disturbing marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   The National Science Foundation argued that those U.S. laws do not
apply to the research project because it was operating in Mexican
waters.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has tried to exempt a series of offshore
operations, including tests of new Navy sonar systems that could
affect whales, from such environmental rules. A federal judge in Los
Angeles recently rejected those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Larson indicated that he would issue a written ruling in a
few days and set a time for a fuller hearing on the issues.</TE>

<HD>A Discovery That's Just Too Perfect</HD>
<DH>Claims that stone box held remains of Jesus' brother may be
suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Eisenman</AU>
<BD>Robert Eisenman is the author of "James the Brother of
Jesus" (Penguin, 1998) and a professor of Middle East religions and
archeology at Cal State Long Beach.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James, the brother of Jesus, was so well known and important as a
Jerusalem religious leader, according to 1st century sources, that
taking the brother relationship seriously was perhaps the best
confirmation that there ever was a historical Jesus.</LD>
<LD>   Put another way, it was not whether Jesus had a brother, but
rather whether the brother had a "Jesus."</LD>
<LD>   Now we are suddenly presented with this very "proof": the
discovery, allegedly near Jerusalem, of an ossuary inscribed in the
Aramaic language used at that time, with "James, son of Joseph,
brother of Jesus." An ossuary is a stone box in which bones
previously laid out in rock-cut tombs, such as those in the Gospels,
were placed after they were retrieved by relatives or followers.</LD>
<TE>   Why do I find this discovery suspicious? Aside from its sudden
miraculous appearance, no confirmed provenance -- that is, where it
was found and where it has been all these years (from the
photographic evidence it seems in remarkably good shape) -- and no
authenticated chain of custody or transmission, there is the nature
of the inscription itself.</TE>
<TE>   There is no problem getting hold of ossuaries from this period.
They are plentiful in the Jerusalem area, most not even inscribed and
some never used.</TE>
<TE>   So confirmation of the Jerusalem origin of the stone is to no
avail, nor particularly is the paleography. The Sorbonne paleographer
Andre Lemaire authenticated the Aramaic inscription as from the year
AD 63. What precision; but why 63? Because he knew from the 1st
century Jewish historian Josephus that James died in AD 62.</TE>
<TE>   The only really strong point the arguers for authenticity have is
the so-called patina, which was measured at an Israeli laboratory and
appears homogeneous. As this is a new science, it is hard for me to
gauge its value. Still, the letters do seem unusually clear and
incised and do not, at least in the photographs, show a significant
amount of damage caused by the vicissitudes of time.</TE>
<TE>   My main objection to the ossuary, however, is the nature of the
inscription itself. I say this as someone who would like this
artifact to be true, someone willing to be convinced. I would like
the burial place of James to be found. But this box is just too pat,
too perfect. In issues of antiquities verification, this is always a
warning sign.</TE>
<TE>   This inscription seems pointed not at an ancient audience, who
would have known who James (or Jacob, his Hebrew/Aramaic name) was,
but at a modern one. If this box had simply said "Jacob the son of
Joseph," it might pass muster. But ancient sources are not clear on
who this Jacob's father really was. If the inscription had said
"James the son of Cleophas," "Clopas or even "Alphaeus" (all three
probably being interchangeable), I would have jumped for joy. But
Joseph? This is what a modern audience, schooled in the Gospels,
would expect, not an ancient one.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is "the brother of Jesus" -- almost no ancient source
calls James this. This is what we moderns call him. Even Paul, our
primary New Testament witness, calls him "James the brother of the
Lord." If the ossuary said something like "James the Zaddik" or "Just
One," which is how many referred to him, including Hegesippus from
the 2nd century and Eusebius from the 4th, then I would have more
willingly credited it. But to call him not only by his paternal but
also his fraternal name, this I am unfamiliar with on any ossuary,
and again it seems directly pointed at us.</TE>
<TE>   This is what I mean by the formulation being too perfect. It just
doesn't ring true. To the modern ear, particularly the believer,
perhaps. But to the ancient? Perhaps a later pilgrim from the 4th or
5th century might have described James in this way, but this is not
what our paleographers are saying.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the numerous contemporary sources I have already referred
to know the location of James' burial site.</TE>
<TE>   Hegesippus, a Palestinian native who lived perhaps 50 years after
the events in question, tells us that James was buried where he was
stoned beneath the pinnacle of the Temple in Jerusalem. Eusebius in
the 4th century and Jerome in the 5th say the burial site with its
marker was still there in their times.</TE>
<TE>   No source, however, mentions an ossuary. Our creative artificers
presumably never read any of these sources (nor beyond the first few
chapters of my book) or they would have known better.</TE>

<HD>Stereotype Leads Down False Trail in the Sniper Case</HD>
<DH>Whacked-out white males are far from the only candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Earl Ofari Hutchinson</AU>
<BD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of "The Crisis in
Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998). E-mail:
Ehutchi344@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many a black comedian has perversely joked that blacks may kill each
other, but they don't shoot up, blow up or hack up crowds. This bit
of gallows humor always gets a laugh from black audiences.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, blacks took morbid pride and comfort in the notion
that despite their long, tortured history, mass killing supposedly
was a white-folks thing.</LD>
<LD>   The assumption was that all serial killers were young, whacked-out
white males. It is easy to believe. In the rash of Hollywood slasher,
horror and thrill-kill movies, serial killers are routinely depicted
as deranged white males. The obsessive media attention on serial
killers such as "Son of Sam" David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, John Wayne
Gacy and the Unabomber also reinforce the notion that serial killers
are loopy white guys. The horde of police, profiling experts and
psychologists that paraded across the TV screen during the sniper
ordeal speculating on the killer also bought into this racial
stereotype.</LD>
<TE>   If, as it is charged, John Allen Muhammad, 41, along with teenager
Lee Boyd Malvo, gunned down a dozen people and terrorized the
Washington, D.C., area, then it would seem that the experts all were
embarrassingly wrong in their assumptions and the old profiles and
theories about mass killers deserve to be scrapped -- and, in fact,
they should be. Muhammad, if guilty, is not a total aberration.</TE>
<TE>   Two studies that specifically looked at the race of serial killers
found that blacks made up about 15% of America's rogue's gallery of
mass murderers. Their rampages still strike fear and disgust in the
communities they pillaged.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, Wayne Williams was convicted of killing five
children in Atlanta, and authorities think he may have killed even
more. In Texas, Coral Watts claimed that he killed 13 women in
several states. In the early 1990s, Cleophus Prince Jr. stabbed six
women in San Diego, and authorities in East St. Louis strongly
suspect a black man is behind a string of unsolved killings of
prostitutes in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The victims of black serial killers almost always are other
blacks, who most often live in the poorest inner-city neighborhoods,
where the murder rates are far higher than in middle-class suburbs.
Because black-on-black crime is so entrenched, it is far too often
considered routine, and police are often more lax toward the violence
than if the victims were white. This makes it easier for black serial
murders to go undetected for far longer.</TE>
<TE>   The implicit message is that black lives are expendable. This
perceived devaluation of black lives has encouraged disrespect for
the law and has forced many blacks to internalize anger and displace
aggression onto other blacks.</TE>
<TE>   That's important to understand because those young blacks who
commit random destructive acts still are savvy enough to target
victims who pose no real physical or personal threat to them.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper's victims fit that profile. The victims, although
racially diverse, posed no danger to the sniper and were apparently
chosen at random.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate weeks before Muhammad's alleged run of terror,
there were disturbing signs that other blacks driven by rage,
bitterness and frustration were more willing than ever to wreak
random violence on themselves and others.</TE>
<TE>   In September, a pack of young -- one as young as 10 years old --
and not-so-young black males mauled a hapless man in Milwaukee. In
June, another mob of young blacks grabbed national headlines when
they stomped to death two men in Chicago. The Milwaukee and Chicago
victims were low- income, middle-aged men or had alcohol and drug
problems. They were easy pickings, just as the sniper's victims were.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's not yet known what drove the person or persons
responsible for the Washington-area sniper shootings, the suspect,
Muhammad, is said to be a man consumed by personal rage and
frustration over failed marriages, tangled personal relationships,
sour business dealings and a rocky military career.</TE>
<TE>   These personal demons -- and not terrorist ties, which authorities
have as yet found no evidence of -- may well have been enough to push
him to monstrous acts.</TE>
<TE>   But equally ominous, his alleged deeds showed that it was a
perilously short step from the random violence that all too often
claims innocent lives and paralyzes many poor inner-city black
neighborhoods to random violence that paralyzes whole cities, even a
nation.</TE>
<TE>   That's a terrible price to pay for ignoring homegrown walking time
bombs created by our inner cities' festering inequities but
overlooked until the madness breaks out of its racially pigeonholed
boundaries.</TE>

<HD>Chechnya Conflict Isn't Worth the Price</HD>
<DH>Moscow should try containment instead of combat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rajan Menon</AU>
<BD>Rajan Menon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, is a professor of international relations at Lehigh
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 115 hostages perished after Russian commandos stormed the
Moscow theater that Chechen radicals had taken over as about 750
people were having a pleasant evening at a popular musical.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't the radicals or even the crossfire that killed all
but two of the captives. It was a noxious gas that rescuers had
pumped into the building to incapacitate the Chechens and prevent
them from killing all their captives.</LD>
<LD>   The dreadful denouement has focused international attention on the
Putin government's use of the unidentified chemical agent, its
failure to have antidotes immediately at hand and its Soviet-esque
approach to releasing information.</LD>
<TE>   The Kremlin's behavior is indeed troubling, but in the anguish, a
larger issue -- that Russia's war in Chechnya is at a dead end, and
it's time for a new tack -- is receiving short shrift. The war's
savagery has escaped most people in the West because it has fallen
off the front pages. Yet it has driven about 225,000 Chechens into
the neighboring and penurious republic of Ingushetia.</TE>
<TE>   The Chechen capital, Grozny (appropriately, Russian for terrible),
is a ruin. Farms and factories have been destroyed. Widows and
orphans abound. The types of cold-eyed people created by this hellish
environment are exemplified by the men and women who were calmly
prepared to kill a mass of innocent Moscow theatergoers.</TE>
<TE>   And though these particular people may be dead or in custody,
there will be others. Chechnya offers a steady supply of people for
whom life is like a used Kleenex. Russia's war is, to put it mildly,
going badly at the front. Military helicopters are shot out of the
sky regularly; bombing and assassination attempts target Russian
officials and members of the pro-Russian Chechen government;
fragmented but dogged guerrillas (who the Kremlin claims are
finished) launch persistent hit-and-run operations.</TE>
<TE>   What last week's hostage-taking shows is that the zone of combat
has been extended from the front to the rear. The most extreme
Chechen groups have decided that Russian civilians need to feel their
pain.</TE>
<TE>   The recent hostage drama, then, is preface to a new stage in the
war. It promises to be a gruesome one.</TE>
<TE>   For Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, the only way out of
Chechnya is to admit what Russians are coming to realize in
increasing numbers anyway: Not only is Russia not winning the war,
the war is unwinnable. But simply withdrawing the Russian army
amounts to a cave-in, not a strategy. Russia should indeed end this
military fiasco, but it also needs to devise a different solution for
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   A new approach would be to replace war-fighting with containment
-- that is, drastically tightened border controls and stringent
monitoring of financial flow. The goal would be to ensure that
Chechnya's turmoil -- and let there be no mistake, even greater chaos
will ensue when Russia leaves because Chechen warlords will turn on
each other once again -- remains sealed within its borders.</TE>
<TE>   Containment would staunch money laundering and gunrunning, prevent
Chechen extremists from crossing into Russia to commit acts of terror
and cut outside support to the extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Russia could not do this alone. Like our own war on terrorism, a
containment plan must have support from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should be eager to lend a helping hand. We have
the expertise; we have a stake in not allowing Chechnya to become a
branch office of Al Qaeda; and we have an interest in preventing
Russia's ruinous war from eroding its fragile democracy and
endangering the economic recovery that it has finally begun to enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Is containment guaranteed to work? Of course not. Is it an ideal
solution? No. But in this messy war, there are no perfect solutions.
It's a matter of choosing the least bad option.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series was about thunder sticks, rally monkeys and little
boys unexpectedly underfoot. It was about San Francisco wishing upon
a superstar and Anaheim responding with a constellation of constantly
shifting lesser stars.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' triumph over the Giants also was about time. Forty-two
years since the first flight of Angels landed. A year since the
Angels finished 41 games out of first. Angel fans used thundering
sticks to beat back the "curse of the singing cowboy." Now Willie
Brown is getting measured for a Gene Autry-style cowboy hat, and
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly's campaign manager is hoping that, come Nov.
5, the Angels will prove to have coattails.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds silenced critics who said he was no Mr. October. But
the Angels did it again Sunday in the grandest of their postseason
string of come-from-behind wins. Garret Anderson -- the team's only
bona fide All-Star -- provided all the needed runs early on, freeing
the Angels to pour the champagne without the rally monkey on their
back.</LD>
<TE>   It is the worst of sports cliches, but the Angels' postseason ride
was a team effort.</TE>
<TE>   Three rookies went to the mound Sunday for the Angels -- including
Francisco Rodriguez, who became a trivia answer a few days earlier by
logging his first two major league victories during postseason games.
Platoon player Adam Kennedy joined Babe Ruth, George Brett, Reggie
Jackson and Bob Robertson, the only players to have hit three home
runs during a single postseason game. Troy Glaus hit a Bonds-like
.385 during the series to earn the most-valuable-player award, and
Manager Mike Scioscia did what 15 of his Angel predecessors could
only dream.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball team owners probably will ignore those eardrum-splitting
thunder sticks when they meet this winter. They'll mumble something
about insurance regulations and instead close down Dusty Baker's
child-care clinic. That would be unfortunate because the televised
images of little boys with dreamy eyes the size of major league
baseballs reminded us why, to so many, baseball still means so much.</TE>

<HD>Third Strike for SEC's Pitt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three strikes and you're out. We're not talking about the World
Series that ended last weekend. We are talking about Harvey L. Pitt,
the embattled chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt earned a called third strike for his wrongheaded campaign to
install former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster as head of the
newly formed Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which is
charged with cleaning up the accounting industry. Initial reports had
Pitt poised to hit a home run by nominating John H. Biggs, the head
of one of the nation's largest pension funds. But the powerful
accounting industry threw high inside heat for Webster, a Washington
insider, and Pitt bailed.</LD>
<LD>   The first strike against the nation's top securities cop was his
tarnishing of his agency's credibility by taking private meetings
with the chiefs of the KPMG accounting firm and Xerox, two companies
facing SEC investigations. His second came when he failed to publicly
lobby for federal money his agency desperately needed to hire
additional staff, modernize computer systems and fund the new
accounting board mandated last summer when Congress passed and
President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's bitterly contested 3-2 commission vote in favor of
Webster was divided along party lines, with Democrats favoring Biggs.
Webster's a fine person, but the long-time Washington insider is
hardly the best candidate to restore the credibility of the nation's
financial markets. "I like Bill Webster," Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.) told The Times on Thursday. "But he's certainly not an expert
in this field."</TE>
<TE>   Expertise, though, is what the board will need to ride herd on the
powerful accounting industry that continues to lobby hard for
business as usual. The oversight board is charged with the important
work of shaping new standards for public accountants and disciplining
accountants who violate securities laws. The board -- and investors
whose faith in the financial markets has been shaken -- would have
benefited from Biggs' hands-on experience.</TE>
<TE>   Webster is not the SEC's main problem, however. We've said before
that Pitt has to go, and we're more convinced of that now.</TE>

<LD>Chechen militants who seized more than 700 theatergoers in the heart
of Moscow, wiring explosives in the building and threatening to kill
their captives, ultimately are responsible for the deaths of more
than 100 innocent people in the rescue attempt. But Russian refusal
to name the gas used and the attempt to blame the deaths on other
causes harken back to the Soviet days of Stalin and the gulags,
especially now that the government has muzzled much of the media.</LD>
<LD>   Hostages who survived said they feared being killed at any minute,
and that indeed was the possibility that prompted the government to
act. But the failure to have medical personnel nearby to quickly
attend to those overcome by the gas and the refusal to tell hospital
doctors what disabling agent was used and what would counteract it
were inexcusable.</LD>
<LD>   Government officials initially blamed many of the deaths on
Chechen gunfire. But civilian doctors said that among more than 115
victims examined, only two died from bullets. The doctors said most
apparently died of poisoning when gas was pumped into the ventilation
system, another contradiction of government statements that the gas
exacerbated existing conditions like heart and lung problems, which
caused the deaths.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 50 militants were killed and the death toll of
hostages could reach 200. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, who
rode to power two years ago by being tough on Chechen separatists,
asked the relatives of those killed to "forgive us." His popularity
soared among those rescued, their families and many Russians outraged
that the war with a troublesome province in the Caucasus again had
been brought to the capital. On Monday, Russian officials accused Al
Qaeda of involvement in the hostage-taking, not the first time the
government has linked Chechens demanding independence to
international terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Chechen anger at harsh Russian rule dates back centuries, and its
targets have included czars, Communists and the post-Soviet
government. In 1994, separatists launched a two-year war that ended
with a declaration of an independent Chechnya that was recognized by
only one other country -- Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. In September
1999, after a series of kidnappings by Chechen warlords and
apartment-house bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed several
hundred people, Moscow launched another war against the rebels. Both
sides have committed atrocities including torture; Russian soldiers
call it the "no limits" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Chechen representatives at a Denmark conference Monday distanced
themselves from the hostage-takers and asked Putin to start peace
talks. After the weekend's carnage, it will be easier for the
president to vilify the Chechens and more difficult to discuss peace.
But such discussion is what's necessary to stop the spiral of
violence. One thing Putin should not do is tolerate the return to the
old Russia that lied to its people.</TE>

<LD>With all this chirping and squawking regarding a possible war with
Iraq and related issues, it is time to introduce a new winged species
onto the political landscape of the United States: the owl.</LD>
<LD>   Owls, of course, are neither doves nor hawks, though we may
possess traits of both. We do hunt, that is true, and no rat is safe
with an owl on the prowl. However, we don't posture in the sky for
all to see -- including our prey and predators -- but rather quietly
await, under cover, our moment of conquest. Nor do we perch idly on a
limb, sanctimoniously displaying our sublime beauty while coo-cooing
with our mates in a public display of indulgent passivity.</LD>
<LD>   However, what really distinguishes owls from the two other groups
of feathered fowl dominating political thought and culture throughout
the world is our ability to turn our heads completely in the opposite
direction, thus giving us yet another perspective, another point of
view.</LD>
<TE>   One more minor characteristic I might mention is that we are
generally associated with wisdom, as opposed to ill-thought-out
warmongering and irresponsible manipulation of the peace market.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Sen. Wellstone Dies in Minn. Plane Crash," Oct. 26: As a student
at the University of Minnesota during the early 1980s, I was involved
in the students' Democrat club. A true die-hard for educating youth
about political awareness, Paul Wellstone would always attend our
events, even if it meant driving through rain, sleet or snow. And
this was no small feat, as his home base was a small private college
an hour from Minneapolis. But his being there was so Paul Wellstone.</LD>
<LD>   He was always there. He was there for liberal causes. He was there
for the youth and the elderly. He was a consistent voice for working
people. He cared about the environment and tirelessly promoted peace.
He was old-fashioned in his liberalism. He was unabashed. And he
didn't give a damn if that bothered some people. Whether it was
popular or unpopular, he stood his ground. Now, with his tragic
passing, we look around and see there are so few true liberals left.
They seem to be fading from view. All we have now are sheepish
politicians. We miss you, Paul Wellstone.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Republican and native Minnesotan, I never liked Wellstone's
ideology, but I always liked him. He was honest, kind, smart,
compassionate and had the kind of heart I wish every lawmaker had.
When I worked as a congressional page in the U.S. Capitol a few years
ago, I came into contact with Sen. Wellstone a lot, bumping into him
in elevators and hallways. Most senators don't give pages, the
lowliest of Capitol Hill employees, the time of day, but Wellstone
always took time to ask how we were doing and thank us for our work.
He was, without a doubt, our favorite senator.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone represented a great and rare breed of politician, the
kind who stands up for what he believes in no matter what the
political price. He was a good man who served his people and his
principles well. Our country will miss him.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I had the distinct honor of working with Wellstone during Bill
Bradley's presidential run. I traveled throughout northwest Iowa with
him and his wife on those cold winter nights to union halls and
college campuses. Wellstone enthusiastically supported Bradley in his
pursuit of America's highest office so he could champion the highest
of ideals. As often happens in America today, more moderate forces
prevailed. Those messages of a better, kinder America are left to the
Paul Wellstones of the world. He did just that and will always be
remembered as a good and decent man whose convictions prevailed over
special interests. He will be sorely missed, and my deepest
sympathies go out to his family and the families of the others lost
in the tragedy that occurred Oct. 25.</TE>

<TE>   Wellstone did not waffle. He did not swing with the polls,
modifying, editing and compromising his beliefs. He did not spend
each legislative day worrying about whether his vote would affect his
reelection or the amount of money he could raise. He voted his
conscience even when it was not the popular thing to do. His vote on
the Iraq war resolution was the crowning example of that.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Is Big Oil Lubricating War Drive?" Commentary, Oct. 25: Jeremy
Rifkin needs to stop watching so much TV and start taking his
medication. His theories of oil conspiracy are about as grounded in
reality as the theory -- also widely believed "in the streets" in
parts of the world -- that the Israelis engineered the Sept. 11
attacks. His assertion that in Europe "most people believe" that the
Americans are out to steal Iraq's oil fields is ridiculous. If oil
were the real issue, one would expect Europe, which is far more
dependent on Middle Eastern oil, to be leading the charge.</LD>
<LD>   Most Europeans, like most Americans, recognize that Saddam Hussein
poses a threat but that there are questions about how immediate that
threat is and what should be done about it. Peddling conspiracy
theories may help Rifkin sell his books, but it only confuses the
debate over difficult decisions that need to be made in the real
world.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Could Hussein, the Bully of Baghdad, become a world-honored
martyr? With President Bush's help it is possible. Rifkin implies
that if we go it alone, the suspicion that war with Iraq is for
nothing more than to confiscate its oil will be confirmed. Could the
U.S. ever sustain a military might big enough to live forever as
robber baron to the world?</TE>
<TE>   Rex Styzens</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missing from Rifkin's piece is any explanation of what the oil
industry has to gain from a war with Iraq. It stands to reason that a
successful war resulting in the liberation of Iraq would lead to
lower world oil prices. This would not be good for the oil industry,
as margins would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   So where's the benefit? Assuming there is an oil angle, wouldn't
the beneficiaries of such action be the consumers, not producers, of
oil?</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Signs Big Boost in Defense Spending," Oct. 24:</LD>
<LD>   In a politically and emotionally motivated wartime era, Bush has
found $355.5 billion for military expenses. I'm glad that new weapons
will be developed, along with a ballistic missile defense system,
while millions of Americans are unemployed, homeless or dying from an
incurable disease. There are people who have no health insurance,
don't know how they'll feed their children tonight or are covering
themselves with this newspaper to stay warm on a park bench. Is it
any wonder that so many Americans feel neglected and unrepresented by
our government?</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Newell</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do we realize that the $355.5 billion for our new defense budget
is more money than all other nuclear powers in the world combined
allocate to their defense budgets? Do we realize that if we shifted
even a portion of this money to humanitarian causes around the world
we'd see a significant improvement in the anti-American zeal sweeping
the globe right now? Or, for that matter, how far this money could go
in helping out with our own problems?</TE>
<TE>   After all, regardless of how we're told that out of any other
country the United States gives the largest amount of money toward
humanitarian causes, it's never mentioned that, when compared as a
percentage of the gross domestic product with other much smaller
European countries, we're far from the leaders of the pack.</TE>
<TE>   As the economic superpower of the world, is this something to
boast about? Do we even care?</TE>

<LD>I was surprised to open the Sunday edition of The Times and find a
baseball game represented in the front-page photo. Coverage of the
previous day's massive, unprecedented demonstrations against the Bush
administration's desire to attack Iraq was relegated to A17.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 200,000 people protested peacefully in Washington. An
additional 42,000 rallied in Berkeley. Excuse me, but this sounds
like front-page news. Is the choice to bury the story a reflection of
the newspaper's priorities, or is it a deliberate attempt to downplay
the importance of this groundswell showing of opposition to war by
ordinary Americans all over the country? Either way, I am more than
disappointed.</LD>

<LD>My goodness, your headline "Fishing Permanently Banned Around the
Channel Islands" (Oct. 24) suggests that there is no place to fish.
Yet your map shows only a small portion of the area to be off-limits.</LD>
<LD>   We have fished off the California coast for more than 50 years. We
heartily endorse the ban. It will revive the fish populations and
other marine wildlife. The issue goes beyond recreation and
commercial interests; it goes to the heart of our food supply. If
these fish become extinct, we lose food for now and future
generations.</LD>
<LD>   We are grateful that some of the money from our fishing licenses
is used to study and make recommendations to preserve our California
fisheries. Our heartfelt thanks go to the California Fish and Game
Commission for its visionary vote.</LD>

<LD>Your Oct. 20-22 series on China and the Oct. 25 letters published in
response have it all wrong. No company ever made a penny moving its
manufacturing and jobs to China. In fact, billions of dollars are
spent from many company bank accounts building factories in China. No
profit is made until the consumer buys an object manufactured in
China. If you buy "Made in China," they send more factories and jobs
to China. If you don't buy "Made in China," they don't move more
factories and jobs.</LD>

<LD>Re "Label This Swell," editorial, Oct. 22: It's not just T-shirts!
Every garment I buy has a label at the neck or waist. Cutting them
off doesn't work; they're still stiff and irritating. Many are sewn
on with prickly plastic thread. Many are sewn right into the seam of
the garment, so you ruin the garment if you use a seam ripper. Some
won't come off even with a seam ripper. Bravo to Hanes. I sure hope
this starts a trend.</LD>

<HD>L.A. Teacher Awarded British Honor</HD>
<DH>Rafe Esquith is recognized for his Shakespeare program for
inner-city kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianne Aryanpur</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Next April, as they do each spring, Rafe Esquith's
fifth- and sixth-grade students at Hobart Boulevard Elementary School
west of downtown Los Angeles will perform Shakespeare in their street
clothes.</LD>
<LD>   And as in other years, Academy Award-nominated actor Sir Ian
McKellen plans to be there to watch.</LD>
<LD>   McKellen, who recently played Gandalf in "The Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Ring," comes to see 11- and 12-year-old kids
spout Shakespeare. A few years ago, McKellen took a break from
filming to watch "Rafe's kids." A few years before that, he made the
trip to Hobart even though the Academy Awards were the next evening.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, however, instead of the British coming to see Esquith
and his students, Esquith went to see the British.</TE>
<TE>   He was in Washington to be honored at the British Embassy for
service to British-American relations through his Hobart
Shakespeareans Project. Started with the help of one of Esquith's
former students, the program works to improve the quality of life of
inner-city kids through the study of Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   British Ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer called Esquith "one of
that rare breed of teachers whose influence extends well beyond the
classroom. His remarkable career ... stands as a testament to what
passion, imagination and energy can achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Three other Americans were honored for aiding the families of
British American victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. The
Rev. Andrew Craig Mead, rector of St. Thomas Church, was recognized
for his spiritual help, including organizing a multi-faith prayer
service for the families of British victims. Richard J. Sheirer,
former commissioner of the New York City Office of Emergency
Management, was honored for organizing recovery efforts after the
terrorist attacks. And Bradford Billet, deputy commissioner of the
New York City Office of the Mayor, was recognized for working closely
with the British consulate general to compile a list of foreign
nationals and a DNA list of survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's award was the latest in a series of honors Esquith has
received for his work at Hobart, where he has taught for 18 years. In
1992 he received a National American Teacher Award, and in 1997 he
was named Outstanding Teacher of the Year by Parents magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "I've received a lot of teacher awards, but I've never felt this
honored," said Esquith, who was recognized Monday as an Officer of
the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Initially founded in
1917 to recognize the contributions of civilians in World War I, the
award now honors civilian contributions to public service and
society.</TE>
<TE>   McKellen isn't the only celebrity fan of the Hobart Shakespeareans
Project; British actors Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are both
supporters. Oprah Winfrey, who in 2000 awarded Esquith $100,000
through her "Use Your Life" award, is also a patron.</TE>
<TE>   For Esquith, who joined the ranks of previous recipients including
former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the real honorees are his
students.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is impressed every day by the intelligence and
courteousness of his students -- many of whom come from minority
backgrounds and from families where English is not their first
language.</TE>
<TE>   In preparation for Esquith's visit to Washington, his students
gave him the "royal treatment" by rolling out a red carpet and
referring to him as "Your Majesty" for days before he left, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are just as bright as the other ones; they just don't
have the same opportunities," Esquith said. Through projects such as
Hobart Shakespeareans and weekend SAT tutoring sessions, Esquith
hopes he can give students that extra boost.</TE>
<TE>   A program Esquith created that allows his students to go to school
from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., 50 weeks a year, has helped his graduates
attend top schools like Yale and Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing the best I can in my little corner of the world to
level the playing field -- that's what a teacher is supposed to do,"
said Esquith, a UCLA graduate.</TE>
<TE>   With nothing but a chalkboard as the backdrop, next spring's
performance of Shakespeare's "Henry IV" will be no different from
years past, with its lack of a set, costumes or props.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the way Esquith and his students like it.</TE>
<TE>   "All that stuff is showbiz; this is about education," Esquith
said.</TE>

<HD>Blake's Lawyer Seeks to Quit in Dispute Over TV Interview</HD>
<DH>Harland Braun informs judge that the actor, who is accused
of killing his wife, ignored legal advice in agreeing to appear on
camera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harland W. Braun is seeking to withdraw as Robert Blake's criminal
defense attorney, saying the actor ignored his legal advice by
agreeing to do an on-camera interview this week from jail.</LD>
<LD>   "No criminal lawyer in his right mind would let a client [be
interviewed for television]," Braun said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 69, is charged with murder, two counts of soliciting murder
and conspiracy in the May 4, 2001, fatal shooting of his wife, Bonny
Lee Bakley, 44, in Studio City.</LD>
<TE>   Braun said Blake's defense could not be adequately summed up
during a 10-minute television interview. He said he expressed those
concerns to Blake last week but was overruled by his client.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think there is no way I can be a party to this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lloyd Nash, who is presiding over
the case, must approve the lawyer's withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he would continue to represent Blake until another
attorney is retained. But the substitution of attorneys could delay
the preliminary hearing, now set for Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Braun faxed a two-page letter to Nash on Monday explaining his
reasons for dropping out of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that a defendant in a murder case would go on national
television to discuss any aspect of his relationship with the
deceased or any of the facts surrounding the murder is beyond the
comprehension of any criminal lawyer," Braun wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "In my professional opinion, a criminal defendant should talk to
the police at the time of the incident if he chooses, as Robert Blake
did for four hours, and should reserve any discussion of the facts
surrounding the case until he testifies under oath before a jury."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Felsen, Blake's longtime civil attorney, said the actor
plans to hire a lawyer "who shares a common philosophy with Robert on
the defense." He defended Blake's decision to do a television
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that Robert be allowed to talk to the
people he's had a relationship with for the past 60 years -- the
American people," Felsen said. "He feels strongly that he has to make
some kind of public statement."</TE>
<TE>   Felsen, a Century City entertainment lawyer, said he wrote a
letter asking the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to permit
an ABC news crew to videotape Diane Sawyer's interview with Blake,
scheduled for Friday at Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, best known for his 1970s television series "Baretta," has
been held without bail since his arrest April 18 in Hidden Hills. He
has given a few jailhouse interviews during that time, but all
off-camera.</TE>
<TE>   The request for an on-camera interview is still under
consideration, a sheriff's spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Eric J. Dubin, an attorney for the Bakley family,
questioned Braun's reasoning for withdrawing before the preliminary
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Blake has done numerous media [interviews], and I don't see
how this would be any different," Dubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said it appears
that Braun is having problems controlling his client.</TE>
<TE>   "What it shows is a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship," Levenson said. "We don't know what's going on -- if
this is the tip of the iceberg or the straw that broke the camel's
back."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Takes Reins at LAPD</HD>
<DH>He avoids bold predictions, but praises officers, urging
them to regain public's trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police Chief William J. Bratton, pinned Monday with the badge of the
Los Angeles Police Department, said the city's entrenched gang
culture and thin police staffing made him reluctant to make the sort
of bold predictions about reducing crime for which he was known in
New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm purposely not talking numbers in a public way until I have a
much better sense of how the department works," Bratton said after
the public ceremony inducting him as the 54th police chief.</LD>
<LD>   In his remarks to a crowd gathered at the Police Academy at
Elysian Park in the backyard of Dodger Stadium, Bratton outlined the
task ahead, saying that the city can become safer only if residents
and the police work together.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no police department in America that needs the community
more than this Police Department," said Bratton, emphasizing the need
to regain residents' trust.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot do it alone, but with them you can do anything."</TE>
<TE>   "We're outnumbered 10 to 1," he told his officers. "100,000
gangbangers out there; 10 to 1." But the chief said skilled policing
can overcome those odds.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who was officially sworn in at a private City Hall
ceremony Friday, donned his midnight blue uniform for the first time
Monday for an outdoor celebration that included a police band,
bagpipes, officers on horseback, a choir and a helicopter flyover.
Gov. Gray Davis, Mayor James K. Hahn, hundreds of dignitaries,
including former chiefs, rank-and-file officers and members of the
public and media attended.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking without notes, Bratton repeated his promise to make Los
Angeles the safest big city in America--the charge given to him by
Hahn. He called on LAPD officers to fulfill the promise "on the side
of each and every one of your black and whites ... that world-famous
motto: 'To protect and serve.' "</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very thin blue line -- 9,000 for a city this large,"
Bratton said. "I want to talk very bluntly to you. The citizens of
this city need you back in those streets. They don't need you smiling
and waving. They need you out of those cars, on those corners, in
those parks taking back those streets."</TE>
<TE>   While he lauded the success against crime during the 1990s in Los
Angeles, Bratton said that, unlike then, police now must forge a
connection with residents, as well as make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new day. Cops have to work with their community," said
Bratton--who has gone back and forth on the quality of the force he
is inheriting, at times saying that the badge has been tarnished by
scandal, but then also saying that the force is already the best in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Monday that he believed good progress had been made
under departing Chief Martin Pomeroy, who came out of retirement
earlier this year to lead the department on an interim basis after
Hahn refused to reappoint Bernard C. Parks to another term.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get in the business of problem-solving -- putting
cops where the crime is," Bratton told the department. "And if it's
on weekends, if it's on nights, if it's on the late hours, that's
where you have to be."</TE>
<TE>   To some, Monday's ceremony represented a changing of the guard at
the LAPD. Many of the top department managers who rose to prominence
under Chief Darryl F. Gates are expected to be ousted in coming days.
But Gates' shadow had hung over the department since his 1992
departure as officers he promoted into management continued to run
Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   Impossible to miss in a pale cotton jacket and tan slacks amid
rows of deep LAPD blue, Gates earned loud applause and whoops and
shouts when he was introduced on the dais.</TE>
<TE>   "What I find to be ominous is the response to Chief Gate's
presence," Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said after the event. "If
one had an applause meter there, it would have been hard to register
any higher than he did. This is what Chief Bratton has to deal with.
I hope he comes to terms with how daunting the task will be."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said he found it disconcerting to watch Gates, whom
he called an "anathema to reform," on the stage, while Parks was
never mentioned by name.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obviously deliberate," he said. "It's hard in my view to
ignore and or disregard someone who devotes nearly 40 years of his
life to an institution."</TE>
<TE>   Gates refused to comment Monday on Bratton's appointment, ignoring
reporters' questions.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he would announce new leadership for the department
in coming days and weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably added at the last minute to the program's listed
platform guests were Cmdrs. Jim McDonnell and Sharon Papa. Bratton
has mentioned the veteran officers, as well as Police Cmdr. George
Gascon, a number of times as people he admires in the department</TE>
<TE>   "We joined the department for the same purpose -- quality public
safety -- that's the bottom line," Gascon said. "Jimmy, Sharon and I
are from a different generation. We're all more willing to try new
things. We're more comfortable with change."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton acknowledged that he is less familiar with Los Angeles'
problems and Police Department than he was with New York's when he
took over the New York Police Department in 1994. In many respects,
Bratton's comments and plan for his newly adopted city seemed a
direct copy of his remarks and the strategy he outlined nearly nine
years ago, when he was sworn in as New York's police commissioner
with an appeal for a new covenant between citizens and police.</TE>
<TE>   Among 50 friends and family members who traveled from the East
Coast to attend Monday's ceremony was George Kelling, who, along with
James Q. Wilson, developed the "broken windows" style of policing
that argues for early police intervention on small problems such as
vandalism as the means to head off serious crime.</TE>
<TE>   Kelling -- who will work for Bratton as a consultant from Boston
-- said Monday that Los Angeles is very different from Boston or New
York but that he believed Bratton can get the same results by
tweaking the approach.</TE>
<TE>   In order to import community policing, Bratton plans to make a
number of adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   He said Monday that he would revamp a disciplinary system that has
been unpopular with rank-and-file officers for being slow and
arbitrary. He said again that he would shift more power to the
department's 18 divisions, which he envisions as "mini-police
departments."</TE>
<TE>   Another priority for Bratton is updating the department's
technology to track crime street by street. He used a similar system
in New York. Bratton argues that such a shift is needed to comply
fully with the federal consent decree that the city signed last year
after the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that the LAPD had for
years engaged in a "pattern or practice of civil rights violations."</TE>
<TE>   But with limited resources, Bratton also seemed eager to identify
new pockets to draw on. He said he would go to the business community
for political support and money.</TE>
<TE>   And when Gov. Davis said in brief comments: "There's no higher
priority to me, than to ensure that the funding, the tools and the
resources necessary to help local law enforcement are there," Bratton
promised to knock on his door.</TE>
<TE>   In one dose of wry humor, Bratton, who received a sustained
standing ovation from the crowd, acknowledged that his days as chief
might not always be as easy.</TE>
<TE>   As Rick Caruso, head of the Police Commission, pinned the badge to
the new chief's uniform, Bratton jokingly called on paramedics in the
audience to be alert.</TE>
<TE>   "If I stab you it's only a sign of things to come," Caruso
responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Caruso," Bratton said, moments after he took the oath for a
second time, "you can stick me any time, as long as it's not in the
back."</TE>

<HD>Murder Defendant Portrayed as Dupe</HD>
<DH>Lawyer for Bridget Callahan, accused of helping kill a teen
girl in 1998, says she was the unwitting accomplice of two skinheads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder defendant Bridget Callahan obediently stood guard as two
skinhead thugs beat and slashed a teenage girl to death in a motel
bathroom four years ago, her lawyer conceded Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But attorney Joseph O'Neill insisted in his opening statement to a
Superior Court jury that Callahan never intended to harm the girl.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill portrayed his client as the diminutive dupe of violent
skinhead gang members, and later the victim of ambitious law
enforcement officers out to crack an unsolved homicide. From start to
finish, O'Neill said, "Ms. Callahan does what she is told."</LD>
<TE>   But Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz told jurors that evidence will
show Callahan was not "a naive little girl," but a woman entrenched
in the violent and racist skinhead subculture who knowingly
participated in the October 1998 slaying of 17-year-old Nichole
Hendrix in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a 30-year-old Ventura resident, faces one count of
first-degree murder and allegations that the slaying was gang-related
and occurred during a robbery and kidnapping. She faces 25 years to
life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Katz also told jurors that there will be no evidence to support
the defense allegations of law enforcement deception and coercion.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't make any promises to her," Katz said. "You're not
going to hear any evidence at all that they tricked her."</TE>
<TE>   Katz suggested that the only person deceived was Hendrix.
According to prosecutors, the teen was drugged and kidnapped by her
friend, Callahan, and skinheads David Ziesmer, 29, and Michael
Bridgeford, 25, so they could fence stolen goods in her possession.</TE>
<TE>   Upon awakening in a "sleazy" Ventura motel room, Hendrix made a
phone call, Katz said. Ziesmer and Bridgeford mistakenly thought the
girl was reporting them to police and decided to kill her, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   After the slaying, Hendrix's body was packed into a trash can
filled with wet cement and dumped into the Ventura County back
country. When it was recovered six months later, animals had dragged
away most of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan is the first to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony began Monday after two years of legal skirmishes and
political tumult.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, Ziesmer and Bridgeford were all indicted on murder
charges in August 2000 after admitting to stabbing Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   But the indictments were later thrown out or dismissed by
prosecutors after a Santa Barbara County judge found the Ventura
County Grand Jury contained too few women and was therefore
"defective."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Callahan's lawyer pushed to have the charges against
her dismissed, arguing that prosecutors deceived her with false
promises of immunity. That prompted the state attorney general to try
the case.</TE>
<TE>   During a court hearing in July, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh, who
had handled the case earlier, testified that authorities knew
Callahan was a murder suspect but continued to treat her as a witness
without informing her she was a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr.
found there was no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct and denied
the defense request to throw out the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has been subpoenaed as a defense witness. The defense also
intends to call a psychologist who examined Callahan last year and
concluded that she feared for her life as Hendrix was being killed in
the motel bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors called two witnesses Monday who testified that they
heard Callahan tell Ziesmer hours before the slaying that she had
drugged Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   According to their testimony, Callahan told Ziesmer: "I just gave
her some pills, and she should be knocked out soon."</TE>

<HD>Tom Dowd, 77; Music Producer and Engineer Behind Many
Popular Hits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Record producer and engineer Tom Dowd, who worked on the first atomic
bomb before turning to the mushroom-cloud explosion of rock 'n' roll,
died Sunday at an assisted living facility in Aventura, north of
Miami in South Florida. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Dowd, whom Eric Clapton once described as "the ideal recording
man," helped create many of the most popular and influential rock,
soul, R&amp;B and jazz records of the postwar era.</LD>
<LD>   Among the artists whose recordings Dowd worked on during a quarter
century as a staff engineer with Atlantic Records were the Allman
Brothers Band, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Aretha Franklin,
Charles Mingus and Sam &amp; Dave.</LD>
<TE>   Hit songs he engineered or produced date virtually from the
beginning of the rock era, from Bobby Darin's "Splish Splash," Ray
Charles' "What'd I Say" and Ben E. King's "Stand By Me" to Derek &amp;
the Dominos' "Layla" and Rod Stewart's "Tonight's the Night."</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Dowd was so germane, so organically tied into the work that
in all my years of producing I never put my hands on the [sound
mixing] board," veteran producer Jerry Wexler said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd took a special interest in working with young musicians
trying to establish a voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I see young bands go wrong is when they get confused about
what direction to take all these influences in, chasing success
rather than being devoted to the music," Dowd told the South Florida
Sun-Sentinel in 1996. "You have to do your homework of American roots
music and not copy what's on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   Dowd also was known for "always having a smile," Wexler said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell how much he loved music," Lee Loughnane of the
rock group Chicago said Monday. "He just lit up in the studio. It was
his passion."</TE>
<TE>   Dowd grew up in Manhattan in a musical family. His father produced
theater, including many musicals; his mother was a classically
trained singer who by turns urged him to study violin and piano.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't stick with either instrument, but learned to read and
write music, an ability that later came into use working with rock
and R&amp;B musicians who often could do neither.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, at age 16, he started working odd jobs in the physics
department at Columbia University, and soon found himself helping
operate a cyclotron, a particle accelerator used in the creation of
nuclear reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd went through Army basic training, and was sent back to
Columbia to continue working with the researchers who were developing
the atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   But when he learned that he couldn't translate his experience into
college credit toward a nuclear physics degree because everything was
still top secret, he took a job in 1947 with the Carl Fleischer music
publishing company, which also owned a small recording studio.</TE>
<TE>   With his background in physics, Dowd quickly took to the technical
aspects of recording and applied his knowledge to improving the
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   He helped Atlantic Records become the first company to use
eight-track stereo recording equipment in an era when monaural,
single-track recording was the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd soon was working with the early R&amp;B, jazz and pre-rock acts
that the fledgling label was recording, and was hired as a staff
engineer in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   He helped the company establish a signature sound that was crisp,
clean and powerful, in contrast to the often sloppy, raw recordings
more typical at the dawn of rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   "Atlantic had true stereo in its vaults three to four years before
anybody else, and that was Tom, absolutely," Wexler said.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd was elected to the Technical Excellence and Creativity Hall
of Fame in 1999, joining Beatles producer George Martin, Phil
Spector, Frank Zappa and Sun Records founder Sam Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences gave Dowd its Trustees Award.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my classmates died in World War II," he told the Miami
Herald in 1996. "I survived atomic bombs. I survived 50 years in the
music business. I'm happy with everything I've done. It's been a
wonderful life."</TE>
<TE>   Dowd is survived by his wife, Cheryl; daughter, Dana; and sons,
Steven and Todd.</TE>

<HD>Decision on Closing Hospitals Delayed</HD>
<DH>County supervisors, who were to vote today on health-care
cuts, bow to widespread criticism.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials opted Monday to delay a vote
scheduled for today on whether to close two of the county's four
full-service public hospitals, despite earlier pledges to address the
issue immediately because of a looming deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors had been set to vote on whether to turn
Olive View-UCLA and Harbor-UCLA medical centers into outpatient
facilities but backed off amid unwavering criticism from other
politicians, medical groups and patients' advocates.</LD>
<LD>   Just a week ago, a board majority said supervisors would resist
such pressure and proceed with the vote because the Department of
Health Services faces a shortfall of $500 million to $750 million in
three years.</LD>
<TE>   Under a proposal released late Monday, the health department wants
the vote rescheduled for Nov. 19. Supervisors still are expected to
discuss a recommendation today to reduce the county's flagship
County-USC Medical Center from 745 to 695 beds.</TE>
<TE>   The board also will consider a recommendation to close Rancho Los
Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, a nationally recognized
rehabilitation hospital in Downey that treats about 42,000 people
annually. Many have severe trauma injuries and disabilities and about
30% are indigent.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors have repeatedly postponed major cuts to the county's
health-care system, despite demands for reform from the federal
government, which has provided more than $2 billion in bailouts since
the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had five years to begin those cuts," Supervisor Michael
Antonovich said last week. "Every day that we delay means dollars
being taken out of other vital services."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, the new director of the Department of
Health Services, said Monday that this latest delay is prudent
because several efforts are underway to improve the health
department's financial prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to see two of our hospitals close, so I feel like
it's to all of our advantages to explore every avenue to see if we
can prevent that," Garthwaite said. "If these were hospitals with a
lot of vacant beds, I wouldn't be telling you that. We want to
continue to deliver care."</TE>
<TE>   One partial solution rests with county voters next Tuesday,
Garthwaite said. They are being asked to approve a parcel tax that
would pump $168 million annually into the county's emergency- and
trauma-care system. If approved, the tax would cost the owner of an
average-sized property -- about 1,400 square feet -- $42.66 a year.</TE>
<TE>   One day after the election, Garthwaite said, a top federal health
official, Tom Scully, is to visit Harbor-UCLA near Torrance and to
meet with county officials to discuss possible financial assistance.
Scully, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
Services, has said he opposes the county's current request for a
$1.4-billion bailout, but he is open to giving some help.</TE>
<TE>   Scully had asked supervisors to delay today's vote, saying in a
recent interview that it was "an artificial date picked for
artificial reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, too, supported a postponement of decisions on
hospital closings. He has said that he will decide next month whether
to call a special legislative session to discuss the county's
health-care deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe, who asked to delay the vote, said he was
pleased that county officials would have time to explore their
options without the cloud of closings hanging over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of things going on that we don't know the results
of yet," Knabe said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who last week opposed any delays, said
he had been assured by county health department officials that the
postponement won't add to the deficit. But if voters approve the
parcel tax, known as Measure B, they could save both Harbor and Olive
View, Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B, he said, appears short of the two-thirds support it
needs to pass, but polling shows it is "within striking distance."</TE>
<TE>   In June, the supervisors approved an initial round of health
department cuts, closing 11 health centers and four school-based
clinics. Supervisors also cut public-health spending by about 10% and
agreed to convert High Desert Hospital in the Antelope Valley into an
outpatient clinic in May 2003.</TE>
<TE>   At two news conferences Monday, elected officials implored
supervisors not to proceed as scheduled with more severe cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking outside Olive View's emergency room in Sylmar,
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) said that any closing would
only create more chaos at other emergency facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The county's financial plight not only threatens the health of
millions of low-income residents who depend upon it for care, it also
puts a heavy strain on Southern California's private health-care
system," said Richman, a physician.</TE>
<TE>   A vote to close Harbor-UCLA and Olive View would have been
"foolhardy, shortsighted and, in my view, really frankly
irresponsible," said Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach) at a
separate news conference outside the county Hall of Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn said that closing two
major hospitals would have discouraged voters from approving Measure
B.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not begin pulling the plug on this system," she said.
"Let's give it life support. Let's wait for things to work before we
begin specifically naming hospitals that will close."</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY CAMPAIGN</KH>
<HD>Paper Launches Drive to Help Less Fortunate</HD>
<DH>No administrative fees means all money goes to local
charities, which report a great need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a tough economy increases demand for food, housing and health
services, the Los Angeles Times this week launches its annual Holiday
Campaign to raise funds for Southern California charities that help
needy children and families.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next several weeks, The Times will run articles about
disadvantaged families, many stretched to the breaking point by job
losses, health woes, depressed wages and other social ills. Other
stories will spotlight the growing demand on charitable agencies at a
time when their funding has been pinched by the impact of stock
market losses, government cutbacks and other economic forces.</LD>
<LD>   The Times Holiday Campaign, established in 2000, is part of the
Los Angeles Times Family Fund and is administered by the McCormick
Tribune Foundation. The foundation will match the first $700,000
raised at 50 cents on the dollar and The Times will absorb
administrative costs for the campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the public's donations to the holiday appeal and the
matching funds raised $653,000 for 56 agencies in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties to help
provide services for, among others, mentally and physically disabled
children, early childhood literacy programs, teen parenting, and drug
and alcohol abuse prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Organizations that received grants last year include Covenant
House California, Devonshire Police Activity League Supporter, Orange
County Child Abuse Prevention and Special Olympics Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "A donation to the Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign will help
nonprofit organizations in Southern California provide food, clothing
and shelter to disadvantaged children and youth," noted Times
Publisher John Puerner.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's airline, hotel and restaurant industries are
struggling to recover after the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks. Thousands
of workers have exhausted savings and remain unemployed or are
marginally employed.</TE>
<TE>   The region's high cost of living, particularly in housing, is
forcing many families to make sacrifices when buying food, paying
monthly bills and seeing doctors, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, economic reports have charted declines in the
purchasing power of those earning the minimum wage, increases in
health insurance premiums and mortgage foreclosures at a 30-year
high. In addition, declines in business investment and steep stock
market losses are stunting private and corporate charity giving.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, we saw a 25% increase in demand at the food
pantries we serve, and that has barely slackened," said Bruce Rankin,
executive director of the Westside Food Bank, which received a $7,000
Times Holiday Campaign grant last year.</TE>
<TE>   That helped fill the gap caused by a drop in donations from some
past supporters, a decline that is exacerbated this year by the loss
of other corporate giving, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Arriola, director of government and public relation at
Northeast Valley Health Corp., which was awarded a $5,000 Times
Holiday Campaign grant last year, said Los Angeles County's closure
of several community health clinics, including ones in Burbank and
North Hollywood, has increased demand for free or low-cost care at
the clinics her agency runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to see, during the holidays, that families make a choice
of going to the doctor or buying a little gift or having a little
something extra on the table, so our visits decline. But in January,
they shoot up again," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Holiday Campaign will accept applications from charities
until Jan. 15, said Giselle Acevedo-Franco, the newspaper's vice
president of public affairs and president of the Los Angeles Times
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Procedures call for eligible applicants to be visited and their
financial statements examined.</TE>
<TE>   Final choices are made by the McCormick Tribune Foundation board
of directors in Chicago. The checks will be presented in July.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a really hard year," said Najeeba Syeed-Miller,
executive director of the Asian Pacific American Dispute Resolution
Center of Los Angeles, which provides peer mediation services to
youth. "But every little bit counts," she added. The nonprofit
organization received $15,000 from last year's campaign.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Is Arrested in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Long Beach man is accused in the beating and stabbing of
his girlfriend. He turns himself in and seeks treatment for wounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Spanish teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School was arrested Monday
night on suspicion of fatally beating and stabbing his 19-year-old
girlfriend, a recent graduate of the Long Beach school.</LD>
<LD>   Pedro Tepoz Leon, 34, was wounded and bleeding when he pulled
behind an officer on Interstate 80 near Vacaville and asked for help.
Leon, suffering stab wounds in the neck and upper torso, told the
officer that he had been involved in an assault in Long Beach, said
Long Beach police spokeswoman Jana Blair.</LD>
<LD>   Police had been searching Monday for Leon in connection with the
death of Mayra Mora in their apartment in the 1900 block of East 1st
Street in Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The officer in Vacaville contacted Long Beach police, who
instructed the officer to arrest Leon, who later was in stable
condition at a hospital. Blair said police did not know how he was
stabbed. "It's unclear if the stab wound came during the assault or
was self-inflicted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police learned of Mora's death after responding to an emergency
call placed about 8 p.m. Sunday by a possible witness at the
apartment building. Mora had suffered blunt force trauma to the body
and stab wounds to the torso.</TE>
<TE>   "It appeared as though the crime had been committed sometime
between Friday and Sunday," police spokeswoman Nancy Pratt said.
"Detectives believe Leon is the person responsible for her death."</TE>
<TE>   As a high school senior last year, Mora was a member of the
school's Latin American Club, which was co-sponsored by Leon. Both
teacher and student were described as easygoing and popular.</TE>
<TE>   Mora, who graduated from Wilson High in June, was an active member
of the beginning dance club, the Latino Club and Senior Women. Fellow
students remembered her as outgoing and upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   Kimi Ballestan, 16, who was in an English class with Mora,
recalled that "she really cared about her grades." "For me, she was
wonderful," she said. "She was always trying to lift our spirits when
we were feeling down."</TE>
<TE>   Leon was described as having an easy rapport with students. One
student, who did not want to be named, described Leon as "cool."
"We'd go to his house and hang out."</TE>
<TE>   Brenden Burley, 17, agreed and added that "he's kind of like a
teacher -- and a student. He acted like one of us."</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Police Department had dispatched an advisory
notifying law enforcement agencies across the nation that they are
looking for Leon and his SUV.</TE>
<TE>   "We're characterizing it as domestic violence," Blair said, "but
we don't know what set off the assault."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said Leon failed to show up for work Friday and
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a no call, no show," Assistant Principal Sandra Blazer
said. "We called his home to find out why he had not come to work,
and there was no answer."</TE>
<TE>   Blazer's duties Monday included counseling teachers at the
4,330-student campus who were distraught over the news.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Unified School District spokesman Richard Van Der Laan
said, "We are deeply saddened."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody hopes it's not true, that maybe there is something else
we need to know about all this," he said. "But right now, it doesn't
look good."</TE>
<TE>   Van Der Laan added, "We are cooperating fully with the Police
Department in their investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Leon, who joined the school district in 1996, taught first- and
second-grade bilingual education courses at King Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   He then moved to Wilson High, where he taught Spanish for two
years on a temporary contract basis, Blazer said. Leon has been a
regular Spanish teacher since 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, he was a boys soccer coach on an extra assignment
basis," Blazer said, "and the year before that a girls soccer coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We've not had any complaints about him. Our performance
evaluations indicate that he was a satisfactory teacher."</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear when Leon began a relationship with
Mora. Neither school officials nor students interviewed Monday were
aware of the intimacy between the two.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment they rented is on a tidy, tree-lined street near a
park. "They moved in about three months ago," said a tenant who lives
a few doors down.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have much," said the tenant, who declined to be
named. "I saw them take in a futon, a computer and a television. We
didn't know much about them until the police came to our door Sunday
night."</TE>

<HD>Mildred L. Lillie, 87; Appeals Court Justice, Pioneer in
Legal Field</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justice Mildred L. Lillie, who was believed to be California's
longest-serving appellate justice and who was once considered for
appointment as the first female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court,
has died. She was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Lillie, whose name appears on the Nov. 5 ballot as presiding
justice of a section of the Los Angeles-based 2nd District Court of
Appeal, died early Sunday in St. Vincent Medical Center in Los
Angeles. Justice Earl Johnson Jr., her colleague on the court's
Division 7, said that no specific cause of death had been given but
that Lillie had been hospitalized for about six weeks for problems
with balance and lightheadedness.</LD>
<LD>   Any vacancy on the state appellate court is filled by
gubernatorial appointment, and Lillie's death will not affect the
election. State Supreme Court and appellate court justices are
subject only to periodic votes of "yes" or "no" as to whether they
should be retained in office. They face no opponents.</LD>
<TE>   "I am hopeful that she will be retained," Johnson said Monday.
"Her performance certainly deserves it, and that would be a good
tribute to her memory."</TE>
<TE>   The Times had endorsed Lillie, who also was believed to be Los
Angeles County's longest-serving judge, with a total of 55 years on
the Municipal, Superior and appellate courts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that, as a justice, Lillie "was both wise and very
hard-working, committed to doing the best possible job in every case.
She was very balanced, very middle of the road."</TE>
<TE>   He said Lillie had conducted their panel's hearings in August and
carried a full workload until she was hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her courtroom work, Lillie for many years served as
the administrative presiding judge of the entire 2nd District, which
includes seven four-judge panels.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement Monday calling Lillie "a true
California treasure -- a pioneer for women in the legal field and an
institution in our courts."</TE>
<TE>   "She served longer than any judge on any California court today
and she was the longest-serving appellate justice in the history of
our state," Davis said, adding that Lillie had served through the
terms of eight governors and had written more than 3,000 opinions.</TE>
<TE>   A Democrat, Lillie was considered so "eminently fair," as one
Republican put it, that she received all her appointments to the
bench from Republicans. She was named to the Los Angeles County
Municipal Court in 1947 and elevated to the Los Angeles County
Superior Court two years later by Gov. Earl Warren.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, Gov. Goodwin Knight appointed her to the Court of Appeal,
and in 1971 President Nixon proposed her as the first female justice
in history for the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   That appointment got derailed, however, after a 12-member
judiciary committee of the American Bar Assn. on Oct. 20, 1971, ruled
that Lillie was "not qualified" to sit on the country's highest
court. The 12 male lawyers, whose opinion was not binding on Nixon
but who certainly influenced him, said Lillie, who had by then
presided over various courts for 24 years, lacked experience. A day
later, Nixon announced his appointment of William Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   Lillie and her colleagues attributed the negative ABA rating to
her being a woman and to the belief of male lawyers in those years
that women were too emotional to sit on the Supreme Court. That
conclusion is borne out by the former Nixon White House counsel, John
Dean, in his recently published book, "The Rehnquist Choice: The
Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment That Redefined the Supreme
Court." (It would be another decade before Sandra Day O'Connor became
the first female Supreme Court justice in 1981.)</TE>
<TE>   Born Mildred Loree Kluckhohn in Ida Grove, Iowa, she moved to
Central California with her parents when she was 3 and grew up on a
farm, picking, sorting and packing fruit. Defying her parents to
pursue a law career -- her mother wanted her to be a commercial
artist, her father favored "something practical" -- she worked her
way through UC Berkeley and its law school.</TE>
<TE>   Her first job as a lawyer was as a deputy city attorney in
Alameda, Calif. She practiced privately in Fresno from 1938 to 1942
and then moved south to become an assistant U.S. attorney in the Los
Angeles district. In 1947, she married attorney Cameron L. Lillie,
who died in 1959, and afterward adopted his surname as her permanent
professional name. Her second husband was A.V. Falcone, to whom she
was married from 1966 until his death in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout her career, Lillie achieved countless firsts, not only
as the first woman to occupy certain positions, but often as the
youngest as well.</TE>
<TE>   When Warren named her to the Municipal Court, she was 32. Two
years later, she became the youngest person appointed to the Superior
Court in California.</TE>
<TE>   On that court, she became the first woman to preside over its
domestic relations department and in 1953 the first woman and the
youngest judge to preside over the court's mammoth Criminal Division.
Because of her stature when few women were lawyers, she was profiled
in such national magazines as Colliers and Mademoiselle.</TE>
<TE>   When Knight named Lillie to the Court of Appeal, she was not the
first woman to reach that level. Gov. Cuthbert Olson had appointed
Annette Abbott Adams to the court's Sacramento district in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   But Lillie is believed to have been the longest-serving justice of
either sex on the statewide Court of Appeal in history -- 44 years.
She served on the 2nd District's Division 1 from 1958 until 1984 when
she was named presiding judge of the then two-year-old Division 7.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lillie's courtroom presence could be stern, and she
quickly lectured any lawyer who was disrespectful or unprepared for
court, she was considered warm and witty off duty.</TE>
<TE>   She always listed her hobbies as writing and cooking, and was
equally praised for her impeccably drafted legal opinions and her
birthday cakes and dessert recipes.</TE>
<TE>   Lillie is survived by two stepchildren, Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Dewey Falcone and Dolores Metzger; four
step-grandchildren; and one step-great-grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will preside at her funeral at 1 p.m.
Wednesday at the Church of the Good Shepherd, 505 N. Bedford Drive,
Beverly Hills. Burial will be at Holy Cross Cemetery, 5835 Slauson
Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations can be made to Catholic Charities of Los
Angeles, 1531 W. James M. Wood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90015.</TE>

<HD>John Lucas, 83; Writer, Director for 1950s-'70s TV Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Meredyth Lucas, who wrote for such classic television series as
the original "Star Trek" and such films as the 1950 "Dark City,"
which marked Charlton Heston's Hollywood debut, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas, who was also a producer and director, died Oct. 19 in Los
Angeles of leukemia, said his daughter, Victoria Lucas.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a show business family, Lucas incorporated his varied
interests into scripts, specializing in medical shows, mysteries and
science fiction.</LD>
<TE>   He wrote and directed several episodes of the pioneering
television realism show "Medic," which starred Richard Boone as Dr.
Konrad Styner, and aired from 1954 to 1956. Filmed in hospitals with
actual doctors and nurses treating patients, the series was based on
case histories from the files of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Lucas went on to write and produce the popular
fictional medical series "Ben Casey" and followed with the
long-running "Medical Center."</TE>
<TE>   For Lucas, writing, directing and producing were happily
intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the most important thing for a producer to be is a
writer," he told The Times in 1965, when he was writing episodes and
producing "Ben Casey," "because everything we do begins with writing.
It's so much better if the producer knows how to work with a script.
Then he's more than just a critic; he can actually help mold the raw
material.</TE>
<TE>   "A good director can make a bad script interesting," he added. "A
bad director can pretty effectively destroy the greatest script ever
written."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas was born to all three roles, as the son of Wilfred Lucas,
one of Hollywood's early actor-director-producers, and Bess Meredyth,
screenwriter for such films as the 1925 version of "Ben-Hur" and the
1926 "Don Juan." Lucas' mother subsequently married Michael Curtiz,
director of such classic films as "Casablanca."</TE>
<TE>   Curtiz, who adopted Lucas, gave him his first job as his script
clerk. Lucas quickly graduated to writing and also founded the
Gryphon Players at the Laguna Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Among the mystery television series Lucas worked on were "The
Fugitive," "Mannix" and "Quincy."</TE>
<TE>   Science fiction series for Lucas included not only the seminal
"Star Trek," but also Rod Serling's "Night Gallery," the TV version
of "Planet of the Apes" and "The Six Million Dollar Man." Lucas also
teamed up with producer Irwin Allen to do the television movie "City
Beneath the Sea" and for Disney wrote and directed one of the first
behind-the-scenes documentaries, "The Making of '20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lucas' first wife was the late actress Joan Winfield.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 24 years, Patricia Kay Lucas, and
three children, Elizabeth, Victoria and Michael Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be private. The family has asked that memorial
donations be made to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund, 22212
Ventura Blvd., Suite 300, Woodland Hills, 91364.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Man Is Fatally Stabbed at Series Tailgate
Party</HD>
<DH>He is attacked in an Edison Field parking lot and found a
few blocks from the stadium. Few other disturbances reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid otherwise orderly World Series celebrations, a Garden Grove man
was fatally stabbed during a tailgate party in the parking lot of
Edison International Field, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Leopoldo "Polo" Bastida -- described by his family as
a lifelong Angels fan -- was found a few blocks from the ballpark
about 9 p.m. Sunday, just after the team defeated the San Francisco
Giants in Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   A man directing stadium traffic dialed 911 after he saw Bastida
bleeding near a commercial strip on West Orangewood Avenue. Police
identified Bastida, 27, as a gang member who spent most of his adult
life in and out of incarceration.</LD>
<TE>   The slaying was the one dark spot in what police said was a
largely peaceful celebration. A few revelers ignited trash cans and
tried to overturn cars, but further disobedience was quickly thwarted
by police. A few fans who ran onto the field after the game were
booked for trespassing.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Bastida's body was shirtless but released few
other details. Authorities, who had no suspects or motive, asked
witnesses to help them piece together what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been anything -- a fan dispute, an argument over a
girl, a drunken brawl, or gang-related. We don't know," said Lt. Mike
Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   Records from the California Department of Corrections show that
over the last 10 years Bastida was sentenced to five years for
assault with a firearm, and 16 months for weapons possession.</TE>
<TE>   In Garden Grove, where Bastida has lived for the last 15 years,
the Police Department's gang unit had numerous run-ins with him
involving drugs and weapons, said Lt. Scott Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives who gathered at Bastida's home Monday said he attended
many Angel games. His mother said her son, the oldest of her three
children, gave her a kiss and a hug before he left their home with a
friend Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened last night should have never happened," said Amparo
Bastida, 50, holding back tears. "To me, he was a good kid."</TE>
<TE>   Bastida had called his girlfriend just hours before his body was
found and asked her to meet him, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Bastida's relatives urged anyone with information to come forward.
"There were so many people there," said Gina Collazo, who is married
to Bastida's cousin. "It's hard to believe no one saw anything."</TE>

<HD>Growth Issue Looms Large in Ojai Race</HD>
<DH>Four City Council candidates oppose the controversial
ballot initiative intended to limit traffic, while two support it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mention Measure C in normally peaceful Ojai and everyone from artists
to average Joes chooses up sides.</LD>
<LD>   The Nov. 5 ballot initiative limiting growth and traffic has
framed the debate in a highly competitive City Council race, in which
six candidates vie for three seats.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbents David Bury and Joe DeVito, along with challengers Paul
Blatz and Bruce Roland, oppose Measure C. Challengers Leonard Klaif
and Carol Smith support it. The current City Council opposes the
measure as unduly restrictive.</LD>
<TE>   With huge oaks, towering mountains and fragrant citrus groves so
central to the town's ambience, any threat to Ojai's tourist allure
becomes a magnet for controversy. And Measure C proves the point.</TE>
<TE>   Backers say the measure would ensure new construction doesn't
overwhelm Ojai's compact road system, which already strains to handle
the crush of cars during rush hours and on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the measure would limit growth to the detriment of
all and that only wealthy developers who could afford to pay for
special traffic-thinning measures would still be able to build in
Ojai. Crowded out of that equation, they say, would be nonprofit
organizations and small builders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the initiative of unintended consequences," said Tim Dewar,
a Humane Society of Ventura County official and spokesman for Ojai
Citizens Against Measure C.</TE>
<TE>   Ojai, a tourist town of 7,800 residents -- a fifth of them senior
citizens -- already has the slowest population growth rate in Ventura
County, expanding by 0.3% in the past decade. Measure C could slow
that even further.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, written by the environmental group Citizens to
Preserve the Ojai, requires the City Council to reject any new
projects that would increase traffic beyond set levels. Single-family
homes on existing lots would be exempt from the new rule, but
so-called affordable housing projects would not be.</TE>
<TE>   Developers could still build if they were able to mitigate for new
traffic -- so their projects would not reduce traffic flow on nearby
streets to a worse level of congestion. Traffic flow is divided into
five levels, with free-flowing the best and virtual gridlock the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   Residents could still get popular projects built -- but only by a
public vote to lower the city's traffic standards, the initiative
says.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say neither scenario is likely to occur, and no growth
would be the result.</TE>
<TE>   But Stan Greene, administrative director of Citizens to Preserve
the Ojai, said the initiative won't stop the kind of growth that's
good for the community. The initiative is necessary, he maintains,
because the City Council isn't doing enough to keep traffic
congestion from getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   The council makes too many exceptions to city traffic guidelines
when it wants to pass pet projects, Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   But City Manager Dan Singer said proposals are already weighed on
their individual merits, and Measure C would make it "difficult, if
not impossible" to continue such subjective evaluations by the
council.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the council, Mayor Steve Olsen -- who is not running
for reelection -- described the initiative as "draconian," and almost
a full moratorium on growth.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen said it might solve a few traffic problems on Ojai's
often-crowded streets, but at the expense of important projects such
as expansions at Ojai Valley Community Hospital, the Ojai Library and
badly needed affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Dewar said Measure C would also discourage new businesses and
drive up home prices.</TE>
<TE>   Greene insists that the library and hospital projects would not
change the level of traffic on nearby streets, so they could go
forward anyway. And if significant community projects are proposed in
the future that would worsen traffic flow levels, voters could then
approve a different traffic standard.</TE>
<TE>   "That type of discussion is like a poster boy -- everybody wants a
hospital or library," Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen said traffic formulas show that if a library expands even by
1,000 square feet, more vehicles drive to it. And that could trigger
Measure C's limits.</TE>
<TE>   Physician Martin Pops, vice chairman of the Ojai Valley Community
Hospital Foundation, said the hospital plans to expand its tiny
emergency room to four times its current size. And Measure C could
undercut that effort, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The population of Ojai is growing older; more and more seniors
are going to be developing chronic health-care problems," Pops said.
"We will need more nursing home care."</TE>
<TE>   The board of the nonprofit hospital cannot officially take a stand
on the measure, but some officials privately said they oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   Singer also said that even luxury residential projects, such as
the 23-unit Los Arboles Townhomes, underway but temporarily halted
next to downtown's Libbey Park, could not be approved under Measure
C. That's because developers would likely not be able to meet traffic
mitigation requirements, the city manager said.</TE>
<TE>   Greene counters that any projects could be built as long as they
address their traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   Even if voters approve Measure C, it might face other obstacles.
City officials say that new state laws show a trend toward taking
control away from cities and giving it to the state for approving
low- and moderate-income housing. If a city's laws conflict with the
state, it might open itself up to a developer's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   William Fulton, a Ventura-based urban planning expert, also said
that if Measure C is approved, a court could deem it invalid, based
on state environmental laws that allow voters to make policy, but not
administrative decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument would be that giving the voters the option to
determine the levels of [traffic] would be too much of an intrusion
into the administrative realm," Fulton said.</TE>

<HD>Latino, Asian Voters Get Extra County Help</HD>
<DH>More languages and polling places are added in voter
outreach effort. But problems remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran and Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County has overhauled its voter outreach program, adding
polling places and more languages and bilingual workers since the
March primary election. The move came after the U.S. Census recorded
a surge in Latino and Asian populations in the county.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County registrar of voters has added more than 300
polling sites and hired 1,000 bilingual poll workers for the Nov. 5
election, officials said. Officials have also increased the stipend
to $70 in an effort to lure more of them.</LD>
<LD>   "We were not doing a good job of getting poll workers to show up
at the polls," especially bilingual workers, said Registrar Rosalyn
Lever.</LD>
<TE>   The agency's effort come after officials reviewed results from the
2000 census released earlier this year. The census documented growing
enclaves of Latinos, Vietnamese, Chinese and Koreans in Orange
County. In the last decade, the county's Latino population grew by
46% and now accounts for at least 28% of Orange County's 2.8 million
residents. The number of Asian Americans rose by 63% -- mostly
Vietnamese, Chinese and Koreans -- and now make up at least 14% of
the population.</TE>
<TE>   The changes by the registrar are in line with mandates by the
California secretary of state that require counties to make voting
more accessible to all ethnic and racial groups .</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, Orange County will add 288 Spanish bilingual polling
places. About 50 more bilingual polling sites were assigned for other
languages, particularly Vietnamese. But finding committed poll
workers there is not easy, Lever said.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Spanish-speaking voters, the county has a
different problem. There are many volunteers in central Orange
County, but not enough in newer Latino areas such as San Clemente,
San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the county is adding Korean and Chinese
language ballots, at a cost of about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that though the changes have merit, the registrar has
not corrected previous problems, such as bad translations and tardy
voter information.</TE>
<TE>   A Latino civic organization has even requested that the Orange
County Grand Jury investigate what they say are persistent problems
in the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, said a member
of his group asked for sample ballots in Chinese, Korean, Spanish and
Vietnamese on Oct. 7, the day absentee voting began for the general
election. The member was told none were available, David said.</TE>
<TE>   "With every passing day, the voting rights of thousands of Orange
Countians in these language communities are being impaired," David
wrote in a letter to the grand jury dated Oct. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Registrar Suzanne Slupsky said the sample ballots take
time to translate. They were available in early October, but Slupsky
did not say what day they were sent out.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnamese voters also have complained about their election
materials.</TE>
<TE>   During the March primary, voter pamphlets with Vietnamese
translations had nontraditional idioms, misspelled words, improper
accent marks and were so vague that the information was nearly
impossible to understand, voter groups complained.</TE>
<TE>   "The words looked like Vietnamese, but they have no meaning. It's
nonsense. The people they used to translate didn't use the right
terms and expressions," said Vietnamese American Voters Coalition
director Chuyen V. Nguyen, who complained formally to Lever's office
following the March primary.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no quality control with the Vietnamese translation,"
Nguyen said.</TE>
<TE>   For the November ballot, Nguyen said, translations are better but
still have problems.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on voter registration forms which ask, "Are you a
U.S. citizen?" the Vietnamese version of "yes" and "no" are
misspelled and have improper accent marks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lever said more bilingual poll workers will be in place to help
Vietnamese-speakers -- and Spanish speakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Voting can be a daunting task, especially for first time voters
who don't speak fluent English," said community activist Linh Nguyen,
54. "With so many measures and propositions, voters need to have
someone who speaks their language to come and ask questions. Having
more bilingual poll workers is a step in the right direction."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Is Setting the Stage for World Series Celebration</HD>
<DH>Disney will host the champion Angels before and after
today's parade. About 300,000 are expected along the route.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino and Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It could be no other way. What are the Anaheim Angels going to do
now? Yup, Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' World Series victory Sunday ended a 42-year quest for
the team and its fans, who plan to cap the storybook season with
daylong celebrations today in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The festivities begin with a 10 a.m. trip down Disneyland's fabled
Main Street. The celebration will continue with an 11 a.m. parade
from Arrowhead Pond to Edison International Field, followed by a
rally in the parking lot. The planned events will end with an Angels
appearance at Disney's California Adventure from 3 to 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   City officials are anticipating 300,000 fans along the parade
route and the Edison Field parking lot. "This is the first party of
its kind in Anaheim," said city spokesman John Nicoletti.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney marketing, the World Championship is a bolt of
lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had something on this scale," said Disneyland
spokesman John McClintock. "It helps that they're right down the
street from us. It might not have been a big deal if it were not the
hometown team."</TE>
<TE>   But it is. And the hometown is pulling out all the stops.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at Edison Field were busy Monday building stages for
today's ceremony, which will include speeches from Angels Manager
Mike Scioscia and many of the players. Police and city officials were
holding last-minute planning meetings to throw the biggest party this
city has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   And many Angels fans, although tired from celebrating late into
the night Sunday, were still walking on air.</TE>
<TE>   The lines were long Monday at the team store at Edison Field,
where people were snatching up pennants, bright-red World
Championship T-shirts, rally monkeys and the black caps the players
wore during their champagne-soaked clubhouse celebration Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting 42 years," said Brad Farrell of Anaheim, who
trudged out of the store with $250 worth of souvenirs. "We want it to
last as long as possible."</TE>
<TE>   But the keepsakes Farrell is most proud of are three autographed
guitar picks given to him late Sunday in the parking lot by Angels
first baseman Scott Spiezio, who plays in a rock band on the side.
"That was a special memory for me and my son," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Lawton of Australia, who had booked a flight home Monday,
was cutting it close when he braved the long lines to buy World
Series souvenirs. He had caught the Angels bug while visiting
Disneyland and watched Game 7 from his hotel room. "This is history
in the making," Lawton said standing in the hourlong line to enter
the store.</TE>
<TE>   National television ratings for this California Series were the
lowest ever recorded for a World Series by Nielsen Media Research,
but many who watched said the it had all the drama of baseball's best
matchup. For Anaheim, the smallest city with its name on a Major
League jersey, the Series was a chance for recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the creation of a suburban legend. And legends are what make
places what they are," said baseball lover Scott Bollens, a UC Irvine
urban and regional planning professor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's putting Anaheim on the map."</TE>
<TE>   The focus on the Angels is also redefining people's views and
stereotypes of Orange County, said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at
the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University.
"It's forced the haughty and more arrogant L.A. people to recognize
that Orange County has a lot to offer, as well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The national media have also been forced to examine outdated views
of Orange County "as a combination of right-wing, John Wayne guys
with shotguns on the one hand and a bunch of airheaded blonds on the
other," Kotkin said. "I think there's a sense that Orange County is a
more sophisticated place. In a way, the Angels themselves represent
Orange County's best image of itself -- tolerant, earnest and
hard-working."</TE>
<TE>   Today, thousands of people are expected to line Katella Avenue and
pack the Edison Field parking lot to thank the team for an
unforgettable season.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds are expected to form early and police urged people to
carpool, bike, walk or take public transportation because of limited
parking.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about these kinds of numbers, you talk about a
once-in-a-lifetime celebration," Nicoletti, the city spokesman, said.
"Unless the Angels win another World Series -- then it's
twice-in-a-lifetime."</TE>

<HD>Marianne Hoppe, 93; German Actress' Career Spanned Eight
Decades</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marianne Hoppe, 93, a leading actress on the German stage through
much of the 20th century, died Wednesday in Berlin of unspecified
causes.</LD>
<LD>   Hoppe's final performance was five years ago in Bertolt Brecht's
"The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui" at the Berliner Ensemble theater.
She had acted professionally since age 17, when she won a place at
Berlin's Deutsches Theater under director Max Reinhardt. She also
worked frequently for director Gustaf Gruendgens, to whom she was
married for 10 years, at Berlin's Schauspielhaus.</LD>
<LD>   Although Hoppe never worked or lived in Hollywood, many of her
films were released in the United States. Among them were her debut
picture, Franz Osten's "Judas of Tyrol" in 1933 and Harald Reinl's
western, "Treasure of Silver Lake," in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1930s and '40s, Hoppe had many contacts with the Nazi elite
and was invited to dinner by Adolf Hitler. Her career spanned and
survived the Nazi era; after Germany's defeat in World War II, she
continued performing in theaters in Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin.</TE>

<LD>William Lewis Beale Jr., 97, chief of the Associated Press Washington
bureau from 1948 to 1969 who directed coverage of about a dozen

<LD>Jacques Massu, 94, a retired general who led French forces to victory
in the 1957 Battle of Algiers and later expressed regret for his part
in torturing opponents in the independence war, died of undisclosed
causes Saturday at his home in Conflans-sur-Loing, France.</LD>
<LD>   Massu rose to military prominence during World War II, after
following Gen. Charles de Gaulle's call to resist the pro-Nazi Vichy
government in France in June 1940. Before rising to the rank of
general in 1955, Massu fought in Chad, Tunisia, Vietnam and other
operations in the former French colonies across Africa and Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Massu's leading of French troops in the Battle of Algiers was a
pivotal point in the war that ended with Algeria's independence from
France.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with Le Monde in 2000, Massu said he regretted the
practice of torture and summary executions during the war.</TE>

<DH>A warrant is issued for Sigfried Frank Widera, who served
in Anaheim and Yorba Linda. He previously had been convicted in
Wisconsin.</DH>

<LD>Orange County prosecutors issued an arrest warrant Monday for a
priest formerly of Orange County, charging him with 33 felony counts
of child molestation involving four boys from 1978 to 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Sigfried Frank Widera has been a fugitive since May, when
Milwaukee authorities filed nine felony sexual abuse charges against
him for acts allegedly committed in the early 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they don't know where Widera is but said they
would seek $1 million bail if they capture him.</LD>
<TE>   The priest was moved from Milwaukee to Orange County in 1976 even
though he had been convicted of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange insists it was not aware of the conviction
when it hired Widera. The Milwaukee archdiocese did tell Orange
County church officials in a letter that Widera "had a moral problem
having to do with a boy in school" years earlier and that "more
recently ... there has been a repetition."</TE>
<TE>   Widera is the fourth Southern California priest or former cleric
to be criminally charged with molesting children since September.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents filed Monday, the Orange County
molestations took place when Widera was a priest at St. Justin Martyr
Church in Anaheim and St. Martin de Porres Church in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   Brea Police Det. Kortney Dodd, the lead investigator in the Orange
County cases, said she has been working on leads and interviewing
witnesses since May, when the first of the two alleged Yorba Linda
victims came forward. She informed one of the alleged victims about
the charges Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was happy," she said. The legal action represented a turning
point, Dodd said, for Widera's alleged victims "who've lived with
hell for all these years. Their final closure will be when he stands
before a judge. But just getting this far helps."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victims are listed as "John Does" in the criminal
complaint; The Times has a policy not to identify victims of
molestation unless given permission by the accusers.</TE>
<TE>   To track down Widera, Dodd is working with her counterparts in the
Police Department in West Allis, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee. She is
also asking that anyone with information about Widera's whereabouts,
including Widera's family, come forward. His last known address was
in Tucson, where he has family. He also has relatives in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Widera's flight also has frustrated the alleged victims and church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "From the victims' point of view, the arrest and conviction really
means more to them than the civil suit," said Irvine attorney
Katherine K. Freberg, who represents four men, including one from
Milwaukee, who say they were molested as boys by Widera. "I wish I
could literally go out and see the police handcuff the guy. That will
give us some sense of satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maria Schinderlev, a spokeswoman for the Orange diocese:
"We're sickened and saddened at the pain caused to the victims. We
have absolutely no idea where he is, and we would certainly cooperate
with law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Widera was stripped of his ability to function as a priest in
1986, shortly after a boy's mother complained to the Orange diocese
about an alleged molestation. Widera was sent to a New Mexico
treatment center for eight months. He has not been defrocked; he
still is a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Widera is the second priest in the 31-year history of the Orange
diocese to rack up multiple felony molestation charges.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Andrew Christian Anderson was convicted on 26 counts of
sexual abuse while a priest at St. Bonaventure Church in Huntington
Beach. He received a suspended six-year jail sentence and was placed
on five years' probation. However, the sentence was reinstated in
1990, when Albuquerque police arrested Anderson for allegedly forcing
a teenage boy into his car, assaulting him and attempting to sodomize
him.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a former Dana Point priest was arrested for allegedly
molesting a teenage girl who sang in the church choir.</TE>
<TE>   The latest felony charges further entangle the Orange and
Milwaukee dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Both defendants are named in a suit filed in May by an Orange man
who said he was sexually abused as a boy by Widera in 1985. He is one
of the alleged victims in the criminal case filed Monday. His civil
suit also accuses the bishops of Milwaukee and Orange, both now
deceased, of conspiring to move Widera, a convicted child molester,
to Orange County.</TE>

<HD>Testimony Begins in Ryder Trial</HD>
<DH>Saks security manager testifies that the actress told him
she shoplifted to prepare for a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Saks Fifth Avenue security manager testified Monday that actress
Winona Ryder admitted shoplifting and said she did so to train for a
future film role.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Evans, the first witness called to the stand at Ryder's
felony trial, told jurors she took his hand and politely apologized
for what she had done. "She just said she was doing what her director
told her to do in preparation for her role as a shoplifter," he told
jurors, in testimony that appeared to surprise the defense.</LD>
<LD>   Evans, a veteran employee at the tony Beverly Hills department
store, said that before calling police to take the high-profile
actress into custody, he consulted with Saks corporate officials.</LD>
<TE>   Evans, who will be cross-examined today, testified after both
sides delivered their opening statements in the case, which is
expected to continue for at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Ryder, 30, went to Saks with the intent to
shoplift, while her defense attorney said she was set up by "out of
control" security guards and never stole anything.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder watched intently, occasionally glancing back at her friends
and family in the courtroom. The star of such films as "Little Women"
and "Mr. Deeds" is accused of stealing $5,560.40 worth of merchandise
from the store on Dec. 12. She faces charges of grand theft, burglary
and vandalism and could be sentenced to three years in state prison
if convicted. She is free on $20,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Evans told jurors he first noticed Ryder because she was carrying
so many bags and seemed to have trouble holding all of them. At the
time, Evans said, he didn't realize who she was. When he found out,
he testified, "I couldn't care less." As Evans followed her route on
the security cameras, he said she visited several departments,
pulling items off racks and piling the merchandise on her arms.</TE>
<TE>   After she left the store, he testified, staffers stopped Ryder and
recovered items that hadn't been paid for, along with others she did
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors also began watching a highly publicized 90-minute
surveillance video, which shows Ryder wandering through the store
with several bags and stuffing socks and hair accessories in a hat.
During the video, Ryder is seen entering a dressing room -- where
there are no store cameras. Evans said his investigator, Colleen
Rainey, told him she saw Ryder cut sensor tags off several items
while she was in that dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   When asked why Evans didn't detain the actress at that point, he
said, "Until she exited the store, she still had an opportunity to
change her mind and say, 'I want to pay for it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he later found four sensor tags in the pocket of a
jacket in the Chanel department. The tags, which had material still
on them, matched items security investigators took from Ryder when
she was arrested, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During opening statements, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle told
jurors Ryder entered Saks Fifth Avenue equipped to shoplift, with
scissors to cut off sensor tags, a heavy garment bag to hide stolen
merchandise and tissue paper to wrap up clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "All this case amounts to is a simple case of theft -- nothing
more, nothing less," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle told jurors that Ryder bought four items the day she was
arrested, but that she stole more than 20, in her own "two-for-one
bonus program." Jurors will see the entire surveillance tape, which
Rundle said will show something "mysterious" happen to a red Saks bag
that contained a pair of shoes Ryder bought earlier in the day. "You
will begin to watch that shopping bag grow and grow," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle told the jurors Ryder walked out of the doors of the
department store with merchandise for which she had not paid. "That
is grand theft, no matter who you are," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos countered that his client was
innocent and that Saks security guards changed their stories after
prosecutors realized that the much-touted surveillance video did not
show Ryder snipping off tags. Geragos said all the video shows is
Ryder shopping, which caused the district attorney's office to panic
and ask Saks staff to come up with a new story.</TE>
<TE>   "They decided then to invent the story about Ms. Rainey," Geragos
said, warning jurors that the testimony they would hear from Saks
personnel would be "bald-faced lies."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder shops at Saks regularly, spending thousands of dollars every
month, and the store had her credit card on file, Geragos said. "This
is a case about a woman who has been wronged," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also told jurors that Ryder was treated "inexplicably" by
Saks staff, who threatened her and tried to lift her shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos objected to Evans' testimony about Ryder's alleged
admissions, saying the statement about a future film role had never
been disclosed prior to the trial. The objection was overruled.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox also held a closed meeting in
his chambers Monday morning with Ryder, attorneys on both sides and a
juror, former film studio head Peter Guber.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Guber told the judge that Sony Pictures Entertainment
produced one of Ryder's films while he headed the studio. The Times
reported Saturday that the studio oversaw the production of three of
her films.</TE>
<TE>   The news of Guber's selection for the jury astonished many in the
Hollywood creative community. A spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office declined to comment on why prosecutors chose to
impanel Guber. Defense attorney Geragos said it wasn't a problem for
prosecutors, and it wasn't a problem for him.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gill, a producer who had worked in marketing during Guber's
reign at Sony, said, "If the prosecutors had known everything that
those of us [in the entertainment industry] know about not only their
history but relationships in Hollywood, it wouldn't have happened. It
shows how divergent the universes are."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Pollock, the former studio chief of Universal Pictures and a
former top Hollywood attorney, said, "He's done three movies with her
and he could have a relationship with her going forward, so it's very
strange that he was chosen."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Medavoy, former studio chief at TriStar Pictures who worked
under Guber, said he was surprised, but was confident that Guber
would "judge it based on the facts presented."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, The Times, along with the Associated Press and the
Daily Journal, filed a writ with the state Court of Appeal,
requesting that transcripts of closed proceedings held last week by
Judge Fox be made public.</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Races Focus on Housing</HD>
<DH>Most candidates for mayor and council oppose Measure B,
which would stop expansion at city limits, slow other development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial Simi Valley ballot measure that would tighten city
growth boundaries is overshadowing races for mayor and City Council,
where three incumbents seek new terms Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Bill Davis is campaigning for a third two-year term against
two underfunded challengers, while Councilmen Paul Miller and Glen T.
Becerra are taking on a retired machinist and a city employee.</LD>
<LD>   If passed, Measure B -- the latest attempt to rein in urban growth
-- would stop expansion at existing city limits. Plans to build homes
or businesses in three rugged canyons nearby -- Alamos, Brea and
Runkle--would be blocked unless voters approved the projects in
future elections.</LD>
<TE>   Those canyons were included as prime growth areas on a successful
1998 ballot initiative. But since then, slow-growth advocates have
concluded the boundaries allow too much construction.</TE>
<TE>   Two projects would be immediately affected: the 1,600 homes and
industrial development proposed by Unocal in upper Alamos Canyon, and
a 550-unit project in Runkle Canyon that includes affordable housing
for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Both sites are outside city limits but within its future growth
boundaries, meaning that the projects now require only annexation and
City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   All but one of the mayoral and council candidates oppose the
measure, saying it would shift control of Simi Valley growth to
county government. Incumbents Davis, Miller and Becerra are part of
the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul L. Delgado, 73, a 40-year city resident, says residents
should oppose rampant growth.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't live where I live. They're going to build all kind of
homes in Runkle Canyon," said the retired aerospace machinist. "This
is our chance to take control of our destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Delgado said residents are fed up with constant noise and traffic
increases. He said the City Council has failed by stressing
residential construction rather than attracting large businesses that
spur local employment.</TE>
<TE>   "Go for big business, not homes," he said during a recent
candidates' forum.</TE>
<TE>   Another council challenger, Brian E. Wilson, a city environmental
compliance specialist, said home builders use campaign contributions
to wield too much influence in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to return the power to the people by listening to the
residents," said Wilson, 37, who first ran for council two years ago.
"I am not accepting any contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Measure B, he maintains, is a signal of residents' displeasure
with the council and the city's pace of development. He suggests
voters reject the measure, but only if they also cast their ballots
for new faces on the five-member council.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra, completing his first four-year term, said Measure B does
not reflect on council members.</TE>
<TE>   He said the countywide Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources
movement, which backs the Simi Valley measure, is also fighting for
growth controls in Ventura and Santa Paula this fall. SOAR will
eventually try to increase voters' control over development in other
Ventura County cities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong resident of Simi Valley, Becerra said his grandfather
moved there in 1927 and that his children are the third generation
born in town.</TE>
<TE>   A former student body president at Moorpark College, the
35-year-old Becerra, a public affairs region manager for Southern
California Edison, supports working closer with the school district
and parks district to enhance services. He wants to attract
high-paying technology jobs, expand the Neighborhood Watch anti-crime
program and set high standards for new construction in the city.</TE>
<TE>   After 32 years in law enforcement, the last dozen as Simi Valley's
police chief, Paul Miller has a public safety focus.</TE>
<TE>   He helped establish the nonprofit Simi Valley Police Foundation,
which raises money to create reward funds, buy new police dogs and
provide scholarships for fledgling officers. He supports citizen
volunteer patrols that would report suspicious activity via cell
phones.</TE>
<TE>   Running for a third term, Miller, 65, said the city must maintain
its fiscal health, ensure orderly growth and development, increase
the supply of affordable housing and improve the flow of traffic by
synchronizing street lights.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the greatest city in the world to live, work and
play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the separate race for mayor, Bill Davis, 75, said he wants
another two years to complete projects remaining after his 16 years
on the council.</TE>
<TE>   He would expand the city's government center, including City Hall
and the senior citizens center, and work to attract a regional mall
to the city.</TE>
<TE>   And Davis said he would continue fighting for more affordable
housing in Simi Valley, which requires most developers to set aside
units at below-market rates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to balance housing and jobs in this city," he said.
"Let's say you don't build one more house. Take the family with two
or three kids -- where are they going to live when they grow up?"</TE>
<TE>   But challenger David R. Plunkett, 43, an aerospace engineer, said
he strongly opposes lower-cost housing programs for anyone but senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, young professionals need to save their money, make
personal sacrifices and accept that they may need to buy an older,
starter home in need of some repair.</TE>
<TE>   Plunkett, who made his own campaign brochures and doesn't plan to
spend more than $1,000, wants to clarify development standards so
builders don't have projects shot down by the council at the end of
the review process.</TE>
<TE>   He proposes reviving Simi Valley's economy by bringing in a
regional mall and several fine restaurants while building a new drama
center.</TE>
<TE>   He said the city's existing cultural arts center -- a former
church that reopened in 1995 after about $2 million in renovations --
is too small: He envisions a playhouse that could hold Broadway-style
shows, much like the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we don't make any money on it, long-term we would improve
the quality in life in Simi Valley," Plunkett said.</TE>
<TE>   A key component of his plan is to give preference to local
contractors and merchants on city contracts, and to require outside
bidders to either hire some local workers or agree to buy some
materials from local companies.</TE>
<TE>   Making his second run for City Hall, Jim Mackelburg, 41, said it's
time for new ideas from the city's mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, he said, "just wants to finish what he's got going. He's
got a two-year outlook. We need somebody who's got a 20-year
outlook."</TE>
<TE>   Mackelburg, a real estate consultant and teacher with about $2,200
in campaign funds, said the incumbents can be blamed for overcrowding
and poor construction on new residences. The way to achieve housing
affordability, he said, is to make recruitment of top employers a
priority.</TE>
<TE>   "Jobs are the key to solving the affordability problem,"
Mackelburg said. "We have to bring in jobs, high-paying jobs. You
can't stop building houses either, otherwise nothing will be
affordable."</TE>

<HD>Like Totally Cool Lexicon, Dude</HD>
<DH>Experts say the Valley should be proud of the dialect that
was born there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley manages to break away from Los Angeles
with next week's vote, it would redraw the political geography of
Southern California and introduce a host of new political leaders to
the region.</LD>
<LD>   But while the Valley would have to start many institutions anew,
it would begin life with a culture and even a dialect all its own.</LD>
<LD>   That is a mixed blessing for the Valley. The quintessential
American suburb gave birth to the "Valley Girl," and for a generation
that icon has symbolized Southern California's shallow materialism.
Today, when young people refer to a look or an idea as "so 818," it's
a reference to the Valley's area code, and it's not meant kindly.</LD>
<TE>   If those cultural identifiers are derisive, though, they also are
recognizable and unique to the community -- which is more than most
suburban areas can claim in terms of cultural impact.</TE>
<TE>   "How many other parts of the country can set an international
trend?" asked Kevin Starr, the state's librarian and a USC professor.
"The Valley should be proud of the Valley Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, a candidate for mayor of a new Valley city, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "People say we have no culture here," he said. "But the Valley
Girl vocabulary is part of our culture. It sets us apart."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Musicians Frank and Moon Unit Zappa catapulted Vals to fame in
their 1982 hit song "Valley Girl." In it, Moon Unit, Frank's teenage
daughter, imitated classmates talking about shopping at the Sherman
Oaks Galleria, visiting the orthodontist, cutting toenails and being
forced to do the dishes:</TE>
<TE>   "It's like so gross. . .</TE>
<TE>   Like all the stuff like sticks to the plates,</TE>
<TE>   And it's like, it's like somebody else's food, y'know</TE>
<TE>   It's like grody,</TE>
<TE>   Grody to the max.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure.</TE>
<TE>   It's like really nauseating,</TE>
<TE>   Like barf out.</TE>
<TE>   Gag me with a spoon."</TE>
<TE>   Improbably, those lyrics helped identify and extend the Valley's
international image.</TE>
<TE>   From Tarrytown, N.Y., to Tokyo, teenagers sought to become Vals,
middle- to upper-class suburban girls who stretched their vowels,
ended sentences in high pitches and made up words such as
tripendicular (as in, "Like, check out that tooe-taa-leee
tri-pen-dic-u-lar dude at the Hot Dog on a Stick.").</TE>
<TE>   Like other Valley Girls, Christina Conley wore her hair permed and
teased and her sweaters off the shoulder. She listened to the Stray
Cats, and giggled lines such as: "Grody to the max, to the big max,
to the quarter-pounder."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Conley has outgrown her teenage mannerisms. She is an
articulate 36-year-old with shiny, straight hair. She left a
successful career in pharmaceutical sales to become a married
stay-at-home mom on a leafy street in Pasadena. She gently scolds her
nieces for using "like" too much.</TE>
<TE>   "It took one of my nieces 12 'likes' to get to the point," Conley
said, as she drove her Saturn past the Northridge Mall, where she and
her friend, Heidi Jorgenson, used to walk, talk and shop. "But I know
it can be fun. It's like Valley Girls put the Valley on the map."</TE>
<TE>   She paused. Then laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm, like, totally, a Valley Girl."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Others have found "like" a hard habit to break, too. In fact, the
word has become an object of popular and academic interest.</TE>
<TE>   Even Oprah Winfrey sounded like a Valley girl one day on her
afternoon talk show.</TE>
<TE>   " ... And I'm like, 'Well, which one is she? Which one is she?'
OK.," Winfrey said during a show last February. "Because she was
like, you were like another girl. And she had on jeans, and she was
blond, and somebody else, and I was like, 'Which one is she?' "</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey and other "like" lovers have nothing to be ashamed of,
according to linguists who study Valley vernacular, also called
mallspeak. "It's a strong, powerful little word," said Muffy E.A.
Siegel, an English professor who teaches linguistics at Temple
University in Philadelphia. She published a study on the word last
summer in the Journal of Semantics.</TE>
<TE>   "Like" is a discourse particle, a term linguists use to describe
words that fill in a sentence, such as "well," "uh" and "oh."</TE>
<TE>   "There are many ways to use like, but the meaning is basically the
same: I'm going to say something, but don't hold me to it," Siegel
said. " ... No other word in the English language does so many
things."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, linguists cite:</TE>
<TE>   * Like as a hedge, an approximation invoked when someone is
unsure: "I'll finish writing my article by, like, 10."</TE>
<TE>   * Like as a paraphrase, a verbal indirect quote: "She said she
wants to, like, paint pretty murals on freeway overpasses."</TE>
<TE>   * Like as a substitute for said, introducing a verbal quote:
"She's like, 'I want a refund.' "</TE>
<TE>   * Like signaling an exaggeration: "She has, like, a million
shoes."</TE>
<TE>   * Like as a time buyer, used when the speaker is thinking on the
fly: "I don't have my, like, homework because, like, my bichon frise,
like, ate it."</TE>
<TE>   Siegel's study found that, the more time people took to consider a
question, the less likely they were to rely on "like." Boys used the
word less because they tend to pause before responding.</TE>
<TE>   "Like has a negative stigma for the people who use it," said
Siegel, who based some of her research on taped interviews her
teenage daughter had conducted with friends. "But I don't see girls
using it as a bad thing. It's a sign of comfort and belonging."</TE>
<TE>   Other academics view Val vocabulary as linguistic blasphemy. At
Smith College in Northampton, Mass., "like" became so pervasive a few
years ago that the school began issuing its all-female students a tip
sheet encouraging them to speak in proper English. "Intelligent women
ought to sound intelligent," it advised. "External poise indicates
internal poise."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Easton, a Hollywood dialect coach, said the languid
locution is so common that he often has to take the California out of
the voices of young actors from distant places.</TE>
<TE>   "They say 'puh-leeze' and 'guh-ros,' " said Easton, who then has
to train, say, a Southern actor to speak with a Southern accent.</TE>
<TE>   California Valley Girl-speak -- glottal stops and all -- is
studied at Harvard University as part of a regional dialect course
taught by Bert Vaux, an associate professor of linguistics. He said
Valspeak resembles the laid-back surfer slang that preceded it.</TE>
<TE>   "Tubular" was a well-curved wave before it became an expression of
excitement synonymous with "awesome." Valley boys were often called
surfer dudes, even though they lived at least 20 miles from the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   Mallspeak endures partly, Vaux said, because Hollywood continues
to feature the dialect two decades after its heyday, when studios
released the classic Val films "Valley Girl" and "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."</TE>
<TE>   There's Alicia Silverstone in "Clueless," who portrays a rich
Westside teen who sounds 818, but expresses horror at the possibility
of venturing into the Valley. Reese Witherspoon in "Legally Blond"
and Kirsten Dunst in "Bring It On" looked and talked like Valley
Girls.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because 'Gag me with a spoon' is no longer used," Vaux said,
"doesn't mean the Valley Girl is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Most of his students agreed. "I had a girl in my senior AP English
class who, in one monologue, said the word 'like' 38 times," Jim
Fingal, a 19-year-old Orange County resident wrote as part of an
informal survey Vaux conducted on Valley Girls.</TE>
<TE>   "The two girls I have met who spoke the most like Valley Girls
were both native Long Islanders," wrote Naomi Straus, 20, of Chico. "
... I also find myself on occasion lapsing back to Valley slang I
thought had died with scrunchy socks and L.A. Gears. I have been
known to bust out 'rad' or 'awesome' in response to things that
excite me, and I am a frequent user of the term 'totally.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the dialect that began decades ago in the Valley today not
only reflects the culture for young people, it also appears in the
speech and writing of serious scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the New York Times columnist William Safire
weighed in on Valley secession. Safire, who also is the author of
"Safire's New Political Dictionary: The Definitive Guide to the New
Language of Politics," did not tip his hand on secession, but he
showed his familiarity with Valley culture.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of secession, Safire said, has and will continue to
make Los Angeles better.</TE>
<TE>   "Like, let's get more San Fernando representation on the City
Council," he wrote, "like, more fire engines up into the hillsides
and like, smaller and more prescriptive English classes for Valley
girls."</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>For Gas Station Complaints, Take a Number</HD>
<DH>Drivers can call 800 line about law requiring free air and
water, but there's no money to enforce it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many times have you rolled into a gas station with an overheated
engine or a doughy front tire, only to find you had to pay for air
and water? Or worse, the station provided no such services?</LD>
<LD>   At many stations, all you can expect is a blank expression from a
slack-jawed teenager working the cash register behind six inches of
bulletproof glass.</LD>
<LD>   It seemed those miserable days were over when Gov. Gray Davis
signed legislation in 1999 to require California gas stations to
provide free air and water to all paying customers. The law included
a $250 fine for violators.</LD>
<TE>   Problem solved, right?</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right.</TE>
<TE>   David Garza of Glendale wrote to Behind the Wheel asking why, if
such a law exists, do four of the five gas stations in his
neighborhood still charge for air and water.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What is the status of the law requiring gas stations in
California to provide free air and water?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: First some background: The law took effect Jan. 1, 2000.
Unlike many other bills, this law came with teeth.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation required the Department of Food and Agriculture to
create a hotline for motorists to report violations. In response to
the complaints, the department was instructed to inspect service
stations and issue fines to violators.</TE>
<TE>   But, as of July 1, the money for the enforcement of the law was
eliminated because of the state's whopping $24-billion budget
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   But all hope is not lost.</TE>
<TE>   If you call the "air and water complaint line" at (800) 356-7057
and leave the name and address of the service station that is
violating the law, the department will send a letter, notifying the
owner of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Boy, that's a message that should make these gas station owners
tremble in their boots: Hey, abide by the law or ... we will remind
you that there is a law!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With all respect to Don, Joe, Glen and other members of the 1970s
band the Eagles, there is, technically speaking, no such thing as a
"fast lane."</TE>
<TE>   Read through the entire California Vehicle Code and you will find
no mention of the term "fast lane" in the entire document.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, ask anybody to name the lane closest to the freeway median
and they will say, "Oh, you mean the fast lane."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Tieman of Los Angeles wrote to say he often drives the
posted speed limit on the freeway only to see motorists in the "fast
lane" speeding by at 85 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, what is the law about going in the "fast lane" at the
fastest legally posted speed?</TE>
<TE>   A: The problem with the term "fast lane" is that it is a misnomer.
It erroneously implies that motorists in that lane can legally drive
as fast as they want. (Try using that excuse with a traffic court
judge. "But your honor, I was in the fast lane!")</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Anne DaVigo noted that the
vehicle code requires slow traffic to stay in the right lanes.</TE>
<TE>   So, she said, those vehicles that are moving faster should pass
the slow traffic using the left lanes. "Does it mean you can go fast
in the left lane?" she said. "No."</TE>
<TE>   The posted speed limit applies to every driver on the freeway,
regardless of the lane, DaVigo said. Perhaps a more accurate term
might be the "faster lane."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, the Eagles probably wouldn't have had a hit with a
song called "Life in the Faster Lane."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of popular tunes, Robert Miller of Long Beach has been
singing the "Highway Blues" since a chunk of pavement broke away from
the San Diego Freeway last month and flew into his windshield.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks after the incident, he said the California Department of
Transportation had yet to fill the crater where that chunk
originated.</TE>
<TE>   Miller wrote to inquire about his options.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can I send the bill to Caltrans?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unfortunately, if Miller tries to bill Caltrans for his damage,
he will probably be humming a catchy Rolling Stones tune that begins
with the lyrics, "I can't get no satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board
gets thousands of claims each year from motorists whose cars were
damaged by deteriorating state freeways. In fact, this type of claim
is one of the most common received by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokeswoman for the board said most of these claims are
rejected. Why? Because the state is obligated to pay only if you can
show that Caltrans previously knew about the rotten roadway condition
and neglected to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   If you still want to try your luck, call the claims board at (800)
955-0045 or visit the Web site at www.boc.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And on the topic of car damage, this column recommended last month
that motorists whose vehicles are damaged by errant gravel and rocks
that fly off big-rig trucks to notify the CHP by calling (800)
TELL-CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Since that column was published, several angry readers have
written to complain that the CHP was less than helpful with those
complaints. Angry truck drivers also have written to ask for a
clarification on their responsibility in such matters.</TE>
<TE>   First, let's review the law in question. A 1990 law requires
truckers carrying aggregate material (i.e. gravel, rocks, dirt) to
cover the load. There are a few exceptions. The load doesn't have to
be covered if the aggregate material does not reach six inches from
the top of the truck container. Also, no cover is needed if the truck
is hauling asphalt or petroleum coke material.</TE>
<TE>   But cover or no cover, truck drivers are responsible for damage if
some of that load flies out and smacks another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   If you call (800) TELL-CHP to report such a mishap, the CHP is
obligated to help you fill out a damage report and notify the truck
owner of your complaint.</TE>
<TE>   If the CHP officer who answers the call tries to give you the
brushoff, CHP commanders in Sacramento say you should be insistent.
Ask for the commanding officer.</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't work, remind them that the logo on the side of
each CHP unit is "Safety and Service."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Southern California, write to Behind the Wheel, 202 W. 1st St., Los
Angeles, CA 90012, or send an e-mail to behindthewheel@ latimes.com.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Narrows Gap</HD>
<DH>In BCS race for No. 2 spot, Fighting Irish close to within
.33 points of Miami. Oklahoma retains No. 1 position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufrense</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma held the top spot in the second bowl championship series
standings while the race for the coveted No. 2 position got tighter
as Notre Dame inched closer to Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame, boosted by a 34-24 win at Florida State, closed to
within .33 points of Miami with the chance to pass the Hurricanes
next week.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma, No. 2 in both national polls, maintained a comfortable
lead in the BCS with a total of 3.33 points, followed by Miami at
6.69 and Notre Dame at 6.99.</LD>
<TE>   The schools with the two lowest point totals in the final BCS
standings on Dec. 8 will play for the BCS national title in the
Fiesta Bowl, Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the BCS top 10 are Georgia, Ohio State, Virginia
Tech, Texas, Washington State, North Carolina State and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   USC moved up three spots, from 14th to 11th, and overtook Notre
Dame for the No. 1 spot in strength of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the jump, however, the Trojans' only realistic shot at
playing in a BCS game is via the Pac-10 champion's automatic berth to
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS standings are a four-part rating system composed of polls,
computer average, strength of schedule and losses. Quality win points
are also awarded for victories against teams that finish in the BCS
top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame picked up a full BCS point by moving from No. 6 to No.
4 in the Associated Press poll, which enabled the Irish to cut
Miami's lead in half from last week, .66 to .33.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish could not overtake Miami because they slipped a bit in
the strength-of-schedule and computer-poll components, due in part to
losses suffered by Notre Dame opponents: Michigan and Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   Should Oklahoma, Miami and Notre Dame remain unbeaten, the race
for the No. 2 spot in the BCS could be another decimal-point
thriller.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame could pass Miami next week when the Irish play Boston
College and the Hurricanes take on lowly Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   After that, though, it's anyone's guess. Notre Dame figures to
lose BCS ground when it plays Navy and Rutgers in consecutive weeks,
but Miami should get a boost if it beats Tennessee on Nov. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The fight for the second BCS berth could come down to the final
two weekends, when Notre Dame plays at USC on Nov. 30 and Miami plays
host to Virginia Tech on Dec. 7.</TE>

<LD>2001-02 record: 39-43, 5th place in Pacific Division.</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Alvin Gentry, third season.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: Earl Boykins (free agent), Obinna Ekezie (free agent),
Harold Jamison (trade), Jeff McInnis (free agent), Darius Miles
(trade), Doug Overtime (free agent).</LD>
<TE>   Who's new: Melvin Ely (2002 draft), Marko Jaric (2000 draft),
Andre Miller (trade), Cherokee Parks (free agent), Wang Zhizhi (free
agent), Chris Wilcox (2002 draft).</TE>
<TE>   Projected starting lineup: SF-Corey Maggette (Lamar Odom when he
returns from sprained ankle), PF-Elton Brand, C-Michael Olowokandi,
SG-Quentin Richardson, PG-Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Projected bench rotation: PG-Jaric, PF-Wilcox, C-Wang, SG-Eric
Piatkowski, C-Sean Rooks.</TE>
<TE>   Keys to the season: Given the string of injuries the Clippers
suffered during training camp, staying physically sound is one of the
season's top priorities. The team will start the season with three
players on the injured list. Living for the moment and forgetting
contract concerns should be another significant goal. Olowokandi has
a good deal to prove as he attempts to show NBA teams, including the
Clippers, he is worth a so-called "max" contract. Brand, Odom,
Maggette and Miller also are eligible to receive new long-term
contracts next summer. The Clippers must play together, avoiding the
temptation to pad statistics in an attempt to increase their value in
off-season contract negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: More than one forecaster has wondered whether the
Clippers have too much of a good thing. It's a valid question. Few
teams have as remarkable a collection of talented players as the
Clippers, and that includes the Lakers and Sacramento Kings. Everyone
wants to play, everyone wants to score, everyone wants to be a star.
It's not possible for Gentry to please all of the Clippers all of the
time. Don't expect to see the Clippers outlasting the Lakers, Kings
or San Antonio Spurs next spring, in other words.</TE>

<HD>Big Hopes Bring Big Ifs</HD>
<DH>Stalled negotiations, injuries and egos raise questions
about Clipper season that could be a franchise best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No question, the Clippers have been discovered. No longer are they
mentioned in the same sentence with the words "sorry," "pitiful" or
"woebegone." What they do, how they play, what they say, has become
increasingly significant from coast to coast.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN found them midway through last season, trailing them 24/7
while producing an MTV-style documentary of a up-and-coming NBA team
struggling to find its way.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers were news wherever they went, and more often than not
it was for the right reasons. Power forward Elton Brand averaged 18.2
points and 11.6 rebounds and played in his first All-Star game. The
team finished with a 39-43 record, good for ninth place in the
Western Conference standings, and was only five games out of a
playoff position.</LD>
<TE>   However, the Clippers' best season in a decade was followed by an
off-season of mixed results that was followed by an injury-riddled
training camp that tempered any swagger the team might have developed
going into a season many predict will be the best in franchise
history.</TE>
<TE>   Brand underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26
and sat out most of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi suffered tendinitis in his left knee and
sat out almost a month.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard Quentin Richardson sprained his right knee and
played in one of eight exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Small forward Lamar Odom will start the season on the injured list
because of a badly sprained right ankle and won't be fit to play
until Christmas, Coach Alvin Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're healthy, we should have a chance to get to the
playoffs," Gentry said. "We're more experienced. We're another year
older. It all comes down to commitment. We've got to be committed to
each other and do what's necessary."</TE>
<TE>   To make it to the postseason for the first time since 1996-97,
"some guys are going to have to make sacrifices," Gentry added.
"Everyone is not going to be the star."</TE>
<TE>   If it all happens as Gentry hopes, if the Clippers jell with new
point guard Andre Miller leading by his unselfish example, then the
team might push the 50-victory mark for the first time since the
franchise began play in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   If not, if the Clippers succumb to more injuries and allow
thoughts of contract uncertainties to overwhelm them, they could just
as easily threaten the 50-loss barrier for the umpteenth time.</TE>
<TE>   So much promise, so much talent, so many opportunities to crumble
under the weight of increased expectations and the fear of the
unknown after this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers bricked an opportunity last summer to lock up
Olowokandi and Brand to long-term extensions, which would have
removed two potential headaches before training camp began.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi has made it clear he intends to have a standout season.
If the Clippers won't pay him a so-called "max-out" deal approaching
$100 million, he'll seek it elsewhere. Brand, Miller, Odom and
forward Corey Maggette also are eligible next summer for lengthy (and
lucrative) extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, this is shooting guard Eric Piatkowski's final season under
contract. Piatkowski has been a career-long Clipper, spending all
nine NBA seasons with the club. Richardson is set to replace him in
the starting lineup, however.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing a potential powder keg when he sees one, Gentry imposed a
gag order on his players. There will be no contract talk this season
-- not on the team's chartered plane and certainly not in the locker
room in the presence of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all talked about it," Gentry said. "Michael and I talked
the other day. We both want to keep the focus on the task at hand. We
want to get ourselves into a situation where we get ourselves into
the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the future is on the minds of every Clipper, including
Gentry, who can be a free agent after this season. The team has an
option on the 2003-04 season, but Gentry isn't banking on it.</TE>
<TE>   Brand would like to see the core group of Clippers stick together
for the next few seasons, knowing full well it takes time to build a
championship-caliber team.</TE>
<TE>   He's doubtful that his teammates would take less money to stay
with the Clippers beyond the 2002-03 season, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys might consider it if we have a great season," Brand
said. "I don't see guys taking a 20% or 30% pay cut just to stay in
L.A., though."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I should be right up there with those guys who are
All-Stars and All-Star-caliber players," he added. "My deal wasn't
up, so I wasn't upset at all."</TE>
<TE>   Miller could be the glue that keeps the Clippers from splintering
when times get tough. The Clippers gave up Darius Miles, a
20-year-old with remarkable potential, to acquire Miller from the
Cleveland Cavaliers on July 30.</TE>
<TE>   Miller led the NBA with an average of 10.9 assists last season and
that figure could rise with the more skillful Clippers in 2002-03.
Gentry and his assistants have heaped praise on Miller, whose
tranquil demeanor differs from the fiery Jeff McInnis, who signed
with the Portland Trail Blazers in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Clippers didn't have to deal Cleveland one or
both of their first-round picks to seal the deal for Miller. The
Clippers kept forwards Chris Wilcox, taken eighth overall from NCAA
champion Maryland, and Melvin Ely, selected 12th from Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   Elgin Baylor, Clipper general manager, also signed point guard
Marko Jaric, a second-round pick in the 2000 draft. Only days before
joining the Clippers for his first NBA training camp, Jaric helped
Yugoslavia win the gold medal at the World Championships in
Indianapolis. Jaric and Miller moved the ball at a dizzying pace
during the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're all looking forward to a great season," Brand said,
fulfilling his role as resident optimist. "I think we can do some big
things. There's a lot to prove."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers waived forward Mike Batiste and guard Bryant Stith, then
put forwards Melvin Ely, Tremaine Fowlkes and Lamar Odom on the
injured list Monday, trimming their roster to the required 12 active
players.</LD>
<LD>   Batiste had made a strong showing in eight exhibitions, leading
the Clippers in scoring for a time. Coach Alvin Gentry said he had no
doubt Batiste, from Long Beach Wilson High and Arizona State, would
soon join another NBA team.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a tough, tough decision because he's going to be an NBA
player," Gentry said. "He has those kinds of skills. I think he will
hook on with somebody. Mike Batiste is a classy kid. He's a
hard-working kid. I think he'll be on an NBA roster."</LD>
<TE>   Stith did not participate in training camp after undergoing
off-season arthroscopic knee surgery. In the end, Stith was nothing
more than a throw-in player in the Clippers' off-season trade that
brought point guard Andre Miller from the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wang Zhizhi has a Chinese nickname that sounds vaguely like
"Dodger" in English. Wang doesn't know much about baseball but has
told his Clipper teammates he likes to be called Dodger.</TE>
<TE>   While he played with the Dallas Mavericks the last two seasons,
team owner Mark Cuban and others referred to Wang as "Z" or "the Big
Z."</TE>
<TE>   "We've totally Americanized him," Gentry said of Wang, who became
the first Chinese player in the NBA when he appeared in five games
with the Mavericks in 2000-01. "He's Dodger to us."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to better bridge the language barrier, Gentry and
the coaching staff wrote out 20 useful basketball terms for Wang. So
far, Gentry hasn't had any problems getting his points across to
Wang, who speaks limited English and has a full-time translator,
Simon Chan, with him this season.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</LD>
<TE>   The featured segment in tonight's edition of "Real Sports" may be
the most powerful in the eight-year history of the show. Esera
Tuaolo, 34, a powerful 300-pound former defensive end who played nine
seasons in the NFL, announces that he is gay.</TE>
<TE>   But this is about more than an ex-football player coming out of
the closet. This is about how homosexuality is viewed in professional
sports and the extent to which Tuaolo went to keep his secret.</TE>
<TE>   Tuaolo and a film producer went to HBO with his story, initially
hoping the pay-cable network would want to do a full-blown
documentary. HBO executives suggested a "Real Sports" segment
instead. Maybe HBO should have done a documentary. Tuaolo has quite a
tale to tell.</TE>
<TE>   Tuaolo, who is from Hawaii and was a second-round draft pick from
Oregon State, played for Green Bay, Minnesota, Jacksonville, Atlanta
and Carolina. He tells reporter Bernard Goldberg his main fear of
being found out was that he would be hurt intentionally -- by his own
teammates. And Sterling Sharpe, a teammate at Green Bay, backs that
up.</TE>
<TE>   "Had he come out on a Monday, with Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
practices, he'd have never gotten to the game on Sunday," Sharpe
says.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe also says, "He would have been eaten alive and he would
have been hated for it."</TE>
<TE>   Also interviewed were Craig Sauer, a teammate in Atlanta who had
to come to terms with his friend's sexuality, and Tuaolo's partner,
Mitchell Wherley, who runs a beauty salon. Tuaolo and Wherley have
adopted 2-year-old twin girls. Tuaolo says he wanted to come out so
he could be happy: "I've taken off this costume I've been wearing all
my life."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Help End Panic in Toronto</HD>
<DH>Maple Leafs, who had lost five of six at home, run into the
right team at the right time, defeating Anaheim, 5-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Take heart struggling hockey teams, aide will be coming to your arena
soon.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the way it seems when the Mighty Ducks hit town.
They've become a care package. Monday was more proof of that.</LD>
<LD>   The Toronto Maple Leafs, feeling the pressure of a poor start, got
a Duck booster shot in a 5-2 victory in front of 18,891 at Air Canada
Centre. A three-goal second period was medicine for what ailed the
Maple Leafs.</LD>
<TE>   Then the Ducks were off, flying to Montreal, where goalie Jose
Theodore, winner of the Hart and Vezina trophies last season, is
laboring to find his game after signing a three-year, $16.5-million
contract.</TE>
<TE>   A hint to the Canadien brain trust: This might be a good time to
get Theodore back in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this to become, 'Invite the Ducks into town when
things aren't going good and we'll give you an opportunity to get it
going,' " Duck Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Ducks, that's the way it has been the last
two games.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, they blew a two-goal lead in the third period, losing to
Edmonton, 4-3. Much talk of learning and improving followed. That
worked fine until six minutes into the second period Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Then Toronto's Nik Antropov battled in front of the net and swept
in his own rebound to break a 1-1 tie. Alexander Mogilny and Mats
Sundin followed with goals and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing to come to Toronto, the hockey capital of the
world, and play like that," team captain Paul Kariya said. "We should
have had a sense of urgency after losing to Edmonton. This team
should have bounced back then."</TE>
<TE>   Now would also be a good time.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have two games left on a trip that started fine with a
tie against Vancouver. After Montreal, they face a Boston team that
has lost only once. Two more losses and the Ducks come home with a
2-7-2-0 record. "This road trip is a big trip for us," Babcock said.
"We got off to a good start on the road trip, we had the situation
... in Edmonton and let it get away from us. Tonight, this is a big
loss."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't start that way. The Maple Leafs seemed as dysfunctional
as the Ducks with a 2-6-1 record before the game. They had lost the
first three games of a seven-game homestand and were 1-5 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Alyn McCauley put the Maple Leafs on better footing 1:56 into the
game, knocking in a Mikael Renberg pass out of the air for a 1-0
lead. Still, all was well for the Ducks when Matt Cullen tied the
score with a wrist shot two minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the second period.</TE>
<TE>   After Antropov scored, Sundin glided behind the net and slid a
pass across the crease to Mogilny and it was 2-1 midway through the
second period. With 17 seconds left, Sundin crashed the net and
knocked home a Renberg centering pass.</TE>
<TE>   "They scored two goals three-on-three down low where we were
lost," Babcock said. "You work on that stuff every day. There is no
excuse for that."</TE>
<TE>   The Duck power play got involved in the third period as well,
producing a goal ... for the Maple Leafs. Jonas Hoglund intercepted a
pass and fed Robert Reichel, who scored the short-handed goal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we have to address," defenseman Fredrik
Olausson said. "You can't play like that and expect to win."</TE>

<HD>McNabb Runs Giants Ragged</HD>
<DH>Eagle quarterback rushes for 111 yards and one touchdown to
lead Philadelphia over New York, 17-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Donovan McNabb dropped back to pass, quickly noticed his receivers
were covered, took off and ran 38 yards.</LD>
<LD>   It was just the fourth play of the game, but it set the tone for
the Philadelphia Eagles.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb ran for 111 yards and one touchdown, Duce Staley had 126
yards in 24 carries, and Philadelphia finished with 299 yards rushing
in a 17-3 victory over the New York Giants.</LD>
<TE>   It was the last Monday night game at Veterans Stadium. The Eagles
are moving to a new stadium next season.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever it takes to win," McNabb said. "You don't have to pass
for 300, 400 yards to get a win. If it takes me running, that's what
I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   It was Philadelphia's third consecutive victory over the Giants
after losing nine in a row to them, and it gave the Eagles (5-2) a
two-game lead over New York (3-4) and Washington (3-4) in the NFC
East.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb had only 137 yards passing, but the Eagles dominated the
Giants on the ground. David Akers kicked three field goals in the
first half, when the Eagles had the ball for 20 minutes 31 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia hadn't had two 100-yard rushers since Oct. 8, 1995,
when Ricky Watters and Charlie Garner did it against Washington. The
Eagles had nine runs of 10 yards or more.</TE>
<TE>   "The offensive line came out and dominated the line of scrimmage
and we got a lot of yards," said Staley, who ran for 152 yards in the
Eagles' 20-10 victory over Tampa Bay last week.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb put the game away with a 40-yard touchdown run 4:30 into
the fourth quarter that gave the Eagles a 15-3 lead, and he connected
with Chad Lewis on a two-point conversion. McNabb's run capped a
nine-play, 99-yard drive that took 3:33.</TE>
<TE>   On third and 11, McNabb dropped back to pass, stepped up in the
pocket, avoided a tackle at his feet by Cornelius Griffin, started to
scramble, cut to his left, streaked down the sideline, jumped over a
blocker at the five and went into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a playmaker, he runs the offense like he's a point guard, he
makes things happen," Giant linebacker Michael Barrow said.</TE>
<TE>   It was McNabb's second 100-yard performance in three games. He had
100 yards in 12 carries in Philadelphia's 28-25 loss to the
Jacksonville Jaguars on Oct. 6.</TE>

<LD>Despite rising fan dissatisfaction over the sudden fall of Syracuse
football, Paul Pasqualoni received a vote of confidence Monday from
the university as he endures his worst season in 12 years as coach.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not a snapshot in a one-year situation," Athletic
Director Jake Crouthamel said before Pasqualoni's weekly news
conference. "It is a long-term evaluation, and we are very conscious
of making sure that we don't just do a knee-jerk reaction, that we
visit these things and revisit them on an annual basis over a long
period of time."</LD>
<LD>   Syracuse has not finished below .500 since 1986, but it appears
its string of 15 consecutive winning seasons will end this year.</LD>
<TE>   The Orangemen are 2-6, their only victories coming against
Division I-AA Rhode Island and Rutgers, perennially one of the worst
teams in Division I-A.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Orangemen finished 10-3, won 10 of their last 11
games, and finished ranked No. 14 in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Pasqualoni is 93-45-1 at Syracuse, including 55-24 in Big East
games.</TE>

<TE>   Brigham Young quarterback Ben Olson will take the next two years
off to serve a Mormon mission, Coach Gary Crowton said.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 210-pound freshman, who has not played this season,
is expected to leave in January. He will have four years of
eligibility remaining when he returns from his mission.</TE>
<TE>   Olson was among the nation's most sought-after recruits last year.
As a senior at Thousand Oaks High, he passed for 2,989 yards and 30
touchdowns.</TE>

<HD>NBA Suspends Fox for First Six Games After Altercation With
Kings' Christie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Fox put up little resistance Monday afternoon to a six-game
suspension, his punishment for smacking and then hunting down
Sacramento King guard Doug Christie in an exhibition game three
nights before.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, who absorbed a blow and then struck Fox in the chin
before being ambushed in the tunnel at Staples Center, was suspended
for two games.</LD>
<LD>   Neither was fined -- although the suspensions preclude pay, a near
$290,000 hit for Fox -- and none of the dozen or more Kings and
Lakers -- Shaquille O'Neal among them -- were suspended by Stu
Jackson, NBA vice president of operations, for leaving their bench to
join the fray.</LD>
<TE>   Fox, who will participate in tonight's ring ceremony but then will
have to leave the arena, will be eligible to return Nov. 8 in
Washington, after sitting out games against San Antonio, the
Clippers, Cleveland, Boston and two against Portland, extending his
training camp by nearly two weeks. The Lakers were already scheduled
to open defense of their three consecutive NBA titles without O'Neal,
so the season's first fortnight became ever more daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the utmost confidence in the world in my team," a contrite
Fox said after a Chamber of Commerce luncheon at the
Westin-Bonaventure Hotel. "They'll fill in and do what is needed to
keep us going here at the start of the season. It's a lesson learned,
something I learned about myself, a mistake made.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what to expect. They got the [video]tape in the
tunnel there and obviously that didn't help my cause. It's something
that's never happened before and it's a precedent they wanted to
set."</TE>
<TE>   Said Christie, "I was glad the commissioner saw fit to understand
and not just react."</TE>
<TE>   In a rare conference call, Jackson on several occasions called the
events of Friday night "unusual" and condemned Fox's actions as
"egregious." He excused the Kings and O'Neal for entering the tunnel,
because, he said, "I don't think anyone ... fully knew what was going
on out of the sight of the bench areas there.</TE>
<TE>   "In this circumstance, our judgment was that the players who left
the bench were attempting to break up the fight and did not escalate
the altercation."</TE>
<TE>   The NBA rule book does not allow for leaving the bench during a
fight for any reason, which is why Laker Coach Phil Jackson ordered
his players to remain nearby, even as the Kings poured into the
tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious they disregarded the rule," Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak called Fox's punishment
"excessive," but said the club would not appeal Stu Jackson's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the Lakers down two starters with the San Antonio
Spurs in town tonight. Phil Jackson said he would start Robert Horry
at power forward, but added that he hadn't made his choices at center
and small forward. Samaki Walker and Soumaila Samake are his options
in the middle, Tracy Murray and Devean George at forward, unless
Jackson opts to go small in the backcourt and start Kobe Bryant at
small forward. George has had a sore lower back, but said Monday he
would have no limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson hates to ride Horry too hard too early, and the absence of
O'Neal cuts into the time Walker can play power forward.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant considered the complications brought by injury and
behavior, and shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we're faced with, so it's important for everybody to
believe in themselves, to believe in what we can do as a team, and go
out there and play like we know how," he said. "Play loose. This is
the best part of the season, a chance to do something that hasn't
been done in a long, long time. It's important that we keep that in
perspective, that we go out there and have fun and let the games take
care of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   He had 12 assists Friday against the Kings, and said to expect
more of that style with O'Neal and Fox away.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I played the game against Sacramento, same way I'm going
to play all season long," Bryant said. "Same way. Doesn't change.
I've got to get my teammates involved, try to make these guys better.
It starts at the beginning of the season, all the way down to the
end, so when it comes time for the playoffs they're feeling extremely
well about themselves and they're viewed as serious threats by our
opponents. My game doesn't change. It stays the same."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, they'll face Sacramento four times, but not again
until Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Jackson said he'd be watching.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that Sacramento and Los Angeles has developed one of
those rivalries," Jackson said. "That's fine. What we can't tolerate
is when people's emotions and feelings end up in acts of violence. It
will not be tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   That being said, the Lakers and Kings aren't close to being done
with one another. Asked during Monday afternoon's luncheon about his
toe, O'Neal smiled wryly and said, "It feels pretty good. I had Doug
Christie's wife massage it for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did some light court work Monday. Asked if his dash down
the hallway Friday night counted as a rehabilitation exercise, he
claimed he hadn't run, but had an explanation for his quick arrival
beside Fox. "You ever see Jason from 'Friday the 13th' run?" he
asked, smiling. "No, but he always got there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Mark Madsen (hamstring) will start on the injured list,
where they must spend at least five games.... The Lakers have not
announced if they will exercise next year's $1.5-million option on
Madsen, though it seems doubtful.</TE>

<HD>Women's Group Points to PGA</HD>
<DH>Burk says tour should cut ties with Masters because Augusta
National doesn't have female members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest salvo in the ongoing debate about the lack of female
members at Augusta National, the National Council of Women's
Organizations wants the PGA Tour to cut its ties with the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   "By allowing the Masters Golf Tournament to enjoy [PGA] tour
recognition while continuing to discriminate against women, the tour
is giving its stamp of approval to the practices at Augusta," Martha
Burk, chair of the NCWO, said in a statement released Monday to the
media.</LD>
<LD>   The PGA Tour has a policy against holding tournaments at venues
with discriminatory practices, but contends that because it has no
contract with Augusta National, there is no issue to debate.</LD>
<TE>   "The tour's position on this issue is well known," said Bob Combs,
the PGA Tour's senior vice president for public relations and
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she would like PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem to
address the subject at his scheduled news conference Wednesday,
before the Tour Championship tournament at East Lake Golf Club in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "Claiming that there is no contractual co-sponsorship agreement
[with Augusta National] does not justify the PGA Tour's violating its
own standards," Burk said in the statement. "In recognizing the
Masters and counting the prize money toward season totals for
players, the PGA Tour has created a double standard for the benefit
of Augusta."</TE>
<TE>   Combs said the PGA Tour will not debate the merits of the issue.
"We have nothing else to add," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said in an telephone interview that she expressed the NCWO's
disappointment with the PGA Tour's position months ago and received
"an unsatisfactory" letter in reply.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm challenging [Finchem]," Burk said. "[He] owes us, the public
and their sponsors an explanation here."</TE>
<TE>   Burk's group is pressuring Augusta National to admit a female
member by the 2003 Masters. Hootie Johnson, chairman of the golf
club, has strongly resisted the move and taken such steps as
eliminating all television commercials during the broadcast of the
2003 Masters so sponsors would not be pressured by the NCWO. There
are no exclusionary policies at Augusta National, but there also are
no females among the club's 300 members.</TE>

<HD>Breeders' Cup Pick Six Probed</HD>
<DH>One bettor had six perfect tickets. There's concern the
bets were put in after the fourth race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An investigation into the Breeders' Cup pick six has been launched by
the New York State Racing and Wagering Board in response to requests
by both the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. and the Breeders' Cup.</LD>
<LD>   On a day spiced by the upset victories of Domedriver, paying $54
in the Mile; Starine, $28.40 in the Filly and Mare Turf, and Volponi,
$89 in the Classic, there were half a dozen perfect pick six tickets,
worth $428,392 each -- all bought by one bettor, making telephone
bets through an off-track account wagering service in upstate New
York, according to the New York State Racing and Wagering Board.</LD>
<LD>   If this weren't unusual enough, all of the tickets, reportedly
bought by a 29-year-old Maryland resident, were exactly the same.</LD>
<TE>   According to information provided by the NTRA, each of the tickets
singled the first four winners -- Domedriver, Orientate, who paid
$7.40 in winning the Sprint; Starine and Vindication, who returned
$10.20 in taking the Juvenile -- then used every horse in both the
Turf and the Classic. The Turf, which had a field of eight, was won
by favored High Chaparral and the Classic, which had a dozen runners,
was won by the longest shot in the field, Volponi.</TE>
<TE>   For a $2 bet, each ticket cost $192, and factoring in pick six
consolation tickets for five winners, totaling 108 at $4,606 apiece,
the total return, before taxes, would be in excess of $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pending the outcome of the investigation, the Breeders' Cup and
Arlington Park, which was host of the event for the first time this
year, have withheld payment to the Catskill Region OTB.</TE>
<TE>   There are said to be concerns the tickets weren't put in until
after the Juvenile, the fourth of the six races, was completed. If
so, that would explain why all the horses in both the Turf and
Classic were used, thus guaranteeing the tickets would be winners.</TE>
<TE>   However, both Donald Groth, the chairman of Catskill OTB, and
Brooks Pierce, the president of Autotote (the tote provider for
Catskill OTB and Arlington Park), were both quoted as saying the bets
were placed before the pick six began.</TE>
<TE>   "From a system perspective, we're 100% certain that the pools were
closed and that this gentleman made his bets 20 minutes before [the
first leg of the pick six]," Pierce told the Daily Racing Form.</TE>
<TE>   After first being contacted on Sunday, the New York State Racing
and Wagering Board began its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at everything there is to look at," said
Stacy Clifford of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board. "It's
an unusual circumstance that you'd want to look at no matter where it
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a case of somebody just getting very lucky. The
investigation is ongoing."</TE>
<TE>   If it turns out any criminal activity -- specifically, fraud --
was involved, the matter will be turned over to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   A formal letter sent to the New York State Racing and Wagering
Board was co-signed by Tim Smith, the commissioner of the NTRA, and
D.G. Van Clief, the president of the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Our obligation in this case clearly is to protect the customer
and the integrity of the process," said Van Clief in a prepared
statement. "We are simply asking for a complete and rapid
investigation by the proper authorities to determine the facts and to
maintain confidence in all aspects of our competition."</TE>
<TE>   Since the pick six tickets with six winners have not been paid,
the payoff to those who had five winners on Saturday would be
readjusted if irregularities were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Because the payoff was greater than 300-1 on a minimum $2 bet, all
those who cashed consolation tickets had to fill out Internal Revenue
Service forms, so there is documentation. The total pick six pool was
$4,569,515.</TE>

<LD>Steve Klosterman of Huntington Beach Marina High, considered the top
boys' volleyball recruit in the nation, has committed to UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-7 opposite hitter, a two-time All-Southern Section
selection, was selected the most valuable player at the USA Junior
Olympics championship last summer after leading his club team to the
18-and-under championship.</LD>
<LD>   Klosterman chose UCLA over Long Beach State and Pepperdine. USC,
Hawaii and UC Irvine were among the schools that offered Klosterman a
scholarship. He will sign a national letter of intent on Nov. 13.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles University forward Ruben Boykin, one of the top
scorers in Southern California, has committed to Northern Arizona,
Wildcat Coach Jim Nakabara said. The 6-7 standout, a member of The
Times' All-South Bay/Westside team, averaged 25.7 points and 11.6
rebounds last season.</TE>

<TE>   San Bernardino Aquinas has forfeited its five football victories
for using an ineligible player, Athletic Director Scot Neudorff said.
The Falcons' record drops to 0-7 overall and 0-1 in the Christian

<TE>   Teams getting victories (with corrected records) via the forfeits
are: Vasquez (1-6); Redlands Arrowhead Christian (4-3, 1-1 in league
play); Yermo Silver Valley (3-4); Riverside Notre Dame (1-6); Big
Bear (6-1).</TE>

game on Friday to its broadcast lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Miramonte League game, featuring two of the top medium-sized

<TE>   Senior Manuel Ruiz of Sepulveda Monroe entered the Mount San
Antonio College Invitational cross-country meet Saturday as the
defending City Section champion.</TE>
<TE>   He left it as a contender for the state Division I title after
finishing fourth in the Division I-II individual sweepstakes race
with a time of 14 minutes 50 seconds over the 2.91-mile course.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Tim Nelson of Redding Liberty Christian and juniors Troy
Swier of San Diego Mar Vista and Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte finished
ahead of Ruiz, but none of them run for Division I-size schools.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Troy Werner of Canyon Country Canyon, who won the team
sweepstakes race in 14:59, had the second-fastest time by a Division
I runner.</TE>
<TE>   "We only run the Mt. SAC course once a year so I didn't know
exactly what to expect of him," Monroe Coach Dean Balzarett said of
Ruiz. "But I was hoping he could run under 15:20.... He really went
out and did a great job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Erick Maldonado of Chino Don Lugo missed the Mount San
Antonio College Invitational cross-country meet because of an injury
and won't race again until the Southern Section preliminaries at Mt.
SAC on Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a sore spot on the bone above his ankle," Don Lugo Coach
Don Salyers said. "We're not sure exactly what it is. Hopefully,
we'll know more in the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado upset Luke Llamas of Canyon Country Canyon to win the
state Division I title last year, but has had several injuries since
then.</TE>

Division I-II team sweepstakes race in the Mt. San Antonio College
Invitational on Saturday. The Jackrabbits had an impressive 26-second
gap between their Nos. 1 and 5 runners while defeating Los Angeles
Loyola, 113-135, for the team title. Riverside Rubidoux, the
defending state Division II champion, returns to the top 10 after
finishing sixth in the team sweepstakes at Mt. SAC.</LD>

nine-hole record for the third time this season with a 188 at par-35
Glen Annie Golf Course. Amber Clifford shot 35 and Nicole Dishman and

Corona del Mar, though, has struggled without star Anne Yelsey, who

<HD>Coaching Lights Up Watts These Days</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Quincy Watts remembers standing atop the medal podium at the
Olympics, wearing his gold medal, having the American flag wrapped
around his shoulders and seeing his father beaming with joy.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a great feeling of achievement," Watts said.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing was supposed to top the level of excitement and
accomplishment Watts felt after winning the 400 meters at the 1992
Olympic Games in Barcelona.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years later, he has found a new way to experience athletic
contentment as track coach at his alma mater, Woodland Hills Taft.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would get the same amount of joy winning a race
myself as watching other kids I'm coaching when they win," he said.
"For them to come back and see the look in their eyes, that's as big
a joy for me as standing on the Olympics stand."</TE>
<TE>   Watts, 32, has been helping coach Taft's cross-country team with a
little assistance from his friends, Maurice Greene and Johnny Gray.
Greene is the reigning Olympic champion for 100 meters and former
world-record holder. Gray is the U.S. record-holder for 800 meters.</TE>
<TE>   The question is: Will they have enough time to coach in between
signing autographs for parents and students?</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon, Zambia or Tanzania could use a coaching staff like the
one Watts has put together at Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Give credit to Principal Myra Fullerton for pulling off the
coaching hire of the year last May.</TE>
<TE>   No one is a better role model for what it takes to succeed in
college and sports than Watts.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't an exceptional student during his days at Taft, but he
never stopped studying because he knew it was the only way he'd get
to college and be able to continue his dream of competing in the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He made it to USC, earned his degree, won an NCAA 400-meter
championship and two Olympic gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to tell young kids today who think sports is the only way,
if you don't have a balance between sports and academics, I don't
care how fast you are or what kind of football or basketball player
you are, you're never going to have the opportunity to progress to
the next level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take care of your academics, for that's the only way
you'll be able to showcase yourself on a world stage."</TE>
<TE>   Watts serves as a personal trainer to several NFL players during
their off-season workouts. He also has helped train high school
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   For almost two months, he has been working with 6-foot-8
basketball player Nick Stiggers of Van Nuys Montclair Prep, meeting
him at 6 a.m. for workouts on the track at North Hollywood
Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him if you can get in shape and be a big man that can run
the floor, you can give yourself a chance to play at the next level,"
Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   Stiggers has lost more than 20 pounds, and Montclair Prep Coach
Tyrone Fuller is thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to play well for one quarter but wasn't able to
sustain the energy level," Fuller said. "The workout he's on is
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be interesting to see how Taft's track athletes
respond to Watts' tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his coaching style, Watts said, "I'm going to do
whatever I have to do to get you motivated. If I have to scream, I'm
going to scream, but with a lot of love."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Taft's students are getting a little cocky by challenging
Watts to a race. He retired from racing last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to have to get into shape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he could always ask Greene to fill in.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Coach Andy Murray has often said of the Kings, "Our game is all about
team. It's not so much about individual stars."</LD>
<LD>   But believe this: It's much better with Ziggy Palffy.</LD>
<LD>   In 90 regular-season games since the start of last season, the
Kings are 15 games above .500 with Palffy in the lineup, an even .500
without him.</LD>
<TE>   This season, they are 2-0-1 with Palffy, including a victory and a
tie against the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, and
2-2-1 in the games the high-scoring right wing has sat out because of
a strained left groin.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes the whole team look better," defenseman Jaroslav Modry
said of Palffy, who is expected to sit out again tonight when the

<TE>   Update -- The Lakers beat the Spurs in five games in last year's
Western Conference semifinals and in four games in the 2001 Western
Conference finals. Kobe Bryant was the leading scorer in seven of
those nine playoff games and in all four of the regular-season games.
That's pretty good news for the Lakers, since Shaquille O'Neal is
still recovering from off-season toe surgery and won't be available
for at least two more weeks. The Lakers also will be without starting
small forward Rick Fox, who was suspended by the league for his part
in Friday's fight against the Sacramento Kings. The Spurs re-signed
free-agent forward Malik Rose over the summer. Center David Robinson
will retire after the season. Tim Duncan was the league MVP last
season, when he averaged 25.5 points and 12.7 rebounds.</TE>

<LD>2001-02 record: 58-24, 2nd place in Pacific Division.</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Phil Jackson, fourth season.</LD>
<LD>   Who's gone: Lindsey Hunter (trade), Mitch Richmond (free agent),
Jelani McCoy (free agent).</LD>
<TE>   Who's new: Tracy Murray (trade), Kareem Rush (trade), Soumaila
Samake (free agent), Jannero Pargo (free agent).</TE>
<TE>   Projected starting lineup: SF-Rick Fox, PF-Samaki Walker, C-Samake
(Shaquille O'Neal when he returns from toe surgery), SG-Kobe Bryant,
PG-Derek Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Projected bench rotation: PF-Robert Horry, SF-Devean George,
PG-Brian Shaw, SG-Rush, SG-Murray, PF-Slava Medvedenko, PF-Mark
Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   Keys to the season: O'Neal, the first-team All-NBA center who in
four years has gone from a man who couldn't win a title to one who
wins one every season, has to recuperate from toe surgery, and fast.
They can give him November, maybe even December, but much beyond that
and the season gets unwieldy for the Lakers in the stacked Pacific
Division. Bryant will have to put his new body to work, grinding
inside for rebounds and easy baskets while O'Neal continues his
recovery. Also, the Lakers could use some three-pointers from the
likes of Murray, Rush and Fisher, particularly with O'Neal on the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Basketball being a game of feet -- O'Neal's, Mike
Bibby's, Fisher's, to name a few -- the Lakers will complete their
four-ay, their four-tune, their four-play, as long as O'Neal becomes
reasonably sound again. There is hardly any argument anymore that the
Lakers play with the two best players coached by the best coach,
except in Sacramento, where the Kings have been slapping their
four-heads since clanking their free throws last spring. The Kings
nearly had them beat, so take your pick: They're catching up or they
missed their chance. Jackson has dismissed the premise that the
2002-03 season boils down to Lakers versus Kings, insisting that the
San Antonio Spurs, Dallas Mavericks and Portland Trail Blazers might
also be capable. One thing is inarguable: They will be, until O'Neal
returns.</TE>

<HD>...Four!</HD>
<DH>After three titles, Lakers still have plenty of incentive
for another run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems odd only if you aren't familiar with Phil Jackson and the
Lakers: They won't be favored to win the Pacific Division title,
although nearly everyone outside of Sacramento expects them to win
another NBA championship.</LD>
<LD>   It is the way of the Lakers, regular-season survivors and
postseason toughs, willing to sacrifice November and December for the
good of May and June, and so center Shaquille O'Neal will start on
the injured list and, for now, the chances of grave consequences are
slim.</LD>
<LD>   Having won three consecutive championships, the Lakers start over
again tonight, without O'Neal -- or starting forward Rick Fox, for
that matter -- for the near future, but with the championship season
still five months off.</LD>
<TE>   They'll play for their fourth title in four years, figuring there
could only be something daunting about it, because every time the
Chicago Bulls won three, Michael Jordan retired. Yet, the Lakers
arrive for the season after, sporting the same core players and the
same stubborn, playground optimism, talking four, playing for four.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing else to do but that," guard Kobe Bryant said.
"We're here, we might as well win it. It's important for a couple
reasons. One, to separate Phil from coaches of the past. Two, to do
something that hasn't been done since the Celtics. And three, just
winning it for Chick [Hearn, who died in August]."</TE>
<TE>   They'll play eventually with O'Neal, but for now with Bryant, who
turned 24 in August, and with the guys who call themselves
"Superfriends," who by habit cling to the offerings of the coach and
defer to the first team All-NBA players.</TE>
<TE>   The star system has worked the last three springs, even as Robert
Horry made shots, and Derek Fisher drew fouls, and Fox buried himself
in an offense that required five players, and Devean George began to
grow up. Contrary to the beliefs in a certain Midwestern front office
left behind by big-time basketball four years ago, players win
championships, organizations schedule parades.</TE>
<TE>   Driven, they've said, by the chance to separate themselves from
every team to run off a few championships but the Boston Celtics
going on four decades ago, the Lakers arrived at training camp
generally thicker through the chest and shoulders than they'd ever
been. Jackson, concerned about the accumulation of games and
practices during their three-peat, actually cut back on the number of
practices in camp, but ran his players harder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an awesome thing we're embarking on," Jackson said. "It's
too [far off] to start talking about. We're nine months away before
it's a reality. So, we just have to do what's natural, and that's
take the first step toward it."</TE>
<TE>   He's guessing, though. A coach of nine NBA champions since 1991,
Jackson has never had a reasonable chance at four in a row. Jordan
kept leaving, and his general manager, Jerry Krause, surrendered, and
Jackson too, eventually left for Montana. Now he stands one title
from overtaking Red Auerbach, who won nine in 10 years with the
Celtics starting in 1957, and doing it in the name of Red Holzman,
his friend and mentor. The Lakers get that too.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil has done a lot for me," O'Neal said. "It'd be nice to be on
the team that puts him over the edge. However, I don't think we
should talk about that right now. For us, we have to set our goals,
one mark at a time. I'm sure by March or April, I, we should be able
to tell if we have what it takes to win it again. I don't want to sit
here and say we want to win 70 games or this or that. We'll stick to
our formula."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Celtics, the Minneapolis Lakers won three in a row in
the early '50s and Jackson's Bulls did it twice in the '90s. Then
came these Lakers, talented and craving direction when Jackson signed
for $6 million a season and an extra $2 million per championship.
Jackson made the Lakers real again and himself rich, and now they
hand out rings and raise banners at Staples Center around Halloween
every year before getting down to the humdrum routine of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   Eight, which would match the best of the Celtics' run of titles,
are too many to fathom and seemingly impossible to replicate. O'Neal
is 30 and on the days his feet hurt, ponders retirement. Many of the
core players -- Horry, Fox, Brian Shaw -- are well into their 30s. As
difficult as it is to rework a roster in the salary-cap era, it could
be as much a strain to maintain established players and high-end
rosters in the luxury-tax era.</TE>
<TE>   But, four? Four could happen. Who knows, the challenge of it alone
could make the Lakers a decent regular-season team, though O'Neal
isn't expected for at least half a month, and Fox on Monday was
suspended for six games for initiating two fights against the Kings
in their exhibition game last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully," Fisher said, "that [challenge] will allow us to keep
things fresh and to keep a newer energy around ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Then, starting again around April, assuming a smooth recovery for
O'Neal, the Lakers will find themselves in their usual place, trying
something totally unfamiliar, if not unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, it'll probably override any other reason we'll
have to give our best this season," Fisher said. "I don't think
there'll be anything more important than that. We have so many
championship rings, so much championship experience. But, all of that
stuff has been done before. So I think this year is going to be about
separating ourselves from that.</TE>
<TE>   "Other teams have done what we've done in the past: Winning one
championship, winning two championships, winning three championships.
The Bulls have done that. This year, it's a chance to do something
that hasn't been done before in our eyes. We're young enough that we
can't understand the magnitude of what the Celtics did in the '50s
and '60s. So, for us, this is one of the biggest things in sports
history.... Obviously, you guys will have plenty of opportunity to
talk about why we don't look excited, or why we look lackluster when
we shouldn't, but overall, when healthy, we're able to sustain
championship-caliber basketball."</TE>
<TE>   They'll have the Kings to deal with, and although they will only
admit it with a raise of an eyebrow, their three-peat nearly died on
that floor in the pasture outside Sacramento last spring. As it
turned out, Game 7 ended five minutes late and the Lakers went on.
How far, exactly, they don't know. But, four doesn't seem out of the
question.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors changed the condition of Rollie Dykstra from critical to
serious Monday, nine days after the University of La Verne senior
quarterback suffered a severe head injury in a football game against
Redlands.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Garcia, a spokesman for Pomona Valley Hospital Medical
Center, cautioned that the difference in conditions for the comatose
player was slight. Dykstra remains in intensive care.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Dykstra Sr., the player's father, said a weekend conference
with his son's doctors had been "discouraging" regarding hopes for a
full recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Rollie Dykstra, 24, was injured while being tackled on a
second-quarter option run Oct. 19.</TE>
<TE>   He collapsed on the sideline minutes after being assisted from the
field, then experienced severe convulsions.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Dykstra and Rollie's girlfriend, Jennifer Ross, contend
that he'd probably suffered a concussion last month when he was
sacked eight times in a loss to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.</TE>
<TE>   After a 30-6 loss at Cal Lutheran on Oct. 5, he complained to Ross
of a "throbbing headache."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Rollie Dykstra told her he'd informed La Verne trainer
Jim May of his headaches, but Ross said Dykstra had received no
medical treatment before playing against Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   May and La Verne spokeswoman Deborah Mandabach have refused to
comment.</TE>

<LD>Ever been to a concert where the backup singer gets a chance to solo
and just takes over the stage?</LD>
<LD>   That's Robert Horry. He's the greatest backup singer in NBA
history. Try to name another non-superstar who has made more
contributions to championship teams.</LD>
<LD>   Horry is not The Man. With Kobe Bryant riding shotgun to Shaquille
O'Neal on the Lakers, Horry isn't even the sidekick. In the credits
his name would be in small type. But his name also belongs with some
of the winningest players to come through the league.</LD>
<TE>   That's why there's an interesting subplot to Phil Jackson's quest
to top Red Auerbach with a potential 10th coaching championship.
Horry has a chance to win his sixth championship ring, which would
equal the championship riches of Michael Jordan and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   Only 12 players have six or more rings. The majority of them
played for the Boston Celtics with the ring leader, Bill Russell,
winning 11 championships. And most of them are in or on their way to
the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Horry won't go to the Hall of Fame. Career averages of 8.1 points
and 5.2 rebounds won't get you to Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   But he already keeps company with the plaque-worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's five rings (three with the Lakers, two with the Houston
Rockets) already are as many as Magic Johnson has and two more than
Larry Bird.</TE>
<TE>   "You come into this league, you want to accomplish certain
things," Horry said. "You want to be the best you can be. You want to
make an All-Star team. You want to win some championships. I've won
five ... so that kind of makes up for not making an All-Star team."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the driving force behind any of his championships, never
won an NBA Finals most-valuable-player award. But it's hard to
imagine any of them happening without him. He comes through with the
support when it's needed most; like a FEMA check.</TE>
<TE>   There were all those three-point baskets he made against the
Orlando Magic when he helped the Rockets to their second consecutive
championship in 1995. There were his timely plays in the pivotal Game
4 of the 2000 NBA Finals in Indiana, and his three-pointer in Game 3
of the 2001 Finals in Philadelphia that ended the drama in that
series and made the rest a formality.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the shot of a lifetime. Lakers vs. Sacramento Kings,
Western Conference finals, Game 4. A loose ball found its way into
his hands as the clock was running down, and a quick three-pointer
ripped through the net to give the Lakers a 100-99 victory and saved
them from heading to Sacramento with a 3-1 series deficit.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Shaquille O'Neal, awarded his third NBA Finals MVP
after the Lakers swept the New Jersey Nets, dubbed Horry "The real
MVP" at the Lakers' victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Horry had a new identity. He had come to be known as a
guy who sleepwalked through the regular season, then showed up in the
playoffs. Now he's The Guy Who Made The Shot.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Houston, his off-season home, Horry was a marked man at
the NBA-heavy pickup games. Whenever Horry's team reached game point,
Maurice Taylor would say: "Make sure Rob doesn't get it. You know
he's going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Every winning team needs someone like Horry. In the 1980s, Michael
Cooper played that role for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the central players in the Chicago
Bulls' six championships, but each three-peat had its own Horry.
Jackson, the coach of those squads, mentioned John Paxson in the
first go-round and Steve Kerr for the sequel.</TE>
<TE>   But the player he expounded on was Bill Cartwright, the Bulls'
center on those '91-'93 ring teams.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a guy that was the glue that kind of held a lot of the
pieces together," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing the comparison to Cartwright, one of Jackson's favorite
players, is high praise from the Zen Master, and it shows just how
far Horry has come in Jackson's eyes since he began coaching the
Lakers in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "In the process of getting this team together he was one of the
very first guys I picked on," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   He told Horry that he could do better than the five points and
four rebounds a game he averaged the previous season. From afar
Jackson had seen the same thing everyone else saw -- mediocre
statistics despite special talent -- and assumed Horry just wasn't
trying hard enough.</TE>
<TE>   Now he simply says, "That's Robert," which sometimes is the only
explanation that works.</TE>
<TE>   "What he does measures yards ahead of the points and assists and
rebound totals that he has, because he defers to other people,"
Jackson said. "He just knows more than most of the guys about what's
going on and how to get it done on the floor -- especially
defensively."</TE>
<TE>   Horry has come so far that now he gets special privileges.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think I've got to coach everybody," Jackson said. "But
he's the one guy I tell the guys, 'If Robert's done something on the
floor, then I know he's got a reason for doing it, because what he
sees on the floor sometimes I don't see.' "</TE>
<TE>   A fair benefit. Horry may not get superstar calls from officials,
but he gets winner's perks from his coach.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson knows he wouldn't have had a chance to pass Auerbach
without Horry. Whenever anyone ascends to greatness, there's always a
guy like Horry helping out behind the scenes, ready to step up and
hit the right note.</TE>

<HD>Do Not Adjust Your Television Sets</HD>
<DH>NBA undergoes radical change by becoming first major pro
league to show its games predominantly on cable TV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NBA is continuing its "Love It Live" campaign, which began last
season. Only this season, it could more accurately be expanded to:
"Love It Live, Because You Won't See Many Games if You Don't Have
Cable or Satellite TV."</LD>
<LD>   As a new season dawns, so does a new television era for the NBA.
Maybe they should call it the CNBA--the Cable National Basketball
Assn.--as the league becomes the first in major professional sports
to show its games predominantly on cable TV.</LD>
<LD>   Under a six-year, $4.2-billion contract completed in January -- it
has been called the most complex sports television contract in
history -- not only did ABC replace NBC as the network carrier, the
number of regular-season network games was cut from 34 to 14.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, ESPN and ESPN2, involved in NBA coverage for the first
time since the 1983-84 season, will televise 76 games and incumbent
TNT will offer 52.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of it this way," said Greg Hughes, TNT senior vice
president. "The NBC weekend package has moved to Thursday nights on
TNT, and the former TNT package is now on ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   A key aspect of the new deal is that most of the games on TNT are
exclusive, meaning they can't be carried by local outlets such as
Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net. In fact, TNT has a "Tickets or TNT"
campaign going, explaining that the games on its schedule can only be
seen by those with game tickets or TNT.</TE>
<TE>   TNT's exclusivity doesn't mean that Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net
will be deprived of more Laker telecasts than in the past. TNT can
show the Lakers nine times, with six telecasts being exclusive, and
ABC has four Laker games exclusively. That's a total of 10 Laker
telecasts exclusive to national TV. Last season, NBC had 11.</TE>
<TE>   What will hurt Laker carriers Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net is that
now games on ESPN and ESPN2 don't have to be blacked out in the
markets of the participating teams.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, with a big production budget and such new technological
gimmicks as a "free flight" camera suspended on cables and "floor
cameras" placed on the court under glass, figures to steal at least
some viewers from Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net will get hurt even more in the
playoffs. Only the opening game of the first round of the playoffs
can be televised locally.</TE>
<TE>   The loss to the Lakers in local television rights money during the
playoffs could be $2 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   Most playoff games will be televised by ESPN or TNT. Only the NBA
Finals and a few selected early-round games will be on ABC. The
conference finals will be exclusively on cable, the West on TNT, the
East on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   If this deal had been in effect last season, none of the seven
games of the Western Conference finals between the Lakers and
Sacramento Kings would have been available in non-cable households.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, that is 37% of the market. In the inner-city, the
percentage of non-cable households is even higher. If baseball had a
television contract similar to the NBA's, 37% of Los Angeles would
have been deprived of the Angels' run to the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   So why did the NBA make a deal that will deprive so many people of
games? Doesn't the league want its games to reach as many viewers as
possible?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but ...</TE>
<TE>   Cable can pay more. Cable has two revenue streams -- money
generated by advertising, plus money generated by subscriber fees.
That's why ESPN pays at least $50 million more a year for NFL rights
than ABC, CBS or Fox.</TE>
<TE>   And now TNT is seeking a 10% increase in its monthly subscriber
fee, from 72 cents a subscriber to 79 cents. That doesn't sound like
much until you consider that TNT reaches 87 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators have already voiced resistance to this increase,
and it's an issue that could become heated after Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But, for now, TNT executives are licking their chops, excited
about their new exclusivity. And why shouldn't they be?</TE>
<TE>   "This deal is not only a value to us," said TNT's Hughes, "it is
also a value to all of cable television. It will bring more viewers
and more subscribers to cable television."</TE>
<TE>   TNT opens with a doubleheader tonight that features the Lakers
playing San Antonio at Staples Center in the nightcap. The game will
be a TNT exclusive, meaning the pregame ceremony featuring the
raising of the championship banner and the presentation of the
championship rings will also be on TNT only.</TE>
<TE>   Just how much time TNT will be able to devote to the ceremony
isn't known. It could get short shrift if the first game,
Philadelphia at Orlando, runs long.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a joke," said Paul Sunderland, the Lakers' new play-by-play
announcer. "The ring presentation should be on local television and
shown in its entirety. There's no way TNT is going to devote much
time to it, particularly if the first game runs long.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not blaming TNT. I think the league needed to step up and
make an exception in this case and let Fox Sports Net also televise
the game."</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, TNT's parent company, AOL Time Warner, paid dearly
for exclusivity. Disney, the parent company of ABC and ESPN, also
paid dearly for ESPN to be able to televise games side-by-side with
local carriers. The Lakers' game at Portland on Wednesday night will
be televised by both Channel 9 and ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the league began negotiations on the new
television contract, it appeared as though this one might be the
first to show a monetary decrease. But through some clever
maneuvering, Commissioner David Stern and his staff came up with a
deal that represented a monetary increase, at least on paper.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if Stern were a car dealer, and when AOL Time Warner and
Disney came in to buy new cars he said, "Have I got a deal for you!
We'll throw in all kinds of accessories if you pay just a little
more."</TE>
<TE>   Stern got Disney to agree to pay an average of $400 million a year
over six years and got AOL Time Warner to agree on a package worth
nearly $300 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The combined rights fee of nearly $700 million a year is almost
$80 million year more than the average rights fee NBC and Turner
Broadcasting (now owned by AOL Time Warner) were paying under terms
of the previous contract.</TE>
<TE>   But since much of the money on the new contract is back-loaded to
the later years, the increase in national television revenue from
last season to this season is minimal. In fact, some sources say
there actually is a decrease.</TE>
<TE>   And part of AOL Time Warner's portion included joint ownership of
a proposed new cable channel that would televise four games a week.
That project was shelved for now, and AOL Time Warner instead paid
$45 million for an 11% stake in an existing channel, NBA TV, that is
available on satellite and digital cable. The plan now is to begin
showing games on NBA TV after the Feb. 9 All-Star game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>High points of the NBA's new television era:</LD>
<LD>   NBC, which televised 34 games last season, is gone after a 12-year
relationship with the NBA. However, Bill Walton is not gone. He'll be
the lead commentator for games on ABC and ESPN, working with
play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, which hasn't televised NBA games since the 1972-73 season,
will televise only 14 regular-season games, and none before
Christmas. The brunt of ABC's weekly schedule begins Feb. 16.</LD>
<TE>   During the postseason, ABC will televise the NBA Finals and a few
early-round games. But the conference finals will be exclusively on
cable. TNT has the Western Conference finals, ESPN the Eastern
Conference finals. TNT and ESPN will share in most of the early round
coverage. Only the opening games of the first round will be televised
locally.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, which hasn't televised the NBA since the 1983-84 season,
will televise 68 regular-season games and ESPN2 will televise eight.
The ESPN schedule generally consists of a single game on Wednesday
nights and a doubleheader on Fridays. Nessler and Walton will
announce the Wednesday night games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' first regular-season appearance on ESPN will be
Wednesday night, when they play at Portland. The game is the nightcap
of a doubleheader that has Washington and Toronto playing in the
first game.</TE>
<TE>   All Laker games will still be televised either nationally or
locally. It's just that when they play on Thursday nights they'll
only be on TNT, and when they're on ESPN the game will also be
televised by Channel 9 or Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' first national TV appearance will be on TNT Nov. 14,
when they play host to Orlando. Their first ESPN appearance will be
Nov. 22, when they play at Denver. The Clippers will make six
appearances on ESPN and four on TNT. They will appear only 25 times
on local TV, all on Channel 5. The Clippers and Fox Sports Net have
not been able to reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   TNT, televising the NBA for a 19th consecutive season, will carry
52 regular-season games, 48 of those on Thursday nights. TNT will
also televise the All-Star game Feb. 9 in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   TNT's Thursday night doubleheaders are exclusive, meaning local
telecasts will not be allowed on those nights.</TE>
<TE>   TNT has two other exclusive dates for doubleheaders -- opening
night and Martin Luther King Day, the third Monday in January.
Because of TNT's exclusivity, the Lakers' opener tonight against San
Antonio will only be televised on TNT. Fox Sports Net is not allowed
to televise the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cable blackouts are a thing of the past. ESPN and TNT (on
non-exclusive dates) do not have to black out Laker telecasts in Los
Angeles to protect the local carrier. Laker telecasts on ESPN, home
and away, will run side-by-side with Laker telecasts on Channel 9 and
Fox Sports Net. Same with TNT on the non-exclusive dates.</TE>
<TE>   ABC can televise a team a maximum of four times. NBC could
televise a team 11 times, so the number of exclusive telecasts -- six
on TNT and four on ABC -- remains roughly the same.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning sometime after the Feb. 9 All-Star game, games will
appear on NBA TV, a league-owned channel available on satellite and
digital cable. AOL Time Warner, TNT's parent company, is a minority
owner of the channel. Eventually, the NBA and AOL Time Warner plan to
create a new channel.</TE>
<TE>   "NBA Fast Break" will make its debut on ESPN2 Nov. 5 at 6 p.m. The
weekly two-hour show will take viewers to arenas around the league in
a fast-paced, whip-around format. Kevin Frazier is the host.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, there will be Spanish-language national
telecasts. Telemundo will televise 15 games on Saturdays and Sundays,
beginning Nov. 10. The studio host for Telemundo will be Andres
Cantor, best known for his "goooooooooaaaaaallllll!" calls in soccer.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Thomas will test the free-agent market after spending his
entire career with the Chicago White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time American League most valuable player told the White
Sox on Monday he will exercise his right to become a conditional free
agent. Thomas has until Dec. 7 to sign with another club or return to
the White Sox. Chicago General Manager Kenny Williams and Thomas'
agent, Arn Tellem, said they will continue negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas signed a contract in 1997 that was to pay him $9.9 million
in each of the next four seasons, including $3.8 million deferred
with interest. Thomas sat out most of last season after tearing a
triceps and batted only .239 before the All-Star break. He finished
at .252 with 25 home runs and 92 runs batted in, and the White Sox
invoked a "diminished skills" clause, which would allow them to cut
his salary. Chicago can pay Thomas as little as $250,000 plus $10.1
million deferred over 10 years without interest.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Piniella was introduced in a news conference at Tropicana
Field as manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays after finalizing a
four-year, $13-million contract that makes him the second-highest
paid manager in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella had asked out of the final year on his contract with
Seattle so he could seek employment closer to his home in Tampa, Fla.
The Mariners agreed to allow the Devil Rays to negotiate with
Piniella after Tampa Bay met their demand for All-Star outfielder
Randy Winn as compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella has a record of 1,319-1,135 in 16 seasons, the last 10
with the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Winn batted .298 with 39 doubles, nine triples and 14 home runs in
2002 and drove in 75 runs as the Devil Rays' leadoff hitter.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays also received minor league shortstop Antonio Perez
in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Art Howe was introduced as manager of the New York Mets,
succeeding the fired Bobby Valentine. Howe was released from the
final year of his contract in Oakland and signed a four-year deal
worth $9.4 million. Howe managed Houston for five years beginning in
1989 and took over the A's in 1996. He has a record of 992-951 in 12
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Macha will be introduced as manager of the A's today, his
agent said. Macha was the team's bench coach under Howe the last four
seasons. A's General Manager Billy Beane did not outright confirm the
appointment but left little doubt about his intentions: "I would say
that continuity, given what we have available to us, will be very
important. I think it would be somewhat foolish not to ... continue
on that path."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Wedge, 34, will be introduced today as Cleveland manager, a
team source told Associated Press. Wedge will be the youngest manager
in the major leagues. He managed Cleveland's triple-A team at Buffalo
the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins are not renewing the contract of John Routh,
43, who helped create Billy the Marlin and has worn the mascot outfit
since the Marlins' first game in 1993. A team official said Routh's
salary, estimated at $75,000, wasn't a factor in the decision.</TE>

<HD>Super Bowl in Pasadena Is a Good Sign for Moag</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The man leading the charge to bring an NFL team to Pasadena
thinks it's a very good sign that the league is considering the Rose Bowl
as a Super Bowl site.</LD>
<LD>   "We take this as a vote of confidence and it's deeply
appreciated," John Moag said Monday. "With it comes the
responsibility for us to produce, and that's what we will concentrate
on."</LD>
<LD>   Moag, the chairman of a Maryland sports investment-banking firm,
cleared the way for the Cleveland Browns to move to Baltimore. Now he
is working to position the Rose Bowl for a team, having accepted that
assignment at the behest of the league. He envisions a completely
reconstructed Rose Bowl that would seat roughly 65,000.</LD>
<TE>   The Times reported Monday that league officials meeting with team
owners in New York this week will recommend they award a Super Bowl
to Los Angeles with the game to be played at the Rose Bowl. The
proposal has already received a stamp of approval from the NFL's
Super Bowl committee. Although the proposal does not include a
specific date, the 2008 game is being targeted by league officials.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will introduce the proposal Wednesday,
in part to demonstrate the league is serious about moving forward in
L.A., which has been without an NFL team since the Raiders and Rams
left after the 1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   No decision on an L.A. Super Bowl will be made at this meeting;
the earliest such a vote would take place would be at the league
meetings in March.</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong sentiment among NFL owners to bring football
back to L.A., provided it involves a new or entirely refurbished
stadium. Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said Sunday he is confident
an existing team will have moved to the nation's No. 2 market within
four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will happen sooner rather than later," he said. "If
you nailed me on it, I'd say 48 months on the outside."</TE>
<TE>   League sources say the San Diego Chargers have the inside track on
the L.A. market, although the Indianapolis Colts have been considered
a candidate for some time.</TE>

and results were negative.</TE>

<LD>Andy VanHellemond, the NHL's director of officiating, calls himself
"the coach of the 84 officials" who referee or work the lines at
league games.</LD>
<LD>   And like a good coach, he knows the ultimate reward for those he
oversees is ice time. That means if any officials don't adhere to the
new standards for calling obstruction fouls, VanHellemond has an
answer.</LD>
<LD>   "I have 12 American Hockey League officials chomping at the bit,"
he said. "Unless an official wants to go to work in the AHL to learn
how to do it, they're going to do it. I don't want to have to do
that, and I think we can all do this right."</LD>
<TE>   Regarded as one of the NHL's top referees during most of his
25-year career, VanHellemond spent four years working for the East
Coast Hockey League before returning to the NHL as an executive for
the 2000-01 season. When the NHL phased in the two-referee system for
every game, he helped reeducate officials who had previously worked
alone and instinctively followed the puck but missed other
infractions.</TE>
<TE>   Having two sets of eyes to look for the clutching and grabbing
that has bogged down the game is making the crackdown effective.
Being sure the on-ice officials divide responsibility and see as much
of the action as possible has helped, too.</TE>
<TE>   "If both were looking at the puck, they weren't looking at the
players who didn't have the puck, and that's where the most trouble
is," VanHellemond said. "It's taken a year or two to change that
thought process. They have to be accountable and responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "The puck does move quick, and the game has gotten quicker. The
transition is so much quicker, and now a team will break out three on
one, rather than two on one, because the player who used to get
tangled up is now free to join the rush. There are fewer players
tackling and mugging in front of the net too."</TE>
<TE>   He also said officials have been given firm definitions of
obstruction, leaving no gray areas. VanHellemond reviews tapes of
every game and sends clips to admonish those who miss calls, but he
won't immediately condemn anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll say, 'I know it's easier to see from video,' " he said.
"Unless you've been on the ice, you don't know how quick someone can
cut in front of you and block your view of something. With the size
of some defensemen and players, you've got to move around them and
past them."</TE>
<TE>   VanHellemond will issue report cards to the officials Nov. 23 and
then every 20 games or so. No lapses will be tolerated from
officials, he said, either within games or late in the season, when
officiating traditionally gets looser.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect referees to be the same from Minute 1 through Minute
60, and throughout the season," he said. "Overall, things have been
good. I think the players understand what we're trying to do and are
buying into it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux Still the Best</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by a fast start in which he has averaged more than two
points a game, Pittsburgh Penguin captain and owner Mario Lemieux is
facing the first real test of his stamina.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, 37 and three seasons into his comeback from retirement,
played consecutive games Friday and Saturday, for the first time this
season, and had two assists in each game. But now comes the tough
part: The Penguins' game against Washington on Monday was the third
in a sequence of four games in six nights, and that grueling stretch
should give him a good read on the status of his balky back and
troublesome hip. It didn't help matters Monday when Lemieux took a
puck in the mouth and needed 25 stitches. In true Lemieux fashion, he
returned to score the decisive goal in the Penguins' 3-2 victory</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Lemieux missed all but 24 games last season because
of hip problems but said he intends to play as close to a full season
as he can.</TE>
<TE>   His timing couldn't be better. The obstruction he long complained
about is vanishing, leaving him better able to capitalize on his
strength and still-remarkable skills.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still not much room, because teams are playing sound
defense," he said during a conference call with reporters. "They all
have pretty good systems defensively. But for sure, you're able to
skate a little bit more freely and that's making the game a lot
faster. The speed of the game has improved quite a bit so far in the
first couple of weeks. For that reason, there's a lot more scoring
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe it's going to stay like that for the whole year.
I think the league is seeing a big improvement in the way the game is
being played. I'm sure they're going to keep it that way, hopefully
forever, [and] bring back the game we had in the '70s and '80s, where
it was pretty much a skating game, puck movement, the give-and-go. I
think that's back in the game now. It's great to see."</TE>
<TE>   Switching from his helmet to his owner's hat, he said the Penguins
are awaiting the outcome of state elections to determine whether they
will get government help in financing the construction of a new
arena. The Mellon Arena, better known as the Igloo, is aging rapidly
and lacks the bells and whistles new arenas can offer. The Pittsburgh
Pirates got a new stadium and the Philadelphia Phillies will move
into a new home next year, both built in part with taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a new arena, Lemieux said, "is very important for us to be
successful in the future, to stay viable. Our point of view hasn't
changed in the last couple years. We're still working very hard to be
ready when we have to go to the state and city and county. We need a
new facility just to remain competitive with the rest of the market."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fleury on the Mend</TE>
<TE>   Theo Fleury, suspended indefinitely by the NHL Oct. 8 for
violating terms of his substance-abuse aftercare program, has resumed
working out. However, it's not clear when he will return to the
Chicago Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mike Smith recently told the Chicago Tribune that
Fleury "seems to be doing OK," and that's good news. But the question
remains why the Blackhawks let the dependable and prolific Tony
Amonte leave as a free agent last summer and signed Fleury, who comes
with a full set of emotional baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Personal problems put Fleury on a roller coaster last season while
he played for the New York Rangers, and his erratic behavior meant
they couldn't count on him consistently. Too many aggressive
penalties -- not to mention a run-in with the San Jose Sharks' mascot
-- were signs he was struggling to control his emotions. Too often,
he lost the battle and as a result, hurt the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks helped Bob Probert through a treatment program and
figured they could guide Fleury through his problems. That's
admirable, but Fleury apparently is still seeking equilibrium. And
even if he can return to the lineup soon, Fleury, who signed a
two-year, $8-million contract, isn't going to help the Blackhawks in
the long term. Amonte would have been a far better investment, but
the Phoenix Coyotes grabbed him for $24 million over four years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Kudos to the Minnesota Wild, the team that was expected to suffer
the most as a result of the obstruction crackdown because it relied
so heavily on defense and slowing the tempo of games. Coach Jacques
Lemaire has done a fine job of making sure his players abide by the
new standards, and he has created a good environment for the
development of forward Marian Gaborik, a budding superstar. The third
pick in the 2000 draft, Gaborik was named the NHL's player of the
week for scoring three goals and eight points in four games last
week. The Wild will take a 3-0-1 streak into its game against
Colorado tonight, the opener of a three-game homestand.</TE>
<TE>   Nice going, Rangers. They spent $70.5 million to sign free agents
Bobby Holik and Darius Kasparaitis and they're still heading toward
another non-playoff finish. There were 0-3-1 on their recent
homestand, prompting fans to chant for refunds. Goalies Mike Richter
and Dan Blackburn have had rocky starts, and the defense has been
disorganized. They won't get far looking for spectacular goaltending
to save them in every game.</TE>
<TE>   There's just no pleasing some people. While the Kings and Mighty
Ducks are trekking around North America for most of the first six
weeks of the season, Toronto Coach-General Manager Pat Quinn was
grumbling about having to play seven consecutive home games. Too many
distractions at home, he claims, and too easy to get stale. Here's a
solution: Pretend it's the playoffs and take the team to a hotel for
a couple of days. The Maple Leafs have an absurdly easy schedule --
their longest trip is four games, to Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and
New Jersey in late December and early January -- and they don't have
to visit Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose or Phoenix. Quinn should be
thankful the schedule maker was so kind, rather than complaining.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Blues are looking hard at signing free-agent goalie
Byron Dafoe. Injuries have depleted the Blues' goaltending and Dafoe
looks better by the day.... The Edmonton Oilers gave a two-year
contract extension to Patrick LaForge, the team's president and CEO.</TE>

<HD>Auckland Race Off at a Crawl</HD>
<DH>Louis Vuitton Cup resumes with nine America's Cup
challengers, but wind-limit delays testing sailors' patience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After taking four days off to avoid stealing any of the Angels'
thunder, the nine America's Cup challengers resumed racing at
Auckland on Monday -- Tuesday in New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   OK, what really happened was that the Kiwi weather god, K-Rod,
pitched a series of sliders across the Gulf that threw the Louis
Vuitton Cup into chaos. For nine of the 21 scheduled race days since
the trials started Oct. 1 the wind has blown too hard or too little
-- usually too hard.</LD>
<LD>   The only recent excitement occurred when software billionaire
Larry Ellison, bedeviled by four losses in five races, replaced Peter
Holmberg with Chris Dickson as helmsman-skipper of his Oracle BMW
boat from San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Holmberg was the world's No. 1-ranked match racer. Ellison praised
his skill as a driver but ... "We pick one leader and I support that
one leader right up until the very moment we make a change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Holmberg on the beach and the popular Paul Cayard on payroll
exile in San Francisco, Dickson drove the boat to a victory over
Italy's hapless Mascalzone Latino in his only appearance before
Monday, as the rest of the fleet grew ever more restless with the
weather.</TE>
<TE>   For that, the challengers have only themselves to blame. They
can't control the weather, but they do make their rules. They won't
start a race if the wind is blowing at more than 19 knots and will
stop a race if the wind is blowing at more than 23 knots.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend sailors commonly race in 19 knots, and 23 knots (26 1/2
mph) is not extreme.</TE>
<TE>   But the challengers came to believe before the previous Cup in
1999-2000 that the wind would blow harder during their trials in the
New Zealand spring than it would in February, when their survivor
would meet the defender, Team New Zealand. That left them with the
choice of building stronger, slower boats to survive rougher
conditions, or building lighter, faster but more fragile boats that
would be more competitive in the Down Under summer.</TE>
<TE>   The solution: wind limits.</TE>
<TE>   The joker in the hand they dealt themselves is that the scheme may
be based on a false premise. In February 2000, when the winds were
supposed to be light, they peaked at decent speeds of 13, 13, 16, 10
and 24 knots for the five races, all of which had similar results:
runaway wins by TNZ over Italy's outclassed Prada. And two days were
abandoned when the wind blew too hard.</TE>
<TE>   So this is the fine mess the challengers have gotten themselves
into.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get frustrated," says Peter "Luigi" Reggio, the
principal race officer from Connecticut whose job it is to get the
races run. "Otherwise, you'd go nuts. This is the way it is, and
you've gotta deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   The rules also say that Round Robin 2 must be completed next
Sunday to allow time for boats to be repaired and altered before the
quarterfinals start Nov. 12. So Reggio has stacked the schedule with
shorter 12.5-mile makeup races in the mornings before the regular
18.5-mile races in the afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the nine challengers will be eliminated by next week,
and that's between winner Mascalzone Latin with a 1-9 record before
Monday and France's winless Le Defi Areva.</TE>
<TE>   But there are serious issues at stake for the other teams too. In
the new Louis Vuitton Cup arrangement, the top four will advance to
the double-elimination bracket of the best-of-seven quarterfinal
matchups; the other four will fall into the single-elimination group.
Switzerland's Alinghi, well funded by young pharmaceutical
billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli and well driven by New Zealand
defector Russell Coutts, and Seattle's One World seem certain to make
the top four, but everyone else is scrambling -- especially Team
Dennis Conner. The America's Cup's best-known impresario seems to
have been hurt by last July's sinking of one of his Stars &amp; Stripes
boats off Long Beach more than he admitted or anyone suspected. That
boat, USA 77, is still being repaired, and the other, USA 66,
apparently is not fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   Team DC slipped to 4-7 with its third consecutive loss to
unheralded Sweden (5-5) Monday and still had to face Oracle BMW later
in the day.</TE>

<LD>World soccer's governing body moved Monday to quell the widespread
unhappiness with the quality of officiating at the World Cup, but its
actions sparked an immediate and furious outcry from CONCACAF.</LD>
<LD>   The FIFA Referees' Committee, meeting in Zurich, Switzerland,
"unanimously agreed that the best referees and assistants, working as
trios from the same country, should be in charge at the next FIFA
World Cup."</LD>
<LD>   The move came after a spate of incorrect decisions at Korea/Japan
'02, mistakes that affected the course of the tournament and led to
claims of conspiracy and the demand that the system be changed.</LD>
<TE>   At the insistence of Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, FIFA's president, the
selection of World Cup referees had been based on geography rather
than ability, and it was this practice that Spain's Angel Maria
Villar Llona, chairman of the Referees' Committee, moved to abolish
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Jack Warner, the president of CONCACAF and a FIFA vice
president, blasted the move, calling it "the worst refereeing
decision of all time."</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost impossible to understand the sheer self-interest and
thoughtlessness of those who made this decision," Warner said in a
statement released by soccer's regional confederation for North and
Central America and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   "This effectively means an almost impenetrable road-block for
referees and assistants from CONCACAF, from Asia, from Africa, from
Oceania ... indeed from all but the select few of the high and mighty
countries who do not mind taking all the playing talent from
elsewhere but do not want someone else to intrude.</TE>
<TE>   "Our collective refereeing development programs are now cut off at
the neck and shoulders.... Maybe the Referees' Committee, in its
total lack of wisdom, can tell the rest of us how to attract, retain
and improve referees and assistants when they know they will never be
invited to officiate at the most important events."</TE>
<TE>   Refuting FIFA's statement that the decision had been "unanimous,"
CONCACAF said that its two members on the Referees' Committee, Lisle
Austin of Barbados and Carlos Ortiz of El Salvador, had spoken out
against the plan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gold Cup</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Panama can clinch their place in the
semifinals of the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup tonight with victories
over Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays at 7 p.m. at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium
and the match will have special meaning for defender Joy Fawcett, who
will appear in her 200th game for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Fawcett, of Rancho Santa Margarita, made her debut for the
national team in 1987 and has since won two world championships and
Olympic gold and silver medals. She will be only the fourth U.S.
player to reach the 200-game mark, joining Kristine Lilly, Mia Hamm
and Julie Foudy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. switched goalkeepers Monday, with Siri
Mullinix being replaced on the Gold Cup roster by LaKeysia Beene.
Mullinix injured her left thumb during training in San Diego last
week and aggravated the injury Saturday. Beene has played 12 games
for the U.S. and will serve as backup to starter Briana Scurry.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Panama, which impressed many with its 4-2 victory over
Trinidad and Tobago Sunday, plays Mexico at 9, with the Mexicans, who
lost, 3-0, to the U.S. on Sunday, needing at least a tie to stay
alive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reyna Injured</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Reyna, the midfielder who helped lead the U.S. to the
quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup, was injured Monday when he fell
awkwardly during Sunderland's 1-1 tie with Bolton Wanderers in an
English Premier League game.</TE>
<TE>   Reyna, who has a long history of injuries, suffered what was first
described as a badly twisted left knee and was carried off the field
on a stretcher. He later left the stadium on crutches and with his
leg in a cast. The severity of the injury was not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lavolpe Moves On</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's new coach, Argentine-born Ricardo Lavolpe, stepped down
as coach of Toluca Monday, a day after leading the club to a 2-2,
come-from-behind tie with UNL and assuring it of finishing no lower
than second in the Mexican league.</TE>
<TE>   Lavolpe will assume his new post next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez Sees Red</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Sanchez's UNAM team, which had blasted seven goals past
Guadalajara only a week earlier, was humbled, 6-3, by San Luis in a
wild Mexican league game that saw Sanchez and three of his players
ejected.</TE>
<TE>   More remarkable still, Brazilian striker Marcelo de Farias scored
a five-minute hat trick for San Luis, with all three goals coming
between the 66th and 71st minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disco Kahn</TE>
<TE>   German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn found himself in trouble again
Monday, before Bayern Munich's must-win European Champions League
game today against Deportivo La Coruna.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn is recovering from a torn thigh muscle, but nonetheless was
fit enough to go golfing over the weekend. When the club learned that
the keeper also had gone dancing, Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing golf and going to a disco are two different things,"
Hitzfeld said. "There will be a fine for that. If you get injured,
you must work on getting fit, and a visit to a disco is not necessary
in that respect."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian Farce</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Brown, a starter on Argentina's 1986 World Cup-winning
team and now coach of Blooming in the Bolivian league, led his team
in a boycott of a weekend game against Bolivar in a dispute over pay
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Blooming scrambled to put together a youth team and,
not surprisingly, was crushed, 10-1. Many of the young players, aged
15 to 17, became ill during the journey to La Paz because they had
never flown before.</TE>

<HD>Trio Is L.A.-Bound for Elite 16</HD>
<DH>Smashnova, Maleeva and Dementieva earn final spots for WTA
Championships at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final rush for points and places in the Home Depot WTA
Championships ended Sunday in Linz, Austria, and Luxembourg.</LD>
<LD>   Moving into the final three spots were Anna Smashnova of Israel,
Maggie Maleeva of Bulgaria and Elena Dementieva of Russia.
Dementieva, a semifinalist in 2000, finished only 20 points in front
of Alexandra Stevenson, who probably will be the first alternate.</LD>
<LD>   Stevenson nearly made it with a late-season surge, beating
Conchita Martinez of Spain, Jennifer Capriati and Daniela Hantuchova
of Slovakia to reach the final at Linz.</LD>
<TE>   Justine Henin of Belgium beat an injured Stevenson, 6-3, 6-0, in
the final Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva and Dementieva got into the elite field because of
injuries to Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Amelie Mauresmo. Hingis
has withdrawn from the season-ending event -- which she won in 1998
and 2000 -- but Mauresmo has not officially given the word to the
WTA. Last week, Mauresmo's agent told Reuters that the Frenchwoman
would not be playing the championships at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   She suffered a knee injury practicing just before the Zurich event
earlier this month and pulled out of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible players are required to come to Los Angeles for the
championships, even if they are not able to participate, and face a
fine up to $250,000 for not showing up.</TE>
<TE>   The field consists of 16 singles players and eight doubles teams.</TE>
<TE>   Among the newcomers to the $3-million season finale, which starts
a week from Wednesday, are Hantuchova, Anastasia Myskina of Russia
and Smashnova.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being sidelined for almost the first seven months of the
season because of knee surgery, 1999 champion and last year's
finalist Lindsay Davenport of Laguna Beach qualified with a strong
late finish, reaching the finals at Moscow and Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   The top qualifiers are defending champion Serena Williams and her
older sister Venus, Capriati (who has lost three of her last four
matches), Belgians Henin and Kim Clijsters, Monica Seles, Hantuchova
and Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   This will be Seles' ninth appearance at the championships. The
28-year-old won it three years in a row, starting in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, she was one of the most pleased players when the
tournament moved back to the United States after one year in Munich,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Seles has refused to play in Germany since she was stabbed by a
fan in Hamburg in 1993.</TE>

<LD>Oh, to be a freshman the Monday after helping your team to a
much-needed victory.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Matt Moore and tailback Tyler Ebell polished off cups
of ice cream moments before conducting interviews that consisted
mostly of soft-serve questions. Moore talked about his mistake-free
college debut and Ebell about his fourth consecutive 100-yard rushing
game in a 28-18 victory over Stanford Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I was sore, but it was a good sore," said Ebell, who is 72 yards
from setting the UCLA freshman rushing record. "I'd take this feeling
every week if we win and I get 39 carries again."</LD>
<TE>   But a few hours later at practice the tone became more serious.
There is no way to sugarcoat the conditions expected Saturday at
Washington -- cold, wet and windy.</TE>
<TE>   Moore and Ebell, like most players from Southern California, could
not remember playing in bad weather -- at least not recently.</TE>
<TE>   "I played a Pop Warner game in Tehachapi in the snow once when I
was 10," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moore and Drew Olson, who is almost fully recovered from a
shoulder injury, will split practice time equally and both will play
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo will decide on a starter late in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's performance against Stanford had a positive impression on
coaches. He made three checks at the line of scrimmage and called an
audible, making the correct decision each time.</TE>
<TE>   Although he had trouble locating secondary receivers, his
inexperience was barely noticeable -- except when he asked coaches
why the clock hadn't stopped for the two-minute warning. "He thought
he was in pro ball," Toledo said. "That was funny."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who has made four appearances in relief, understands the
offense better than Moore, a consideration because there will be more
emphasis on the passing game this week.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is first in the Pacific 10 Conference in rushing
defense and ninth against the pass. "Drew does know the offense
better than Matt, he's farther along," Toledo said. "You can't win
football games being too simple."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle (foot), running back Manuel White
(hamstring) and cornerback Matt Clark (toe) will not play against
Washington.</TE>

<LD>USC moved up three spots to No. 11 in the bowl championship series
rankings on Monday because of a performance against Oregon that also
put several Trojans among the statistical leaders in the Pacific 10
Conference and the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Carson Palmer, who passed for a school-record 448
yards and five touchdowns against Oregon, ranks second in the
conference and eighth nationally in total offense at 291.9 yards a
game.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer has passed for 2,429 yards and 18 touchdowns with eight
interceptions. His 57 career touchdown passes are one shy of the
school record set by Rob Johnson in 1991-94.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer said he played his best game of the season against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was easy," he said after the game. "The offensive line
was doing such a great job, the running game was there. That opened
the play action. The receivers had a great game -- all those guys
were getting open and running good routes. We were just clicking."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman receiver Mike Williams, who had 13 receptions for 226
yards and scored twice against Oregon, is tied for third in the
Pac-10 with nine touchdowns. He also is third in the conference and
14th nationally with 6.25 receptions a game. He is fourth in the
conference and 16th nationally in receiving yardage at 102.4 yards a
game.</TE>
<TE>   Junior flanker Keary Colbert is fifth in the conference in
receptions per game (5.5) and seventh in receiving yardage (78.1).</TE>
<TE>   Freshman punter Tom Malone is tied for first in the Pac-10,
averaging 42.6 yards a kick.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Kenechi Udeze is third in forced fumbles with four,
fifth in tackles for loss, 12, and ninth in sacks, 5.5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With an open date Saturday, USC will practice today, Wednesday and
Thursday before taking the weekend off.... Linebacker Oscar Lua and
offensive lineman Eric Torres will speak today at an assembly at
Evergreen Avenue Elementary School in Los Angeles. Athletic Director
Mike Garrett will also attend.... Stanford, USC's next opponent,
leads the Pac-10 in rushing at 159.1 yards a game. Kerry Carter ranks
eighth at 50.5 yards a game and Kenneth Tolon II is ninth at 49.3.
The Cardinal is the only team with two players in the top 10. The
Trojans' Sultan McCullough, who played behind Justin Fargas against
Oregon, is fifth in the conference at 72.8 yards. USC ranks first in
total defense at 301.9 yards a game.</TE>

<LD>Britain said it was seeking to ban four militant Muslim groups that

<LD>   Home Secretary David Blunkett said he would submit the names of
the groups -- Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Sayyaf, the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan and Asbat al-Ansar -- to Parliament, which is expected to
approve the ban Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jemaah Islamiah is suspected of involvement in the Bali bombing
that killed more than 180 people this month.</LD>

Japanese officials arrived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for talks on
establishing diplomatic relations with the reclusive Communist state.</LD>
<LD>   The talks were made possible by an unprecedented summit between
the leaders of the two nations last month.</LD>

<HD>Fear of Collapse Adds to Disputes Over Jerusalem's Temple
Mount</HD>
<DH>An ominous protrusion in one of the holy site's supporting
walls pits Israelis and Palestinians against one another in a 'Battle
of the Bulge.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>What would happen if the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism,
the third-holiest in Islam and perhaps the most contentious plot of
real estate in the world, suddenly collapsed?</LD>
<LD>   As if there wasn't enough to worry about in the Middle East, a
group of Jewish archeologists is warning that a 35-foot-wide bulge in
the complex's southeastern supporting wall is in serious danger of
rupturing. An accident could prove especially deadly if it happened
during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins around Nov. 6
and is expected to draw up to 200,000 worshipers to the site. It is
also feared that even a small accident could trigger a new outbreak
of Israeli-Palestinian violence.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not a prophet. I can't say exactly when, but there is no
question that it will collapse," said Gabriel Barkai, an Israeli
archeologist.</LD>
<TE>   Israelis say they noticed the bulge about two years ago when it
was, in the words of Hebrew University archeologist Eilat Mazar, a
few months pregnant. Now, she says, it is at the equivalent of eight
months and on the verge of bursting.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see it with your bare eyes. It is protruding more and
more every time you look at it," said Mazar, who along with Barkai is
part of an ad hoc group of archeologists and political figures
calling themselves the Committee for the Prevention of the
Destruction of the Antiquities on the Temple Mount.</TE>
<TE>   The Temple Mount -- known to Muslims as the Haram al Sharif, or
"noble sanctuary" -- is part of the Old City of Jerusalem, captured
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. At the western retaining wall,
Jews come to pray and grieve for the temple that once dominated the
site and was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70. The top of the mount
is home to Al Aqsa mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock, the most
famous monument in Jerusalem's skyline.</TE>
<TE>   Although Israeli police patrol the site, day-to-day administration
is handled by an Islamic trust run mostly by Palestinians. All too
predictably, Israelis and Palestinians are at such loggerheads over
the protruding wall that the Israeli media have dubbed the entire
affair the "Battle of the Bulge."</TE>
<TE>   Among the points of contention are how serious the bulge is, who
should be responsible for fixing it and -- the omnipresent question
in the Holy Land -- who is to blame?</TE>
<TE>   "The usual stupidity prevails," said Oleg Grabar, a professor with
Princeton University's Institute for Advanced Study who has
occasionally been called on to mediate Holy Land archeological
disputes for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization. "Almost anything you touch in this part of Jerusalem
will cause some sort of problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Waqf, the Islamic trust in charge of the holy sites on the
mount, agrees there is a problem but says it can easily be fixed. The
trust erected scaffolding around the bulge early this year to begin
repairs, but it was stopped by Israeli police in April after some
Israeli archeologists complained that its approach could make the
problem worse. ("They were putting on a little glue here and there.
It was like treating cancer with aspirin," Barkai said.)</TE>
<TE>   From an office overlooking Al Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock, the
trust's director scoffs at the fuss created by the Israeli
archeologists.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a joke. It is all politics," said Adnan Husseini. "This
is something that we are able to fix, but Israelis want to use this
to create more tension in the atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Husseini says the bulge in the ancient wall dates back hundreds of
years and has been aggravated by various natural calamities, notably
a 1920 earthquake. Only about 20% of the repairs had been completed
when the trust was stopped by Israel. The plan had been to finish the
repairs before the winter rains, which could sharply increase the
risk of a collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli government will be responsible if there are lives
lost," Husseini said.</TE>
<TE>   The Temple Mount is notorious for the strong emotions it stirs. A
September 2000 visit to the site by Ariel Sharon, before he became
prime minister, sparked riots that marked the beginning of the
current Palestinian uprising. In 1996, the opening of a small exit to
a tunnel in the mount also set off riots among Palestinians, who
believed it was a nefarious plot to undermine the foundation of Al
Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock.</TE>
<TE>   The same Israeli committee that is warning about the bulge alleges
that the Islamic trust is trying to eradicate archeological evidence
that a Jewish temple ever stood on the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli archeologists point specifically to an ambitious
project that the Waqf started in 1999 to open a large mosque in an
underground vault known as Solomon's Stables. They complain that tons
of valuable archeological debris were thrown away in the process of
opening the site, and Barkai suspects that the laying of paving
stones for the mosque might have created a drainage problem that has
contributed to the growth of the bulge.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs a thorough survey by engineers to determine exactly what
is happening, but we can't get in," Barkai said.</TE>
<TE>   So rancorous is the atmosphere that the Israeli committee has
hired private aircraft to take aerial photographs of the site every
few weeks to look for construction work by the Waqf.</TE>
<TE>   But even within the Israeli government, there is disagreement
about the immediacy of the danger. Shmuel Ben-Ruby, a spokesman for
the Israeli police, says the archeologists may be overly panicked.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say that people are making more noise than is
necessary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has seized responsibility for the dispute because of its
sensitivity, and his office is trying to strike a compromise with the
Waqf to have the repairs completed. A team of Jordanian engineers
inspected the wall earlier this month and might be called on to
oversee the repairs. Another possibility would be to have the work
supervised by UNESCO, but Israel might object to involvement by the
U.N. agency, with which it has had a contentious relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's office declined comment on the matter, other than to say
in a statement by Cabinet Secretary Gideon Saar that "the Israeli
government believes this is a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is being dealt with discreetly for the sake of optimal
treatment," Saar's statement added. "We don't elaborate about it in
the media."</TE>

<HD>Nature of the Job Endangers Diplomats</HD>
<DH>Envoys must have wide contact with people of the host
nation. Homes often go unprotected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although they work in embassies fortified against terrorist threats,
thousands of U.S. diplomats across the globe live in homes where they
are as vulnerable to attack as Laurence Foley, the USAID official
gunned down Monday in Amman, Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   Foley's slaying prompted a call from the American Foreign Service
Assn. for the government to step up efforts to protect diplomats and
their families.</LD>
<LD>   "The threat used to be inside our offices. Now it's wherever we
gather," said John K. Naland, president of the association. He said
terrorists seem more willing to kill family members as well as U.S.
government employees, as they did in March in an attack on a church
in Pakistan, where a diplomat's wife and her daughter were killed.</LD>
<TE>   The association called for the State Department to expand security
to areas farther from embassies and to try to protect family members
as well as the embassy staff. It also called for the government to
speed up work on security improvements at U.S. Agency for
International Development facilities abroad. The upgrades have been
requested by the department but are hung up in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials declined comment on the proposals, but
one official said the department had been "working very hard" on
improving residential security.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department has poured more than $4 billion into
rebuilding embassies and taking other steps to improve diplomatic
security since two U.S. embassies in East Africa were bombed in
August 1998. But terrorists appear to be increasingly going after
"softer" targets. Earlier this month, a night club on the Indonesian
island of Bali was bombed.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. intelligence official said that while it was unclear
whether the attack on Foley was terrorism, "it doesn't look like a
robbery." Another U.S. official said Foley was not a CIA employee.</TE>
<TE>   The last killing of a U.S. diplomat in Jordan was in 1970, when
Palestinian gunmen shot Maj. Robert Perry, an assistant military
attache, at his home. The assassination came during a period of heavy
fighting between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordanian
troops.</TE>
<TE>   With its stable, pro-Western regime and well-developed security
apparatus, Jordan has generally been considered a relatively safe
Arab state for U.S. diplomats and businessmen. One U.S. official, an
expert on the Middle East, said it was especially alarming that the
killing had taken place in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very alarming. Jordan is known as a safe place," the
official said. "I have been with ambassadors in that part of the
world who were just totally exposed because it's always been such a
friendly environment to us. There's no history that would condition
us to take extra precautions there."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they are considering how to extend protection
for the 9,500 U.S. diplomats living beyond embassy walls around the
world. One option being explored, they said, is to step up protection
at homes.</TE>
<TE>   But officials acknowledge that cost is an issue, and that there
cannot be 100% protection when part of a diplomat's job is to have
wide contact with the people of the host nation.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that the
government has "done a lot in upgrading security at our embassies ...
and for some of our residences. But all over the world, we've seen
this terrible practice that, when we are able to better protect
'hard' targets ... then they go looking for other things."</TE>
<TE>   Under current rules, new embassies and consulates are set back
from the street 100 feet to protect them from car bombs and are
surrounded by perimeter walls and concrete barricades. In some
cities, embassy employees live in compounds or buildings with guards.
Sometimes they travel in cars with 3-inch-thick bulletproof windows.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department has an aggressive surveillance program around
U.S. government buildings and has increased its security staff more
than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Because of security risks, the State Department has moved family
members and nonessential employees out of Pakistan, Indonesia and
Yemen. In some places, such as Jerusalem, the department has declared
large swaths of a city off limits.</TE>

<HD>Anti-U.S. Feelings Bubble Up in Egypt</HD>
<DH>More and more, citizens of the Arab world's most populous
and influential country feel betrayed by and distrustful of America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Forty-six years ago, when the United States withdrew its offer to
help build the Aswan dam after Egypt recognized China, President
Gamal Abdel Nasser rallied his people in Cairo and shouted from an
elevated stage, "O America, may you choke to death on your fury!"</LD>
<LD>   In the streets below, the multitudes roared approval.</LD>
<LD>   Today, on the streets of Cairo, capital of the Arab world's most
populous and influential country, one hears an echo of those
anti-American sentiments from the past. Sometimes harsh and angry,
sometimes softened by a long-held admiration of the United States, it
is the voice of people who feel betrayed by and distrustful of
America and what is perceived here as its effort to rearrange the
Middle East at gunpoint.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd always looked up to the U.S.," said Gamal Mahfouz, 32, a
computer engineer. "I never liked its foreign policy, but I admired
its democracy and general system. After 9/11, everything the country
stood for seemed to disappear. It became judgmental and intolerant.
Isn't that why the U.S. was created--to get rid of intolerance toward
others? I don't look up to the U.S. anymore. Worse, I feel since 9/11
the American people, not just the American government, are against
the Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   The signs of tension, and the hint of risk, are everywhere. The
U.S. ambassador does not fly the American flag on his armor-plated
BMW as he moves about Cairo. The press is more adversarial toward
Washington than it's been in years, with the Egyptian Gazette
suggesting in an editorial that the United States might use the
"spoils of Iraq" -- oil -- to "tempt opponents into bowing to its
militarism." The British, Israeli and American flags were burned
during a downtown Cairo demonstration last month.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of a deteriorating American-Arab relationship was
underscored Monday by the slaying of Laurence Foley, an official of
the U.S. Agency for International Development, outside his home in
Amman, Jordan. Although a motive for the shooting was not immediately
established, his death raised fears in the U.S. community that
Americans themselves, rather than U.S. policy, could become the
target of Arab anger.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a comfortable time to be associated with the
Americans," said an Egyptian professional who has worked for the U.S.
Embassy here for more than 20 years. "My friends don't say anything,
[but] I know they don't approve. The other day my uncle, an old man,
said to me, 'When are you going to finish with the Americans?' When
you've got old, uninvolved people feeling like that, it's sad."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the souring mood in the streets, resident Americans in
Egypt, numbering about 16,000, encounter neither hostility nor
difficulty in their daily lives, and American visitors are welcomed
as graciously as ever by a people who have a justified reputation for
friendliness and moderation. It is not hatred that is in the air. It
is anger, disappointment, disillusionment and defensiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a hit with the Israeli peace treaty in '79," an Egyptian
journalist said. "We weren't ready for it. But we came around to the
view that, well, maybe we'll get something out of this. We didn't.
Then the alliance with the United States, and we said, 'Oh well, at
least you offer us protection.' Now, after Afghanistan, the green
light for Israel to do as it pleases to the Palestinians, the plans
for war on Iraq, there are educated Egyptians seriously asking if
we're next on your attack list."</TE>
<TE>   The emotional underpinning of Arab-American relations remains the
Palestinian question. Arabs accept that the United States has a
special relationship with Israel. But they believe the Bush
administration's unstinting support of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
and his tough military and economic actions in the Palestinian
territories negate any sense of evenhandedness. What they see forming
is an anti-Arab Israeli-American partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an attack on Iraq, the reaction on the Arab street
depends on a couple of things," said Edward S. Walker Jr., president
of the Middle East Institute in Washington and a former ambassador to
both Israel and Egypt. "One is if Israel were to join in and the
Arabs saw the war as one of Israeli aggression rather than one to
liberate the Iraqi people [as Washington contends]. If that happened,
we'd lose an embassy or two."</TE>
<TE>   Popular antagonism toward the United States puts many Arab
governments in a delicate position. Most despise Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein but want to avoid losing credibility with their people
or alienating Washington. They've let controlled demonstrations and
the state-run media condemn U.S. actions, but they gave Iraqi Foreign
Minister Naji Sabri the cold shoulder on his recent tour of Arab
capitals seeking support.</TE>
<TE>   "If it comes down to war, we are not going to allow our strategic
friendship with the United States to be jeopardized," Jordanian
Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher told the Council on Foreign Relations
in Washington last month.</TE>
<TE>   Like other U.S. allies in the region, Jordan is bending to
American influence, at least in part because Arab regimes are fragile
and the voice of the Arab world on the global stage is weak.</TE>
<TE>   Many of its neighbors have acknowledged that the U.S. might use
their facilities in a war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt is likely to give the U.S. military the same access to the
Suez Canal and airspace as during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. It is
not known if it would allow the United States to use its Cairo West
airport for refueling and troop transits, as it did in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   A war in Iraq, however, is one that no Arab leader wants. Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, whose government gets $2 billion a year in
financial assistance from Washington, has said he fears the Bush
administration does not comprehend the chaos an attack on Iraq could
unleash in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak's aides dismiss as naive and uninformed comments by
President Bush's national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, that
the Arab world would see a "march to democracy" if Hussein was
removed from power.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception among Arabs is that the peace has been damaged,
and maybe destroyed, by the United States letting Israel do anything
it wants," said Hafez abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think the anti-American mood is only temporary. If Bush
tomorrow ordered Israel out of the occupied territories and
reestablished Palestine, guaranteeing security for both states, I
think the feelings against America would change immediately."</TE>

<HD>Mt. Etna Eruption Blackens Sky</HD>
<DH>Smoke from the Sicilian volcano is seen as far away as
Libya. No villages are in danger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CATANIA, Sicily</DL>
<LD>Mt. Etna spewed columns of ash that blackened skies as far away as
Africa on Monday as lava streamed down its slopes. The magma set a
pine forest on fire and led officials to divert flights to the other
side of this Italian island.</LD>
<LD>   The air was thick and dirty over eastern Sicily, and on Malta, an
island 125 miles south of the volcano, ash blackened parked cars and
dirtied laundry hanging from balconies. Satellite photos showed that
the ash was carried as far as Libya in North Africa, 350 miles south
of Etna.</LD>
<LD>   From as deep as three miles, the volcano coughed up flaming stone
that soared more than 300 feet into the air. Lava flowed down the
mountain, but experts said Monday that villages were in no immediate
danger.</LD>
<TE>   Flights were diverted to Palermo, on Sicily's northwest coast,
because ash hampered vision and left runways slippery at Catania's
airport, the only large such facility in eastern Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   Sicily asked the Italian government to declare a state of
emergency, and state TV said soldiers might be sent in to join civil
defense workers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Catania's 350,000 residents carried umbrellas against the
black ash. Authorities banned motorcycles because of the slippery,
ash-covered roads, and Catanians were allowed to ride buses for free,
a step to encourage people to leave their cars at home.</TE>

<HD>Russia's Use of Gas Focuses Attention on Chemical Agents in
U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren and Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Russia's use of an unspecified gas to end a Moscow hostage crisis
last weekend is drawing new focus to claims that the United States is
also developing chemical agents that would be illegal if used in
warfare.</LD>
<LD>   Bush administration officials said Monday that they suspect the
gas used by Russian authorities was an opiate rather than a nerve
gas, the most lethal and feared agent of chemical warfare. They said
they based their view on interviews with victims conducted by
nongovernmental organizations and by other nations responding to the
scene.</LD>
<LD>   Controversy continued Monday as Russian officials persisted in
their refusal to identify the gas, which is believed to have caused
most of the 117 or more hostage deaths during the crisis. They said
only that it was a general anesthetic, such as one used in surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Bush administration officials voiced displeasure with the
Russians' refusal to disclose the agent. "There is a lot of
exasperation at the Russians' attitude and approach to this so far,"
a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Arms control experts said Russia's use of the gas, regardless of
its type, threatened to widen a "loophole" in a 5-year-old treaty
designed to eliminate chemical warfare agents.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, bans the development,
production and stockpiling of any chemical weapon for warfare -- even
such common chemicals as tear gas.</TE>
<TE>   However, it allows the use of certain chemical agents for "law
enforcement, including domestic riot control purposes."</TE>
<TE>   The fear, arms control experts said, is that Russia and other
nations are developing chemical agents for warfare under the cover of
using them for law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they said, the Russian action raises questions about
when chemical agents may be used on civilians. The experts are
divided on whether the Moscow hostage standoff, which involved armed
rebels in an ongoing military conflict, was a matter of law
enforcement or warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Other uses of military force, such as peacekeeping missions,
rescue operations and aspects of the Bush administration's war on
terrorism, may also fall into the gray area between police actions
and warfare, arms control specialists said.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that war was war, and now there is a whole
gradation of military activities that need to be taken into account,"
said Elisa Harris, a member of the White House National Security
Council during the Clinton administration. She said nations that
signed the chemical weapons treaty may have to clarify what
constitutes warfare at their next meeting, in 2003. The U.S. and
Russia were among the original signatories in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Russia apparently is not the only nation to develop so-called
nonlethal chemical agents. Some critics say the United States and
possibly other countries are developing chemical agents for domestic
and peacekeeping use that would be illegal in a full-scale war.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pentagon is actively assessing different types of calmative
compounds," or narcotic materials meant to incapacitate rather than
kill, said Edward Hammond of the Sunshine Project, a nonprofit group
that opposes the use of chemical weapons. The group is based in
Austin, Texas, and Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Science magazine reported that the National Institute
of Justice, the research arm of the Department of Justice, had funded
an experiment at Pennsylvania State University to gauge the effects
of inhaled calmative gases and pepper spray, a crowd-control agent.
The report said the research could lead to "weaponized" Valium and
other chemicals for use in crowd control.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunshine Project has posted a contract on its Web site,
www.sunshine-project.org, in which the Office of Naval Research
agreed to pay Penn State $88,750 to study the "utility of delivering
nonlethal effects against personnel."</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials acknowledge that the Pentagon has developed
"riot control agents," such as tear gas and pepper spray, that have
been used in Haiti and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon office responsible for such weapons, the Joint
Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, has received "unsolicited proposals"
for so-called calming agents, "but no funding has been put forward to
support any of that research," a defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Calming agents are not in the U.S. inventory, nor are there any
plans to develop any," said Bryan Whitman, a senior Pentagon
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Arms control specialists said the alleged U.S. research, combined
with Russia's use of gas last weekend, signals that some provisions
of the Chemical Weapons Convention may be deteriorating.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Hunts U.S. Envoy's Killer</HD>
<DH>Islamic extremists are main suspects in shooting death of
diplomat in capital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>Officials said Monday that they would focus on Islamic extremist
groups known to be operating in Jordan as they began hunting those
responsible for the slaying of an American diplomat who was gunned
down outside his home here.</LD>
<LD>   Laurence Foley, a 60-year-old employee of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, was struck by at least seven bullets in
the head and torso as he was about to step into his car, parked in
his gated driveway in a quiet, affluent neighborhood. His wife,
Virginia, who was home at the time of the early morning shooting,
told officials that she saw a man whose face was masked by a kaffiyeh
headdress fleeing on foot.</LD>
<LD>   The killing came at a time of rising tensions in the Arab world
due to the United States' support of Israel and possible military
action against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan is considered one of the region's most stable states and is
also one of America's closest allies in the Arab world. However, it
has strong cultural and commercial ties to neighboring Iraq, and
there is considerable public opposition here to aiding the United
States in any strike against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Security surrounding American diplomatic personnel and other
foreign envoys in Amman was heightened in the wake of the shooting.
Diplomatic vehicles were seen moving about the capital under the
escort of Jordanian special forces in jeeps with mounted machine
guns.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy urged American citizens in Jordan to be vigilant,
but Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm Jr. declined to discuss specific
measures. Jordan is home to about 9,000 U.S. citizens, many with dual
Jordanian and American citizenship. Gnehm noted that the U.S. State
Department has referred repeatedly to "the concerns we face in this
region."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, 10 men were detained in connection with an alleged
plot to kidnap U.S. Embassy employees in Amman as they were out
jogging.</TE>
<TE>   A number of militant Islamic groups have had a well-established
presence in Jordan. Osama bin Laden has fired the imaginations of
many young men here, and substantial numbers of Jordanians were among
those who spent time at his Al Qaeda terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official in Washington speculated that the assassination
might have been the work of the Al Qaeda network, in part because of
the prior threat of kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some pretty clear indications that the network is now
more active in Jordan," said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. But there has been no recent or specific intelligence
about Al Qaeda going after embassy or USAID personnel, he said. U.S.
officials added that so far, they had seen no links to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A leading Al Qaeda activist known as Abu Qatada, who was arrested
in London last week, is a Jordanian of Palestinian extraction. More
than half of Jordan's population is Palestinian, and authorities say
they wage a constant battle to prevent militant Palestinian groups
from using the kingdom as a staging ground for infiltration into
Israel and the West Bank. The Jordanian government has cracked down
hard on groups it considers a threat.</TE>
<TE>   The militant Islamic group Hamas made Jordan a key regional base
until most of its members were expelled after the ascension of King
Abdullah II in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1999, authorities broke up a so-called millennium plot to
attack Israelis and Americans at hotels and tourist sites in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   At the sprawling, fortress-like U.S. Embassy in Amman, hundreds of
employees gathered for a "very somber, very sad" meeting hours after
the attack, said press spokesman Justin Siberell. Foley, a onetime
Peace Corps volunteer who spent his career working in aid and
development projects, was remembered as a warm and openhearted
colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all simply devastated," Gnehm told journalists, his voice
cracking. "We're outraged by this incomprehensible act. There can be
no possible explanation for a heinous act of this kind."</TE>
<TE>   The ambassador called those behind the killing "cowardly and
evil," pledging: "We will not rest until they are found." King
Abdullah, among many other Jordanians, had called to express sympathy
and support, Gnehm said.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials in Washington said it was too soon to say
whether the killing was a terrorist attack, Jordanian officials
voiced suspicions that it might have been just that.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking more for political motives, without ruling out
anything else," Information Minister Mohammed Adwan told reporters.
He said there had been no claim of responsibility and no arrests
made, but he indicated that members of known extremist groups would
be under intense scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "We know practically all the groups that can do something like
this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers said an attack targeting an American diplomat
should not have been unexpected, given sentiments in Jordan about
both a looming confrontation in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian analyst Labib Kamhawi warned of an increase in
anti-American feelings in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the beginning of a new wave of violence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Foley's neighborhood of yellow-stone villas and apartment
buildings, a large bloodstain could be seen next to his burgundy
Mercedes with diplomatic license plates, which was parked under a
grape arbor inside the wrought-iron gate.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, a tanker truck arrived and workers used a hose to clean
away the stain, along with traces of fluorescent pink powder left
behind by investigators dusting for footprints. The door to the
Foleys' home bore a small skeleton, apparently a Halloween
decoration.</TE>
<TE>   Reem Rafidi, who lives just opposite, said that at 7:20 a.m., the
time of the attack, she was awake and giving her children breakfast
but did not hear any shots. She did not realize anything was amiss
until police cars arrived. The Foleys were among a dwindling group of
Americans in the neighborhood, she said. A number have moved to areas
closer to the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Adwan, the information minister, said he believed that Foley was a
target of opportunity, as opposed to being specifically selected
because of his duties.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just an American diplomat to them," he said. "Whoever did
it knew his habits. I'm sure they'd been watching."</TE>
<TE>   Foley, a native of Boston who made his home in Oakland, Calif.,
began his public service career as a Peace Corps volunteer in India
in 1965. He served as the Peace Corps' associate director in the
Philippines and worked for USAID in Bolivia, Peru, Zimbabwe and,
beginning this year, in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Only a day before he was slain, Foley had received an award at the
embassy honoring him for humanitarian work. "Larry represents the
very best in America, a man dedicated to his country and to helping
other people," Gnehm said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Foley is survived by two grown daughters
and a son. Funeral arrangements were pending.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian authorities said they would willingly cooperate with any
American law enforcement agents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fairly confident that sooner or later we will catch up to
those who committed this crime," said Adwan. "Whoever is behind this
is targeting American interests, but also at the same time targeting
Jordan, attempting to destabilize us, trying to send a message to the
U.S. and all moderate countries who are allied with the U.S."</TE>

<DL>BANGUI, Central African Republic</DL>
<LD>Heavy fighting rocked this capital Monday as Libyan-backed government
troops battled rebels loyal to a former army chief for a fourth day,
residents said.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Bangui reported hearing automatic weapons fire about
a mile north of the residence of President Ange-Felix Patasse.</LD>
<LD>   Rebels have held the area since Friday. Despite heavy shelling
over the weekend by government soldiers, neither side appeared to
have gained much ground by Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In New York, a "deeply concerned" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan condemned the uprising and called on the rebels to lay down

small peacekeeping force in the area, Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department described security as uncertain and advised

<HD>Putin Promises Tough Anti-Terror Measures</HD>
<DH>Russia won't succumb to blackmail, president says.
Meanwhile, hostages' relatives vent anger over deaths, while others
call raid a success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin promised Monday to widen the
military's powers to take tough measures against terrorists as
Muscovites mourned the deaths of more than 100 hostages from a gas
used by security forces during a controversial weekend rescue
operation.</LD>
<LD>   Putin said he would enable the Russian military to take its attack
against terrorists anywhere they have bases, organizations, financial
backers or ideological supporters.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have still not released the name of the gas used in
Saturday's effort to free about 750 people held by Chechen rebels at
a Moscow theater, but they insist it was a general anesthetic such as
those used in surgery. About 400 of the freed hostages remained
hospitalized Monday.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Embassy officials said Monday that Western doctors had
examined some of the released hostages and concluded that the gas
used was probably an opiate rather than a nerve gas, as some had
speculated.</TE>
<TE>   There were some inconsistencies in the death toll. A Health
Ministry press release Monday put the number of hostages killed
during the operation at 117, one lower than the figure announced a
day earlier by Moscow health officials.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 50 hostage-takers were killed during the operation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that one of two American citizens who were
among the hostages was killed. They have tentatively identified the
slain man but were awaiting confirmation before releasing his name.
Media have reported that an American named Sandy Alan Booker, 49, of
Oklahoma had not yet been accounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Although anger is growing among bereaved relatives about the
extent of casualties and the use of the unidentified gas to knock out
hostages and terrorists, many Russians called the raid a success.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Putin said Russia would never succumb to blackmail by
terrorists. He warned of a growing threat that international
terrorists would attack using means similar to weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "International terrorism is getting more and more arrogant and is
behaving more and more cruelly," he said. "If someone even tries to
use such means against our country, then Russia will retaliate with
measures adequate to these threats."</TE>
<TE>   Putin did not elaborate on his declaration that his security
forces would go anywhere terrorists or their supporters are based,
but it was widely assumed that he meant not only Russian territory
but such neighboring nations as Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Putin declared Monday a day of mourning, and Russians thronged to
the theater where the hostages were taken captive Wednesday night
during a performance of the musical "Nord-Ost." On a black, wet
evening, they piled flowers knee-deep and coaxed candles to light in
the wind and rain.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the mourners praised Putin's handling of the crisis,
arguing that there was no other way to resolve the deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   Oksana Yermokova, 29, manager at a cable television company, stood
silently staring at the flowers and the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very sorry for those who died. But I believe that given
the number of hostages, the number of casualties is unfortunately
acceptable," she said. "I think [the raid] was the one and only
correct way out."</TE>
<TE>   Like many, she said the use of gas was "a necessary measure,"
despite the fact that it is blamed for almost all of the deaths among
hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Gennady Milov, 67, a neurologist who came to mourn, said he felt
sorry for the dead but "there was no other way."</TE>
<TE>   "Only about 15% of the hostages died," he said. "That's normal, by
international standards. Otherwise it could have been close to 1,000
dead. Everything was done in the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Galina Dmitreyeva, 65, said the operation was "successful and
timely. Putin handled himself very correctly and courageously."</TE>
<TE>   But one bereaved father, interviewed by telephone, was furious.
Sergei Karpov said he found out only Monday that his son Alexander,
31, had died. The father searched for three days with little help
from the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Karpov said he would not take any of the $3,150 in compensation
offered by the government to victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   "I found my son in a morgue today. I am going to sue the state in
court for killing my son. Now I am looking for a good lawyer," he
said. "I am going to sue them through the nose, and it is not about
money. It is about moral principles."</TE>
<TE>   Controversy continued Monday over the continuing refusal of the
authorities to give details on the gas used in the operation, despite
requests from several foreign embassies.</TE>
<TE>   The chief doctor of the Russian Emergency Medicine Center, Irina
Nazarova, said in an interview on Echo of Moscow radio that none of
the doctors knew what kind of gas they were dealing with when
hundreds of unconscious patients were brought to hospitals Saturday
morning after the rescue operation. Nor were they issued any special
antidote by the government; they used what medications they had on
hand.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta on Monday quoted an indignant
doctor who entered the theater just after the security forces moved
in and complained that authorities should have warned medical staff
of the gas they were planning to use.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors lacked even enough stretchers to deal with hundreds of
unconscious hostages, delaying the evacuation of the gas-filled hall,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we approached the building, we were shocked. We saw piles of
bodies, lying on the front steps," said the doctor, who requested
anonymity. "Those whom we lost died from suffocation on their vomit
or by their tongues, from cardiac arrests, or because we could not
ventilate them in time.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply did not have enough stretchers," he said. "If only we
had known in advance. They could at least have warned us we would
have to take out a lot of unconscious people with arrested breathing
and heartbeats, then the result might have been better.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody even thought about the consequences of use of this gas,"
the doctor added. "If people were organized, I think that we could
have saved more people. And amid this turmoil, we were told to do
everything faster, faster, faster!"</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, meanwhile, a Chechen envoy said the separatist
republic's leader, Aslan Maskhadov, was seeking talks with Russia to
resolve the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities also announced the arrest of a middle-ranking
police officer who allegedly helped the terrorists by giving them
information by mobile phone.</TE>

<HD>Secretive Moscow Reminds Some Russians of Soviet Era</HD>
<DH>Information about the hostage crisis and its deadly
resolution remains murky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>When it was over, state television showed the slain leader of the
Chechen hostage takers, Movsar Barayev, posed with a cognac bottle
near his hand. Officials declared that the women who had threatened
to blow themselves up in a crowded theater were drug addicts with
needle tracks on their arms and syringes at their feet.</LD>
<LD>   And for more than a day, officials stonewalled, refusing to
release the information that a mysterious gas used by rescuers was
the actual cause of death for all but two of the hostages who were
killed.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities still have not told doctors any details about the gas
used to subdue Chechen militants and their hostages inside a Moscow
theater, so the knowledge could be used to treat the former captives.</LD>
<TE>   Control of information by the government from the seizure of the
theater during a performance of the musical "Nord-Ost" on Wednesday
to the Saturday rescue that left more than one in seven hostages dead
has struck many people here as a retreat to Soviet-era methods of
propaganda, evasion and half-truths.</TE>
<TE>   While many Russians accept that the loss of many hostages might
have been unavoidable, there were signs Monday of increasing
bitterness that authorities were not open throughout the crisis and
its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Karpov gave one example of a Kafkaesque distortion of the
facts after the death of his son, Alexander, 31, a well-known
libretto writer.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't believe the absurdity of it," Karpov said. "Today in
the morgue they handed me my son's death certificate. [It] stated as
cause of death: 'murder.' And the diagnosis: 'victim of banditry and
terrorism.' What kind of medical document is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Statements in the official media during the crisis seem at
variance with what hostages later reported, especially regarding the
decision by special police to storm the theater and details
concerning the health effects of the gas.</TE>
<TE>   When the raid began about 5:30 a.m. Saturday, officials told
reporters it was because the Chechens had begun to carry out their
threat to execute captives. In one published report, the first two
executions even took place on the auditorium's stage.</TE>
<TE>   Former hostages, however, later said they remembered nothing of
the kind.</TE>
<TE>   There were no summary executions. A shooting in the auditorium had
been hours earlier, between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m., when one hostage
gave in to stress and threw a bottle at a female captor.</TE>
<TE>   A Chechen then shot at him, but instead killed a man and fatally
wounded a female hostage sitting in the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Two other incidents cited in the early morning hours Saturday --
that there were explosions going off inside the theater and that a
large group of hostages had staged a breakout attempt that caused the
Chechens to open fire as they fled -- also remained uncorroborated.</TE>
<TE>   Reports that the Chechens inside were drinking and using drugs
contradicted later recollections.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't drink, didn't smoke, didn't swear," said one hostage,
Mark Podlesny. "They were very disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the special police moved in on the theater, government
officials launched a steady stream of statements portraying the
operation as an unqualified success.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters were told initially that all the hostages were saved and
that all the foreign hostages were safe. At a time when workers were
piling up dozens of bodies of those already dead from the gas on a
sidewalk outside the theater, a deputy interior minister, Vladimir
Vasilyev, was stating for the cameras that only about 10 might have
been killed.</TE>
<TE>   In his updates to reporters, he at first made no reference to the
fact that a chemical agent had been used, or that virtually all the
hostages found inside were unconscious and needed urgent medical
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Also, initial reports did not say that the female hostage takers,
unconscious in the auditorium from the effects of the gas, were shot
to death while they slept to prevent them from regaining
consciousness and setting off explosives they had strapped to their
bodies.</TE>
<TE>   While the number of dead Chechens was revealed almost
instantaneously by Vasilyev, the scale of death among the hostages
was released piecemeal over two days, allowing state broadcasters and
government officials to drive home the idea that the operation had
been an overwhelming success.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexi II declared that he was pleased
the seizure had ended "without bloodshed."</TE>
<TE>   And instead of being shown the wards overflowing with unconscious
former hostages struggling to breathe, TV viewers saw President
Vladimir V. Putin in a white hospital gown chatting with a group of
released hostages who looked to be in near-perfect health.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei Piontkovsky, director of the Independent Institute for
Strategic Studies, called the official behavior "simply disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   "All these lies about terrorists beginning to execute the
hostages, etc. They didn't even admit at the beginning that they used
gas. But when it was no longer possible to hide it from the public,
they had to admit they did, but they never told the people -- even
the doctors -- what gas they used," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "So the doctors all over Moscow were receiving unconscious
patients and they didn't know how to treat them. And the patients
continued to die."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said the government's actions needlessly endangered
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is asking the authorities to disclose military secrets and
inform the public about the chemical formula of the agents used,"
said one doctor, allowing himself to be identified only as Valery,
who treated dozens of the patients at a central hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "But authorities could have at least told the people in common
parlance what is being done to them, to prevent the hostages from
feeling like guinea pigs. But, as often in Russia, nobody thought
about people's feelings and bothered to inform them."</TE>
<TE>   "What worries me is the volume of lies which are being thrown at
us from all directions, from the authorities, from the papers, from
the television. It suddenly feels as if we are back in the Soviet
Union," said psychiatrist Alexander Kolmanovsky.</TE>
<TE>   "The odd thing is that it is not that they are trying to hide some
terrible secret. They just lie to us instinctively about everything,
beginning with the nature of the toxic agent they used," Kolmanovsky
said. "Why don't they come out and tell people what gas it was and
explain properly that there was a tough necessity to use it? And
people would understand them. But instead they prefer to lie."</TE>
<TE>   The attack by hostage takers in the heart of the capital was all
the more shocking because many Russians had begun to think of the war
as practically over. During the past two years, state control over
national television news broadcasts has grown with the elimination of
two independent stations. Russians have been seeing little news about
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of using the crisis to educate viewers about the
Chechen situation, the government, if anything, was even more strict
about keeping Chechen viewpoints off the air.</TE>
<TE>   A pro-Chechen Web site was suddenly blocked, and the Press
Ministry said it was pulling the license of a small Moscow television
station that had carried statements from the Chechen side. Echo of
Moscow radio, which presents independent news reports, also was told
that its Web site would be blocked for similar reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Kolmanovsky, the psychiatrist, said he believes attempts to
distort the truth can only come back to haunt the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually more and more people will begin to question the
actions of the authorities, because lies are counterproductive,
especially when they are bundled on top of each other like this every
day," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Debates Who Has Last Word on Iraq</HD>
<DH>In Security Council, France and U.S. parse sentences over
what offense would trigger an attack on Baghdad, and who would be the
judge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley and Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>As the United Nations enters a crucial week in its lengthy
deliberations over Iraq, Washington and Paris are discussing a
compromise that could push the Security Council to agreement.</LD>
<LD>   France and the U.S. agree that there should be "serious
consequences" if Iraq refuses to prove it has disarmed. But they have
been deadlocked over what those consequences should be and who has
the authority to decide them.</LD>
<LD>   In the compromise, France may grant the U.S. its desire to have
the term "material breach" in a resolution -- which the U.S. argues
would justify military action -- as long as the U.S. concedes that
only the Security Council has the power to decide whether Iraq has
committed one. France "will accept 'material breach' as long as you
get the words around them right," said a council diplomat Monday.
"It's feasible that we could have an agreement this week."</LD>
<TE>   The latest compromise is still in early stages, with the United
States rejecting France's Sunday night overture and offering a
counterproposal Monday. But the nations are edging closer after more
than six weeks of wrangling over language, sparking optimism in
word-weary diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing our best now to come to a solution that will produce
unanimity by the council," said a French envoy. "It's not clear if we
will manage to do it, but there's no reason to think it's
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   In the tussle over language, France's key concern has been not so
much Iraq's disarmament as keeping the United States from acting
without U.N. approval, diplomats say. In the sometimes arcane art of
diplomacy, concepts may get boiled down into simple words laden with
political meaning and precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dancing on the head of a pin," another envoy said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Iraq debate, it all comes down to "material breach." On its
face, the phrase means a violation of a resolution, but in the
contentious discussion on Iraq, it means war.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Security Council already found Iraq in material
breach of its disarmament requirements -- in Resolution 707 from 1991
-- the U.S. wants to not only note the past violations, but add that
any more violations would constitute a further material breach.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Material breach' is not a subjective term," said Richard A.
Grenell, spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N. "It's a statement
of fact."</TE>
<TE>   To the U.S., that fact would provide the legal foundation for the
use of military force. In December 1998, the U.S. used a similar
argument as a basis to bomb Baghdad as punishment for blocking
inspectors. Ambassadors wince when they recall that they were in a
Security Council meeting when they heard about the bombing from a
security guard who saw it on CNN. "It was a surprise attack," said
one Security Council diplomat. "Not only on them, but on us."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of attack is exactly what France is trying to prevent.
Because the U.S. is so insistent on having the term in the
resolution, France suspects that "material breach" conveys not only
the authority to go to war, but the right of the U.S. to judge by
itself whether a breach exists.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush also has said that if the U.N. fails to take action
against Iraq, the U.S. will assemble a coalition of allies to act on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   Paris and other council members believe that it is up to the
council to decide on a breach, and has proposed new paragraphs in the
draft resolution to keep any "consequences" as part of a clear
sequence.</TE>
<TE>   First, the chief weapons inspectors must report if Iraq has failed
to comply with the terms of the resolution. Next, the council would
meet to determine whether Iraq is indeed in material breach, and if
so, it would discuss the next steps. Then, with council agreement --
but not necessarily a new resolution -- a coalition of council
members and allies could enforce the decision, which would probably
mean the use of military force.</TE>
<TE>   It seems simple. But last week, Security Council ambassadors spent
part of a session arguing about a comma. The omission of a single
word such as "and" could allow the U.S. to attack Iraq just for
leaving items of weapons materiel off a declaration required within
30 days of the resolution's passage -- before weapons inspectors even
go back to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   All these details give diplomats a headache. "We need to find a
compromise on language that is beyond ambiguous interpretations,"
said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, the Mexican ambassador who holds a key
swing vote on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to negotiate these fine details with such
great importance when English is a second language for most of us,
and there are different legal backgrounds," said Bulgarian Ambassador
Stefan Tafrov. "It is better to be clear."</TE>
<TE>   Until the details do become clear, ambassadors spend their time on
the phone to each other and their home countries, faxing paragraphs
back and forth. Diplomats and their resident Iraq experts from the
five veto-holding countries -- the U.S., Britain, France, China and
Russia -- are ferried in black limousines to each other's embassies
to hash out the resolution, line by line.</TE>
<TE>   Walking to and from the Security Council, they are thronged by
cameras as if they are movie stars, as reporters with tape recorders
shout questions.</TE>
<TE>   This evening, the full 15-member Security Council will meet to go
over any changes in the resolution that the U.S. formally introduced
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been listening to suggestions and thinking about changes
that would strengthen the resolution," Grenell said. "But no
decisions have been made."</TE>

<HD>State Spent Its Way Into Budget Crisis</HD>
<DH>Davis, legislators of both parties lavished windfall on
programs. Analysts see years of pain ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey L. Rabin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During Gray Davis' term as governor, California's state budget has
gone from a record surplus to a record deficit.</LD>
<LD>   When the state treasury was flush with cash, the governor and
lawmakers from both political parties pushed state spending to new
heights. In part, that money was spent to expand programs --
especially in education -- that locked the state into future
spending.</LD>
<LD>   But when the economy faltered and revenue sank, the governor and
the Legislature kept spending at near the levels they established
early in Davis' term. So now, instead of having billions in the bank,
the state is borrowing billions from the future to pay today's bills.</LD>
<TE>   Republican Bill Simon Jr. has criticized Davis for his handling of
the state budget, saying that he would bring smarter fiscal
management to a state that has seen its fortunes reverse in recent
years. Indeed, California's deep fiscal problems will be a
front-burner problem for the next governor -- no matter who wins Nov.
5.</TE>
<TE>   The seeds of the state's budget difficulties were sown in
Sacramento and on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis took office in January 1999, the stock market was
climbing toward a historic peak. The state's high-tech economy was
turbocharged. Silicon Valley was booming.</TE>
<TE>   The surging stock market pumped new money into state coffers,
helping to build a surplus of $8 billion in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   State income tax receipts just from taxpayers exercising stock
options and taking capital gains on the sale of assets more than
doubled from nearly $8 billion in 1998-99 to $17.6 billion in
2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Tim Gage said administration officials
understood that the windfall from stock options and capital gains
would not last forever and tried to set aside a portion of the extra
money for one-time spending programs.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the governor and lawmakers responded to the state's good
fortune by embracing sharply higher spending, particularly for
education. The state also embarked on a major expansion of health
coverage for uninsured children, more college scholarships and raises
for state employees. Lawmakers also gave back money to taxpayers in
the form of reduced motor vehicle fees.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two budgets of the Davis administration, the state's
general fund spending shot up by $20 billion, accelerating a growth
trend that began in Gov. Pete Wilson's second term. Those spending
plans won approval with solid support from Republican lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Kennedy, cabinet secretary to Davis, said that when Davis
became governor, he was determined to address "16 years of pent-up
demand" for school funding, transportation and health care for
uninsured children.</TE>
<TE>   During Davis' tenure as governor, state spending for kindergarten
through high school education increased by $15 billion to $56
billion, a 37% jump.</TE>
<TE>   Per-pupil spending on California public schools has risen from
$5,756 to $7,067 a year, a 23% increase since the last budget of the
Wilson administration. From near the bottom, Davis administration
officials said, California's spending per pupil has climbed toward a
middle ranking compared with other states.</TE>
<TE>   Student fees for California residents at the University of
California, state colleges and universities, and community colleges
were cut 5% during Davis' first year in office -- with the state
government stepping in to make up the difference. The reduction
followed a similar decrease in the last year of Wilson's
governorship. Those fees have not gone up.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to extend health coverage to uninsured California
children, enrollment in the state's Healthy Families program has
increased more than twelve-fold to 624,000. The program is expected
to cost the state $672 million this year, more than six times the
amount in Wilson's last budget.</TE>
<TE>   During the boom years, lawmakers also reduced the fees charged at
state parks and enacted tax breaks for business, teachers, research
and development, child care and elder care.</TE>
<TE>   But when the tech bubble burst, the income tax windfall from stock
options and capital gains abruptly ended. State revenue plummeted by
15%, the largest drop since the Great Depression. And the state's
cash reserves were being eroded by $6 billion on spending for power
purchases during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The speed with which the revenue dissipated was just shocking,"
said Tom Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Since the peak in early 2000, the stock market's steep slide has
slashed income tax receipts by more than $10 billion, according to an
estimate from the legislative analyst's office.</TE>
<TE>   Finance chief Gage said the stock market dive caught everyone by
surprise. "No one saw this coming, at least not to this magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   While the downturn depressed revenue in many states, California
and its high-tech economy suffered a particularly hard blow.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, economist Lieser said, the state's income tax has
become the most important revenue source, providing half of the funds
needed to support general fund programs. Sales, bank and corporation
taxes are the other major sources of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to have become more dependent on high-income taxpayers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst has reported that more than 40% of all of
the adjusted gross income in the state is earned by the top 5% of
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   That makes the state treasury more vulnerable to economic slumps
that depress income and revenue from taxes on capital gains and stock
options.</TE>
<TE>   "The capital gains part has been a bit of a wild card," said
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been real volatility in that element of the personal
income tax."</TE>
<TE>   Hill has warned that without legislative action to boost revenue
or cut spending, the state's financial problems will persist for
years to come.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, Simon has been sharply critical of Davis,
saying the governor has "completely mismanaged the state budget."</TE>
<TE>   "He turned a record budget surplus into a record budget deficit,"
Simon said during the debate with Davis this month in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At campaign stops, Simon ridicules Davis for a 36% increase in
state spending over three years -- more than double the rate of
inflation and growth in population.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate calls such rapid growth in spending "a
prescription for disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Davis defends his record, noting that the state's "schools are
getting better" and many more children have health care.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials also point out that spending always
fluctuates with the economy and note that there were rapid spending
increases during the tenure of Republican governors, including Wilson
and George Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, the budget problems peaked this summer, when he and the
Legislature were confronted with a $23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   To close it, the governor and lawmakers relied primarily on a
series of stopgap measures, including the use of extensive borrowing,
to produce a $98.9-billion budget. In the process, they broke another
record: The budget was 67 days late.</TE>
<TE>   One area where the state has borrowed from the future involves
tobacco settlement money. This year's budget includes $4.5 billion in
future tobacco settlement money to pay current bills. Otherwise, much
of that money would have gone to support health programs in future
years.</TE>
<TE>   Gage defended the decision to borrow against the tobacco
settlement money. "We needed to help cushion the blow of a
significant and abrupt decline in revenue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The budget adopted in September also relies on speeding up some
tax collections and pushing some expenditures into the next fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   After a yearlong hiatus, the state's financial woes triggered a
quarter-cent sales tax increase last January.</TE>
<TE>   To help ease the budget crunch, tax credits for teachers and
businesses with net operating losses have been temporarily suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Davis acknowledged when he signed the budget that "it is not a
perfect document." But the governor insists that he took a balanced
approach to the spending plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget I signed did not have any tax increases, and in fact,
did protect our priorities of public safety, public education, vital
programs for seniors and our Healthy Families insurance programs," he
said during the debate. "I had some revenue increases, and I had some
cuts, and I had some one-time deferrals."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Simon has been vague about his solutions for the
state's budget problems and has failed to offer specifics about where
he would cut expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the state's economic woes, neither side in Sacramento has
rushed to cut spending.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, Davis and
lawmakers in Sacramento have engaged in "massive ostrich behavior."</TE>
<TE>   "They really refused on a bipartisan basis to do anything but pray
and borrow from the future."</TE>
<TE>   The latest overall state budget, including all spending, was
trimmed by about 2.4%, or almost $2.4 billion from the previous year.
The general fund, which supports most programs such as schools,
higher education, law enforcement and prisons, was cut a scant 0.2%,
or $141 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although UCLA economists foresee a modest improvement in the
state's economy next year, Lieser said Sacramento is not out of the
woods. "It's going to be a very frugal fiscal environment for several
more years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) was among those
legislators who approved the burst of new spending early in the Davis
administration. But when the revenue picture darkened and "it came to
managing the problem of the budget," Davis was "just slow to act,"
Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   He and most other Republican lawmakers refused to vote for the
last two Davis budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Cox likes to simplify the differences between the two political
parties over the budget. "One side believes it's an expenditure
problem. The other side believes it's a resource problem," he said.
"Our side believes smaller government is better. The other side
believes bigger government is better."</TE>
<TE>   That brought a sharp retort from Davis' cabinet secretary, who
said Republicans like to talk about spending cuts but don't like to
vote for them. "The Republicans who say it's an expenditure problem
should put up or shut up," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Levy predicted that the budget crisis will be back the
day after the election because Democrats and Republicans in
Sacramento failed to come to grips with the fundamental imbalance of
revenue and spending.</TE>
<TE>   "The party of investing colluded with the party of fiscal
responsibility in this little boondoggle," Levy said.</TE>

<HD>Film Agency's Chief Finds Himself in D.A. Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry, Anita M. Busch and Ted Rohrlich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In just over a decade, Cody Cluff transformed himself from a
controller at an Orange County solenoid factory to Los Angeles' film
czar.</LD>
<LD>   An accountant by trade, Cluff was assigned by city and county
elected officials to woo Hollywood players -- to keep them shooting
films and TV shows here, rather than in other states and countries
busy rolling out red carpets of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Cluff, head of Los Angeles' Entertainment Industry Development
Corp. since its creation in 1995, has helped streamline a vital part
of the Hollywood production process by making it easier to obtain
filming permits while keeping relative peace in affected
neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   But the way he spent the agency's money has also led to trouble.
With carte blanche access to his agency's multimillion-dollar
treasury, the ambitious entrepreneur treated himself and those he
courted so well that he and the nonprofit agency are now under
investigation by the district attorney's office for possible misuse
of agency funds.</TE>
<TE>   The probe has cast an embarrassing spotlight, not only on Cluff,
but on the elected officials who created the EIDC as an experiment in
privatizing government functions. They appointed themselves as its
overseers, then all but ignored it, except as a source of campaign
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Without close scrutiny, Cluff expanded the scope of the
$5-million-a-year enterprise while running it out of his hip pocket.
For example:</TE>
<TE>   * Hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in corporate expenses
were paid for with Cluff's personal credit cards because the EIDC
never used a corporate line of credit. Cluff and EIDC employees say
they charged everything from office equipment to travel and
entertainment expenses, with bills of about $30,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   * Cluff set his own $200,000-a-year salary package, including an
$1,800-per-month housing allowance.</TE>
<TE>   * Under Cluff's stewardship, the EIDC spent $3 million on an
online film permit system that never worked.</TE>
<TE>   * Cluff directed one quarter of the EIDC's fiscal 2001 charitable
donations to youth and public school programs in Covina, where he
grew up and his children have gone to school.</TE>
<TE>   * Cluff negotiated a $340,000 contract to develop a Web site and
database for the online system with a firm controlled by a longtime
EIDC board member and production company president, Frank Scherma.</TE>
<TE>   * And Cluff directed $185,000 in political contributions to
candidates and elected officials, including 19 members of the EIDC's
board, the only entity with power to rein in the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The degree of disengagement by public officials in a position to
regulate the EIDC's activities has been extreme. All members of the
county Board of Supervisors and Los Angeles City Council
automatically serve on the EIDC board, but few attended meetings,
which were often canceled for lack of interest. Those who did show up
were satisfied with a six-line annual budget. The city's chief
administrative officer, William Fujioka, was required to audit the
EIDC every two years. But he did not, saying his office was too busy.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, when money and a public policy is involved, you see a
little more vigorous oversight on the part of elected officials,"
said Steve Frates, senior fellow at the Rose Institute of state and
local government at Claremont McKenna College. "In 25 years of
looking at local government, I can't recall another example of this
kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cluff contended that using his personal credit
cards to pay for the EIDC's day-to-day operations was not unusual. It
happens all the time in private business, he said. He conceded,
however, that he is "not the best administrator." When asked recently
at a public meeting how much his agency had in cash reserves, Cluff
said he didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said he has been taken aback by the district attorney's
investigation because, until it began, he had received good reviews
from elected officials. In fact, in 1998, the City Council and the
Board of Supervisors each voted unanimously to extend the life of
Cluff's agency for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC was set up as a private nonprofit corporation -- an
effort to show that private enterprise could do a better job than
government. But the district attorney says that because the EIDC
performs government functions -- handling film permits -- and
collects public funds such as use fees for fire department
supervision of film sets, it qualifies as a local government agency
under state law.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion over the EIDC's status is unlikely to be resolved soon.</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors file criminal charges, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley
predicted, appellate courts will probably decide whether the EIDC is
a public or private entity. "Both sides are going to fight this one
to the death, because it's so important in terms of defining what
government is and what government isn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's questionable expenses, according to legal documents,
included 100% tips and a $350 bottle of wine.</TE>
<TE>   To the district attorney's office, such spending is evidence that
Cluff lived high on the EIDC's funds. "It stinks," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. David Demerjian, head of the public integrity division.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said that the EIDC is a private agency and that he spent
money properly, wooing production people in Hollywood who help decide
where films are shot.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to go hang out with Joe Schmo bureaucrat," said
Cluff, 43, who shaves his head and dresses Hollywood casual. "They
want to hang out with somebody who's cool, who gets it."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said Hollywood people are accustomed to being "treated like
royalty" by film commissioners in other states soliciting film and TV
shoots. In fact, some regularly provide free air travel, hotels and
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said that when he walks into a bar or restaurant with
clients, he wants to be waved right in. "The feeling needs to be that
I'm known, respected in the environment, and that everything going on
around us has to be top shelf," he said. "Otherwise, we can't
compete."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said he regards his expensive but fruitless attempt to issue
permits online as his biggest failure. He also acknowledges that the
disproportionate charitable contributions he directed to his hometown
of Covina -- $12,700 during fiscal 2001 -- might have been a
misjudgment. He defends the political contributions as appropriate,
intended to cultivate powerful supporters to whom he could turn when
filmmakers ran into jams.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it has not decided whether to
file any charges. Seventy boxes of documents seized from the EIDC's
offices last month are still being cataloged. Authorities have since
raided the accounting firm that audits the EIDC's books and the home
office of the property manager to whom the EIDC sends Cluff's
residential rent checks.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they had taken the unusual step of seizing the
EIDC's records only after being stonewalled.</TE>
<TE>   Nine times in as many months, Los Angeles county officials asked
for unfettered access to the EIDC's financial records. Nine times,
the EIDC refused, arguing that some of its data are proprietary.</TE>
<TE>   A Way Around Red Tape</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC was created after years of lobbying by TV and film
producers. Delays cost money, and the notoriously fast-moving
industry was frustrated by lethargic bureaucrats in separate city and
county film offices. Filmmakers had to navigate public works, fire,
police and other departments whose services were needed for film
shoots.</TE>
<TE>   It was a real pain, said Jim McCabe, a location manager for more
than 20 years who last worked on "Spider-Man." "It was up to the
production companies to bird-dog it, and you had to know how to get
around the system. EIDC created a shortcut and became the great
facilitator."</TE>
<TE>   As threats mounted in the late 1980s and early 1990s that
productions would leave Los Angeles, politicians began taking the
complaints seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County was the first to act, contracting with the
nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   The scion of an extended family of Arizona farmers and ranchers,
Cluff moved to Covina in the fifth grade. After graduating from Cal
State L.A., Cluff worked as an auditor for PriceWaterhouse, then as
controller for the solenoid manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, at age 30, was hired as a consultant at the Economic
Development Corp. and was asked to run its new film office. He said
he was intrigued by the chance to create jobs, particularly for
blue-collar production workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not star-struck," he said. "I was not planning a career in
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's success in speeding up the county's permit operation
eventually caught the attention of the transition team of newly
elected Mayor Richard Riordan. Elected in 1993 on a platform that
called for privatizing government services when possible, Riordan
made Cluff an assistant deputy mayor for the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's assignment was to privatize the city's film permit office.
Two years later, the EIDC was born.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of film industry and labor representatives and a
$100,000 municipal start-up loan, Cluff filed the legal papers that
established the EIDC as a tax-exempt, public benefit corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff said his main job was to make it easier for filmmakers to
shoot in Los Angeles. He made EIDC staffers available to producers 24
hours a day. He also had a grander vision: He saw the EIDC as a
demonstration of "what kinds of things can happen if you let the
private sector partner up with government."</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC quickly repaid the city and began raking in millions of
dollars from $450 fees for permit applications, its primary income
source. The EIDC also collected millions more in use fees to pass on
to city and county governments.</TE>
<TE>   Running for reelection in 1997, Riordan called the EIDC "one of
the big success stories of my administration."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, public officials gave the EIDC a great deal of
power normally associated with government, including de facto
authority to grant film permits and to impose temporary moratoriums
on filming at locations deemed overused.</TE>
<TE>   Film permits amount to temporary zoning variances that allow
filming off studio lots. Technically, as a private corporation, the
EIDC is not entitled to issue them. That is the province of
government. But the EIDC's written agreement with the Los Angeles
Police Department gives police only four hours to object before the
EIDC hands out the permit. EIDC staff members say police seldom even
review requests.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff says that before a permit request goes to the LAPD, the EIDC
clears it with other government departments. Road closures, for
example, are approved by public works.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC also has authority to mediate disputes between residents
and filmmakers. In heavily filmed neighborhoods, mediations have
resulted in rules about parking and work hours.</TE>
<TE>   As a referee, the EIDC has irritated many people and developed a
reputation for arrogance as it has juggled the competing interests of
filmmakers, who want to do whatever it takes to make a scene work,
with those of residents, who see filming as a nuisance. Since the
1997-1998 fiscal year, the number of citizen complaints has risen 30%
even as the number of film production days has marginally declined,
according to the EIDC's latest annual report. More recent figures
indicate that filming is again on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Only Game in Town</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Cluff managed to significantly expand both the
exclusivity and the scope of the EIDC's operations.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has behaved like a monopoly, elbowing aside some of the
smaller, for-profit firms that provided similar permit services for
film companies. Some of these firms have gone out of business. Others
have survived by continuing to charge clients for film permits, which
they obtain through the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1996 letter to one such competitor, Cluff wrote: "EIDC is the
only entity authorized by the city and county through which filming
permits can be issued."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council learned in 1997 that the city Department of
Airports was dealing directly with filmmakers. So the council
instructed the department to work through the EIDC, saying that the
lack of centralization resulted in "unnecessary confusion and costly
delays."</TE>
<TE>   The agency took over film coordination from other government
entities, including the Department of Water and Power, the Los
Angeles Unified School District and the Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC also moved into lucrative sidelines. It charged
filmmakers to notify residents and merchants where filming would
occur and received government grants worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars for job training and collecting data on entertainment
industry job trends.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC staff went from eight to 45, plus 30 part-timers, among
them monitors assigned to heavily filmed neighborhoods to see that
filmmakers obeyed permit conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Diversification was so successful that, earlier this year, Cluff
announced that only 55% of the EIDC's revenue was coming from permit
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff was also working toward a national presence. He was
instrumental in founding FILM US, an organization to promote filming
in the United States. The organization's phone rang in the EIDC's
offices. Cluff also directed $10,000 in EIDC funds to a rival film
office in Pittsburgh, whose top executive was the head of FILM US.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing Investigation</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's autonomy came to an end in early September when district
attorney's investigators armed with a search warrant and guns burst
into his Hollywood Boulevard offices as he was eating a takeout
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned, the staff of the EIDC watched as the investigators
frisked their boss. Cluff has since lost 22 pounds and is thinking
about calling it quits.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians are considering revamping the EIDC and have called for
audits and suggested that elected officials no longer serve on the
agency's board.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Hollywood production community worry that film permits
could again get bogged in bureaucracy. "So far, the operation of the
office has continued without interruption," said Nick Counter,
president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
"We all hope that continues."</TE>
<TE>   The sudden interest by politicians in the EIDC represents a major
turnaround for a group that had been content to cash campaign checks.</TE>
<TE>   At a board meeting last year, then-City Councilman Michael Feuer,
who had not received any contributions, moved unsuccessfully to ban
the practice.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in six years that contributions had been
discussed by the EIDC board. Only four other elected officials were
present at that meeting, all of whom had received EIDC campaign
contributions. They were Supervisors Yvonne Burke and Michael
Antonovich and City Councilmen Hal Bernson and Mike Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Feuer's motion died for lack of a second.</TE>
<TE>   Since the district attorney's raid, Burke has returned her
contributions, Antonovich has said he would return his and Bernson
has said he is considering doing so. Hernandez has left office.</TE>

<LD>The Entertainment Industry Development Corp. has given campaign
contributions ranging from a few hundred dollars to more than $20,000
to 19 elected officials who have served on its board of directors. An
additional five elected officials who have been EIDC board members
have received contributions from top agency executives.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the donations were made as officials sought election for
the first time or reelection to posts as Los Angeles City Council
members or county supervisors, offices that automatically placed them
on the EIDC board.</LD>
<LD>   Former City Council member and current Assemblywoman Jackie
Goldberg received the most--$21,750. Goldberg, whose district
included Hollywood, received all but $3,000 while on the City
Council, mostly while campaigning for her Assembly seat. She received
an additional $500 from EIDC top executives.</LD>
<TE>   State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) received $20,000 in
donations from the EIDC, most of which came after he left the City
Council for the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Other City Council members who have received campaign
contributions from the EIDC or its top executives include Alex
Padilla, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Hal Bernson, Cindy Miscikowski and Nate
Holden.</TE>
<TE>   Council members who got contributions while making successful
initial runs for a City Council post were Nick Pacheco, Tom LaBonge,
Jan Perry, Janice Hahn, Eric Garcetti, Dennis Zine and Wendy Greuel.
Garcetti, Greuel, Perry, Pacheco and Zine got more after they took
office.</TE>
<TE>   Former council members who received money from the EIDC or its top
executives while on the EIDC board were Rudy Svorinich, Mike
Hernandez, Richard Alatorre, Laura Chick, John Ferraro and Joel
Wachs.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Mike Antonovich
also got donations, as did former Mayor Richard Riordan, whose post
also placed him on the EIDC board.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn got money from the agency and its top
executives during his race.</TE>

<HD>Simon Resurrects Felon's Allegations Against Davis</HD>
<DH>GOP challenger points to recently unsealed records.
Prosecutors said accuser, a convicted racketeer, lacked credibility.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican Bill Simon Jr. sought to bolster his campaign to oust Gov.
Gray Davis on Monday with newly unsealed court records showing that a
convicted racketeer tried in 1993 and 1994 to implicate Davis in
improper campaign fund-raising.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors found no evidence of a crime when they reviewed the
matter, concluding at the time that Davis' accuser, Mark L.
Nathanson, lacked credibility. A Davis spokesman called the
accusations "totally false."</LD>
<LD>   But a federal judge's release of the records just eight days
before Davis is up for reelection turned the felon's accusations into
a central focus of the governor's race.</LD>
<TE>   Within hours, Simon sought to publicize them at a news conference
on the beach in Malibu. He demanded that Davis answer detailed
questions about the unsubstantiated charges by Nathanson, a former
state coastal commissioner convicted in a corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of California deserve to know whether these
allegations can be corroborated," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson went to prison in 1993 for extorting payments from
Hollywood celebrities and others seeking permits to build on the
Southern California coast.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to reduce his sentence, Nathanson told prosecutors that
Davis asked him for the names of people he had helped in coastal
business so that Davis could solicit campaign money from them.</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing Nathanson extensively, the U.S. attorney's
office in Sacramento did not pursue his allegations.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 2000 court filing, prosecutors explained their
rationale. Nathanson, they said, "lied during debriefings, withheld
information, described conduct which was not illegal and/or provided
information which could not be corroborated."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a former federal prosecutor, made a passing reference
Monday to doubts about Nathanson's credibility. "Yes, of course we
need to consider the source," he said. "But one should also consider
the well-documented record of Davis' pay-to-play politics."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar called the accusations
"baseless charges that the FBI, the U.S. attorney and a district
court judge found to be not credible."</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI and the U.S. attorney both branded the accuser as a
liar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar recalled that Simon made a false claim earlier this month
that Davis had illegally accepted campaign money in a state building.
Simon first said a photograph provided proof, but later admitted that
it actually showed Davis in a private home.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like the reckless charge that Bill Simon made three weeks,
ago, these accusations are totally false," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to answer Simon's specific questions on Nathanson's
accusations, saying Davis "will not get into a tit-for-tat response
with a convicted felon and admitted perjurer."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's concern about potential political damage was
underscored last week by his campaign's threat to sue TV stations
that air any Simon ad that includes Nathanson's allegations. Simon
refused to say Monday whether he would use them in a TV ad.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis moved quickly to inoculate himself against damage anyway
by releasing a new spot of his own. It quotes newspapers saying
Simon's earlier allegation against the governor was "a colossal
blunder," a "false accusation" and an "unforgivable act of
foolishness."</TE>
<TE>   "Can we trust anything Bill Simon says?" a narrator asks.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson was one of 14 legislators, lobbyists and others
convicted in a state Capitol corruption scandal that broke in 1988,
one of the biggest in California history.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Nathanson was a Beverly Hills real estate agent known
as the coastal commissioner to the stars. He pleaded guilty in 1993
to federal charges of racketeering and filing a false tax return.</TE>
<TE>   His allegations against Davis appeared in 1993 and 1994 letters
from his lawyers to federal prosecutors. In an effort to reduce his
prison sentence of four years and nine months, he tried to implicate
Davis, then state controller.</TE>
<TE>   The documents on Nathanson's allegations were released by U.S.
District Judge Lawrence Karlton after a two-year legal battle by the
Sacramento Bee to force disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The judge had sealed them earlier, contending that they besmirched
Davis and others. But after the Sacramento Bee sued, Karlton released
redacted versions of the letters omitting the names of Davis and
others.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the newspaper.
But a Los Angeles developer named in the documents, Jerome Snyder,
pursued the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court rejected
his plea earlier this month, leading Karlton to unseal the documents
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Nathanson's allegations were nothing more than the desperate
lies of a convicted felon hoping to shorten his jail sentence,"
Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Twice during the legal fight, lawyers for Davis intervened and
argued that release of the information would damage the governor's
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis attorney Joseph Remcho said he sent a letter to Karlton in
March 2001, and late last year filed a brief before the appeals
court.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson also tried to block the documents' release.</TE>
<TE>   Nathanson declined to discuss the matter, saying: "I'm not making
any comments, but thank you anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown appointed Nathanson to the
Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   According to the letters, the former coastal commissioner and
Davis had a "long relationship" dating to the governor's days as
chief of staff to former Gov. Jerry Brown. Nathanson helped raise
money for many politicians, Davis among them.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis would obtain from Nathanson the details regarding what
Nathanson had done for the person [seeking a coastal permit]," a 1994
Nathanson letter says. "Davis would thereafter contact the person and
seek to obtain a campaign contribution."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also sought the names of people Nathanson helped, and "using
Nathanson's name, Davis would try to obtain contributions," it says.</TE>
<TE>   One of the letters alleges that as a "quid pro quo," Nathanson
asked that Controller Davis appoint Nathanson's father as inheritance
tax appraiser. Nathanson's father failed the test to become an
appraiser, and did not pursue the appointment.</TE>

<HD>Tepid Voters Favor Davis</HD>
<DH>Times poll shows the governor's lead stems from a dislike
of Simon, not from incumbent's popularity. Most think state is on
wrong track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One week before election day, Democrat Gray Davis is clinging to a
steady lead over Republican Bill Simon Jr., but widespread discontent
with the incumbent has kept him from pulling away in the governor's
race, according to a new Los Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Californians remain underwhelmed by their choices: More than half
of likely voters in the poll say their pick is merely the best of a
bad lot. And they give Davis dismal ratings on most issues facing the
state. A majority believe that California is on the wrong track and
just about half consider Davis a poor leader.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, by 45% to 36%, those likely to cast ballots next Tuesday
say that they will vote to reelect Davis to a second four-year term,
according to the survey completed Sunday night. Eleven percent of the
likely voters were backing other candidates and 8% were undecided.
The numbers were largely unchanged from a Times poll conducted four
weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   Davis' advantage stems almost entirely from the fact that,
unpopular as he is, Simon is held in even worse regard.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis can't make up his mind whether to put his right shoe
on his right foot. He sits there and does nothing," said Leona Wise,
a 70-year-old college librarian and Democrat from South Pasadena who
consented to a follow-up interview. That said, Wise continued, "if
push comes to shove" and she absolutely had to, she would vote for
Davis, because she believes his GOP rival "is an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Negative assessments of Simon were shared by nearly 6 in 10 likely
voters, the survey found. Only about a third had a favorable view of
the Los Angeles businessman, a first-time political candidate who has
been the subject of millions of dollars worth of Davis attack ads.
The governor is scarcely more popular, even though he has shifted the
tone of his advertising lately to a more positive message in hopes of
buffing his image. A little more than 4 in 10 likely voters had a
favorable impression of Davis, while 56% viewed him unfavorably.</TE>
<TE>   In other statewide contests, Democrats were leading all seven
down-ballot races for offices such as lieutenant governor, attorney
general and treasurer. But several of the contests have tightened
over the last month and two of them -- the fights for controller and
secretary of state -- have turned into genuine horse races.</TE>
<TE>   In the contest for controller, Democrat Steve Westly was
marginally ahead of Republican Tom McClintock, 41% to 37%. In the
race for secretary of state, Democrat Kevin Shelley was leading
Republican Keith Olberg, 41% to 35%. In both races, the lead was
within the poll's margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the ballot, a pair of measures dealing with fiscal
matters received favorable marks from likely voters. Proposition 47,
a bond measure to relieve school overcrowding and repair aging
facilities, was supported by 62% of those surveyed and opposed by
27%. Proposition 49, the Arnold Schwarzenegger-backed initiative to
promote after-school programs, was ahead 57% to 33%.</TE>
<TE>   A third measure on the Nov. 5 ballot, dealing with the state's
election laws, was trailing among likely voters. The initiative,
Proposition 52, would allow eligible Californians to register to vote
as late as election day. Thirty-five percent approved and 57% were
opposed to the measure.</TE>
<TE>   For all the events of the past month -- including a candidate
debate and a flap over a misfiring attack by Simon on Davis'
fund-raising -- the fundamental dynamic of the governor's race has
remained largely unchanged. At this point, just about three-quarters
of the likely voters said they had made up their minds and an
additional 15% said they were pretty certain how they would vote. Of
the 11% who were still considering their choices, a bare majority
were Democrats, about a third were Republicans and the rest were
independents.</TE>
<TE>   Among those wavering is Sharon Nelson, a Democrat in Redwood City.
She is unimpressed with Davis' lackluster performance over the last
four years. "I don't think he has his finger on the pulse of the
economy," said the 55-year-old accountant. "With all the money that's
been pumped into the state for education, I still haven't seen a
positive thing with that. Those are the two main things on my
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   But if she had to decide right now, Nelson said, she would
probably "go with the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know much about Simon to take that leap of faith," Nelson
said, adding that the one thing she did know about -- his false
accusation that Davis had illegally accepted campaign cash on state
property -- was "mudslinging to the nth degree. You don't put out
damaging [information] like that without any due diligence."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of discontent, ambivalence and disgust that Nelson
expressed appears to be widely shared by her fellow Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, a majority of likely voters polled expressed
dissatisfaction with the state of their state and unhappiness with
the man they elected nearly four years ago to run it.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-two percent believed things are on the wrong track in
California; 51% disapproved of the way Davis has performed as
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, such poor ratings would signal near-certain defeat at the
polls. But Davis is running ahead of Simon, in good measure because
many likely voters believe the Republican nominee would do an even
worse job.</TE>
<TE>   On many issues -- education, homeland security, crime, handling
the economy -- likely voters tended to prefer Davis, often by a
sizable margin. The sole exception was energy, the source of much of
the displeasure with the Democrat because of his hesitant handling of
last year's electricity crisis. By 41% to 32%, likely voters said
Simon would do a better job on the energy issue; 18% said neither
candidate would outperform the other.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was also favored over Simon on other, less tangible
measures. The incumbent was rated a stronger leader than his GOP
challenger, came closer to sharing voters' values and was thought to
display more honesty and integrity than the Republican hopeful,
though nearly a quarter said neither candidate won out in that
category.</TE>
<TE>   By 69% to 12%, an overwhelming majority of likely voters said
Davis knew more about California than Simon, who moved to the state
just about 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also appeared to have won favor with his action on a
pair of contentious bills that reached his desk in the final days of
the legislative session. He signed a measure that requires
independent mediation when labor talks stall between growers and farm
workers. And he vetoed legislation that would have allowed illegal
immigrants to obtain California drivers' licenses if they were
applying for U.S. citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Both moves proved popular with a substantial majority of likely
voters, with more than 6 in 10 backing them. Latinos likely to cast
ballots on Nov. 5 were even more supportive, even though some Latino
political leaders have angrily criticized the veto on the driver's
license bill. Two-thirds of likely Latino voters approved of the
veto; about three-quarters backed Davis' signing of the farm workers
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Democrat enjoyed 57% support among likely Latino
voters, compared with 25% for Simon. The GOP hopeful was slightly
ahead among white voters, 44% to 36%.</TE>
<TE>   The two were running essentially even among men, while Davis
enjoyed a substantial advantage -- 49% to 29% -- among likely women
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically, Davis was running far ahead of Simon in the
Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco
Bay Area, with Green Party candidate Peter Camejo receiving 11%
backing in the north. The two major candidates were running close to
even in Orange County, San Diego and the Inland Empire, with 44%
support for Simon and 41% for Davis. The governor was leading Simon
43% to 36% in rural Northern California and the Sacramento region,
but Simon was leading 43% to 36% in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest imponderable in next Tuesday's election is turnout.
With dissatisfaction so widespread among Californians, experts are
predicting record low participation. That means the depth of each
candidate's support could prove important, because it could dictate
whether backers actually show up at the polls.
   Neither candidate, the poll made clear, has bowled the state over.
Only 2 in 5 of likely voters interviewed said they liked the candidate
they supported; 56% described their choices as the best of a bad lot.</TE>
<TE>   Raedine Martinez, a 55-year-old San Diego Republican, may skip the
governor's contest. It would be the first time she has failed to vote
in a top-of-the-ticket race in more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two main choices, she described Davis as "wishy-washy," and
Simon as untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   "I would almost rather not vote," Martinez said, "because I will
not vote the party just to vote the party."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis was faring marginally better than Simon when it came
to the enthusiasm of his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of the governor's backers said they were voting for
the Democratic incumbent mostly because they liked him, compared with
about 3 in 10 Simon supporters who liked their candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Asked separately why they were supporting the Republican
challenger, 38% of Simon's backers said they were doing so because
they disliked Davis and just 18% said it was because they considered
Simon the best choice of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve percent said they were supporting Simon to bring about a
change in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Among Davis supporters, 24% were backing the governor as the best
choice, 16% because of his job performance and 14% because of his
stand on issues. One-tenth of the Davis voters said they were backing
the incumbent out of dislike for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, under the direction of Susan Pinkus,
interviewed 879 likely voters statewide from Oct. 22 through Oct. 27. The
margin of sampling error is 3 percentage points.</TE>

<TE>   HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll contacted 879 likely California voters by telephone
Oct. 22-27. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all
exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so
that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex,
race, age and education, and with figures for registration. The
margin of sampling error for likely voters is plus or minus three
percentage points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors,
such as question wording and the order in which questions are
presented. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.</TE>

<LD>U.S. military authorities have released four prisoners who had been
held for months at the Navy detention facility in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and will release others soon, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The four -- three Afghans and a Pakistani -- are the first group
to be released from the prison since it began housing in January
detainees captured abroad.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials declined to release the names or nationalities of
the men, but sources in Pakistan identified the freed Pakistani
detainee as Mohammed Sagheer, 60, who is from the North-West Frontier
Province that borders Afghanistan. Pakistani newspapers reported that
officials there said they will debrief Sagheer before releasing him
to his family in the town of Mansehra.</LD>
<TE>   Private aid officials confirmed the other men released were from
Afghanistan, but their identities could not be learned.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they plan to free small groups of detainees from
Guantanamo Bay after determining they have no value for U.S.
intelligence and do not pose a terrorist danger.</TE>

with a blow to the back of the head in 1998.</LD>

arguments that the jury that convicted Jonathan Miller in 1999 may
have been prejudiced by exposure to news coverage of the Columbine

not violate Miller's right to a fair trial when it denied defense
lawyers' request for a change of venue.</LD>

<HD>Judge Refuses to Intervene in Texas 'Sleeping Lawyer' Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Houston on Monday refused to intervene in the
retrial of a convicted murderer whose first lawyer had slept through
significant portions of the original trial -- a case that has raised
serious questions about the quality of justice in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David Hittner rejected a motion from the
American Civil Liberties Union that he order a state court judge to
appoint veteran Atlanta lawyer Robert McGlasson to represent Calvin
Burdine. Hittner cited a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that federal
courts, as a general rule, may not intervene in a pending state court
criminal prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-page ruling was a victory for Harris County, Texas, trial
Judge Joan Huffman, who had refused to appoint McGlasson even though
he had represented Burdine for 15 years in appealing the 1984 murder
conviction.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, Hittner ruled that Burdine's constitutional rights had
been violated because his original attorney had fallen asleep several
times during the trial. Hittner's ruling eventually was upheld by a
federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court, setting the stage
for a retrial.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine asked Huffman to appoint McGlasson to continue
representing him, saying that the federal public defender, who used
to work in Texas, had detailed knowledge of the case. But Huffman
declined, saying that McGlasson was not on an approved list of
lawyers qualified to represent defendants in murder trials in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected an appeal of
Huffman's ruling. The ACLU then sued Huffman in federal court, asking
Hittner to order her to appoint McGlasson in order to effectuate
Hittner's original decision that Burdine receive a new, fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Hittner ordered the two sides to mediate the issue, but no
agreement was reached and he was forced to rule.</TE>
<TE>   He said that relevant precedents required him to stay out of the
case. Moreover, Hittner said, he would not presume that Burdine will
receive poor representation simply because McGlasson is not
appointed.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing this month, a deputy state attorney general,
representing Huffman, said she would appoint two "first class, top
notch" attorneys to represent Burdine.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU lawyer Annette Lamoreaux said that she was disappointed in
the ruling and would appeal to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans. The Texas attorney general's office did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Bush Visits Colorado in Bid to Boost Senator's Chances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds and Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>DENVER -- With the balance of power in Congress at stake in next
week's elections, President Bush came to Colorado on Monday to help
one of his party's most vulnerable incumbents, part of his all-out
drive to reclaim the Senate for Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's stop here came three days after the death of Sen. Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.) threw an already-tense battle for the Senate into
greater flux. Democrats in that state are expected to turn to former
Vice President Walter F. Mondale as a replacement candidate in hopes
of keeping the seat.</LD>
<LD>   If the Democrats win in Minnesota, the race in Colorado would
become all the more crucial for Republicans. They need a net gain of
just one seat to capture the Senate, but the relatively small number
of competitive races means a loss by any GOP incumbent would be a
blow to achieving that goal.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.), a low-profile freshman, faces a stiff
challenge from Democrat Tom Strickland. Recent polls indicate the
contest is a dead heat.</TE>
<TE>   "For the sake of Colorado and the sake of the U.S. Senate, Wayne
Allard needs to be sent back to the Senate," Bush said as he stood in
front of an F-102 fighter jet in a hangar-turned-aerospace museum on
the outskirts of Denver. Bush flew an F-102 in the Texas National
Guard, and officials deliberately chose it as his backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to his ranch in Texas, Bush said, "Around Crawford, we
kind of know the difference between a show horse and a work horse.
With Wayne, you've got somebody who's willing to work on your
behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Two other GOP-held Senate seats are widely viewed as especially
vulnerable. Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.), another freshman, has been
trailing in the polls against Democrat Mark Pryor. And in New
Hampshire, Republican Rep. John E. Sununu and Democratic Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen are locked in a too-close-to-call race for an open Senate
seat.</TE>
<TE>   A new political equation in the Senate was clearly on the
president's mind. At a get-out-the-vote rally earlier in the day in
Alamogordo, N.M., Bush noted that if the Senate headcount swings in
the GOP's favor, New Mexico's Pete V. Domenici would become chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee. Domenici is heavily favored to win
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope, if all goes right next Tuesday all around the country,
we're going to start calling him Mr. Chairman again, because we're
going to change the United States Senate," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The race between Allard and Strickland is a rematch of their 1996
contest. That year, Allard won with 51% of the vote to 46% for
Strickland.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Democrats say Strickland is in stronger shape.</TE>
<TE>   He served as U.S. attorney during the second term of the Clinton
administration, bolstering his law enforcement credentials. He is
running in a state with high population growth, meaning many
potential voters are likely unfamiliar with Allard.</TE>
<TE>   Allard "has frankly been invisible," contended Jim Jordan,
executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   He also charged that the incumbent, who generally votes with his
conservative party leadership, is "ideologically out of step with the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have responded by seeking to define Strickland as too
liberal for the Mountain West.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Wadhams, Allard's campaign manager, said Bush's visit
underscored that the incumbent would back the popular president if
returned to the Senate. "Strickland would be a reliable vote against
that agenda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to spend much of the next week campaigning for GOP
candidates as Tuesday's election approaches, focusing on places where
a drop-in visit from the president might seal a margin of victory.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota Campaign Strategies Emerge</HD>
<DH>Democrats envision race as tribute to Wellstone, whereas
GOP wants to draw issue contrasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The campaign strategies began to emerge Monday for a
Minnesota Senate race expected to pit Republican Norm Coleman against
former Vice President Walter F. Mondale.</LD>
<LD>   Whereas Democrats appeared inclined to frame the race largely as a
tribute to Sen. Paul Wellstone, Republicans indicated they would look
to draw clear issue contrasts between Mondale and Coleman as the Nov.
5 election approaches.</LD>
<LD>   "There will be a vigorous, vigorous campaign to close out this
election," said Tom Mason, Coleman's communications director. "We are
going to campaign as many hours as is possible in the final days."</LD>
<TE>   In an interview on CNN on Monday, Coleman echoed calls from state
Republican leaders for debates with the eventual Democratic nominee.
"Minnesotans want [debates] and expect that," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, were laying plans to unveil their nominee at
a special meeting of their central committee Wednesday night in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "The tone will be different, but it will be in some respects like
a convention in which we expect the nominee to say something," said
Bill Amberg, the state Democratic Party's communications director.</TE>
<TE>   All signs were pointing toward Mondale as the Democrats' choice to
replace Wellstone, who died in a plane crash Friday. Mondale, a
former U.S. senator from Minnesota who then served as vice president
in the Carter administration and was the 1984 Democratic presidential
nominee, has not publicly committed to run. But privately, Democrats
say they have seen clear indications he will accept the nomination
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "From my understanding, it's a yes," said one source familiar with
the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   The National Republican Senatorial Committee released a poll
Monday that showed Mondale holding only a 45% to 43% advantage over
Coleman. But even some GOP strategists worried that Mondale would
look stronger later in the week, after the publicity surrounding a
memorial service in Minneapolis for Wellstone today and the
nomination Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties wrestled with the question of what campaign tone
might be acceptable to Minnesota voters still reeling from the sudden
death of Wellstone, a two-term liberal who was leading Coleman in the
latest polls.</TE>
<TE>   In a measure of the unsettled environment, two key groups that
have been spending heavily in the race announced they would withdraw
from the contest through election day.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which had been
painting Coleman in television ads as a tool of corporate interests,
said it would pull the commercials through election day.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Americans for Job Security, an independent conservative
group that had unleashed a barrage of ads against Wellstone for
opposing repeal of the estate tax, said it was stopping its effort.
The group had been targeting Wellstone with a media campaign so
comprehensive that it included radio ads in Norwegian in a state
where more than 17% claim that ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking about issues specific to Paul Wellstone, so we
are out of the fray," said Michael Dubke, the group's president.</TE>
<TE>   NRSC officials, though, refused to rule out running ads during the
campaign's final days.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think the party goes back on the air," said a top Republican
operative. "I may be completely wrong, but I don't know if people are
going to get offended by having somebody point out Mondale's record,
even in this situation."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican determination to rapidly resume the campaign
reflects not only the limited time left before election day, but the
desire to avoid a repeat of the 2000 Senate race in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   In that contest, John Ashcroft, the GOP incumbent who now is
attorney general, shut down his campaign for 10 days after his
Democratic rival, Mel Carnahan, was killed in a plane crash.
Missouri's Democratic governor indicated he would appoint Carnahan's
widow, Jean, to the Senate if the dead man received the most votes on
election day, and Ashcroft lost the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you what happens if you stop campaigning: You lose,"
said John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, the biggest Republican fear is that Mondale -- who
begins the race with an advantage in stature -- will seek to largely
stay above the fray over the next week and try to ride a wave of
emotion over Wellstone's death into office.</TE>
<TE>   One telling signal is that Democratic leaders are discussing ways
to incorporate Wellstone's trademark green school bus into the
campaign's final days.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is, basically, 'Do it for Paul,' " said one source
familiar with Democratic thinking.</TE>
<TE>   To counter that, Republicans appear poised to engage Mondale,
assuming he accepts the nomination, much more directly than they did
Democrats in the final days of the Missouri campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, state and national Republicans previewed the
contrasts they may try to draw between Coleman and Mondale.</TE>
<TE>   In comments to local reporters, Minnesota Republican Chairman Ron
Eibensteiner made clear the GOP will try to frame the brief race as a
choice between the future and the past. Coleman is 53, and Mondale is
74; moreover, Mondale hasn't appeared on a ballot since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also suggested they may try to place Mondale in an
ideological cross-fire.</TE>
<TE>   From one side, Eibensteiner tried to raise doubts about Mondale
among Wellstone's most ideological supporters by noting the former
vice president's service on corporate boards of directors.</TE>
<TE>   From the other side, conservative public relations consultant Joel
Rosenberg on Monday released a memo charging that Mondale voted for
tax increases at least 16 times during his Senate career.</TE>

<HD>Crime Up in 2001, FBI Says</HD>
<DH>Rise is first in a decade, with increases in nearly every
major category. Diversion of police after Sept. 11 may have left
public less protected.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A broad measure of major crime took its first jump in a decade during
2001, with increases in murder, rape, robbery and nearly every other
category, the FBI reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Although experts offered a wide range of social, demographic and
economic reasons for the uptick, one longtime analyst of crime data
suggested that the diversion of police to anti-terrorism tasks after
Sept. 11 may have left the public somewhat less guarded from routine
crime.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI's Uniform Crime Report is based on reporting from more
than 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States.</LD>
<TE>   According to the annual study, there were 11.8 million serious
crimes in the U.S. in 2001, up 2.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The 15,980 murders across the U.S. marked a 2.5% increase, 422,921
robberies a 3.7% increase and 907,219 aggravated assaults a 0.5%
decrease. Rape was up less than 1% to 90,491. Other categories of
crime, including property crimes, burglaries, larceny thefts and auto
thefts, were up by as much as 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles metropolitan area experienced 391,068 serious
crimes, including 1,074 murders. Orange County had 79,916 serious
crimes with 63 murders. Accounting for population differences, Los
Angeles had a murder rate of 11.1 per 100,000 population, versus 2.2
for Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The overall figures released Monday did not include the Sept. 11
attacks. The FBI reported separately that the terrorist strikes
killed 3,047: 2,823 at the World Trade Center, 184 at the Pentagon
and 40 in the plane crash in Somerset, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal justice experts said that the changes were too small to
be precisely interpreted and that any of a wide range of explanations
could be made, based less on statistical analysis and more on
political orientation.</TE>
<TE>   "The increases look fairly minor, as far as I can see," said Floyd
Feeney, a UC Davis law professor who has served on presidential
commissions and other groups to study crime. "With changes of this
magnitude, it is possible only to guess. This is certainly within the
range of natural variation."</TE>
<TE>   Feeney, who has been following crime statistics since the 1960s,
said that year-to-year variations are difficult to analyze properly.
Summaries of broad categories of crime are virtually worthless, he
noted.</TE>
<TE>   Feeney, however, observed that the increase in crime appeared to
occur in the last three months of 2001. Although December tends to be
a volatile month in most years, he noted that October and November
appeared to stand out.</TE>
<TE>   Feeney surmised that police attention in the weeks and months
after Sept. 11 was directed away from traditional duties to
anti-terrorism tasks. That may have left the public somewhat less
protected from usual crime.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, given the amount of police and public safety time
taken away from traditional tasks, the surprise may be that there
wasn't a greater increase in crime," Feeney said.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of crime that was committed in the final months of
2001 appeared to be somewhat higher than in earlier years, according
to a month-by-month breakdown of the FBI's crime index totals, Feeney
said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, law enforcement officials made an estimated 13.7 million
arrests for criminal offenses, a 2.1% decline from 2000. Those
statistics do not include driving- related offenses. It isn't clear
why reported crimes increased while arrests decreased.</TE>
<TE>   All of the statistical shifts are fairly small, however. Although
the total number of violent offenses went up in 2001 by 0.8%, the
rate per 100,000 population declined by 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Doyle, a professor in the criminal justice program at
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, said he believes the
slight rise in crime represents a demographic shift that is once
again adding to the population of young men most probable to commit
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We had better get used to it," Doyle said. "If you get more young
men, you get more crime."</TE>
<TE>   Although overall crime went up for the first time in a decade,
murder had already begun to inch up in 2000 compared with 1999.
Similarly, drunk driving arrests have shown an uptick, another
offense mainly committed by men in their 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle discounted the use of crime statistics for setting policy,
though they have played an important role in such issues as prison
construction, tougher criminal sentences and police budgets, among
much else.</TE>
<TE>   Some national crime experts said crime may be increasing because
the downturn in the U.S. economy may have caused local police
jurisdictions to decrease their budgets, whereas others said the
slower economy reduced job opportunities for youth.</TE>

<DH>Is it right to create one child to save another? A British
panel that could become a model for the U.S. tells an ailing boy's
parents it's not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BICESTER, England</DL>
<LD>Freshly changed into pajamas, Charlie Whitaker sucks on a pacifier
and tries to ignore the needle in his father's hand. He focuses on
the television while the needle goes into his belly, then winces as
his father tapes it in place. The needle will stay there overnight so
that the drug Desferal can filter into Charlie's body.</LD>
<LD>   "Why do we give you Desi?" his father asks in a comforting ritual.</LD>
<LD>   "To get rid of iron in my blood," answers the 4-year-old boy.</LD>
<TE>   "And what does Billy Blood do?" his father asks.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps you alive," says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie needs this nightly ritual, along with frequent blood
transfusions, because his body cannot produce red blood cells. The
disorder threatens his life. But illuminating one of the most
gripping moral quandaries of modern genetics, a British government
panel has barred the Whitakers from trying a promising new cure.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: The cure depends on creating another person --
specifically to help Charlie. Charlie's parents would mix their eggs
and sperm to produce embryos, a common fertility technique. But to
select which embryo to grow into a baby, they would use a new
screening test to find the one that could best donate blood-making
cells to their ailing son.</TE>
<TE>   Is it proper to create one child to help another? In the U.S., no
government agency even considers the question. But for the British
government panel, it is only the latest concern in a decade-long
effort to determine what is proper -- and what is immoral -- as
scientists put the human embryo to new uses.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is called the Human Fertilization and Embryology
Authority, and it is quickly becoming a major force in the worldwide
debate over embryo science. Human cloning? The embryo authority
barred it in 1998. Testing embryos to pick a child's sex? The panel
sharply curtailed that in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Whether for research or high-tech reproduction, anyone in Britain
who wants to create or use embryos needs the panel's permission. Even
the most emotional plea is rejected if the 21 panel members decide,
as they did in the Whitakers' case, that it violates the public
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many other nations are turning to the British model as they
grapple with the boom in fertility clinics and embryo stem-cell
research. Canada is poised to approve a similar body. Officials from
Taiwan, Japan and Ireland, among others, have consulted with the
British panel.</TE>
<TE>   There is even growing interest from the U.S., where there is
relatively meager regulation of fertility techniques and
private-sector embryo research.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, embryo authority chairwoman Suzi Leather
consulted with President Bush's Council on Bioethics, an advisory
group that is deciding whether to propose its own plan for regulating
embryos. A report due soon from the Hastings Center, a well-known New
York bioethics think tank, will recommend that U.S. officials copy
the British model.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need a similar kind of body in the United States,"
said Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins
University and a member of Bush's bioethics council. Irving L.
Weissman, a Stanford University stem-cell researcher and businessman,
said adopting the British model "makes sense to me, if it has
knowledgeable members."</TE>
<TE>   Adopting something like the British authority would be a political
challenge in the United States, where each side in the abortion
debate fears that new embryo regulations could weaken its position.</TE>
<TE>   And the Whitakers warn that regulation comes with a price: an
intrusion on the traditional privacy of reproductive decisions and on
the independence of doctors and patients to decide the course of
their own treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part of this is that medical science is dangled in our
face as a potential cure, and then it is pulled away," said Jayson
Whitaker, Charlie's father. "At the end of the day, this should be
our decision for our children and our family."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a growing number of critics say society should have a
larger role in regulating techniques that touch on the earliest
stages of human life.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, they say, is that fertility doctors are increasingly
treating patients who want to screen the genes of their embryos to
guarantee that their next child will be a boy, or a girl, or free of
serious familial diseases. Next, some people fear, could be the
"designer baby" -- a child whose traits are ordered up as if they
were features on a new car.</TE>
<TE>   The debate goes beyond traditional fertility issues, thanks to the
discovery of embryonic stem cells. Scientists want to study these
cells for their potential to cure disease. But embryos must be
destroyed to obtain the cells, drawing protest from people who see
life as beginning at the moment of conception.</TE>
<TE>   Only a small portion of the work using embryos falls under federal
supervision in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration regulates drugs and medical
devices, but not medical procedures, such as reproductive techniques.</TE>
<TE>   In the research world, the National Institutes of Health enforces
a strict ban on experiments that harm embryos -- but that applies
only to government-funded research.</TE>
<TE>   Privately funded researchers can work in secrecy. They can create
embryos or dissect them for stem cells. When a Massachusetts company
merged two species to create a human-cow embryo, the work became
public only because the company chose to reveal it.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say U.S. regulation is full of gaps and morally
inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think embryos are special and deserve protection," said
Lori Knowles of the Hastings Center, "then they deserve it whether or
not it's the government that's funding the research."</TE>
<TE>   Oversight in Britain</TE>
<TE>   Britain, by contrast, brings all embryo work under the Human
Fertilization and Embryology Authority -- whether funded publicly or
privately, in fertility clinics or research labs.</TE>
<TE>   Created by Parliament in 1990, the panel learns precisely what
will be done with embryos before deciding whether it is proper. Can
the research be done through other means? Does it involve a truly
serious disease? Is there evidence that a reproductive technique
might harm a patient or, most important, injure the child to be born?</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fear of science being out of control, that what's
being created is abhorrent to the human race," said Dr. Maureen
Dalziel, the panel's top staff official. "We show that you can
consider all the issues, and that gives people a degree of comfort."
The result, she said, is greater public support for the research and
treatments that are permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Some limits have been laid down by Parliament. Embryos may be
dissected for stem cells, but no one may experiment with an embryo
more than 14 days old. Cloning is banned to produce a baby, but not
as a tool of disease research. Fertility procedures should be barred
if they harm the welfare of the child.</TE>
<TE>   But generally, the embryo panel is left to its own judgment.
Panelists are appointed by a government health ministry, and more
than half must come from outside the medical and scientific
professions. The current lineup includes a social worker, a
philosopher, an Anglican bishop and a newspaper columnist.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a system in which the freedom to work with embryos
is broad, but also far more supervised than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fertility services are booming in both countries, but only Britain
can say how many embryos are created at clinics: 925,747 between 1991
and 1999. The British authority also can say how many have been
destroyed, donated for research and created by scientists
specifically for experiments.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, no one tracks that information.</TE>
<TE>   Fertility patients in both countries can use eggs and sperm
produced by donors. But the British sharply cap payments to donors,
even laying out how much they may be compensated for each mile
traveled to a clinic by car, bus and bicycle. In the United States,
where faith in the free market is stronger, women with the right
looks and college credentials have been offered as much as $80,000
for their eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.K. has struck a very sensible balance in this whole domain
that we're just still struggling for and has eluded us," said Michael
J. Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard University and a
member of Bush's bioethics council.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we should have regulation of fertility clinics and embryo
research -- not to stop the activities but to permit it with the
confidence that it will be done ethically and won't give rise to
abuses," said Sandel, who believes abuses include high payments to
induce women to donate eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Many fertility doctors, however, are suspicious of putting more
government in the medical office.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're talking about is the government regulating how people
have children, and we have a much stronger tradition of avoiding that
in this country than they do," said Sean Tipton, spokesman for the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which represents
fertility doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Only Cure for Boy</TE>
<TE>   When it rules on an application, the British panel often inspires
a spirited public debate. But few decisions have been as contentious
as its rejection of the Whitakers' effort to help their son.</TE>
<TE>   From birth, Charlie Whitaker was pale and sleepy, and at 12 weeks,
his doctors discovered why: His body was not manufacturing red blood
cells. Charlie had been getting by on the few cells that had slipped
in from his mother, Michelle, while he was in the womb.</TE>
<TE>   The diagnosis was Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Syndrome, which affects
fewer than 700 people worldwide. The average life expectancy is 31.</TE>
<TE>   To survive, Charlie needs a blood transfusion every three weeks,
along with Desferal to draw out the excess iron that builds up after
the transfusions. The only cure is to transplant new blood-making
cells, which can be found in bone marrow or in a newborn's umbilical
cord blood.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is to find cells that Charlie's body will not reject.
His doctors said he needs a donor whose biology closely matches his
own -- so closely that the cells could come only from a sibling. And
not just any sibling. Brothers or sisters have only a 25% chance of
being the right match.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitakers, who live in Bicester, a town of modest homes near
Oxford, say they always wanted a large family. Last year, they had a
daughter, Emily. She is healthy, but not able to help Charlie.</TE>
<TE>   But another development in the United States was giving the
Whitakers hope. In October 2000, doctors announced the birth of Adam
Nash of Colorado. Adam had been conceived in a laboratory dish along
with other embryos, then singled out by a genetic test as the only
one who could donate cells to his sister, Molly, who suffered from a
deadly blood disease called Fanconi anemia.</TE>
<TE>   Adam's birth suggested that the Whitakers could also create a baby
to help their sick child. "We went to our consultant right away,"
Michelle recalled, referring to Charlie's doctor, "but she said, 'You
must be joking. That will never happen in this country.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then late last year, the British embryo authority had its own Nash
case. A couple from the northern city of Leeds, Shahana and Raj
Hashmi, sought permission to create a child who could donate cells to
their son, Zain, who suffered from the blood disorder beta
thalassemia.</TE>
<TE>   The embryo panel had several concerns.</TE>
<TE>   To study an embryo's genes, doctors grow it for three days, until
it has about eight cells, and then remove one cell for testing. The
panel feared the cell removal might expose the embryo to lasting
physical harm.</TE>
<TE>   And there might be emotional risks to a child whose identity was
forged in relation to a sibling. "One of the most important
characteristics of parenthood is the unconditionality of parental
love," said Leather, the embryo authority chairwoman. "If you start
out by saying, 'Well, we really only want one that comes in blue or
one that comes in pink,' it undermines that unconditionality."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the panel considered whether selecting a child as a cell
donor was a step toward the widely feared "designer baby."</TE>
<TE>   "How far would it go?" asked the Right Rev. Michael James
Nazir-Ali, the bishop of Rochester and a panel member. "Could parents
get characteristics that are not life-threatening medical issues?
What about colorblindness?" Or musical ability? Or blue eyes?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the panel decided that embryo selection should be used
only when the unborn child had something substantial to gain. And
because the Hashmis' next child ran a risk of inheriting beta
thalassemia, the child could in fact benefit from embryo screening.
When they chose an embryo that could help Zain, the Hashmis would be
choosing an embryo free of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   In the Whitaker home, the decision was great news. Like the
Hashmis, they had a son with a blood disorder. Like the Hashmis, they
saw a way to boost their odds of gaining a cell donor.</TE>
<TE>   But the embryo authority saw a key difference. Zain inherited his
illness. Charlie, so far as doctors could tell, was ill because of a
one-time genetic fluke. When the Hashmis created a dish of embryos,
some would carry Zain's illness and some would not. If the Whitakers
created embryos, none would have a substantial chance of carrying
Charlie's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "So, you would be creating a child to serve somebody else's ends,
albeit a sibling's," Leather said. "You would expose it to potential
risk for which it wasn't getting any benefit. And that to us felt
like it was breaking an ethical principle, and tipping the benefit
scale away from the individual" to be born.</TE>
<TE>   To the Whitakers, the rejection made no sense. People have
children for all sorts of reasons, Jayson said, "to look after them
in old age, for passing on the family fortune."</TE>
<TE>   "Teenagers have babies in this country to get a subsidized flat,"
he added. "Why would they think we wouldn't love this child as much
as any other?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so angry," said Michelle. "Abortion is legal in the
United Kingdom. They're protecting a 3-day-old embryo, but we could
terminate an 18-week-old fetus."</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, some people criticized the embryo panel's decision.
But some also had been angry when the panel allowed the Hashmis to
proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "Whichever way we take it, we're going to get lambasted," said
Sara Nathan, a broadcast journalist on the panel. "They'll either say
you're on the slippery slope toward having designer babies, or you're
going to be seen as a rigid moralist who says no."</TE>
<TE>   But generally, the British panel's decisions are accepted by the
public, said Nathan, several scientists and the country's main
advocacy group for infertile patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some think that no U.S. embryo panel would win similar acceptance,
because the debate over abortion, and over legal protections offered
to embryos, is far more contentious than in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't work in the U.S.," said Tipton of the fertility doctors'
group. "The climate around abortion politics in this country
precludes rational discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion politics, in fact, have stalled past efforts to regulate
embryo science.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has never laid out rules for stem-cell research, leaving
it to Bush. And it has not banned cloning to produce babies, even
though lawmakers from both parties, and with opposing views on
abortion, have said creating a cloned baby would be immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Some people believe the nation needs a new approach. They include
several members of Bush's bioethics advisory council, said Dr. Leon
Kass, the physician and ethicist who leads the council.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 18, just after hearing from the leader of the British
authority, the bioethics council voted to draft a proposal on how to
regulate embryo screening, embryo research and other technologies
that involve early forms of human life.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitakers are urging caution. They now have plans to visit the
United States, where doctors perform embryo screening about 15 times
each month to produce cell-donor matches for sick children. If U.S.
doctors were stripped of freedom to use the technique, the chance to
cure Charlie might also disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Whitaker said she's "really glad" that the United States
has not followed Britain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with people wanting blond-haired, blue-eyed
children or deciding what sex it is," she said. "But it's another
thing to help a sick child."</TE>

<DL>BILLINGS, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors charged the manager of a Montana State University farm
near Bozeman with cruelty to animals Monday after nine horses died of
dehydration when the creek through their pasture dried up and no one
noticed.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the nine counts filed against Kim Anderson is a
misdemeanor. He was ordered to appear Nov. 11 in Gallatin County
Justice Court.</LD>
<LD>   State law defines cruelty to animals as knowingly or negligently
subjecting an animal to mistreatment or neglect by failing to provide
proper food, drink or shelter.</LD>
<TE>   The deaths prompted outrage across Montana and led to the
formation of a committee to oversee the care and use of animals as
part of agricultural research and education. University President
Geoff Gamble also called for an internal review.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who has worked at the university since 1999, was put on
paid leave Monday pending the case's outcome, said Sharron S.
Quisenberry, dean of the College of Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "We accept full responsibility," Quisenberry said. "It was a
tragic situation, and people are duly upset. We're upset. Hopefully,
with what we're doing and what we're putting in place, this will
never happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson could not be reached for comment, and Deputy County Atty.
Eric Kitzmiller declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen horses owned by the university and used for horsemanship
classes were sent to pasture last summer at the school's Fort Ellis
farm near Bozeman, in south-central Montana. The only source of water
was the creek, and it went dry.</TE>
<TE>   Farm workers found six horses dead Sept. 3. Anderson, who managed
the farm, was called, along with Bruce Sourness, a veterinarian who
said it was apparent that the animals still alive were dehydrated and
began treatment. An additional horse died at the site and two others
later had to be euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Six horses, including the two euthanized, were taken to David
Catlin's veterinary clinic. He said the horses may have gone up to
two weeks without water, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Gagnon, a professor of animal and range sciences and
responsible for the school's horse program, said the animals should
have been checked several times a week. He said dust in the creek was
3 to 4 inches deep, indicating that it was dry for some time before
the horses were found dead, according to court documents.</TE>

<HD>Student Guns Down 3 Professors in Arizona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>A failing student gunned down and killed three of his nursing
professors at the University of Arizona on Monday morning, calmly
opening fire on two of them in front of a roomful of horrified
exam-takers, police said. The gunman then ordered the students out of
the classroom and committed suicide.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 students witnessed two of the shootings, some of them
hiding under desks while others fled the fourth-floor classroom,
screaming and sobbing, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "We were taking a critical-care exam. We were halfway through it,"
said Julie Raymond, 22, a senior nursing student. "I didn't pay any
attention until he started talking. He fired shots and told us all to
leave. I thought it was a joke at first, a really bad Halloween
joke."</LD>
<TE>   Raymond said she realized it wasn't a prank when "I heard the
gun."</TE>
<TE>   Police identified the gunman as Robert S. Flores, 41, a Persian
Gulf War veteran and student at the College of Nursing. Flores had
failed a pediatric nursing class and was struggling in the
critical-care class, according to Elizabeth Irvin, the university's
vice provost.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrived at the campus three minutes after the 8:40 a.m.
report of gunfire and quickly summoned the bomb squad after a package
or backpack was discovered under the gunman's body. A bomb-sniffing
dog also alerted officers to possible traces of explosives in Flores'
car.</TE>
<TE>   The nursing school and nearby buildings were evacuated. Police
searched into the evening but no explosives were found in the
building or in Flores' vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In a late briefing, police said the suspect was carrying five
handguns and at least 200 rounds of ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, bomb squad investigators ordered residents of
the apartment complex where Flores lived to leave their homes, but a
check of his apartment found no explosives. A witness had told police
that Flores had made a bomb threat two weeks earlier against the
College of Nursing, Tucson Police Chief Richard Miranda said.</TE>
<TE>   The victims were identified as Robin Rogers, 50, who was shot
first and whose body was discovered in her second-floor office in the
nursing school building; Barbara Monroe, 45, shot three times in the
front of the classroom; and Cheryl McGaffic, 44, the final victim,
shot three times in the rear of the room. All three were associate
professors of nursing.</TE>
<TE>   McGaffic "was a spiritual person," said Megan Fernow, 21, a
nursing student. "At student orientation this year, she said if you
have a problem in spirituality, come to me."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Edwards, 21, a psychology major, was waiting for a shuttle
bus when she saw a crying student run out of the building.</TE>
<TE>   The student said two professors had been shot. Edwards said
witnesses told her some of the critical-care students were so upset
they were throwing up.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Brink, manager of the apartment complex, said Flores never had
a harsh word about anyone and was easily recognized as the owner of a
Great Dane that he walked each morning.</TE>
<TE>   Brink said that Flores' 15-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son
visited during the summer and on weekends, and that he never saw any
firearms when he was inside Flores' apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed talking with him very much," the manager said. "He was
always concerned about my health. He was concerned about everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda said Flores had targeted his victims.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too soon to say why he committed this terrible deed,"
Miranda said. "We have determined that there are many issues in Mr.
Flores' life, all of which are a factor."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda said that in April someone from the university had "made a
report" to the police about Flores, saying he was depressed and might
do something to harm others. The chief declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the scene in Room 467, nursing student Diana Lugo, 22,
told the Arizona Daily Star: "He walked in and said to the first
professor, 'Here's a lesson in spirituality,' then he said, 'Make
peace with your maker,' and then he shot her."</TE>
<TE>   Police said he worked at the Southern Arizona Veterans Affairs
Health Care System as a licensed practical nurse and was studying to
become a registered nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Violence has occurred at several American colleges over the last
decade, though claiming fewer victims.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, an 18-year-old sophomore wearing a shirt with the words
"Sick of it all" in red letters went on a shooting rampage at Simon's
Rock College of Bard in Great Barrington, Mass., killing a teacher
and a student and wounding four other people.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, a Harvard premed student fatally stabbed a
classmate and wounded the woman's friend before taking her own life.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of classes in August 2000, a 67-year-old English
professor at the University of Arkansas was gunned down in his office
by a longtime graduate student, who then killed himself. The student
had just been notified that he had been dropped from the graduate
comparative literature program for insufficient academic progress.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a student apparently irate over failing grades killed
the dean, a professor and another student at Appalachian School of
Law in Grundy, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "We have now seen a number of these kinds of events and usually
there is a sign," said Joel C. Epstein, a lecturer in education law
and policy at Boston College who specializes in campus safety issues.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein said college administrators sometimes mistakenly believe
they are capable of defusing the problem, not realizing they are
facing a potentially deadly situation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are dealing with someone who is potentially lethal, that
is not the way to go," Epstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, communication typically breaks down somewhere
between the professor and administrator, who may know of a troubled
student, and the rest of the institution."</TE>

<HD>Virginia Counties Join Race to Prosecute Sniper Suspects</HD>
<DH>The Justice Department could decide this week which of
three states can hold trial first. The pair are now suspects in a
Tacoma, Wash., killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian and Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a rush to avenge nearly a month of terror, three Virginia counties
indicted John Allen Muhammad and his juvenile partner Lee Boyd Malvo
on Monday for a string of murders and other capital punishment
crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Similar charges were filed last week in Maryland and Alabama,
while federal prosecutors are considering bringing a sweeping federal
indictment that would charge Muhammad with crimes in all three states
and the District of Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   The prospect of a death penalty trial against Muhammad and Malvo
is dominating the competition among prosecutors to hold the first
trial.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department could decide this week, possibly as early
as today, which jurisdiction should initially prosecute Muhammad and
Malvo. They are in a Baltimore lockup under the custody of U.S.
marshals.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is closely monitoring the case and must
approve any decision about where the two will be tried first.
Officials in Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and the Justice
Department were all discussing Monday who would first obtain custody
of the pair.</TE>
<TE>   Among the charges filed Monday, Prince William County in Virginia
charged Muhammad, 41, and Malvo, 17, with capital murder and
terrorism, both offenses that carry the death penalty in Virginia.
Malvo was believed to have been charged in sealed petitions to
juvenile courts, but prosecutors said they would seek to have him
tried as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   Other charges were filed Monday in Spotsylvania and Hanover
counties, the sites of two other shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies along the cross-country route
that brought Muhammad and Malvo from Washington state to Washington,
D.C., began to reexamine their open murder and robbery cases for
possible links to the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Washington state police said Monday that they are taking another
look at their open cases from the last few months, as are many other
jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   And Wednesday evening, Tacoma Police Chief David Brame said
Muhammad and Malvo are suspects in the killing of 21-year-old Keenya
Cook. She was shot in the face Feb. 16 when she opened the door at
her Tacoma home.</TE>
<TE>   Brame said a local man contacted the FBI and told authorities he'd
allowed Muhammad and Malvo to borrow his weapons, including a
.45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, while the pair were staying with
him earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, they now consider Muhammad and Malvo as suspects in
the Cook homicide, Brame said.</TE>
<TE>   Brame also said a .44-caliber Magnum, borrowed from the same man,
was used in a shooting at Temple Beth El in Tacoma from May 1 to 4.
No one was known to be at the synagogue at the time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said no charges were planned against the man who lent
the weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad purchased the 1990 Chevrolet Caprice allegedly used for
the killing spree Sept. 10 and is known to have visited at least half
a dozen states between that time and his arrest last week.</TE>
<TE>   The investigative fallout from the case has spilled over onto
foreign shores as well.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 miles southeast of the U.S. capital, on the
twin-island Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, Prime Minister
Lester Bird called Monday for a rare independent investigation into
how Muhammad got an official passport from that country during his
stay there two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bird also asked the nation's attorney general to investigate
whether Muhammad was illegally selling Antiguan passports that he
allegedly obtained through falsified documents during his more than
three months on the island.</TE>
<TE>   Several eyewitnesses in Antigua have said in recent days that
Muhammad also had access to falsified U.S. birth certificates and
other American documents, and that he traveled frequently between
Antigua and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad himself disclosed in court documents he filed in his
second divorce case in Tacoma, Wash., late last year that he left for
Antigua with three of his children on March 27, 2000. He stated in
his affidavit that he stayed on the island until late June.</TE>
<TE>   After Muhammad's arrest in the sniper case, Ena Thomas, the
government official in charge of Antigua's passport division,
confirmed that he had successfully applied for an Antiguan passport
on June 6, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He doctored his New Orleans birth certificate in swearing that his
mother was Antiguan, documents show. The passport was issued to him
on July 4, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Antiguan investigation also will include whether Muhammad used
Antiguan documents to help smuggle Malvo into the United States,
sources on the island said. Malvo, a Jamaican citizen who apparently
was brought to Antigua by his mother in the late 1990s, was arrested
by Border Patrol agents in Bellingham, Wash., as an undocumented
migrant in December.</TE>
<TE>   "It is bad enough that Antigua has been associated with the
suspected sniper John Allen Williams," said Bird, who has ruled over
the nation's politics for decades. "It is now very important that we
ensure that our system for granting passports is as secure as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Antigua's opposition United Progressive Party was
more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Jonas labeled the Muhammad passport connection "a fiasco,"
part of a widespread illegal passport racket dating back several
years in a nation that has been embroiled in numerous international
smuggling and offshore banking scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, Antigua and Barbuda's international image is dragged
further through the mud," Jonas said.</TE>
<TE>   Jamaican officials also were scrambling to do image damage-control
Monday, after a second Jamaican citizen was arrested in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although columnists, social scientists and politicians in the
Jamaican capital of Kingston were attributing Malvo's alleged acts to
America's violent gun culture, Jamaican consular officials were
attempting to contact their citizens now in U.S. custody in the case.</TE>
<TE>   A Jamaican government official said Malvo's mother, Una James, is
believed to be in police custody in Washington state, where she
reportedly was detained shortly before last week's arrests and has
been assisting the sniper investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A second Jamaican, Nathaniel Osbourne, who was arrested as a
material witness after records show he co-owned the 1990 Chevrolet
Caprice that police said the two men used as a shooting blind, was
still being held in Flint, Mich. Federal marshals are expected to
transport him to Maryland this week, possibly today.</TE>
<TE>   And Jamaican Embassy officials were seeking to interview Malvo in
a consular visit at the Maryland detention center where he is being
held along with Muhammad.</TE>

<HD>Senators Honor Wellstone in Emotional Remembrance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- His gleaming mahogany desk draped in black felt, the
late Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) was eulogized Monday by former
colleagues as an uncommon advocate for the common man.</LD>
<LD>   The brief Senate session, three days after the plane crash in
Minnesota that killed Wellstone, his wife, daughter and five others,
revealed the grief and shock of lawmakers at the sudden death of one
of their own. "For me, the loss of Paul Wellstone cuts very deep,"
said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), her eyes reddened and her voice
halting.</LD>
<LD>   Boxer was one of Wellstone's closest Senate allies, serving with
him on the Foreign Relations Committee and sharing his consistently
liberal voting record.</LD>
<TE>   She recalled Wellstone, who was 58 and seeking reelection to a
third term, as "kind, compassionate, self-deprecating, a passionate
voice for those without a voice, enthusiastic, a bundle of energy."</TE>
<TE>   The somber 40-minute remembrance, held while most senators were
away from Washington, was a prelude to Wellstone memorials today in
Minnesota and in coming days at the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Others praising Wellstone in short, emotional speeches were
Democratic Sens. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Christopher J. Dodd of
Connecticut and Mark Dayton of Minnesota. "It wasn't about polls; it
wasn't about pundits," Dayton said. "It was about conviction."</TE>

<HD>The Promised Land</HD>
<DH>After failures of the past, eliminating the Twins had many
players happy just to have reached the World Series</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exorcising demons apparently can be fun, or so it seemed when the
Angels knocked down the door in the American League championship
series.</LD>
<LD>   They weren't burdened by the club's traumatic playoff history,
focusing on the present and the Minnesota Twins. This time, the
Angels weren't "one win away" or "one strike away." They went all the
way.</LD>
<LD>   They did it efficiently and convincingly against the AL Central
champions, taking the best-of-seven series, 4-1, becoming the first
AL wild-card team to advance to the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "Angel immortality," closer Troy Percival said, "for this entire
team."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had pounded the New York Yankees' high-priced,
star-powered rotation in winning the best-of-five division series,
3-1, treating Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Mike Mussina and David
Wells like a bunch of batting-practice pitchers. The Yankees' current
reign over -- or at least momentarily interrupted -- baseball
suddenly was buzzing about the exciting Angels and the aggressive
style of Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Then Joe Mays went to work.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota right-hander shut down the Angels in a 2-1 victory
in Game 1 at the Metrodome, stirring renewed concern about the
Angels' history at this stage of the season. The Angels' previous
three trips to the AL championship series ended badly for them,
including nightmarish collapses in 1982 and '86.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the first two games against the Milwaukee Brewers in
1982, the Angels lost three in a row on the road and an opportunity
to reach the World Series. In '86 Dave Henderson hit a two-out,
two-strike, two-run home run in Game 5 to help put the Boston Red Sox
in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, Mays had the "game of my career" in the
opener, handcuffing the Angels on four hits over eight innings. But
these Angels don't believe in ghosts, saying the past is best left
there.</TE>
<TE>   They rebounded a night later against Rick Reed in a 6-3 victory,
looking every bit like the club that batted .376 against the Yankees.
Ramon Ortiz made the biggest comeback, working 5 1/3 innings after a
jittery 2 2/3-inning performance in his postseason debut.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz helped the Angels gain a split, neutralizing the Twins'
dome-field advantage with the series shifting to Edison Field for
Game 3. Jarrod Washburn was eager for his turn against Minnesota,
which loses its edge when the roof comes off, the grass is real and
left-handers are on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins were 23-29 against left-handers during the regular
season, batting 30 points lower (.252 to .282) than against
right-handers. Washburn did his part in seven outstanding innings and
the overpowering one-two punch of rookie setup man Francisco
Rodriguez and Percival was spectacular again in an electric 2-1
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were having so much fun that even stoic third baseman
Troy Glaus got caught up in the excitement, breaking out of character
by pumping his fist three times while rounding first base after
hitting the game-winning home run in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the crowd. Fans considered among baseball's
most passive changed their image overnight in a raucous, noise
stick-wielding demonstration, keeping it loud and annoying the Twins,
who finally experienced what visitors encounter in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had been even-tempered through a 6-14 start that became
a franchise-best 99-victory regular season, but emotions are hard to
contain after dramatic playoff victories and theirs were on display.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time to enjoy it," center fielder Darin Erstad said.
"Who knows if you ever get a chance to play in the postseason again?
This is the time when it's exciting, and we need to enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were only two victories away from the World Series, but
Brad Radke was up next. In 18 career starts against the Angels,
Minnesota's ace was 11-4 with a 1.72 earned-run average overall,
including 6-1 with a 1.38 ERA at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Radke was also 2-0 with a 1.54 ERA in the division series against
the Oakland Athletics, and rookie right-hander John Lackey was making
his first playoff start, so the situation seemed favorable for the
Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey outdueled the Angel nemesis, tossing seven shutout innings
in a 7-1 victory. Radke took the loss despite working 6 2/3 strong
innings and matching Lackey for six. Leading, 2-0, in the eighth, the
Angels scored five runs against the Twins' tired bullpen, providing a
sign of bigger things to come.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't help but think everything is lining up," right fielder
Tim Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared ghosts had returned to haunt the Angels as the Twins
rallied to take a 5-3 lead in the seventh inning of Game 5 against
Rodriguez, pitching for the third times in as many days, on a
bases-loaded walk and bases-loaded wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels got 10 hits in the bottom of the inning for the
second time in the playoffs, including Adam Kennedy's third homer of
the game, in a 10-run outburst against four Minnesota relievers.
Kennedy, the most valuable player in the series, became the fifth
player to hit three homers in a postseason game, and the Angels were
on their way to their first World Series in 42 years with a 13-5
victory that started another October party in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even able to make sense of this," said Salmon, the
longest-suffering Angel. "I feel like I'm dreaming."</TE>
<TE>   And the dream would soon get even better.</TE>

<HD>Dismissing Mystique</HD>
<DH>With hardly a trace of postseason experience, Angels
eliminate Yankees with an offensive show</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never mind the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Or Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco Rodriguez had never even been to New York.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of his Angel teammates didn't seem appreciably better
prepared to take on the New York Yankees in the opening round of the
playoffs, a best-of-five division series pitting the wild-card Angels
against New York, winner of the American League East.</TE>
<TE>   Against a Yankee team that had been in the playoffs five of the
previous six seasons, the Angels were bringing a 25-man roster that
totaled one game of postseason experience, a pitching appearance by
Kevin Appier as a member of the Oakland Athletics. And he had lost
that game. To the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Other points in New York's favor:</TE>
<TE>   * The Yankees had won four of the previous six World Series. The
Angels, in 41 previous years of existence, hadn't won a playoff
series.</TE>
<TE>   * The Yankees had won 103 games and had the best regular-season
winning percentage in baseball in 2002. The Angels didn't even win
their division.</TE>
<TE>   * The Yankees had a tradition of winning. The Angels had a history
of curses.</TE>
<TE>   Whom would you bet on?</TE>
<TE>   A cartoon in a New York paper showed a wide-eyed, apple-cheeked
youngster in an Angel uniform, presumably Game 1 starter Jarrod
Washburn, with a halo above his head on a pitching mound facing a
gigantic, bearded, beady-eyed monster with a bat in his hand and
obvious malice in his heart.</TE>
<TE>   It was an image few outside Orange County would dispute.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels departed for New York, their optimistic fans saw a
determined and talented team on its way to topple the ruling class.
The realists saw lambs on the way to slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1, it was there for the Angels. Despite all the dark
predictions, victory was within their grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, many felt it was within the grasp of Angel closer Troy
Percival. If only Manager Mike Scioscia had given him the ball.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels leading, 5-4, and two runners on with two out in
the eighth inning, Scioscia left Percival in the bullpen. The
expectation was that Percival, the last line of defense for the
Angels, would come in. Rather than his usual three outs, Percival
would be asked to get four.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Scioscia went with Scott Schoeneweis, who gave up the
tying run, and Brendan Donnelly, who gave up the three-run home run
to Bernie Williams that gave the Yankees an 8-5 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Much was made in New York about the Yankee mystique.</TE>
<TE>   Much was made in Anaheim about the Angels' failing to get their
best relief pitcher into the game.</TE>
<TE>   It happened again in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels ahead, 7-5, in the bottom of the eighth, one out
and two on, all eyes turned to Percival in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   All eyes but those of Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't want to ask his closer to get five outs. So he brought
in Donnelly again, this time to face pinch-hitter John Vander Wal.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Tim McCarver called it the "most courageous"
managerial move he'd seen in a postseason game. Percival, twice
exhibiting a pronounced shrug of the shoulders, probably called it
something else under his breath.</TE>
<TE>   But Donnelly struck out Vander Wal, and finally the call came for
Percival, who held off the Yankees the rest of the way for the save
in an 8-6 Angel victory.</TE>
<TE>   Unimpressed with the screaming fans and clapping noise sticks and
the dancing monkeys at Edison Field, the Yankees unleashed their
trademark power offense and raced to a 6-1 lead after 2 1/2 innings
of Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels quickly showed their resilience, staging another of
their vaunted comebacks behind Tim Salmon, the longest-suffering
Angel. He had played more games without reaching the postseason than
any active player, but once there he found the reality as good as the
anticipation. Salmon homered, had another hit and drove in four runs
as the Angels came back with eight unanswered runs to win 9-6.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 4, the second-guessers were on Scioscia as he benched two
hot players -- designated hitter Brad Fullmer and second baseman Adam
Kennedy -- and started Shawn Wooten and Benji Gil. All they did was
combine to go six for seven to lead a 15-hit attack in a 9-5 Angel
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels broke open the game in the fifth inning when they sent
13 men to the plate and scored eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   The poise of the Yankee veterans crumbled under the onslaught.
Second baseman Alfonso Soriano made an error. So did pitcher David
Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Before he retreated to the safety of the dugout, Wells had given
up eight runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   With two series still ahead, heaven would have to wait for the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   For now, they'd have to be content with having won their first
postseason series, beating the mighty Yankees and putting behind them
four decades of bad luck, bad breaks and bad baseball.</TE>

<LD>WORTH ANOTHER LOOK: It's not that everything went exactly the way the
Angels would have scripted it in the 2002 World Series. It's that
whatever happened, they found a way to overcome it. The Giants' Barry
Bonds, right photo, hit .471 and set a slugging percentage record of
1.294, but he wasn't able to beat them by himself. In Game 6, San
Francisco's Kenny Lofton tangled with second baseman Adam Kennedy on
a steal, bottom left photo, and ran the Angels into trouble, fueling
a 5-0 lead in the seventh, but a memorable Anaheim comeback wiped
that out in the last two innings. And in Game 7, when Giant pitcher
Livan Hernandez made a mistake and hit Tim Salmon, bottom right, with
a pitch to load the bases, the Angels turned it into a three-run
third inning. All of which left every Angel, including reliever Ben
Weber, center photo, to celebrate with long-suffering fans a
championship that was 42 years in the making.</LD>

<HD>There Is a Real Season for</HD>
<DH>If you were looking for a sign the Angels were a team of
destiny, these defining moments pointed the way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Night falls, and bedtime approaches. For the first time since
brushing his teeth that morning, the adorable little kid removes the
bright red Angel cap from his head, but only after Mom promises he
can wear the cap again tomorrow.</LD>
<LD>   Mom tucks him into bed. Before she turns out the light, the kid
smiles at the stuffed monkey wrapped around his bedpost. The monkey
smiles back. The kid is sure of it.</LD>
<LD>   This could be your kid, or the kid down the block, or the kids
playing T-ball in the park. To this youngest generation of baseball
fans, the Angels won the World Series championship because of a cute
monkey jumping up and down and thousands of fans -- mostly grown-ups,
at that -- banging big red sticks together and making lots of noise.</LD>
<TE>   If a monkey turns a kid into a baseball fan, well, bless the
monkey.</TE>
<TE>   Those kids will outgrow their blissful innocence, although there
is no hurry. They will learn that World Series championships are won
by neither rally monkeys nor noise sticks. The Angels' rally monkey
is great fun, but it does not bat.</TE>
<TE>   Today, one of those kids might be taking a rally monkey to school.
That same kid might be wearing a bright red T-shirt, with the last
name of one of the players on the back. Erstad, maybe, or Glaus or
Eckstein, Salmon or Anderson, Kennedy or Percival. If the kid's a
rebel, maybe Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   The World Series championship trophy commemorates the Angels and
their accomplishments. In their first 41 seasons, the Angels won six
postseason games. This October, they won 11. For the first time, the
Angels are champions of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The moments along the way, like the monkeys, are too numerous to
count. Here are a few defining moments along the path to October
glory:</TE>
<TE>   April 24</TE>
<TE>   When poor results follow high expectations, a manager never sits
easily in his chair. The Angels started the season 6-14, the worst
start in franchise history. They had sunk 10 1/2 games out of first
place. This was not exactly what Disney had in mind when it boosted
the payroll to a club-record $60 million.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, Manager Mike Scioscia presented a lineup in which
reserve outfielder Orlando Palmeiro batted in the No. 3 spot,
traditionally the province of the best hitter on the team. In 1,459
career at-bats, Palmeiro has three home runs.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels lost again, Scioscia would risk players wondering
whether he had pushed the panic button and would hear more questions
about his job security. But Palmeiro slapped three hits, and the
Angels scored five runs in the first inning en route to a 10-4
victory over the Seattle Mariners, the first of eight consecutive
victories and the start of a 21-3 run. The Angels became the first
team in major league history to lose 14 of their first 20 games and
qualify for the playoffs; Scioscia is expected to win the American
League manager of the year award.</TE>
<TE>   April 28</TE>
<TE>   The Angels like to say shortstop David Eckstein does all the
little things, and there is no pun intended. Eckstein stands a couple
of eyelashes taller than 5 feet 6, but the Angels believe he is the
smartest man in their clubhouse, coaching staff included. He led the
league in sacrifice bunts and times hit by pitch. He rarely struck
out or grounded into a double play. He chastises himself for hitting
a fly ball in batting practice, because his game involves slapping
singles over the field and maximizing his speed. Power, he believes,
is something best left to the big guys.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein had hit a grand slam the night before, in the fifth
inning of an 11-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Hey, accidents
happen.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, he hit another grand slam, this one a walk-off slam
in the 14th inning, good for an 8-5 victory over Toronto. He became
the first shortstop in major league history to hit grand slams in
consecutive games. The Angels had yet to scramble back to the .500
mark, but the consensus in the clubhouse was that this marked the
turning point of the season, the first sign that something magical
might be happening this year.</TE>
<TE>   May 10</TE>
<TE>   The Angels crashed in 2001 in large part because their offense
did. They crashed in the first three weeks of the season in large
part because their offense did. If outfielders Tim Salmon and Darin
Erstad sputtered again this year, and if second baseman Adam Kennedy
did not progress, the Angels again would sink in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the Angels crushed the Chicago White Sox, 19-0--the
largest victory margin ever in an Angel shutout--only 11 days after
another 19-run victory, that one 21-2 over the Cleveland Indians. On
this day, Kennedy hit two home runs, Salmon had four hits and Erstad
scored twice.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy finished the season with a .312 batting average, leading
the team and ranking seventh in the league. Salmon rebounded from
.227 to .286 and Erstad from .258 to .283. The Angels led the major
leagues in batting average (.282) and fewest times struck out.</TE>
<TE>   June 24</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey made his major league debut, summoned from triple-A
Salt Lake for a spot start in a doubleheader. The third batter he
faced, Alex Rodriguez, whacked a 433-foot home run.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey, displaying the poise that all the world saw when he won
Game 7 of the World Series, shrugged off Rodriguez's home run and
held the Texas Rangers to three runs over seven innings. The Angels
lost, 3-2, but they decided Lackey needed no further refinement in
the minor leagues. They inserted him into the starting rotation and
dumped Scott Schoeneweis into the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The move paid off. Lackey went 9-4 with a 3.66 earned-run average,
the lowest of any starter beside ace Jarrod Washburn. Schoeneweis,
maddeningly inconsistent in his three years as a starter, prospered
in the bullpen. On July 15, Dennis Cook was diagnosed with a torn
rotator cuff, leaving Schoeneweis as the Angels' lone left-handed
reliever. From that day forward, he posted a 1.71 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   July 19</TE>
<TE>   No pennants would be won if the Angels could not defeat the
Mariners. At the All-Star break, the Angels stared at a schedule that
included 12 games remaining against Seattle. The Angels had lost 21
of their last 26 games against the Mariners, including 12 in a row at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the Angels exorcised the first of so many demons to
be exorcised this season. The Angels peppered Seattle for 20 hits,
including five by Salmon, in a 15-3 rout at Edison Field. The losing
pitcher was Freddy Garcia, who was 5-0 against the Angels in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Washburn and the Angels beat Seattle, 7-5.
Washburn extended his winning streak to 12 games, setting a franchise
record for consecutive victories in a season. The Angels swept the
three-game series, their first sweep of the Mariners in four years.</TE>
<TE>   August 25</TE>
<TE>   In Fenway Park, the Boston Red Sox tried to slow down the Angels
in the wild-card race. Pedro Martinez won the first game in a
four-game series, but Kevin Appier, Brendan Donnelly, Schoeneweis and
Troy Percival combined on a shutout in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the third game of the series, the Red Sox desperately
needed to win. Their starting pitcher was Cy Young Award candidate
Derek Lowe. The Angels' starting pitcher was Mickey Callaway, making
his first major league start in three years, summoned from the minor
leagues to replace the injured Aaron Sele.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway gave up two earned runs in six innings. Lowe and the Red
Sox lost, 8-3. And, in his major league debut, Chone Figgins entered
the game as a pinch-runner, raced from first base to third on a
single to left field and scored the go-ahead run on a squeeze by
Eckstein. Figgins later won another game with his speed, in the 10th
inning of a 4-2 victory at Baltimore, and made the playoff roster as
a pinch-runner.</TE>
<TE>   August 29</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the final one before the strike deadline set by major
league players, the fans did not take kindly to the possibility that
the Angels' magical season might be cut short. The Angels beat the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 6-1, but not before an atypically rowdy crowd
let loose some anger, chanting "NO STRIKE" and throwing baseballs and
beach balls, water bottles and soda bottles, beer cups and toilet
paper onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis, the Angels' player representative, ripped the fans as
"classless" and said, "When 4-year-olds get frustrated, they throw
stuff. Grown adults shouldn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   The strike is averted, after all-night negotiations in New York.
The Angels return to Edison Field the next day, beating the Orioles,
6-2. Schoeneweis earned his first major league save. He was heartily
booed.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 15</TE>
<TE>   The power of third baseman Troy Glaus makes him the one player who
can carry the Angels for days at a time. But power hitters are
notoriously streaky, and Glaus' power was intermittent for most of
the summer. After hitting a league-leading 47 home runs two years
ago, and 41 last year, he had only 22 through the first five months
of this season.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Glaus conserved his power for the most critical
time of the year. He hit eight home runs in September and seven more
in October, including three in the World Series, and he earned the
Series MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, he hit three home runs, the first Angel to do so
since Hall of Famer Dave Winfield in 1991. He joined outfielder
Garret Anderson as the first players in club history to drive in 100
runs in three consecutive seasons. In a 13-4 victory over Texas, the
Angels set a franchise record with their 94th victory--they finished
with 99--and ascended a season-high 39 games over .500, another
franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 18</TE>
<TE>   On this day, with little notice, a September call-up named
Francisco Rodriguez made his major league debut in a 7-4 loss to the
Oakland Athletics. He gave up a single to Eric Chavez, then got
Jermaine Dye to fly out. He then struck out John Mabry and Mark
Ellis, the first of eight consecutive strikeouts (over four
appearances), tying Nolan Ryan's franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   In 5 2/3 innings, he gave up no runs and struck out 13, and the
Angels scrambled to add him to the playoff roster. He pitched 18 2/3
innings in postseason play, striking out 28, and recording five of
the Angels' 11 playoff victories. At 20, he became the youngest
player to earn a World Series victory. In Game 7, he pitched one
inning and struck out three of the four batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 26</TE>
<TE>   On this day, after an agonizingly long wait through four
consecutive losses, the Angels clinched their first playoff berth in
16 years. Anderson, Salmon and Scott Spiezio all hit home runs, and
Lackey was the winning pitcher in a 10-5 victory at Texas. The Angels
are back in the saddle again, galloping into the playoffs and toward
their first World Series championship.</TE>

<LD>A million thanks to the world champion Angels. Thank you for showing
the world how baseball is to be played: one at-bat, one base, one
game at a time. No stars who stare at home runs, no pitchers shooting
out batters, no flash over fundamentals.</LD>
<LD>   You have destroyed a 41-year-old myth that the Angels are
synonymous with futility; you have set a blueprint for how to build a
team that fits with the manager's game plan; and you gave
long-suffering fans a championship to be proud of, because it was
done the right way, with home-grown talent, coupled with judicious
trades and signings.</LD>

<TE>   I have been an Angel fan since I was 6 years old. I remember going
to games with my father, hoping to experience that one magical
moment. And, after years of disappointment, lost title hopes, poor
trades, living in the shadow of the Dodgers and, of course, those
forgettable periwinkle uniforms, I had pretty much given up hope.</TE>
<TE>   Then it happened: Game 6 vs. the Giants. I rocked with the rest of
the crowd as our team came back with a vengeance. The excitement and
electricity was like no other I've ever experienced. It left the
Giants and the rest of baseball wondering, "What just happened?"
Well, what happened was my "magical moment" had finally arrived.</TE>

<TE>   In 1951, when I was an 11-year-old Dodger fan, the New York Giants
and Bobby Thomson put a huge bone in my throat. Several pennant
victories by the Dodgers over the Giants were never dramatic enough
to clear it. A bunch of no-name Angels, true throwbacks to the '50s,
did the trick quite nicely this weekend. Fifty-one years later, I can
breathe again.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Van Wagenen</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Can someone explain to me how Barry Bonds can have the most
productive World Series in history, setting records for a seven-game
series (runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, walks,
intentional walks) -- some of which will last for decades, if not
forever -- and not be voted the 2002 World Series MVP?</TE>
<TE>   One article commented that Troy Glaus (who also had a fine series,
of course) had more RBIs than Bonds by a margin of eight to six. How
could he not? Bonds was walked intentionally seven times -- most, if
not all, of those with men on base. And pitched around on other
occasions with men on base. Psychologically he dominated every
half-inning in which he came to the plate, or appeared likely to come
to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   The award is not defined as the most valuable player on the
winning team. Nor is it a Mr. Congeniality award. The sportswriters
and broadcasters who did not vote for Bonds should be ashamed of
themselves; 50 years from now people will still be looking at the
numbers Bonds amassed in this series and wonder which game those
voters were watching.</TE>

<TE>   Even up here in Northern California, when people see my Angel cap,
they say something like, "Thanks for beating the Yankees," or "I'm a
Giants fan, but I've got to say, you've got an amazing team." Today,
as I went to a newsstand in Palo Alto to buy an L.A. Times to read
the local coverage of my first World Series victory, the two guys
behind the counter (one wearing black and orange) saw my hat and they
actually applauded.</TE>

<LD>There are no guarantees, no sure things.</LD>
<LD>   There is no easy route back to the World Series, but there is also
no reason to think the Angels can't be competitive again next year,
can't contend for a wild card, division title and, perhaps, more.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, no recent World Series winner figures to be better
prepared in the context of returning virtually the entire roster that
was responsible for 110 wins, 11 in the 16 games of the postseason.</LD>
<TE>   Only three Angels--outfielders Orlando Palmeiro and Alex Ochoa and
relief pitcher Dennis Cook (who may retire)--are eligible for free
agency, and virtually the entire nucleus, home-grown and otherwise,
is either signed to comparatively modest multiyear contracts covering
next year at least or still under club control -- a tribute to the
aggressive foresight of General Manager Bill Stoneman and predecessor
Bill Bavasi.</TE>
<TE>   It is conceivable, in other words, that the Angels could do
nothing over the winter and return next year with basically the same
lineup, rotation and bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The harder part, perhaps, will be returning with the same selfless
approach at the plate, the same sense of Team, with a capital T, but
then it is unlikely Manager Mike Scioscia will tolerate anything
less.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting to know that this core of players is going to be
together for some time," Scioscia said before the corks popped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's championship caliber, and with the experience of what
they're accomplishing this year, the confidence level will be high
enough to let it remain championship caliber."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, of course, have yet to even enjoy their parade.</TE>
<TE>   Next year can wait.</TE>
<TE>   But the extent of the potential stability and continuity they take
into the winter can be measured against the uncertainty facing the
team they just defeated in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The potential upheaval starts with Manager Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giants can't be sure he will be back or wants to
be back.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, valuable second baseman Jeff Kent is eligible for
free agency and likely to test a market that may include interest
from the Dodgers, who were aware they had to make an impact move to
improve the offense even before the Angels, playing a game familiar
to the Dodgers of the past, stole some of the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Giants, meantime, center fielder Kenny Lofton and
utility players Tom Goodwin and Shawon Dunston also are eligible for
free agency, and the status of four others--third baseman David Bell,
right fielder Reggie Sanders, closer Robb Nen and reliever Tim
Worrell--hinge on option clauses at a time when the new labor
agreement and alleged industry losses of $800 million could find
option and arbitration-eligible players thrown into a market almost
certain to undergo significant correction.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the potential impact of all that on a lineup that
included eight players 30 or older, it was not surprising that
managing general partner Peter Magowan stood by the Giants' dugout at
Edison Field before Game 7, reflected on the fact that it had been 40
years since the team had last played a Game 7, and said candidly, "I
don't know if I'll ever be here again."</TE>
<TE>   Magowan said he wasn't ready to ponder his club's immediate
future, but he added:</TE>
<TE>   "I do think when you get into a World Series, you have to have a
pretty good team to get there, and there's a lot of incentive to try
to have as much of that team coming back next year as you can. Having
said that, the days are over when a World Series team could come back
intact. The Yankees are a good example. Of the eight starters on that
team last year, four [were] not back this year. [Paul O'Neill and
Scott Brosius retired, and Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch left as
free agents]. So if the Yankees can't keep their team together, the
Giants will have a pretty tough time of it."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to the fact that revenues in San Francisco don't
compare to those in the Bronx. The Yankees had a payroll of about
$130 million, while the Giants were at $78.3 and will have to keep it
there, Magowan said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Angels went the distance with a payroll of $61.6
million and do basically have their World Series roster returning
intact additionally validates the work done by Stoneman and Bavasi,
along with former scouting director Bob Fontaine Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Magowan concurred.</TE>
<TE>   While wondering if he and the Giants would ever be back for a Game
7 (or even a Game 1), he said of the Angels: "I like the way they
play and the way they've been put together. They're young enough that
I have to think this won't be the last time they'll be in a World
Series."</TE>
<TE>   In the final days of the American League West race, as the Angels
and Oakland A's jousted down the stretch after the A's had been
unable to shake the Angels despite winning 20 consecutive games,
Oakland General Manager Billy Beane offered a similar thought, saying
of the Angels: "They're not going anywhere. They're going to be good
again next year."</TE>
<TE>   All of this is not to suggest that the World Series winner doesn't
have issues.</TE>
<TE>   How much will Disney let the payroll expand at a time when it
finally has suitors seriously interested in buying the team?</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, who had biting comments when his contract was
renewed at $350,000 last spring and went on to win 18 games, will be
pursuing a multiyear contract while also eligible for the often nasty
process of arbitration. Adam Kennedy, Scott Spiezio, Benji Gil, Scott
Schoeneweis and Brad Fullmer also are arbitration eligible, and
Fullmer, who regained a consistent groove when it was needed in
September and October, could pose a significant decision for Stoneman
after making $3.75 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also are likely to consider multiyear offers to David
Eckstein, John Lackey and Francisco Rodriguez among a group of
players not yet eligible for arbitration and which includes Brendan
Donnelly, Ben Weber and Scot Shields--all in line for raises.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, Lackey and Ramon Ortiz will certainly make up
three-fifths of next year's rotation, but what about Kevin Appier,
who appeared to be a spent pitcher after Sept. 1, and Aaron Sele, who
is coming off rotator cuff surgery? They are still owed $40 million
through 2003 and 2004 without either having much market value. In
addition, how do the Angels go about adding depth to their
left-handed relief ranks, especially if Schoeneweis insists on
starting or demands a trade?</TE>
<TE>   In a recent ranking by Baseball America of the top-10 prospects in
every minor league, the Angels had more than any other team--which is
another reason to think 2002 can be sustained -- but whether any will
make the 2003 team (outfielder Robb Quinlan, the Pacific Coast League
MVP may have the best shot at a reserve role) is problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman enters the winter with one year left on his contract, a
situation that probably will be left to the new owners, and pitching
coach Bud Black, under whom the team's earned-run average has
improved each of his three years, could leave for a managerial
opportunity with either the Giants or Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   In the intensely competitive AL West, where the Mariners, A's and
Texas Rangers all will have new managers, Scioscia is suddenly the
dean after just three years with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the World Series king, with a seemingly competitive
chance of retaining his crown.</TE>

<LD>And on guitar and lead vocals, please welcome to the stage ... Scott
Spiezio!</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' victory celebration today will not be complete without
a little music from Spiezio and his band, Sandfrog. Thanks to
Spiezio's high-profile day job as the Angels' first baseman, Sandfrog
might be one of the most publicized garage bands in music history.</LD>
<LD>   The band, formed by Spiezio and several old friends back home in
Illinois, has been together for years. Sandfrog has yet to record an
album, but thanks to Spiezio, the band has been featured in newspaper
and magazine stories for several years now. During its World Series
telecasts, Fox hyped Spiezio and his band.</LD>
<TE>   So it's about time for a live performance from Sandfrog, or at the
very least, a solo performance from Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio's bandmates all made it to Anaheim for the final game of
the World Series, but Spiezio wasn't sure whether they could stick
around for today's rally.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Spiezio made no promises but called a performance "a
possibility," even if some of the band members cannot be there.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to get some big-name guys to take their place," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The victory rally starts at noon in the Edison Field parking lot.
The festivities start with a cavalcade down Disneyland's Main Street
USA at 10 a.m., followed by the official parade at 11, which starts
at the Arrowhead Pond and proceeds along Katella Avenue to Edison
Field.</TE>

<HD>Top 10 Reasons Angels Are Champions</HD>

<LD>It was never about the ninth-inning, game-winning home run.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels didn't have any of those.</LD>
<LD>   It was never about the brilliantly pitched shutout.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels didn't have any of those, either.</TE>
<TE>   Their October search for a World Series championship ring was
never about the diamonds or the gold.</TE>
<TE>   It was always about the inside of the ring, the engraving, the
part seen only by them, the part that makes it their ring.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout their postseason, the Angels were not a team of
expensive giant baubles, but priceless little messages.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the most important 10, in chronological order:</TE>
<TE>   * The Pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   Opening game of the division series against the New York Yankees,
fifth inning, Angels trailing, 3-1, everyone wondering if the new
kids were already cracking.</TE>
<TE>   With Adam Kennedy running from first base and David Eckstein
batting, the Yankees pitched out and should have easily nailed
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Except Eckstein leaned out across the plate and fouled off the
pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   We'll repeat that for the hard of believing.</TE>
<TE>   He fouled off the pitchout.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens stared at home plate in disbelief. Who knows how
many scouts and future playoff opponents were doing the same thing?</TE>
<TE>   The Angels eventually lost that game, but the message had been
sent that they would were afraid of nothing, and would try anything.</TE>
<TE>   * The Adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   While everyone will remember Angel Manager Mike Scioscia's refusal
to bring in Troy Percival with two out in the eighth inning in their
opening loss to the Yankees, do you remember what happened the next
night?</TE>
<TE>   There were two out in the eighth and the Angels were leading
again, just as they had in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Only this time, Percival was brought into the game and he saved
the Angels' first postseason victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sign that Scioscia was not afraid to admit he could learn
from the past and adjust on the run. It was the night a great manager
became even better.</TE>
<TE>   * The Groundout.</TE>
<TE>   The big news in Game 3 against the Yankees was Erstad's
run-scoring double in the eighth inning that capped a comeback from a
6-1 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the bigger news was the first run of the comeback, in
the second inning on a shortened-stroke RBI groundout to first base
by Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on second and third and the team trailing, Spiezio
could have been swinging for the fences. And early in the at-bat, he
was.</TE>
<TE>   But once he fell behind two strikes, he said he remembered the
Angels' mantra about scoring runs at any cost, even with an out.</TE>
<TE>   With the groundout, he showed that this team was not about fear or
panic, but smarts and unselfishness.</TE>
<TE>   * The Slap.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' eight-run, 10-hit, line-driving fifth inning in the
clinching win over the Yankees was truly memorable.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps even more compelling was the slap that helped start it
all.</TE>
<TE>   With Benji Gil on first base and one out and the score tied, 2-2,
in the eighth, the Angels called upon Eckstein to hit and run.</TE>
<TE>   Gil sprinted to second, Eckstein fought off a pitch that he
slapped into right field, and suddenly the emotional David Wells was
surrounded by runners on first and third with a stadium roaring above
him.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the next eight batters got hits, and the Angels were soon
headed to the American League championship series -- the Yankees
having been knocked out by a feather.</TE>
<TE>   * The Recovery.</TE>
<TE>   You'll remember that the Angels scored four runs in the first two
innings of Game 2 of the AL championship series against the Minnesota
Twins, setting the tone for four consecutive wins after an
opening-game loss.</TE>
<TE>   But do you remember that none of it would have been possible
without Kennedy's falling on his rear between first and second base?</TE>
<TE>   He fell and was apparently going to be picked off, but then he
scrambled to his feet to force a rundown that allowed Spiezio to
attempt to sneak home from third base.</TE>
<TE>   That led the Twins' throw to the plate, which led to a collision,
which led to a run by Spiezio that helped the Angels forge a lead
they never lost.</TE>
<TE>   This showed the Angels were blessed even when they were
bone-headed.</TE>
<TE>   * The Slider.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knew that, in tough situations, Francisco Rodriguez could
throw the ball 95 mph and somebody would probably swing and miss.</TE>
<TE>   But who would have thought that, when he thought the hitter was
looking for a fastball, he would have the guts to throw something
even more impossible to hit?</TE>
<TE>   It was Game 4 against the Twins, eighth inning, a runner on third,
two out, tying run at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   And K-Rod struck out Bobby Kielty, flailing at a pitch that
registered 83 mph.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Angels weren't just winning games, they were messing
with minds.</TE>
<TE>   * The Cutoff Man.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the 10-run inning that clinched the pennant in Game 5
against the Twins, the Angels made a big play without ever touching a
bat.</TE>
<TE>   With the Twins leading, 1-0, in the second, A.J. Pierzynski
knocked a line drive to left field, sending Dustan Mohr home from
second base.</TE>
<TE>   As the throw left Garret Anderson's hand, Pierzynski rounded first
and took off for second.</TE>
<TE>   But Troy Glaus, in a play as big as any of his giant hits, cut off
the throw and flipped it to Kennedy, who tagged out Pierzynski.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Mohr scored. But suddenly there were two out, the uprising
was quelled, and it would be nine batters before another Twin reached
base.</TE>
<TE>   These Angels weren't just storybook, they were textbook.</TE>
<TE>   * The At-Bat.</TE>
<TE>   While everyone will remember Tim Salmon's eighth-inning home run
that gave the Angels an 11-10 victory over the San Francisco Giants
in Game 2 of the World Series, do you remember what happened moments
earlier?</TE>
<TE>   Erstad flied out to left. But he wore down pitcher Felix Rodriguez
for eight pitches in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Included were three foul balls, two throws to first base, and one
step-away-from-the-plate move by Erstad to take off his batting
helmet and glare.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed that the entire thing took 20 minutes. Salmon then won
the game in about 20 seconds, hitting the weary and frustrated
Rodriguez's first pitch over the left-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants learned what others already knew -- to overpower the
Angels you must first outlast them, and good luck.</TE>
<TE>   * The First Pitch.</TE>
<TE>   In the throes of World Series Game 6 madness, with the Angels
having closed the gap to 5-3 at the start of the eighth inning, only
three people at Edison Field remained calm.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, Salmon and Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   With the time expiring on their season, all three batters
amazingly took the first pitch from the struggling Giant relievers.</TE>
<TE>   All three were rewarded with a pitch out of the strike zone.</TE>
<TE>   All three then sighed, dug in, and proceeded to deliver three of
the most important hits of the Angel season.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting 42 years, these Angels continually proved they could
wait for the right pitch.</TE>
<TE>   * The Last Great Strike.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, people will forget that the Angels' seemingly easy
4-1 victory in Game 7 of the World Series actually came down to the
ninth inning, with runners on first and second and Tsuyoshi Shinjo,
the potential tying run, at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   With an overpowering energy that came out of nowhere and
everywhere, Percival unleashed a 98-mph fastball, the hardest single
pitch he threw all month.</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo froze at that first-pitch strike and meekly struck out four
pitches later.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Kenny Lofton flied out to Erstad, and the halo had
been replaced by a crown.</TE>

<LD>On the day after the Angels finished the regular season and headed to
New York for the playoffs, there appeared on the median island on a
wide, busy Tustin road, a neatly lettered sign.</LD>
<LD>   It said, simply, "Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad."</LD>
<LD>   And the day after the Angels beat the Twins to advance to the
World Series, there was another sign, stuck into the ground at Cedar
Grove Park. It was hand-lettered too, maybe not perfectly neat, done
perhaps by a child. It said, "Tustin Loves Tim Salmon."</LD>
<TE>   On Walnut Avenue, the street that turns into Orangewood and leads
to Edison Field, as the playoffs traveled forward, with the Angels
completing astounding comeback after incredible rally, little houses
sprouted incredibly inventive, carefully designed, clearly heartfelt
cheers for the Angels. Big signs, little signs, banners with sparkles
used to make the halo around the Angel 'A' glitter even after dark.
This was not manufactured, artificially drummed-up enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   This was sports at its neatest, moms and dads and kids coming to
root for the Angels not because they had always been Angel fans or
because they had season tickets or because their dad or grandpa had
rooted for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   It was because this particular team, its players and coaches, its
style of play, its humbleness, its all-for-one attitude that wasn't
corny because it was real, made baseball fun again.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened with me.</TE>
<TE>   The only baseball playoffs I had covered from start to finish in
my life came nine years ago. It was in Philadelphia and the upstart
Phillies, a franchise overcome by malaise in the previous decade, and
overcome again in the next, made an unexpected playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   And it was no fun.</TE>
<TE>   The clubhouse was an unfriendly place. The stars -- Lenny Dykstra,
John Kruk and Darren Daulton -- dubbed their area of lockers "Macho
Row," and it was real estate that gave "macho" a bad name.</TE>
<TE>   There always seemed to be tension. One game in July, the Phillies
beat the Dodgers, 7-6, in 20 innings but only after closer Mitch
"Wild Thing" Williams blew a 5-3 lead in the ninth. Afterward, Kruk
said, "I came here and I wanted to kill Mitch, but they told me it
was against the law."</TE>
<TE>   In an August game, starting pitcher Terry Mulholland broke his
right hand because he punched a water cooler after a 3-2 loss. It was
that kind of team. Undisciplined, a bit out of control, sometimes
scary.</TE>
<TE>   Games were sloppy, players were moody, egos were prominent. And
when Williams blew a one-run lead in the bottom of the ninth of Game
6 by giving up a three-run homer to Joe Carter and handing the Blue
Jays the World Series, Williams received death threats and had police
protection around his New Jersey home for a week.</TE>
<TE>   What followed, it seemed, was nine years of more ugliness than
happiness in baseball. There was labor strife and animosity --
between players and owners, players and fans, media and players, fans
and owners -- and the game seemed to deteriorate into nothing but a
home run-hitting contest, with discussions of steroid use and a race
between the teams that could spend money faster than anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   As beautiful as it is to watch Derek Jeter play shortstop or
Bernie Williams play center field, there seemed no sport to watching
the Yankees win.</TE>
<TE>   And then came these Angels.</TE>
<TE>   They were never boastful and they had no superstars.</TE>
<TE>   When they started the season badly, when Edison Field was sparsely
populated, when their games weren't on TV and barely on the radio,
none of the Angels complained.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand why the fans are skeptical," Tim Salmon said one
day. "They need for us to prove something to them."</TE>
<TE>   There was a linear progression to the way the Angels played.
Singles were followed by doubles. Some games were clinics in the
proper way to execute the hit-and-run. At-bats were to be treasured
and there was entertainment in watching David Eckstein or Scott
Spiezio foul off four, five pitches in a row before lining an
offering to left or right.</TE>
<TE>   It was fun watching Troy Glaus learn patience and the reward of
going the opposite way and hitting an RBI single and celebrating as
enthusiastically as when he hit home runs. It was hard not to root
for Spiezio and Eckstein and Brendan Donnelly and Ben Weber and all
the other Angels who had been cut, released, told to go away.</TE>
<TE>   This was a team in the truest sense and we get that so seldom in
sports any more.</TE>
<TE>   These Angels, though, grew up together, most of them. They are
signed as Angels for the next couple of years, most of them. They
haven't resented being anonymous, they don't mind sacrificing
personal gain for a greater team good.</TE>
<TE>   They were classy in praising Barry Bonds and never showed
resentment at the way Bonds would stand and admire his grand home
runs. Glaus didn't complain about getting dusted. Starting pitchers
went to the bullpen. Rookie Francisco Rodriguez was made to feel at
home. Rookie John Lackey couldn't stop praising veteran Dennis Cook,
who had been left off the World Series roster but who kept pulling
aside Lackey to give him tips.</TE>
<TE>   And now I'm a baseball fan again. A team beat individual
greatness.</TE>

<HD>Ratings Tumble but Not in L.A.</HD>
<DH>World Series has record-low numbers nationally, but Game 7
has highest numbers in two years here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Series drew record-low ratings nationally, but it was a
different story in Los Angeles, where they went through the roof.</LD>
<LD>   For Game 7, Channel 11 got a 42.1 Nielsen rating with a 61 share,
the highest L.A. rating of any kind since the 2000 Academy Awards on
ABC got a 43.1/61.</LD>
<LD>   No sports event has drawn that kind of L.A. rating since the 1998
Super Bowl at San Diego between Denver and Green Bay drew a 43.5/71.</LD>
<TE>   The last sports event to get anywhere close to the 42.9 was a 36.9
for Game 7 of last season's Western Conference finals between the
Lakers and Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Anaheim's 4-1 victory Sunday night got a 17.9
preliminary rating and 28 share, down 24% from last year's Game 7
between Arizona and the New York Yankees (23.5/34).</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' seven-game World Series triumph over the San Francisco
Giants averaged a 31.1/39 in L.A., which is 102% better than the
15.4/26 last year's Series.</TE>
<TE>   This year's four-game NBA Finals in June averaged 31.8/51 and the
five-game NBA Finals in 2000 averaged 33.2/54.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the World Series averaged an 11.9 rating and 20 share,
24% below last year's 15.7/26.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record low was a 12.4/21 for the Yankees' five-game
win over the Mets in the 2000 Subway Series.</TE>
<TE>   As television ratings have dropped in general, so have ratings for
the Fall Classic. Minnesota's seven-game victory over Atlanta in 1991
got a 24.0 rating and 39 share. The top Series rating was a 32.8/56
for Philadelphia's six-game victory over Kansas City in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   But Fox executives were generally pleased with the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "While the viewership was not as high as we had hoped, the fact is
that Fox won six of the seven nights World Series games were played,
won the week in households and adults 18-49, and will finish ahead of
our business forecast," said Ed Goren, president of Fox Sports.</TE>
<TE>   And Fox executives in Los Angeles see a brighter future for
baseball here.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to see viewers in this area get behind the Angels
the way they did," said Dave Boylan, general manger of Channel 11 and
Channel 13. "And it was nice to see baseball was up in general this
season in Los Angeles. Now there is some real momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking ahead to next season, our sales staff [which also sells
for Fox Sports Net] is already banging their ThunderStix."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net's Angel ratings were up 40% from a year ago,
Channel 9's were up 60% and Dodger ratings overall were up about 30%.</TE>
<TE>   The national picture is not as pretty, even though Fox estimated
that 57.9 million viewers saw Game 7, making it the most-watched
program of the television season.</TE>
<TE>   With the Yankees not in the World Series for the first time since
1997, the all-California matchup set record lows for an opener (9.4),
Game 2 (11.9), Game 3 (10.8), Game 4 (11.8), Game 5 (10.0), Game 6
(11.8) and Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   The 11.9 national average for the World Series paled in comparison
to last season's Super Bowl, which got a 40.4/61. The NCAA men's
basketball championship game between Maryland and Indiana got a 15.0,
and Miami's national football championship Rose Bowl victory over
Nebraska got a 13.8.</TE>
<TE>   After Game 7, Fox Sports chairman David Hill joined in all the
celebrating the Fox crew was doing in the TV complex at Edison Field.
But on Saturday, Hill hadn't been so upbeat. He cited this season's
labor strife as being partly responsible for the ratings decline.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, baseball managed to turn off its loyal fans," he
said. "I hoped it would pick up when we got to the postseason. It
certainly hasn't been what I hoped it would be.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ratings had been terrific all year. They went in the bucket
when all the bristling and saber rattling started."</TE>
<TE>   Fox is in the second year of its six-year baseball contract.</TE>
<TE>   The rating is the percentage of TV households in the U.S. watching
a broadcast, and each national point represents 1,055,000 homes. The
share is the percentage watching a program among those households
with televisions on at the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today's Angel victory celebration will get blanket media coverage.
Television coverage will be provided by Channels 4, 7 and 9 at 10
a.m., Fox Sports Net at 10:30 a.m. and Channel 11 at 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   KSPN (1110), which becomes the Angels' flagship radio station next
season, will have coverage from 6 a.m. until 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   KLAC (570) will begin coverage at 11 a.m. and KXTA (1150) and KLAC
will have joint, simulcasted coverage beginning at noon. After the
celebration, both stations will carry a special Angel playoff review.</TE>

<DH>In winning first World Series, Angels were ultimate example
of what it means to come together</DH>

<LD>Twenty-five players ... one cab? You think of the 2002 Angels and
that old circus act comes to mind, the one where a Volkswagen Bug
pulls up, one clown gets out, then another dozen clowns follow, as if
they were all squeezed into the tiny car.</LD>
<LD>   But it was no illusion with the close-knit Angels, who took team
harmony to another octave throughout a season that ended with a
thundering climax in Edison Field on Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   It took a village to raise a championship trophy, and never was
that more apparent than in the World Series, when the whole of the
Angels was far greater than the sum of their parts; when a band of
brothers won out in a thrilling seven-game series over baseball's
only child.</LD>
<TE>   "I tell you what, Barry Bonds is the best hitter I've ever seen,"
Angel closer Troy Percival said of the San Francisco Giant slugger,
who will go down as one of the most dominant offensive forces in
World Series history. "But we threw nine clutch hitters at them. We
had nine guys who wouldn't quit."</TE>
<TE>   That did not make this reporter's job as a member of the small
panel chosen to select the World Series most valuable player any
easier.</TE>
<TE>   A strong case was made for Glaus, who hit .385 with three home
runs, three doubles, eight runs batted in, seven runs and knocked in
the tying and winning runs with a two-run double in the eighth inning
of Game 6, as the Angels overcame a five-run deficit for a dramatic
6-5 victory that forced a Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   The award could have gone to first baseman Scott Spiezio, who hit
.281 but knocked in eight runs, three of them on his seventh-inning
home run that resuscitated the Angels in Game 6, turning a 5-0
deficit into a 5-3 game, and two on a third-inning triple that
jump-started the Angel offense in a 10-4 Game 3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Or it could have gone to right fielder Tim Salmon, who hit .346
with two home runs and five RBIs, two of them coming on his
eighth-inning home run that broke a 9-9 tie and lifted the Angels to
an 11-10 victory in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Though they may not have been MVP candidates, center fielder Darin
Erstad hit .300, made two spectacular diving catches, one of them in
the fifth inning of Game 7, and inched the Angels ever closer to
their Game 6 victory with a leadoff homer in the eighth inning that
trimmed San Francisco's lead to 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop David Eckstein hit .310 with three walks and three RBIs.
Garret Anderson, relatively quiet most of the Series, broke a 1-1 tie
with a three-run double in the third inning of Game 7, sending the
Angels on their way to a 4-1 Series-clinching victory. Reliever
Brendan Donnelly threw 7 2/3 scoreless, one-hit innings in five
appearances, and Percival had three saves.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Glaus was named series MVP, which he called a great
honor.</TE>
<TE>   "But we play for the big trophy with the pennants on it, not for
these," Glaus said, comparing the World Series and MVP trophies. "No
one guy on this team has gotten us to this point or carried us
through this point. It's been a team effort all the way through, 25
guys."</TE>
<TE>   And it was that way against the Giants in the World Series. Every
night, it seemed, there was a different Angel hero, and the
cumulative effect of so many contributions from so many sources was
to offset Bonds, who hit .471 with four homers, six RBIs, 13 walks
and eight runs and reached base 21 times in 30 plate appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds made an immediate impact, smashing the second pitch he saw
in the Series far over the Edison Field wall in right field, giving
the Giants a 1-0 lead in the second inning of Game 1, and two batters
later, Reggie Sanders homered to make it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus hit two solo homers in the game, but he was trumped by San
Francisco first baseman J.T. Snow, whose two-run homer in the sixth
was the difference in the Giants' 4-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The resilient Angels rebounded in Game 2, pounding Giant starter
Russ Ortiz for five runs in the first inning, but they blew the lead
and were trailing, 9-7, in the fifth. Spiezio's sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the fifth and Anderson's RBI single in the sixth tied the
score, and Salmon's second two-run homer of the night won it in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Though the game will long be remembered for Bonds' 485-foot homer
off Percival in the ninth, the Angels had tied the Series, 1-1, and
it was on to Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels batted around in consecutive innings in Game 3, scoring
four times in the third and fourth innings on their way to a
comfortable 10-4 victory, but David Bell's eighth-inning RBI single
off Angel reliever Francisco Rodriguez gave the Giants a 4-3 victory
in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco pummeled Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn and
several relievers en route to a 16-4 Game 5 victory that gave the
Giants a 3-2 edge in the best-of-seven series, and San Francisco was
eight outs away from its first championship since 1954 when the
Giants had a 5-0 lead over the Angels with one out in the seventh
inning of Game 6 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   What transpired over the next two innings is why some have already
called Game 6 one of the best in World Series history, a game that
may supplant Kirk Gibson's dramatic 1988 World Series Game 1-winning
homer as the most memorable moment in Southern California baseball
history.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus and Brad Fullmer each singled, and Spiezio battled through
an eight-pitch at-bat against reliever Felix Rodriguez to deliver a
three-run homer to right, a high fly ball that barely cleared the
outstretched arm of Sanders at the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad homered off reliever Tim Worrell to lead off the eighth,
Salmon singled, Anderson dropped a bloop single to left, and Glaus
knocked a two-run double to left-center off Giant closer Robb Nen for
a 6-5 victory.</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey, starting on three days' rest, threw five strong
innings in Game 7, giving up one run and four hits to become the
first rookie since Detroit's Babe Adams in 1909 to earn the victory
in a winner-take-all World Series game.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling catcher Bengie Molina doubled in a run in the second
inning, Anderson cleared the bases with his double in the third, and
Donnelly and Francisco Rodriguez combined for three innings of
scoreless relief.</TE>
<TE>   Percival put the finishing touches on the Angels' first
championship, getting Kenny Lofton to lift a high fly ball to right
center with two out and two runners on in the ninth. Erstad called
for it immediately, but routine, this play wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't shaking, but I wasn't breathing, either," a
beer-and-champagne-soaked Erstad said afterward. "I said to myself,
this is the toughest catch I'll ever make in my life. Just use two
hands, like my dad always taught me. I didn't even feel it hit my
glove. I heard the crowd cheering, so I must have caught it. There's
no feeling like this in the world."</TE>
