<LD>Tony Orlando is making a comeback. The sing- er, whose fame crested
in the 1970s as the front man of Tony Orlando and Dawn, has a cameo
role in the new film "Waking Up in Reno," a new solo album, a memoir
in the works, and a Las Vegas show due to open later this month.</LD>
<LD>   He credits the VH1 show "Behind the Music" for jump-starting his
career in 1998. "I think that gave people a handle on who I am as a
person," he told us. "It reopened a relationship with audiences that
were there before and created new ones. My numbers went up. The
interest in me as an artist went up."</LD>
<LD>   VH1producer George Moll said Orlando was a reluctant subject. "At
one point, [he] even threatened to take legal action against us for
interviewing his ex-wife, [because] he was afraid it was going to be
a negative story," Moll said. After the show aired, however, Orlando
took out an ad in the Hollywood Reporter thanking the music channel.</LD>
<TE>   Soon after the program aired, Orlando was contacted by Miramax for
the film, which opens in February and stars Billy Bob Thornton,
Natasha Richardson, Charlize Theron and Patrick Swayze. In the film,
Richardson's character is enamored of Orlando, who plays himself, and
she persuades her friends to travel to Reno to see him perform "Knock
Three Times."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Orlando is scheduled to perform at the Cerritos Center
for the Performing Arts, and on Jan. 22 he opens a 13-week gig at the
Golden Nugget. His as-yet-untitled book is expected out this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's career waned after his trio, including Telma Hopkins and
Joyce Vincent Wilson, broke up in 1977. After that, he was devastated
by the death of his sister, who suffered from cerebral palsy. In the
1990s, Orlando moved to Branson, Mo., and opened a club. Today, the
57-year-old crooner of such hits as "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the
Ole Oak Tree" and "Candida" lives there with his wife, Francine, and
daughter Jenny Rose, 10. Orlando's son Jon, 30, is an actor and
comedian in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Yothers in Court</TE>
<TE>   Former "Family Ties" star-turned-rock singer Tina Yothers and her
band manager, Bob Jones, are scheduled to appear in a Beverly Hills
court today for a hearing on $5,000 in debts they allegedly owe their
former public relations company.</TE>
<TE>   Yothers, who played Jennifer Keaton on the 1980s TV show, recently
launched a career in music. Her legal troubles started last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Luck Media &amp; Marketing President Steve Levesque sued Yothers and
Jones in small claims court last May and won. When no payment was
made, Levesque took them back to court. When they failed to appear in
court in November, a Beverly Hills judge issued a warrant for the
arrest of Yothers and Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones told us that he and Yothers are being held accountable for
charges that were the responsibility of the band's record
distribution company. An executive of the distribution company would
not comment, other than to say the company is considering pursuing
legal action of its own.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Dining</TE>
<TE>   Joachim Splichal, downtown's answer to Wolfgang Puck, is opening a
new restaurant on Figueroa Street. "Downtown is the place to be,"
said Splichal, who founded the Patina Group, which owns Patina, the
Pinot restaurants and Nick &amp; Stef's Steakhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Splichal, formerly a chef at the Seventh Street Bistro and
executive chef at the Regency Club, promises the new Zucca Ristorante
will be "one of the prettiest restaurants in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The menu at Zucca, slated to open in early February, will feature
rustic Italian food in not-so-rustic surroundings. Splichal imported
wood floors from a Tuscan villa, Italian antiques and hand-blown
Venetian crystal chandeliers for the place, which will also have a
1,500-square-foot patio.</TE>
<TE>   "We traveled to Italy and France and picked up everything from
tile flooring to Venetian chandeliers," he said. "It will feel like
walking into an old restaurant in Milan or Florence."</TE>
<TE>   With construction underway on Walt Disney Concert Hall and the
cathedral, it seemed like a good time to open another downtown
restaurant, Splichal said, adding, "We feel very comfortable
downtown." So does Arnie Morton's steakhouse, apparently. A downtown
version opened on Figueroa in November; we hear tables have been
full.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Highland Clubbing</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood &amp; Highland welcomed a new gargantuan club on Tuesday
night: the Highlands, a 30,000-square-foot venue featuring seven
bars, two dance floors, a stage, four dining areas and four patios.
The star wattage at the opening was low (Nelly Furtado and Jennifer
Love Hew- itt notwithstanding), but the views from the place were
spectacular. The club opens Friday to the public.</TE>

<HD>'Backyard' Birding From a Balcony Garden</HD>
<DH>Benita Sanserino's condo balcony is a beautiful haven for
birds and other 'winged things.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN DARDICK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hummingbirds dart from flower to flower to sip nectar from fuchsias,
snapdragons and foxgloves. Juncos, finches and grosbeaks visit the
seed feeder suspended from an upper balcony. Butterflies cling to the
gray stucco walls absorbing warmth and sunlight.</LD>
<LD>   The balconies at Benita Sanserino's condominium are not like the
balconies of so many condos--forlorn space that seems to say "stay
inside." Her balconies are teeming with life, thoughtfully composed
gardens that are havens for "winged things" and humans.</LD>
<LD>   Sanserino has joined the legions of Americans who enthusiastically
combine gardening with bird watching to become a backyard
birder--even though she technically doesn't have a backyard.</LD>
<TE>   Many homeowners combine the two interests by growing nectar-rich
plants to entice birds into their gardens as well as providing seed
and nectar feeders and a water source in their backyards--hence the
term "backyard birders." But apartment and condominium dwellers with
a plan scaled to the space available to them--and honoring any
association restrictions--can create bird-friendly spaces with steps
as simple as adding containers of flowering plants and a small
birdbath.</TE>
<TE>   And, even though "balcony birders" work with a small space, they
can make use of the same principles that work in larger
gardens--grouping together tall and short plants, combining foliage
and color in interesting ways, making sure the plants are suitable
for the amount of sunlight they will get, making sure the soil in
which they are planted gives them the right nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a pleasing environment for birds should be done in a way
that doesn't create an unpleasing one for everyone else. Some condo
associations discourage residents from putting out birdseed because
it can attract undesirable critters--like rodents and crows. But
nectar-producing flowers and hummingbird feeders don't have those
drawbacks, and they still attract small birds. And a small
closed-system water fountain can provide a birdbath without soaking
the patio. Excess water can annoyingly rain down on your neighbor's
space or, more critically, lead to wood damage that makes the balcony
unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Johnson, a staff member at Audubon House and Bookstore in
Los Angeles and a director of the San Fernando Valley Audubon
Society, says it's possible to enjoy birding even if you don't have a
garden. "If people want to make an effort, all they have to do is put
out two feeders--one for seed-eating birds and one for hummingbirds,"
she said. "Water that drips or makes a noise is a big attraction.
There are so many small fountains available that will do the job."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, to attract birds, spend some time thinking like a
bird.</TE>
<TE>   Sanserino and her husband, Gary, live in a condominium complex in
Encinitas, just a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. Their
three-level condo has several balconies and is well-placed for
birding. It's at the end of the building, situated near a cluster of
alder and eucalyptus trees, which provide perches and shelter to a
variety of bird species.</TE>
<TE>   The largest balcony, off the living room, is 7 feet, 6 inches deep
and 16 feet wide and has ample space for dozens of plants, a wall
fountain, patio table and chairs and seed and nectar feeders. The
condo also has two small balconies off the master bedroom that are
planted to attract butterflies. A small entryway patio, which has
strong sun exposure, houses pots of succulents and cacti.</TE>
<TE>   Benita Sanserino estimates that every day, about 50 birds peck
seeds from her feeding stations, splash in the fountain on the living
room terrace and fly among the potted plants she chose for their
usefulness to birds and butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   One of her favorite pastimes is to sit quietly on this balcony,
cup of coffee nearby, and simply watch as the birds come to eat,
drink and bathe.</TE>
<TE>   "I can spend hours here," she said. "My contentment is to sit and
watch the birds as they bathe and listen to them."</TE>
<TE>   From the sofa in her living room, she can look through the glass
doors and watch shy birds, like orioles and warblers, who prefer
privacy as they splash in the cascading water in an ornate wall
fountain--a birthday gift from her husband. He also built a special
seed feeder from PVC pipe that is suspended above the living room
balcony--attached to the balcony on the upper-level bedroom. The
feeder is retractable for ease of cleaning and refilling.</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance of feeders is an important part of birding, balcony or
otherwise. Scott Todd, who with his wife, Ginny Szabo, owns Wild Bird
Center in Encinitas, is an enthusiastic birder who has five feeding
stations in the backyard of his home in Oceanside.</TE>
<TE>   He says it's crucial that hummingbird feeders be cleaned
regularly. "Don't wait for the birds to empty the feeders because
fungus usually starts to grow after a few days and can be deadly to
them. Clean and refill them every four to five days." He recommends
keeping seed and nectar feeders separate to encourage more
hummingbird activity. "Hummingbirds like to dart and don't like to
fly near slower-moving birds," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides feeders and water, birds are also drawn to areas where
trees and shrubs provide cover and protection from predators like
cats and Cooper's hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Sanserino provides shelter for her bird visitors by decorating her
balconies with hanging baskets, planter boxes and potted plants.
Redwood planter boxes fastened to balcony railings contain ivy
geraniums, snapdragons, impatiens and pansies. Pots of philodendrons,
various varieties of ferns, Mandevilla 'Alice du Pont,' salvia and
cymbidium orchids are clustered in groups around the fountain and
along the other balconies.</TE>
<TE>   Sanserino has gardened most of her life, as a girl growing up in
Florida and while living in a Victorian house in Idaho. When she and
her husband moved into their condo three years ago, she designed her
balcony garden with the goal of attracting birds.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she became fascinated with butterflies and has
designated the two bedroom balconies as butterfly gardens, with pots
of parsley, salvia and geraniums included as host plants for
butterfly larvae. Although geranium leaves look a little ragged while
scores of caterpillars chew their leaves, she doesn't begrudge the
sulphur larvae their meals. "The garden can look a little worm-eaten,
but you must give butterflies host plants where they can lay their
eggs."</TE>
<TE>   Butterflies also need a safe, sunny location where they can bask.
Even before Sanserino provided host plants, she saw many butterflies
cling to the gray stucco walls absorbing warmth and sunlight. Her
home is along the migration route for monarch butterflies, and
multitudes fly through the region. They inspired Sanserino to
encourage other species, including sulphur, gulf fritillary, skippers
and swallowtails to become regular visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The range of winged species that visit has been a delightful
payoff for the time she has invested.</TE>
<TE>   When Sanserino is relaxing on her living room balcony, she keeps a
bird field guide nearby so she can identify her avian visitors. In
addition to the plentiful hummingbirds, finches and sparrows, she's
spotted Townsend warblers, yellow-rumped warblers, Wilson warblers,
black-throated gray warblers, phoebes, Savannah sparrows and cedar
waxwings.</TE>
<TE>   She was thrilled when she identified a rose-breasted grosbeak, a
rare visitor to the San Diego area. "It was totally out of the
ordinary," she recalls. And right in her own backyard--er, balcony.</TE>

<HD>The 'Why?' Behind American Executions</HD>
<DH>THE LAST FACE YOU'LL EVER SEE: The Private Life of the
American Death Penalty By Ivan Solotaroff; HarperCollins; 256 pages;
$25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARMELA CIURARU</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1923, an Irishman named Charles Duff published a savagely ironic
polemic against capital punishment, "A Handbook on Hanging," in which
he noted that "killing is killing, and constant familiarity with it
breeds contempt or an immunity of feeling for killing."</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, journalist Ivan Solotaroff began work on a book about the
death penalty. He focused his efforts on the so-called Death Belt, a
900-mile stretch from Florida to Texas where most executions are
performed in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Duff, Solotaroff was not interested in probing the morality
of the issue or in making a case for or against it. Instead, he
simply wished to understand why we do it. "I wanted to know who
carried out executions, where, when, and how, and what it had been
like for them to do it," Solotaroff writes. Polls show that a
majority of Americans support capital punishment--but does the death
penalty satisfy our desire for justice or simply for revenge?</LD>
<TE>   After spending five years among executioners and prisoners on
death row, the author found that the answer was far more complex than
he expected.</TE>
<TE>   The author of the nonfiction collection about lost souls, "No
Success Like Failure," in his latest work Solotaroff studies failure
within the American penal system: by states to deter violent crimes
through the death penalty and by executioners to be at peace with
their vocation. The scenes that depict a longing for redemption by
executioners and prisoners alike offer some of the book's most
heartbreaking moments, and he recounts a chilling quote from
Sophocles: "Who is the victim? Who is the slayer? Speak!"</TE>
<TE>   It's reasonable to expect that a book about executions would stir
feelings of revulsion, fear, anger and disbelief, and this one does
not disappoint. Solotaroff's graphic, lengthy depictions of the gas
chamber are nightmare-inducing.</TE>
<TE>   The book takes its title from a quote by a crass New Orleans
prosecutor named Jim Williams, one of many outsized characters
encountered by Solotaroff. Williams' office features morbid
execution-themed cartoons and gag gifts of large syringes. Williams
tells Solotaroff, "If I get you condemned, it's personal....I want to
be the last face you'll ever see." Williams' colleague, a man named
Ronnie Boddenheimer, gleefully tells the author that sometimes during
pretrial hearings, he enjoys sidling up next to defendants, leaning
over and exclaiming: "Bzzzzzzz!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Despite having been convicted of sickening crimes, some of the
convicts interviewed by the author come across as gentle, intelligent
and perhaps even innocent. These sympathetic traits are not lost on
executioners, who often suffer deep ambivalence over having to put
inmates to death. Donald Hocutt, the state executioner of
Mississippi, struggles to articulate the sensation he experiences at
the penitentiary after 20 years of service: "I could say it's like a
noise," he says. "Like a radio stuck in between stations. But it's
really more of a feeling, like I was living under power lines or
something. It's not pleasant."</TE>
<TE>   Hocutt is unwilling to concede that his litany of health
problems--insomnia, gout, depression among them--were caused by his
line of work, which include preparing cyanide solutions and engaging
in "death rehearsals" with his colleagues to test the equipment just
before a sentence is carried out. There are, of course, those who
don't feel conflicted by what they do, such as the warden of the
Louisiana State Prison at Angola, who blithely says: "I prefer a
simple hanging, on a tree or a gallows right in the middle of town,
at high noon."</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Face You'll Ever See" reveals many facets of capital
punishment, from the reason executioners choose the job (the money
can be quite good, and they believe they are performing a public
service) to the moment-by-moment devastation the body suffers when it
is put to death. (Contrary to what most people think, death by legal
injection is in no way just like being put to sleep.) Death row, it
turns out, even has a media day in which reporters are given tours
and fact sheets, "similar to the handouts in sports-event press
rooms."</TE>
<TE>   Solotaroff's writing is vivid and his tone compassionate
throughout. A self-described "agnostic" on the death penalty, he
succeeds in giving us a better idea of why we support or oppose
capital punishment--perhaps more than we wished to know, since
ignorance is far less troubling.</TE>

<HD>President Finds a Voice, or Two</HD>
<DH>Bush proves himself bilingual, speaking the languages of
both statesman and cowboy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both professional Bush bashers and rock-ribbed supporters of
America's 43rd president got some new ammunition  last weekend. On
Saturday, during a brief California stopover, George W. Bush told an
approving crowd that congressional Democrats would be allowed to
raise taxes "over my dead body," a phrase that echoed the bellicose
tone of Bush's wartime rhetoric since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   To his admirers, the tough-worded trope gave further proof that a
politician once derided as a lightweight was no longer pulling his
punches. To his critics, the phrase had the smart-alecky ring of a
schoolyard taunt--in poor taste, at best; divisive and insensitive,
at worst. On both sides of the political fence, some also predicted
that Bush's pledge might come back to bite him in 2004, just as his
father's (in)famous vow of "Read my lips: No new taxes," helped sink
his own 1992 reelection bid.</LD>
<LD>   Has the "war on terrorism" helped Bush finally find his voice and
a commanding public persona, as many supporters contend? Or was the
president's boast another example of what some see as his tendency to
revert to an over-the-top, tough-guy shtick reminiscent of a
pulp-fiction private eye?</LD>
<TE>   What Bush may have been seeking to do with his "dead body"
metaphor was extend the idea of an urgent need for national unity
from the foreign policy realm to the domestic front. The president's
remarks apparently were aimed at Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.), who had criticized Bush's tax cut. The president
characterized this criticism from Democrats as akin to a call for a
tax increase. "I challenge their economics, when they say raising
taxes will help the country recover," Bush said. "Not over my dead
body will they raise your taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, however, the president's metaphorical cadaver was
slightly misplaced. The correct expression, of course, is "over my
dead body," minus the "not," signifying a determination to lay down
one's life rather than let something unspeakably awful occur. Untold
generations of parents have used it to indicate displeasure over
their teenage children's Saturday night dating plans. ("When hell
freezes over" is an acceptable substitute in these situations.)</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Newman, president of a New York City firm that specializes
in public speaker training, said that for some time Bush has
flip-flopped between two very different styles of expression. The
first was displayed in his Sept. 20 speech before Congress, in which
a statesmanlike Bush magisterially and poetically proclaimed that
America would "define our times, not be defined by them," and vowed
to bring justice to those who had "hijacked Islam itself" and were
going to wind up in "history's unmarked grave of discarded lies."</TE>
<TE>   On that occasion, Newman said, the president was "was elegant and
eloquent." She praised "the language of the speech--it was so
well-written--his pacing, his pausing, his tone, his ability to use
the prompter so that everybody felt he was talking to them."</TE>
<TE>   "He really rose to the occasion at a time when the country needed
him to do that," she said. "And I didn't even vote for him."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Newman continued, Bush's "dead body" remark was a
rhetorical misfire.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think about where the country is today, 'over my dead
body' is not a phrase we need to hear, given that we have a country
that is littered with dead bodies. It's just a very startling and
negative image. On the other hand, he certainly let us know where he
stands, and Bush is not beating around the bush when he comes out and
says something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Newman said that Bush still is trying to figure out the image he
wants to project. "Does he want to be this testosterone-based cowboy
who says, 'Not over my dead body,' which was not the same caliber or
eloquence of the [Sept. 20] speech?"</TE>
<TE>   But with America still reeling psychologically and awash in
patriotic sentiment, it may not matter much which style Bush adopts,
said Robert Hariman, a professor in the department of rhetoric and
communication studies at Drake University in Des Moines and author of
"Political Style: The Artistry of Power." In the aftershocks of the
terrorist attacks, Bush's public remarks have been virtually
off-limits to criticism, Hariman maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "The bar is so low after Sept. 11," he said, "there's virtually
nothing he could do that would provoke a serious reassessment or a
drop in the public approval rating he's getting. The media is asking
such softball questions."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Hariman said, in the weeks since the attacks, the
mass media have taken on the role of stirring up nationalistic
feeling and boosting morale, providing a rhetorical context for the
nation's elevated emotions. As an example, he pointed to a halftime
show of patriotic imagery that ran during a recent broadcast of ABC's
"Monday Night Football."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what was a traditional function of presidential rhetoric
isn't done through presidential speaking. It's done thorough
sophisticated use of visual media," Hariman said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's phrase has a long rhetorical pedigree. Examples have been
cited in Homer, and Rex Stout used the expression to title a 1939
novel starring his crime-solving hero Nero Wolfe. In the late 15th
century, the Welsh feudal lord Sir Rhys ap Thomas, later a favorite
of Henry VIII, bragged that a rival ruler would land in Wales only
"over my bellie," which somehow doesn't sound quite as impressive as
"body." And Milton Berle starred as a bungling amateur sleuth in the
1942 comedy "Over My Dead Body."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Medhurst, a professor of speech communication at Texas A&amp;M
University, said he thinks Bush's figure of speech probably was
deliberate and well thought-out, "given the family background" and
what Bush the elder's similar comment cost him.</TE>
<TE>   Medhurst agrees that the president has two distinct styles, one
for informal occasions, the other for formal speeches, which are
frequently scripted by Michael Gerson, his chief speechwriter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a perfect match," Medhurst said. "It never is. But in an
interesting sort of way, I believe that Gerson has challenged George
Bush to come up to his rhetorical standards and he has, given a
script that has some lofty ideas in it and some imagery."</TE>
<TE>   As for the president's latest memorable locution, Medhurst said it
reminded him of Bush's vow to get Osama bin Laden "dead or alive."</TE>
<TE>   "It basically displays character. He's trying to tell people what
kind of person he is," Medhurst said. "There's a certain kind of
bravado in that. It certainly plays well in Texas."</TE>

<LD>America is made up of many different cultures and communities, each
with their own traditions of helping others and giving in time of
need. As a nation, we have pulled together in various ways to help
our fellow citizens recover and heal from the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   What are some of the ways you have tried to help people? Make a
list of all of the acts of kindness you have done over the last few
months. Consider writing a New Year's resolution to do something
helpful for someone during 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Like others in America, the Jewish community has its own way of
expressing kindness and charity. It is called tzedakah (derived from
the Hebrew tzedak, meaning "justice") and is translated as "charity"
or "giving. " It has been a tradition of Jewish life for more than
4,000 years. It can include personal gifts, donations and other
expressions of love and kindness. Many Jewish families have a
tzedakah box at home that they fill with coins. When it is full, the
money is donated to a charity.</LD>
<TE>   Another Jewish tradition called tikkun olam means "repair the
world" and can be achieved many ways. These include welcoming the
stranger, being kind to the earth, giving to the needy and comforting
the sad.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about tzedakah, tikkun olam and see some
tzedakah boxes at the Skirball Cultural Center. This Sunday at 1
p.m., Skirball invites you to stamp your feet and sing along with the
Shirettes as part of its Kids B'Yachad (Kids Together) benefit
concert. All proceeds from the concert will go to the Jewish
Federation of Greater Washington's New York/Washington terror attacks
victims relief fund and will be used to help all families of the
tragedy. For more information, call (310) 440-4636 or visit

<HD>Having a Good Laugh</HD>
<DH>People are getting together to yuk it up, and for no better
reason than it feels great.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AJAY SINGH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dozen men and women, many strangers to one another, are gathered
on a patch of grass in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, looking a
bit nervous about what they might have gotten themselves into. They
are standing in a loosely formed circle when Kim Corbin, dressed in
bluejeans and a T-shirt that says "Think Globally, Laugh Locally,"
asks them to hold hands.</LD>
<LD>   She raises a silvery wand like an orchestra conductor: "Ho, ho,
ha-ha-ha!" she bellows. "Ho, ho, ha-ha-ha!"</LD>
<LD>   The group gets the idea. "Ho, ho, ha-ha-ha, ho, ho, ha-ha-ha,"
they say, knowing how silly they look--but gradually realizing being
silly doesn't really hurt. What begins as a stifled effort at jollity
soon dissolves into spontaneous giggling. Then, it's out and out
laughter, prancing-around-in-the-grass kind of laughing. Laughter
that makes you feel good even when you don't have a good reason.</LD>
<TE>   Corbin, 32, is a "certified laughter leader"--neither comedian nor
humorist but a specialist in pure laughter. And she's just getting
started with this group. On her command, the members pounce at each
other, grunting loudly, wagging their tongues and pawing the air with
imaginary claws.</TE>
<TE>   This, explains Corbin, is "lion laughter," one of about a dozen
techniques she teaches. Next comes "chicken skip laughter"--everyone
breaks out into titters, moving their upper arms sideways, like birds
flapping wings. There's also "silent laughter"--mouths open wide with
chuckles, but no sound is produced.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Corbin, nobody in the group has ever laughed this way
before.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great to be connected with everyone," gushes Misha
Knowles, a 21-year-old professional skater. Says Barry Marcus, 46, a
network administrator, "I'm a laugh-oriented person but I have to say
I've never laughed so hard before."</TE>
<TE>   To an outsider, the first impression suggests that this is some
kind of crazy congregation: laughing for no evident reason other than
perhaps the fact that after days of depressing, rainy weather, San
Francisco has been blessed with an unusually sunny Sunday afternoon.
"Very San Francisco," says a passerby on hearing the exaggerated
laughter. "Only in San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco may be one of the easiest cities in which to hang
loose, but it isn't the only place where people meet for no reason
other than to laugh their heads off. Across much of the United
States, Americans are participating in a curious new phenomenon--some
call it a movement--dedicated to laughing for happier, healthier and
fuller lives. Many of them meet in public parks or in apartments to
giggle, guffaw, chuckle, chortle, screech or titter--anything to
surrender to uninhibited laughter.</TE>
<TE>   They're by no means the first to do so. Decades ago, author Norman
Cousins launched something of a nationwide movement focused on the
healing art of laughter when he evidently cured himself of a
degenerative spinal disease by taking huge doses of vitamin C and
watching Marx Brothers comedies. "I made the joyous discovery," wrote
Cousins in "Anatomy of an Illness," the 1979 book about his dramatic
recovery, "that 10 minutes of genuine belly laughter had a salutary
effect on the body's chemistry." Cousins famously called laughter
"inner jogging," equating the primal emotion with physical exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The current laughter trend differs from Cousins' in one
significant sense: It doesn't at all rely on what psychologists call
"cognitive events," such as comedies, humor or jokes.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean it isn't therapeutic. "We can lower stress
hormones in the body through mirthful laughter regardless of how we
do it," says Lee Berk, a professor of complementary medicine at UC
Irvine and an authority on laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The man behind America's guffawing craze is Steve Wilson, 61, a
cherubic psychologist from Columbus, Ohio, who, in turn, was inspired
by Madan Kataria, 46, a physician far away in Bombay, India. The
"guru of giggling," as Kataria is called, has earned international
renown for forming or helping launch some 1,000 "laughter clubs" in
India and another 150 or so in Europe, Australia, the far East and
lately, the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He came up with the idea of laughter clubs in 1995 after years of
observing that his patients' immune systems improved dramatically
following bouts of laughter, even the forced kind. Kataria initially
enlisted friends to crack jokes every morning at the first club he
launched in a Bombay public park. But the group soon ran out of
material. The doctor then developed a technique of "thought-free"
group laughter based on yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Kataria's hee-haw phenomenon is the subject of a recent
documentary film, "The Laughing Club of India," directed by
Indian-born filmmaker Mira Nair, whose other credits include "Salaam
Bombay" and "Monsoon Wedding," to be released next month. The
"Laughing Club of India" profiles Kataria and several members of his
Bombay club, notably the matriarch of a 38-member family and two
retired men with a penchant for silent laughter. The documentary
begins with a group of workers standing silently in a circle in a
Bombay electronics factory. At the count of three, everybody takes a
deep breath, raises their arms, and explodes into seemingly senseless
laughter. "At first you feel sort of foolish and then you get carried
away by the rhythm of it," says Nair, who herself succumbed to
Bombay's laughter contagion while directing her film.</TE>
<TE>   Nair, a resident of New York City, made the 35-minute documentary
following a trip to Bombay in January 1999. She was stuck in a nasty
traffic jam one morning in the polluted metropolis and was really
fuming when she spotted some 2,000 women marching and laughing on the
road. "My anger melted away. It was like being in a Fellini movie,"
she says. It was "World Laughter Day," first celebrated one year
earlier. It was celebrated for the first time in the U.S. last
spring.  The event's backers now plan it as an annual event to be
observed on the first Sunday in May--the 5th of the month this year.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson found Bombay's laughter phenomenon equally fascinating.
When he met Kataria in the city in 1998, the doctor urged him to
spread the message of laughter in America. The Iowan jumped at the
opportunity, delighted by the idea of unadulterated, interactive
laughter. "There are a lot of people who have an innate sense that
laughter is a good thing," he says. "But they don't necessarily want
to turn on the TV and see a comedian."</TE>
<TE>   So in the summer of 1998, Wilson co-founded the World Laughter
Tour, www.worldlaughtertour .com, an umbrella group for laughter
clubs in North America. Two years later, he began coaching laughter
leaders in two-day weekend workshops held monthly in Columbus, Ohio.
The seminars, costing $289 per student, cover everything from
laughter techniques to overcoming the fear of appearing silly while
laughing--a key lesson.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Wilson has certified 225 laughter leaders, ages 16 to 84,
from the U.S. and Canada. He estimates that about two-thirds of them
are at work leading as many as 150 weekly laughter sessions in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   Participants are usually recruited through Internet postings and
by word of mouth. A typical organized laughing session lasts 20 to 30
minutes, beginning with a light warmup and some deep breathing yoga
exercises. Thereafter, participants indulge in a variety of laughter
techniques such as "elephant laughter" (hold one arm above the head
as if it were a pachyderm's trunk and grunt like an elephant
trumpeting) and "monkey laughter" (place feet wide apart, bend
forward and laugh while scratching the underarms). Wilson's
messengers of mirth constantly come up with hilarious new forms of
laughter. Examples include the "Pillsbury Dough Boy laugh" (mutual
poking of stomachs as if testing bread dough) and the "mad scientist
laugh."</TE>
<TE>   At the Golden Gate Park gathering last month, one participant
introduced the "Austin Powers laugh"--incorporating the trademark
snicker of the character's nemesis, Dr. Evil, with pinkie placed
alongside the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in India, where people mostly laugh to keep in good health,
Americans primarily focus on what New Yorker Dana Flynn calls the
"direct experience of laughter."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, 39, is a yoga instructor who leads the "Laughing Lotus"
club once a week on an apartment rooftop in Greenwich Village. It's
an occasion dedicated to 20 minutes of guffawing. But for Flynn, it's
the "sound of the soul waking up--it connects us to those parts of
ourselves we're separated with."</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody wants to laugh for enlightenment, though. Take
Debbie Smith, 48, a resident of Darlington, Ind., who's planning to
sign up for Wilson's workshop this year. Besides working for
Ameritech, Smith owns a bed-and-breakfast, a riding stable and a
horse-carriage company. "When you live on a farm and think you're the
only one who steps in doo, it can be depressing," she says. "You just
have to be able to laugh or you'd sit down and cry and nobody would
care."</TE>
<TE>   Smith is also campaigning for laughter therapy to be introduced in
the National Guard, where her husband, Jim, works. "It's a stressful
time for military families right now," she says. "Laughter is a good
way to look at the world through a different angle."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some authorities on mirth believe that humans may be the
only ones on the planet capable of laughter--and that there's no such
thing as a humorless person. Everybody can crack up, whether in a
club or in the quiet of a bedroom, turning laughter into a joyful
form of meditation.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a way of life," says Wilson, whose experience has
been so rewarding that he no longer practices psychotherapy. In the
summer of 2000, he closed his clinic, ending his 40-year career as a
psychologist. "I decided the world didn't need a full-time
psychologist," he laughs. "What it needs is a full-time
'joyologist.'"</TE>

<HD>The Past at Play</HD>
<DH>A display of international  toys shows the importance  of
preserving the handcrafted tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where have all the handcrafted toys gone? Nancy Romero, curator of
the "Toy Mechanics" exhibition at the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art
Museum, warns that toys lovingly crafted everywhere in the world
throughout the centuries are in danger of disappearing as people rely
more and more on mass-produced playthings.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody knows how to make toys anymore," Romero says. "They buy
something ready-made, and they assume it's going to work, and it
does. They don't question how or why it works. People need to know
how to make toys again; it used to be a family craft--you found
something lying around, like paper or string, and made a toy out of
it. Or you whittled a piece of wood. We're losing that creative
ability."</LD>
<LD>   "Toy Mechanics" elucidates the tradition of handcrafting through
220 international toys--antique and modern--categorizing them by
whether they amuse by moving, making noise or other special
attributes. "Toys are universal. In fact, the same toys can be found
in every single country, like wooden pecking chickens or balls,"
Romero continues. "Each has a different ethnic slant, but they're
basically all the same toy."</LD>
<TE>   Toys have probably been around as long as humans have been
civilized. The earliest known moving toy dates from Egypt, circa 1000
BC. Ancient Greeks and Romans had toy chariots and jointed dolls. Two
of the oldest toys in the show are a pull-toy dog and centaur from
18th century Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who's ever laughed at a jack-in-the-box or a dancing
marionette, or marveled at the beauty of an airborne dragon kite
knows the pleasure of movable toys. The toys here were made to be
spun, pulled, pushed, cranked, dropped and squeezed. A video shows a
brightly painted jazz quintet from Brazil included in the show
playing drums and strings, an American palomino rearing up smiling,
and a French 19th century bulldog growling.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the toys sit inert in their display cases, the musical
video shows how the toys move. Examples of similar toys that visitors
can try for themselves also are on hand. Visitors can pick up simple
instructions on how to craft each type of toy at home.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning toys in a variety of sizes, colors and materials open the
exhibition. "See this top made from a piece of cane and an acorn?
It's so simple, but so elegant in design," says Romero about a
rudimentary Mexican toy.</TE>
<TE>   She explains that the earliest tops were found in ancient Egypt,
Rome and China. They all revolve on a point, which can hold weight
that's equally distributed and kept in balance by motion.</TE>
<TE>   Along one entrance wall are colorful wheeled toys from Africa,
South America, Japan and Mexico, some of them quite humorous, such as
the African lion nipping at the heels of a fleeing man wearing a
bottle-cap hat. "These toys use gears, and you can load as many
movements onto them as you want," says Romero. "There's an entire
wooden Mexican rodeo with everything moving that's based on simple
gears."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most spectacular objects are the windup toys, which
include whirligigs, sailboats, balloons and kites, which originated
in Asia. On the wall is a surprising picture of a boy with a
helicopter-type toy that was made in about 1584.The puppets, too, are
fascinating, with their expressive faces and fluid movements. An
especially unusual kind is the Vietnamese water puppet. "These are
20th century papier-mache toys of the actual puppets," explains
Romero. "The real puppets are much larger, with the puppeteers
standing in the chest-deep water with all the mechanisms under water.
The puppets then move, float and splash." Hinged toys are designed on
the same principles--using flexible joints--as human bodies. The
simplest toys in the exhibition use string to link joints, while the
more complicated ones use a tongue-and-groove method. Look for
whimsical, colorful little snakes.</TE>
<TE>   Noisemaker toys originally were made to make people laugh and also
to scare off evil spirits. Rattles, whistles and other noisemakers
were crafted to transport Australian aborigines into dreamland. "It's
through toys like horns, drums, flutes and rattles that the young
were introduced to music," says Romero.</TE>
<TE>   Romero devoted one section to the toys of Francisco Hipolito
(1935-1988). Paralyzed from the waist down from age 17, he sat on his
porch in the Mexican village of La Cienega and crafted wooden toys
that could be pulled, pushed or cranked, like the small Ferris wheel.
"I loved the tender quality of his toys, so I featured him here,"
says Romero.</TE>
<TE>   "The toys are microcosms of what the people making them believe
in. So, for example, if you show five different tops or pull toys
from around the world, you see both the commonality and the
diversity," says Patrick Ela, chairman of the museum's board of
trustees.</TE>
<TE>   "Toy Mechanics" continues at the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art
Museum, 5814 Wilshire Blvd., through Jan. 27. A  workshop on how to
make climbing toys will be held Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m. For more
information, call (323) 937-4230.</TE>

<HD>'Can't' Is the Worst Word Ever</HD>
<DH>Part 4: The story so far: Mrs. Carter has suggested that
Emily interview Jenna next, a girl who has set a school record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHERIE TROPED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next day I went to Ms. Carter's office, and Jenna was there. She
was in a wheelchair.</LD>
<LD>   "Emily," Ms. Carter said, "meet Jenna--the No. 1 reader in our
school!"</LD>
<LD>   "Jenna, remind me, how many books have you read?" Ms. Carter asked
her.</LD>
<TE>   "This year?" asked Jenna. "Around 300."</TE>
<TE>   "Three hundred books! And I thought I read a lot!"</TE>
<TE>   "You do read a lot," Ms. Carter said, "but Jenna managed to read
every single book in our school library!"</TE>
<TE>   "Every book? Even the boys' books?"</TE>
<TE>   "Every book!"</TE>
<TE>   I was really impressed. I love to read, but I don't like reading
boys books about worms and monsters and yucky stuff.</TE>
<TE>   But then I said something so stupid that I still can't believe I
said it. I actually asked Jenna if she reads so many books because
she is in a wheelchair!</TE>
<TE>   OHMIGOSH! The minute the words left my mouth I wanted to call them
back.</TE>
<TE>   Right away I told her I was so sorry. I didn't mean the way it
sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Then I told her that my heart doesn't work too well, and I have to
rest a lot, too.</TE>
<TE>   Jenna tried to make me feel better. "It's OK! I don't mind.
Honest. Emily, I am what I am. And what I am is a person who has
wheels on her chair."</TE>
<TE>   I think Ms. Carter wanted me to learn a valuable lesson. She said
that a story about someone like Jenna who isn't an athlete is as
important as writing about kids who run and jump. She said other
things are important like quiet things, music and art and books.
"Running and dancing and sports aren't everything, Emily," she told
me.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to tell her that to me they are everything. I really wish
I could do those things. But to be honest, I guess, I really can't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Emily makes a discovery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped says she started writing the very same way Emily
did. And she doesn't like the word "can't" either! This story will be
on The Times' Web site at www.latimes. com/kids.</TE>

documenting celebrities and historic events, publishing books of her
work and winning prestigious awards. "Eve Arnold: In Retrospect,"
opening Friday at Apex Fine Art, surveys highlights of her career,
including a portrait of Malcolm X, a shot of a young woman at a Cuban
bar and an image of Marilyn Monroe rehearsing in "The Misfits."</LD>

<TE>   "David's Mother," first seen in 1992, is about a mother, her
autistic teenage son and how his care becomes her all-consuming
passion and cross to bear. Bob Randall's play is not a sentimental
ode to motherly love; there is a price to be paid as Sally, the mom,
uses caustic humor to shut out the rest of the world, leaving herself
and David in an unhealthy state of isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "David's Mother," Rude Guerrilla Theater Company's Empire Theater,
200 N. Broadway, Santa Ana. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30

<TE>   With the future of the Dance Kaleidoscope series uncertain, all
honor is due to dedicated co-producers Deborah Lawlor and Benita Bike
for offering emerging local contemporary choreographers an
opportunity to test their work through the Fountain Theatre's
Choreographers Showcase, a veritable cornucopia of
made-in-the-Southland discoveries. In this sixth annual festival of
solos and duets, the participating dance-makers include Moonea Choi,
Christine Chrest, Maria Gillespie, Erin Hirsh and Dani Lunn, Kiha
Lee, Carol McDowell, Don McLeod, Paula Present, Susan Shaberman,

Burgess, has lived here for four years, and the group's new album,
"Wonderland," was largely recorded here. The record also contains
some work in the group's hometown of Manchester, England, and it adds
up to a resounding recovery from the ever-promising outfit's
snakebitten history.</TE>

<TE>   Nam June Paik is internationally renowned for making art from
stacks of television sets--essentially painting great big collages of
images that flicker on the tubes. Paik left his trademark video work
behind in 1996, when he was disabled by a stroke, but he didn't stop
making art. An exhibition that opens Friday at the Korean Cultural
Center reveals that Paik now works with relatively conventional paint
and brushes but still has a distinctive view of the world around him,
not to mention a keen sense of humor.</TE>

<LD>Actor Martin Mull is a member of a rare breed of show business
personalities who have developed second careers as visual
artists--and won critical acclaim for their efforts. His latest
exhibition, at Patricia Faure Gallery, features a new group of
collage-like paintings that recall memories of his childhood in the
Midwest with a twist of wry humor and angst. In strange combinations
of images from children's books, Bibles and bucolic landscapes, Mull
suggests that you never know what you'll discover on a walk through
the heartland.</LD>

Lancelot in "Camelot" opposite Richard Burton's King Arthur and Julie
Andrews' Queen Guinevere. Goulet's big love ballad was "If Ever I

multifaceted career in films, television, touring musicals and 75
album releases. At 68, the native of Lawrence, Mass., also plies the
lecture circuit as an advocate for early screening for prostate
cancer. He had surgery for the disease in 1993. His concert, "Robert

<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   "Fool for Love," first seen in 1983, is one of Sam Shepard's most
frequently produced plays. It certainly is getting its due in Orange
County, where the Hunger Artists opened 2001 with a taut and
explosive production; now the Vanguard Theatre Ensemble is having a
go at it to start 2002. Like Shepard's "True West," it concerns a
combustible pair who duke it out against a desert backdrop, with a
haunting father figure--only talked about in "True West" but a
ghostly onstage presence in "Fool for Love"--to drive the conflict.
Eddie, a drifting cowboy, and May, his on-again-off-again lover,
convene in a dingy motel room like two thunderclouds clashing.
Shepard himself played Eddie opposite Kim Basinger's May in the 1985
film version directed by Robert Altman.</TE>
<TE>   "Fool for Love," Vanguard Theatre Ensemble, 699A State College
Blvd., Fullerton. Preview tonight, regular performances begin Friday.

<TE>   Don't look for a feel-good evening of theater when Neil Labute is
the playwright. As the screenwriter and director of the films "In the
Company of Men" and "Your Friends and Neighbors," Labute relentlessly
has held up a mirror to some damaged and damaging behavior. More of
the same is in the offing in his 1999-vintage play, "Bash," subtitled
"Latterday Plays" in reference to Labute's Mormon faith and the
milieu of the piece. The evening consists of three one-act plays
dominated by monologues. Hunger Artists bills "Bash" as "a voyage
through a nightmare landscape inhabited by commonplace people capable
of nearly unspeakable acts."</TE>
<TE>   "Bash," Hunger Artists Theatre Company, 204 E. 4th St., Suite I,
Santa Ana. Preview tonight, regular performances begin Friday.

<TE>   Art Party: Never mind that the current exhibition at the Studio
Channel Islands Art Center is your standard hodgepodge affair. Try to
ignore the mess and the fact that it's a gathering of art with no
great interest in expressing any particular ideas or artistic
directions. Consider it a holiday party, and a deserved
self-administered toast to the gallery itself. Welcome to "Momentum,"
the second annual juried members show in one of Ventura County's most
inspiring spaces to view art. The center's growth over the last few
years has been impressive.</TE>
<TE>   This gallery and studio complex grew out of a vacuum, in a wing of
the decommissioned Camarillo State Hospital. As a result, the
property, soon to open as the new California State University Channel
Islands campus, has had at least one corner of its empty space put to
fine use. The current selection of art, fittingly, was curated by
Jack Reilly, who will be heading the art department at the new CSUCI.
Art spilleth over here, in the main gallery in front as well as the
more recently opened adjacent gallery and the hallway leading back to
artists' studios. Julia Pinkham's eye-tickling painting "Fairytale"
has a sly title, open to interpretation. It's partly abstract, in the
Gorky-esque sense, and partly candied up with a vivid palette that
might put us in mind of a hallucinatory wonderland. In other
heightened color news, the color orange virtually engulfs us--in a
warm, radiant way--in Susan Clark's "Toscana."</TE>
<TE>   There are some pieces of topical and local interest. With
"Afghanistan 2001," Carlisle Cooper shows one of his signature,
optically charged and layered portraits, this one of an Afghan
soldier against a mosaic of fire. Cindy Medlyn's "Chumash Mysteries,"
a miniature painted cave scene with pictographs, is a tableau
described as a sculptural landscape, but it also has an archeological
alter ego.</TE>
<TE>   Roxie Ray continues to create empathetic portraits of local farm
workers, of which the brightly colored "Strawberry Picker" is a good
example.</TE>
<TE>   Art about art-making is behind the cleareyed painting "Young
Artists With an Unfinished Painting," by Ventura College art teacher
Hiroko Yoshimoto.</TE>
<TE>   For pure evocative powers, in a tiny package, there may be nothing
so moving in this show as Elisse Pogofsky-Harris' monotypes. Smaller
than postcards, suggesting landscapes without explicitly describing
them, these small wonders lurk gracefully in the periphery of a busy
show.</TE>
<TE>   * "Momentum," Studio Channel Islands Art Center, Cal State Channel
Islands, Camarillo. Ends Jan. 19. Gallery hours: Thursdays to
Saturdays, noon to 3 p.m. (805) 383-1368.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Comings and Goings: One of the shows in the planning stages at
Studio Channel Islands Art Center is a tribute to Art City II. This
art gallery and center, long a fixture in town, is losing its present
space, with a last hurrah of a show up through January. With this
change, assuming that it doesn't immediately move to another space,
Ventura's art scene will have lost an important venue.</TE>
<TE>   This Saturday night, there will be a send-off of sorts, involving
figures who have been part of the Art City story for years. Jeff
Kaiser, on trumpet and electronics, will lead an improvisational
group that includes Los Angeles-based musicians Scott Ray, on
trombone and electronics, G.E. Stinson on guitar and electronics, and
Steuart Liebig on bass guitar and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Note the prevalence of electronics on the list: It's an event with
both plugged and unplugged components. Poets Phil Taggart, Jackson
Wheeler, Marsha de la O and David Oliveira will also read.</TE>

<HD>Compassionately Conserving Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So now we know why the White House has spent the better part of a
year fending off congressional efforts to find out who Vice President
Dick Cheney met with for input on his energy task force. Turns out
that the vice president and his staff had at least six meetings with
representatives from Enron--including one with Chairman Kenneth L.
Lay--the last of which occurred just six days before the company
revealed that it had vastly overstated its earnings, signaling the
beginning of the end for the energy giant.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Enron collapse, President Bush has been acting like Lay
was just some good ol' boy who also happened to hail from Texas. This
new information proves otherwise: that Lay and his company's sizable
political contributions had bought what Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los
Angeles) has termed "extensive access" to the epicenter of American
political power. It's Teapot Dome, the Sequel.</LD>
<LD>   During his run for the White House, Bush fought long and hard to
convince us that he was a new breed of conservative--a Compassionate
Conservative. But recent events make clear that he is actually the
standard-bearer of a far more coldhearted breed. Call them the Enron
Conservatives.</LD>
<TE>   Enron Conservatives are people who use political money and
connections as levers to free themselves of all accountability to
laws, regulations and responsibility--even to their own employees.
Simply put, they are people who consistently, shamelessly and
aggressively put their self-interest above the public interest. And
when the lives of others are destroyed in the process, they just look
the other way and hope that the law does too. And, all too often, it
does.</TE>
<TE>   It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to
hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush
violated truth-in-labeling laws during his campaign, when his pledges
of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites. But it
should. Because we've heard precious little of them since Bush took
the oath of office.</TE>
<TE>   "While many of our citizens prosper," the freshly anointed
president said in his inaugural address a year ago, "others doubt the
promise, even the justice, of our own country." And those nagging
doubts are only aggravated by the behavior of Enron executives who
continue to prosper even as thousands watch their jobs--and their
life's savings--disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Bush was so eager to paint himself as a Compassionate
Conservative that he even dared to impugn the moral supremacy of the
free market--blasphemy in the eyes of his party's doctrinaire right
wing.</TE>
<TE>   "The invisible hand works many miracles," said Bush during the
summer of 1999, evoking Adam Smith's famous paean to market forces,
"but it cannot touch the human heart." This simple truth lies at the
core of the need for fair and rational government regulation of
industry. All too often, after all, the human heart is filled not
with goodness but with greed, selfishness and a desire for profit at
any cost.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad Bush left this noble idea on the campaign trail. Since
taking office, the hallmark of his administration has been an
unwavering belief in the free market's invisible hand. In the last
year, the president and his anti-regulatory appointees have (take a
breath): abandoned a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide;
repealed workplace ergonomic rules designed to improve worker safety;
proposed reversing regulations protecting 60 million acres of
national forest from logging and road building; and canceled a
looming deadline for auto makers to develop prototype high-mileage
cars. And that's just a partial list.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the rapacious excesses of the Enron debacle have quelled
the drive for deregulation--or the ardor of Enron Conservatives who
champion the cause. Pat Wood, Lay's handpicked choice to head the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, insists that the collapse of
Enron "doesn't seem to be tied too much to deregulated energy
markets." You know that something is rotten in Washington when the
top energy industry regulator is so unabashedly anti-regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce, is another Enron Conservative who sees the
energy giant's collapse as an aberration, not a smoking gun. He
dismisses Enron's demise as "an in-house problem" and continues
slaving away on a deregulation bill that would make Lay proud.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Lawrence Lindsey, the president's top economic
advisor and a former advisor to Enron, who went so far as to claim
that the Enron disaster "is a tribute to American capitalism." And
Sept. 11 was a tribute to Islamic ingenuity.</TE>
<TE>   Not that long ago, Bush was vowing to battle domestic suffering
with "armies of compassion." Instead, he and his cadre of Enron
Conservatives are adding to the carnage.</TE>

<HD>A Military's Power Isn't in the Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United States "special operations" in Afghanistan have been far from
dramatic. So far, there has been only one classic commando-style raid
and it was nothing more than a straightforward helicopter descent
that encountered no resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there is no doubt that U.S. elite soldiers on the ground have
achieved spectacular results in a new and powerful synergy with air
power. There is a lesson on military spending in this for Europe.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1999 Kosovo war, targets could be bombed precisely almost
every time, but there was nobody on the ground to identify moving
targets for aircraft overhead. As a result, only buildings and
infrastructure could be destroyed, not the Serbian forces terrorizing
Kosovo's Albanians into flight. There were local allies--the loose
bands of the Kosovo Liberation Army--but there were no advisor teams
to channel supplies, to motivate and coordinate and to ensure close
air support.</LD>
<TE>   With or without local allies, the new synergy of elite forces with
air power has become the essential military instrument of today--and
a very economical one. It is myth that only the U.S. can afford the
cost. It is a question of will and priorities rather than of budgets.</TE>
<TE>   That is why little Israel has the new capability on a rather large
scale with a military budget only half that of Italy's and one-third
that of Britain or France, deducting the cost of their nuclear
forces.</TE>
<TE>   By now it is widely understood that precision bombing itself is
not only effective but also relatively cheap: About 6,000 guided
bombs (more than were used in Kosovo or Afghanistan) can be purchased
for the price of three fighters of the Tornado/Rafale class. Giving
up a couple more will pay for all the other components large and
small, from remotely piloted air vehicles for overhead observation to
hand-held laser equipment. And because precision greatly reduces the
need for numbers (one guided bomb replaces dozens of unguided ones),
air forces can be smaller and yet much more powerful.</TE>
<TE>   It is the same for the elite troops needed on the ground. True,
they are costly individually to maintain, yet they are cheap
collectively because the total number required is small. It is not
their mostly prosaic equipment that makes elite units expensive but
their training. Serious training is both expensive and the only true
source of combat capability. It was not supermen the U.S. sent to
Afghanistan but well-trained men.</TE>
<TE>   Even the U.S. Rangers at the bottom of the elite hierarchy receive
six months, not six weeks, of individual instruction in infantry
skills before joining their units. New recruits in the U.S. Special
Forces, the Green Berets--who have done so well in supporting Tajik,
Uzbek, Hazara and Pushtun bands--receive even more training in
everything from field medicine to foreign languages, in addition to
weapons and tactics. The small Delta battalion and its Air Force and
Navy counterparts never stop training at all.</TE>
<TE>   Every helicopter flight hour costs thousands of dollars, and elite
forces use helicopters all the time for their training, along with
much else, from lots of ammunition to the services of language
teachers. But again the total cost is small because elite troops are
so few.</TE>
<TE>   European armies that keep large numbers of soldiers who are unfit
and unprepared for any kind of combat could replace many of them with
elite units at equal cost.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that the lives of officers are less comfortable
when training is for real. It's far easier to pretend that the
training of the line forces is sufficient and to exaggerate the
quality of any elite unit that exists, even if it's only elite by
local standards. Only determined political and military leadership
can overcome bureaucratic resistance to real training, but the reward
is to have real military capabilities, which are needed even for
peacekeeping operations if they are actually to keep the peace.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the U.S. has shown both the power and the economy of
synergistic warfare--the entire Afghan war has cost less than 2% of
the annual defense budget--it will be interesting to see how European
governments react. European leaders have been seeking roles for their
armed forces in the Afghanistan war and its peacekeeping aftermath.
If they had effective forces, it is the Americans who would do the
asking.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Taxing Clintonian Language</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN SCHNUR</AU>
<BD>Dan Schnur was communications director for former Gov.
Pete Wilson and the presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. John McCain.
Last summer, he advised Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis never had sex with that woman. He never inhaled. And he
definitely "will not advocate raising taxes"--at least not until
someone asks him to.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has the misfortune of facing a nasty economic recession and
state budget meltdown just as he is preparing to run for reelection.
So when he delivered his annual State of the State address Tuesday
night, it would have been reasonable to expect California's governor
to lay out a path toward economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   But solving a $12-billion budget deficit is a politically painful
experience, and an election year is definitely not the time for
political pain, especially for an incumbent governor already running
behind in the polls.</LD>
<TE>   There are three ways to solve a budget deficit: cut spending,
raise taxes or run deficits, none of which are particularly pleasing
to voters. Faced with a choice between three unpopular courses of
action to kick off his reelection campaign, Davis chose to ignore
economic and fiscal reality, instead proposing spending increases in
several state government programs. He also promised not to raise
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Or did he? During his address, Davis declared, "The budget I will
submit to you ... will not raise taxes." A few minutes later, for
emphasis, he added, "I will not advocate raising taxes."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, that sounds a lot like a promise. But to a
political community well-schooled in the art of Clintonian linguistic
gymnastics, Davis' statements sounded much less convincing. Upon
further discussion, it appears that Davis has not ruled out signing a
budget that includes a tax increase. He just won't propose one
himself. But if someone else wants to raise taxes? Well, that's a
different story.</TE>
<TE>   State Senate Democratic leader John Burton last week engaged in a
bout of political nostalgia by announcing his support for more than
$9billion in new taxes. Whether Davis will support some or all of
those taxes is anyone's guess. All we know is that he'll let someone
else lead the fight. Maybe he'll follow. Or maybe he won't.</TE>
<TE>   So Davis, an expert politician miscast as a governor, will submit
a campaign pamphlet disguised as a budget proposal today and then
allow others to put together an alternative that will form the
starting point for actual negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Then it will be left to others to make the hard decisions needed
to get California's economic house back in order.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping back from the leadership demands of his office may not
qualify Davis for an additional chapter in "Profiles in Courage." But
he remembers the budget fights of the early 1990s when then-Gov. Pete
Wilson, a Republican, fought with the Legislature to close budget
gaps of $14 billion and $10 billion. He also remembers that both
Wilson and the legislators saw their poll numbers plummet to
subterranean levels. Less than 10 months from election day, Davis is
not eager to experience that sensation for himself.</TE>
<TE>   But even if he is unwilling to lead, it will be impossible for
Davis to avoid getting splashed by the muck from the inevitable
budget brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Republican gubernatorial candidates will be firing at him from the
campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis will be the target of more dangerous
attacks from Burton and other Democratic leaders, who will be
reluctant to provide votes for any budget that doesn't include
significant tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Although all the participants will suffer as the negotiations
progress, Davis' visibility means that he will endure the
overwhelming share of the political pain. The cumulative effect of
months of unflattering news coverage cannot be overestimated. Daily
headlines that talk of tax increases, budget cuts and deficit
spending pack a wallop that no negative advertisement or direct mail
attack can match.</TE>
<TE>   And make no mistake: The news coverage will be very, very ugly.
Because when dealing with budget deficits of this size, the question
is no longer whether to take your poison. Rather, the decision facing
Davis is which poison to take.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, Bill Clinton dissected the English language with
surgical precision. It's a testament to Clinton's considerable skills
that only after he left office could we appreciate his dexterity by
watching other, less talented politicians fail in their attempts to
match his extraordinary verbal feats.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why did a quiet, studious American kid write a suicide note
supporting Osama bin Laden and then fly a Cessna into the Bank of
America building in Tampa? The answers to that question already are
rushing in from both sides of the culture wars, and in the ensuing
blame fest we are likely to lose sight of the most important variable
in the equation: Charles J. Bishop's state of mind.</LD>
<LD>   Conspiracy theories are circulating. The media have reported that
the 15-year-old was of Arab descent on his father's side and that his
surname once was Bishara. This does not mean that Bishop wasn't as
patriotic as his acquaintances say he was or that the sadness he
expressed over the terrorist attacks was insincere. Many questions
about Bishop's solitary life remain unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   The media have focused more on the security loopholes that
Bishop's flight exposed, especially the gaping ones in noncommercial
aviation. But this misses an equally important lesson: Was Bishop
mentally competent?</LD>
<TE>   It seems likely that Bishop's dive-bomb into a skyscraper had more
in common with the Columbine High School massacre and other school
shootings than it did with the Sept. 11 assaults.</TE>
<TE>   The psychological profile that emerged from the personal journals
of Columbine killer Dylan Klebold indicated that the boy was a deeply
depressed and paranoid outcast. Bishop, too, has been described as an
unusually withdrawn, solipsistic loner who "stood apart from the
others at the school bus stop" and enjoyed true friendship only with
his dog.</TE>
<TE>   The earmarks of a disturbed mind are all over these guys. Though
we hesitate with good reason to psychoanalyze them collectively, we
can't go on denying a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Yet we also seem bent on opportunistic partisan explanations. When
the story of John Walker Lindh broke, conservative pundits were quick
to offer predictable explanations for how a sensitive California boy
turned into a Taliban fighter. Marin County was the culprit, they
acidly surmised. What else can you expect from that corrupting
sinkhole of moral relativism, New Age religiosity and liberal
decadence? Yet Lindh's extreme behavior makes far more sense in the
context of mental illness. One look at the video footage of his
capture shows that there was probably a lot more than hunger and
fatigue going on behind those vertiginous eyes.</TE>
<TE>   After Columbine, liberal voices piped up just as loudly with their
policy issue primers on how inadequate gun control had pulled the
trigger as surely as had the two students. Democrats even made it a
campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt someone will fault Bishop's teacher, who, when discussing
Sept. 11, reportedly advised her students not to be too quick to
judge people because of their skin color or religion. But even mushy,
politically correct pedagogy does not a killer make. Mental
instability does, and we ignore it at our peril.</TE>
<TE>   Guidance counselors, teachers and parents need to start paying
more attention and learning to recognize the warning signs of mental
illness in their charges. Our home security may, in part, depend on
it.</TE>

<LD>   Actor Martin Mull is a member of a rare breed of show business
personalities who have developed second careers as visual
artists--and won critical acclaim for their efforts. His latest
exhibition, at Patricia Faure Gallery, features a new group of
collage-like paintings that recall memories of his childhood in the
Midwest with a twist of wry humor and angst. In strange combinations
of images from children's books, Bibles and bucolic landscapes, Mull
suggests that you never know what you'll discover on a walk through
the heartland.</LD>

Angeles, which seized land that it earlier approved as a site for
Washington's long-awaited community dance center.</TE>

<LD>It just doesn't stop.... This week's parties include Tuesday's
grand-opening gala for Highlands, a mondo reminder that the Kolachis
brothers like to do things B-I-G. Looks like this two-level nightclub
with a smashing view might be a hit.... On Wednesday, the crew behind
Sushi Roku and Balboa celebrated the grand opening of its newest
contribution to L.A. night life, Katana, (see story, Page 26) a sweet
Sunset Boulevard restaurant.... Hollywood's new gem, A.D. (see
review, this page), is already flaunting some primo parties: a big
Flaunt magazine bash on Jan. 28 and an E! Entertainment party on Jan.
30. Sweet.</LD>
<LD>   Members of L.A.'s rock scene continue to memorialize Betty
Blowtorch singer Bianca Halstead, who died in a car crash last month.
Her family is throwing a fabulous benefit at Dragonfly in Hollywood
on Tuesday. The show starts at 8 p.m., and a $20 donation will give
you a license to ill with some stellar L.A. talent, including Faster
Pussycat, Texas Terri, Motochrist, the Super Bees and Coyote Shivers.</LD>
<LD>   Also performing: the Pleasure Seekers, whose frontman, Casper, is
the latest star from Hollywood's growing rock scene.</LD>
<TE>   Wow, wish I could a hop a train to Sundance this year because
Monday's William Morris-Diesel Details party sounds like a girl's
best friend. Sponsored by the Diamond Council of America and Rabin
Rogers Events (Cherry promoter Bryan Rabin's new company), the "Docs
&amp; Rocks" bash celebrates the documentary art form with wall-to-wall
denim and diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   The great drag club, Dragstrip 66, is calling all cats to
celebrate its ninth anniversary on Saturday at Rudolpho's in Silver
Lake. At the 9 Lives of Dragstrip 66 party, promoter Paul V. says
he's giving membership cards to anyone in costume, allowing them
reduced admission to future Dragstrip events. Wicked.... My old pal
David Millman tells me you're missing out if you haven't checked out
Welsh singer Judith Owen, who has a Tuesday night residency at the
Joint on Pico Boulevard. Among her devotees are Tracey Ullman, Jeff
Goldblum, Annabeth Gish, Danny DeVito and Jamie Lee Curtis. Sounds
groovy.</TE>

<HD>A.D.: It's a Name to Live Up To</HD>
<DH>The talents behind the Playroom reopen the venue and serve
notice of their intentions.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With A.D., an ambitious Hollywood nightclub on Highland Avenue, we
begin a new era. Its three owners, Art and Allan Davis and Cheryl
Rixon-Davis, set out to create an ultimate clubbing experience we
haven't seen the likes of before. A.D. is sexy and decadent,
cinematic and lavish, a hard-core nightclub for the new millennium.</LD>
<LD>   The Davises weren't content to rest on the laurels of such
successes as the Gate and the Lounge, two major L.A. hot spots. They
wanted to rock, in a big way. Three years ago, they bought the Probe,
which at the time was L.A.'s greasiest nightclub. It was transformed
into a fabulous pop art venue called the Playroom, and along with
such hot club promotions as Cherry and Scream, bands like Buckcherry
and the Cult put it on the map. But when a fire torched the Playroom
a year ago, the Davises decided to take advantage of the situation
and turn things way up. Thus, the birth of A.D., which debuted with a
sold-out Club Cherry in December.</LD>
<TE>   Combining the rich look of Parisian cathedrals, European manors
and hecho en Hollywood fakery, they've aggressively gone after L.A.'s
rock and glamour set to winning effect. A.D. is a labyrinth of sorts,
with hidden nooks, lounges and too many flirting vantage points to
count. The three-level nightclub features dramatic mahogany walls and
open, cathedral-style windows that allow you to peer into various
rooms. A downstairs prison, set up like a dungeon, adds a touch of
camp and provides the backdrop for many out-there performances.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of merging decadent European elements with Hollywood
camp is no accident. While a scene of "Rush Hour 2" was being filmed
at the Gate, the Davises met set designer Eddie Esparza, whom they
enlisted to give A.D. its over-the-top drama. The main room is
flanked by bombed-out pillars. Water walls shield VIPs tucked away in
hidden booths. In addition to the dramatic flair, they added two
smoking patios and a third bar.</TE>
<TE>   In just a few short weeks, the 600-capacity club is already home
to numerous popular dance and rock promotions. Club Cherry's back on
Fridays, and it's a feast for the eyes: Wild rockers and colorful
drag queens mill around in A.D.'s dark Euro-glam settings. It all
works, in a weird way. "Remember when the Who and the Rolling Stones
went out and bought their first English manor homes but had no idea
how to set the table?" asks Cherry promoter Bryan Rabin. "That's A.D.
It's got all this decadence and poshed-up opulence, but then it just
throws it away."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, A.D. is an extension of the Davis' other popular
hang, the Gate. That gothic West Hollywood restaurant has been a
favorite for nearly a decade, and many of its long-term promoters are
building new scenes at A.D.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesdays and Thursdays have dance club nights featuring
successful Gate and Lounge promoters, and Bolthouse promotions, which
already has hot Wednesdays (Las Palmas) and Thursdays (the Lounge)
going, is moving in on Saturdays. With the imminent return of Scream,
which may make its debut with a performance by Marilyn Manson, things
will only get hotter.</TE>

<HD>A Charming French Throwback</HD>
<DH>Traditional Cafe Beaujolais in Eagle Rock has a
neighborhood feel and a menu that mostly could be from a restaurant
30 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cafe Beaujolais is the sort of neighborhood French restaurant every
neighborhood ought to have. It's charming and unpretentious, with a
grapevine pattern stenciled high on its pale yellow walls, and boy,
are the baguettes fresh. It has its very own bakery right up the
street, Beaujolais Boulangerie.</LD>
<LD>   The cafe is very much a neighborhood place. It features live music
some nights, and the musicians aren't names--they're usually local
Eagle Rockers.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, the menu could be from a French restaurant 30
years ago: escargots, onion soup, pork Vallee d'Auge.</LD>
<TE>   The onion soup has a slightly sweet beef broth and a lot of
cheese. The soup of the day will be based on pureed vegetables; one
night it was a subtle veloute flavored with zucchini and mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   As for the escargots, they're tender and flavorful, with plenty of
garlic butter. The tres moderne pate (there's a turkey version as
well as pork) is flavored with parsley--and it's served hot, like
some kind of light, crumbly meatloaf, with baby greens on the side.</TE>
<TE>   The Caesar salad is a middle-of-the-road version, although the
dressing is rather thick with ground Parmesan. The goat cheese salad
is greens garnished with hot, nearly melting goat cheese on baguette
rounds: a real mouth-filler.</TE>
<TE>   The prettiest salad, and the most refreshing, is crab meat with
peeled red and pink grapefruit sections.</TE>
<TE>   Entrees come with a sort of potato gratin, a cake of zucchini
bound with egg, a hash of sweet peppers and half a baked tomato. They
tend to be tasteful and low-key.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Cafe Beaujolais ought to be the ideal restaurant for
people who like to complain about dishes being "drowned" in sauce,
because the quantity of sauce can usually be measured in teaspoons.
With the rack of lamb (four dainty grilled chops), you get a little
pool of meaty brown sauce espagnole. The pork chop Vallee d'Auge
comes in just a bit of apple-scented cream sauce. The supreme de
poulet au basilic is a chicken breast fried brown with mushrooms and
basil wedged under the first joint of a wing. It's served with a
smidgen of Port sauce and some chopped tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   There's no sauce on the steak grille, but it makes a bold display:
It's a round steak pounded until it's as broad as a dinner plate but
only about an eighth of an inch thick. Tender and just medium rare,
though with ostentatious grill marks, it fans out like a giant
butterfly on a plate piled high with French fries and a few bits of
diced tomato.</TE>
<TE>   The most interesting fish I've had was a special of escolar, which
played off its rich flesh with a fennel-scented cream sauce. The
other fish dishes seemed to take this simplicity thing a little too
far. Although the fish was always perfectly cooked, I didn't get much
from the cream sauce on the salmon, and there was scarcely any of the
advertised balsamic vinegar on the pave of rare albacore.</TE>
<TE>   After this, it's surprising to find so much chocolate sauce
swirling around the pear tart, but nobody ever seems to complain
about drowning in chocolate sauce. In fact, the desserts may be the
best part of the meal--a devastating dark chocolate mousse, a lemon
mousse that is really more like a squat cylinder of luscious lemon
curd on a cookie, occasional special pastries from the bakery.</TE>
<TE>   You can also eat up the street at the bakery, although the menu
there is limited to soups, salads, sandwiches and pastries. Apart
from croque-monsieur, they're pretty much like American sandwiches
plus a little basil. Take the turkey breast: It has a sweet, clean
taste abetted by the freshness of the baguette bread.</TE>
<TE>   You might consider two reasons for choosing the bakery over the
cafe: (1) It's open all day. (2) Breads and pastries to go.</TE>

255-5111. Dinner, 5 to 10 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Wine and
beer. Street parking. All major cards. Dinner for two, $36 to $58.</TE>

<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was the time I cut off two-time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon in
traffic.</LD>
<LD>   This was in Beverly Hills, at the intersection of Roxbury Drive
and Santa Monica Boulevard. Lemmon was going south on Roxbury, making
a right onto Santa Monica, and I was heading north, driving through
the intersection--but in a left-turn-only lane.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   I saw this older man yelling at me, but it took me half a block
before I realized: That was two-time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon! Angry,
as if I were a thumb-sucking nuclear power plant manager in "The
China Syndrome" or the upstairs neighbor with the barking dog in "The
Prisoner of Second Avenue."</TE>
<TE>   What can I say? I was thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   Star sightings in Los Angeles are so common for natives that we
use them as conversational shorthand, the way people in cities with
real weather talk about snowstorms or hurricanes or heat waves. In
Los Angeles, we don't say, "They're predicting a foot of snow by the
weekend." We say, "I saw Cameron Diaz having lunch at Joan's on Third
Cafe." Or: "Guess who I cut off in traffic today? Two-time Oscar
winner Jack Lemmon."</TE>
<TE>   But what do we mean? That our lives are empty and that running
into a celebrity gives us meaning (by this reasoning, if Lemmon and I
had gotten out of our respective cars, I would have said, "Mr.
Lemmon, you ... complete ... me").</TE>
<TE>   And yet, this is what makes a good star-sighting such a local
perk: The fact that our lives, by their very nature and rhythm, have
intersected with the life of a celebrity means we are them, in some
small way, because we eat at the same breakfast place and cut each
other off in traffic. Right?</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like a merging of realities," says Matt Maranian,
35, co-author of "L.A. Bizarro," the 1997 guidebook to the "obscure,
the absurd and the perverse in Los Angeles." To Maranian, the power
of a star sighting occurs in that moment when "someone that you never
really considered to be real in the first place" suddenly appears
before you.</TE>
<TE>   I know exactly what he means. For instance, I once looked at a
vacant apartment in West Hollywood with fellow prospective renter
Soleil Moon Frye, a.k.a. Punky Brewster.</TE>
<TE>   Maranian, who is working on a spinoff of his interior design book
"Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living" (Chronicle Books, 2000), lived in
Los Angeles from 1984 to 1999 before decamping to Brattleboro, Vt. He
divides his star-sighting experiences in L.A. into various
categories. They include:</TE>
<TE>   * Spotting Someone Who's in Disguise and Being the Only Person or
One of a Very Few People Who Realizes It. "That happened to me with
Michael Jackson," says Maranian, who saw Jackson in Tower Video on
Sunset Boulevard, in West Hollywood. The pop star was wearing a short
Afro wig and sunglasses. This was at night. There were bodyguards
throughout the store. Jackson bought Disney videos, Maranian says.
There was also the time Maranian was pretty sure he saw Ann-Margret
shopping at a Ross Dress for Less in the San Fernando Valley, wearing
a head scarf and sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   * Bathroom Sightings: Comedian Richard Lewis, "Growing Pains" star
Kirk Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   * When They Talk to You First: Maranian was sitting at an
intersection in his 1967 persimmon orange convertible Barracuda. "I
was in a really horrible mood, and I heard him yell from the car next
to me. "Him" was Tony Danza, admiring Maranian's car. "I've always
liked Tony Danza since then," he says.</TE>
<TE>   * When You See Someone and React to Them First as a Person, Then
Realize It's a Celebrity: On Sunset, "Cher was getting out of her car
and putting money in a meter. I first saw her arm and thought, 'God,
that woman has a really ... ugly tattoo."</TE>
<TE>   All of these categories prove a larger point: A good star sighting
just happens. "Years ago, I was waiting for an elevator alongside
Demi Moore on one of the garage levels of Beverly Center," says a
friend. "She said to the stretch limo driver, 'If the baby cries,
just page me.' We rode into the shopping center together, and off she
went shopping."</TE>
<TE>   As this example shows, a good star sighting entails seeing said
star in the wild--trying to parallel park, say, or "haggling over
vintage jewelry and being really mean about it."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Barbra Streisand, as spotted at the Santa Monica
Airport by Jacqui Hyland, an actress and native Angeleno who shares
her own sightings and posts others' on her Web site, accessed via
www.livejournal.com (search word: celebysightings).</TE>
<TE>   Hyland lives in Brentwood, the tony Westside hotbed of show
business. Among her anecdotes: Meryl Streep, eating at a
Souplantation; Brendan Fraser and Brad Pitt, seen separately at the
Brentwood market Vicente Foods; Monica Lewinsky (back when people
cared), shopping at a clothing store on Montana Avenue, also in
Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland admits to feeling a little queasy about posting her
sightings, given the potential for aiding and abetting stalkers. And
she knows there's a fine line between sighting and staring. "I've
learned to affect disinterest," she says. "But the truth is, I'm
staring at them, and then on the other hand I know these people are
hounded and hunted."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, looking for stars is a low-end sport relegated to
trash-can-rummaging paparazzi, celebrity autograph seekers and the
otherwise obsessed. Nor are we talking about the rubes who shell out
money to sit in exhaust-spewing tourist buses as they rattle through
town, carting around the naive.</TE>
<TE>   Because we don't really need to find them, you see. No, they find
us, and sometimes they're in character when they do.</TE>
<TE>   One friend saw Ben Stiller in klutz mode, hanging on for dear life
on a speeding Stairmaster at Crunch on Sunset Boulevard in West
Hollywood. Another friend says she was once returning to her Beverly
Hills office building after lunch, holding the door open for her
lunch-mates.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed just as the last of our group entered the building that
there was a man approaching a few yards away. He saw that I was
holding the door open and assumed a slow jog. He was wearing Ray-Bans
and a Lacoste shirt, and he seemed to be smirking. I held the door
for him, joking, 'How do you like that?' He filed past, lowered his
glasses, gave me a friendly once-over and replied, 'I like it.'" Jack
Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   You can make money off these stories. "The bigger the star, the
better the sighting," says Janet Charlton, gossip columnist for the
tabloid the Star, who says she uses 30 or 40 reliable spies to feed
her items. And what makes a good sighting for Charlton's purposes?
"If the star responds back to whoever you are, [that's] the best
kind," she says. "But if you catch them doing something interesting,
that's good too."</TE>
<TE>   But all of that sounds too ... too effortful, as if these people
matter to us. Because frankly, we see them, see them all the time,
and yet we really don't care. We so don't care. In fact, watch us
watching them: There's the flash of recognition and excitement on our
faces, followed by the forced nonchalance, the returning to the
business at hand, followed by the compulsion to steal another look.
Just one.</TE>
<TE>   And what if they turn out to be look-alikes? A seasoned sighter
knows the difference. Yes, that was Jack Lemmon in traffic, and Punky
Brewster on the stoop.</TE>
<TE>   Because we have to tell everybody, all of our friends, nattering
on about seeing Ellen DeGeneres at a Bristol Farms or Jason
Alexander, in a "Seinfeld" sweatshirt, at the dog park.</TE>
<TE>   It's a particularly L.A. habit, which is why I called Sandra Tsing
Loh, writer, radio commentator and general chronicler of most things
eccentric in L.A. Loh referred me to her semiautobiographical novel
"A Year in Van Nuys" (Crown Publishers, 2001), about a writer
struggling on the fringes of fame and self-esteem. In one scene,
Sandra, her sister and her husband, Ben, go to the Hollywood Bowl,
where they sit in a box, eating their picnic dinner, surrounded by a
gaggle of "'70s era B-list celebrities" (e.g. Morgan Fairchild, Susan
Anton). This touches off the following discussion:</TE>
<TE>   Sandra: "There's no place for Weird Celebrity Sightings like the
San Fernando Valley. Melrose, Benedict Canyon, Malibu: Forget it.
It's all gated communities, industry pool parties, people putting
their best front forward. But if you want to see celebrities being
themselves, Van Nuys is the hotbed. If you're a celebrity who has
either fallen so far--or, to put a positive spin on it, who is so
comfortable with your own self-image--that you're living in Van Nuys,
well, you just don't care who sees you!"</TE>
<TE>   Ben: "Like at Nat's Early Bite."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra: "Nat's Early Bite! Corner of Burbank and Hazeltine! It's
regular people, it's tank tops, it's thong sandals, it's eggs, it's
toast. A regular there? Ike Turner. Why? No one knows. But it feels
right, doesn't it? You won't see Tina Turner breakfasting in Van
Nuys, but you will see Ike."</TE>
<TE>   Ben: "I just saw this one last week. Kind of a mystery one. At
Art's Deli in Studio City: Paul Williams and Wilford Brimley.
Together again. Why? Even more odd: They left in a light blue
metallic Ford Taurus."</TE>
<TE>   Thus we arrive at another important star-sighting axiom:
Sometimes, the magnitude of the sighting is not commensurate with the
magnitude of the star. Sometimes, it's all about the context. There
is this sighting, for instance, courtesy of writer and Malibu
resident Merrill Markoe: Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, getting
manicures side by side at a nail place in a Malibu strip mall. "It
was the two of them, like some kind of Diane Arbus photo, and they
were both having their nails filed," she says. "It would have been
equally good if they had both been sitting under hairdryers."</TE>
<TE>   But no setting is a bigger repository for random star sightings
than the supermarket. I have personally known this since I was a boy
and discovered that one of my heroes, Moe Howard of the Three
Stooges, shopped where my mother shopped--at the old Shermart on
Doheny Drive and Santa Monica Boulevard, on the borderline of Beverly
Hills and West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, so many celebrities have infiltrated our lives at
markets that the Gelson's chain has a regular feature in its
bimonthly employee newsletter called "Star Shoppers," in which
Gelson's staffers contribute star sightings.</TE>
<TE>   The coverage area of that publication, called Express Lines,
stretches over the chain's stores from Dana Point to Santa Barbara,
says Benita Shaw, a partner in Grapevine Communications, which
publishes Express Lines.</TE>
<TE>   Coverage includes Mayfair markets, which are part of the Gelson's
chain. Not surprisingly, Shaw says, the Pacific Palisades Gelson's
sends in the most star sightings (the November-December issue
includes Clint Eastwood, Charlton Heston, Martin Short, Billy Crystal
and Meredith Baxter).</TE>
<TE>   The Dana Point Gelson's, in the same issue, weighs in impressively
with James Gandolfini, Chuck Norris and HoKu Ho, daughter of famed
Hawaiian singer Don Ho, Shaw says. In recent months, the Valley has
been represented, with Pat Benatar (the Northridge Gelson's) and
Lorenzo Lamas (the Tarzana Gelson's).</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Mayfair on Franklin and Bronson avenues in
Hollywood, long a feeder market for young Hollywood living up in the
hills (Heather Graham, Bridget Fonda and No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani
appeared in the September-October issue of Express Lines).</TE>
<TE>   Several checkers at the Mayfair report seeing A-listers Brad Pitt
and wife Jennifer Aniston, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very incognito; you never know who he is," says Mayfair
checker Dorothy Young, referring to Spacey.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, Rick Levy, co-owner of Victors, both the
restaurant and the neighboring liquor store and deli, won't name
names. He's too coy for that. Too coy and a little jaded. "Everyone
in Hollywood is a celebrity; that's the problem with Hollywood," says
Levy, whose great-grandfather started the business in 1929.</TE>
<TE>   Beside, Levy says, they don't make movie stars the way they used
to. Yeah, yeah, but if Brad and Jennifer do their grocery shopping
across the street, doesn't it stand to reason that they come here to
buy their fine wines, their turkey pastrami, their smokes? Levy won't
budge. "People who shop with you shop with you because they feel
comfortable," he says. Naming names, in other words, is bad for
business.</TE>
<TE>   So is identifying the eccentricities of a visit. Thus, a waitress
at Lulu's Cafe, near Beverly Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, talks of
the place being surrounded by bodyguards when singer Marc Anthony
dropped in recently. But the waitress doesn't want to be identified.
And she's got to go: Luke Perry, in celebrity-issue baseball cap and
scruffy face, is over at a side table, and he needs some service.</TE>

<HD>Food on the Fly: The Airlines Should Skip Dinner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why do the airlines even bother?</LD>
<LD>   On a flight to New York, I was sitting in coach eyeing the
contents of the tray the stewardess had just plopped in front of me:
a skinless chicken leg in a murky sauce brightened with strips of red
pepper, mashed potatoes that had set like concrete, a swatch of green
salad with grated carrots, a slab of chocolate something.</LD>
<LD>   I was hungry. I'd gotten up before 5 to be at the airport the full
two hours before the flight.</LD>
<TE>   And, though I know better, I hadn't planned ahead and brought my
own lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, with the new carry-on regulations, at least on this trip,
I didn't have an inch to spare in my newly limited carry-on baggage.</TE>
<TE>   What is this? I thought. It's 10:30 a.m. L.A. time and they're
giving us a bald chicken leg? The sight of it was enough to lead me
to consider becoming a vegetarian, at least for the duration of the
flight.  Ah, a roll, and a dab of butter: real food. Not. The roll is
stale and chilly, tough as particleboard.</TE>
<TE>   Well, at least there's salad. I rummage around and find the packet
of dressing. Very haute. Balsamic vinaigrette has finally made it to
coach. Not that I think it's anything to cheer about. The only thing
that could be worse is white truffle oil.</TE>
<TE>   I fiddle with the sauce around the chicken. Well, at least the
bird doesn't have feather stubble like the one I was presented with
on the flight back from the Ivory Coast. I can't eat it. I gingerly
stick my fork into the chocolate something. It tastes like it was
concocted in a chemistry lab.</TE>
<TE>   The worst is that I have to sit with this unappetizing tray in
front of me for what seems like an hour, until the stewards have a
chance to come around and collect the uneaten food.</TE>
<TE>   I'd be happy with a fresh roll, a piece of cheese and a juicy
apple. Or a decent sandwich instead of the revolting melted American
cheese gizmo I was served on another flight.</TE>
<TE>   I'm convinced that airlines have to give up the idea of serving
hot meals with all the fixings.</TE>
<TE>   At the price point they're employing, all they can offer is a
pathetic simulacrum of food.</TE>
<TE>   I'd rather go back to the days of Freddy Laker's cut-rate
transatlantic flights on which the stewards offered sandwiches,
muffins and fruit for purchase.</TE>
<TE>   As it is now, the security search by a team of guards in navy
fatigues, jaunty Special Forces-style berets and powder-blue plastic
gloves was less humiliating than the food on this flight.</TE>
<TE>   How's this for an idea? Eliminate everything except the beverages
and let us buy our own food--some healthful fruit, fresh salads, good
sandwiches or even just some La Brea Bakery bread and cheese--from
kiosks at the gate, as passengers do on European trains.</TE>

<HD>Surreal Visions of Americana</HD>
<DH>Handsome Family's folk-based music is haunting, tender and
whimsical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stuck inside Chicago with the desert blues again....</LD>
<LD>   A Dylan paraphrase seems appropriate to describe the lot of the
Handsome Family, since both artists share a knack for spinning
Americana into surreal visions.</LD>
<LD>   The Handsomes--husband and wife Brett and Rennie Sparks--are the
creators of a distinctively haunting brand of folk-rooted music that
has made them a connoisseur's choice in the "alternative country"
spread. Critics and Brits love them, and with a coalition of
unreformed old folkies and college-rock hipsters in place at home,
they've become regulars in year-end best-of lists and on the
indie-rock touring circuit. (They headline at Spaceland on Friday.)</LD>
<TE>   The fact that they crafted their rustic artifacts in the belly of
a city whose vastness and dreariness distressed them--to the point
that after 12 years in Chicago they finally moved away to Albuquerque
last summer--might be surprising, until you hear Rennie, who writes
the lyrics, talk about the songs on the fifth Handsome Family album,
"Twilight," which came out last fall. It turns out that deprivation
can translate into inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about all the things in Chicago that made life bearable,
and these little moments of beauty that just strike you when you're
living in an ugly city," she says. "All of a sudden sometimes I'd see
a streetlight and it would look so beautiful, and I'd realize I
hadn't seen stars in years. But sometimes just a streetlight can give
you that same feeling when you're that deprived. Or a pigeon.
Sometimes even a rat would make me feel like, 'Ah, there is a world
out there.'"</TE>
<TE>   This glory-from-grime theme isn't the only paradox at play in the
world of the Handsome Family. Personally, they're a longshot
matchup--Brett is from the Texas Panhandle and learned to sing in a
Baptist church, Rennie is a Jewish girl from Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, Brett's settings evoke Appalachia and Nashville
archetypes, but as Rennie cheerily notes, "We don't live in a log
cabin and smoke corncob pipes."</TE>
<TE>   True enough. Brett, 38, holds a master's degree in music history
at Stony Brook University in New York, where the two met as students.
Rennie, 36, has a master's in creative writing from the University of
Michigan, has published a book of short stories and is working on a
novel.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone is mistaking them for the Dogpatch house band.
Brett's dry baritone attends Rennie's narratives with the riveting
directness of a mountain balladeer, but that only sets off their
quirks in greater relief.</TE>
<TE>   Take the new album's "The Snow White Diner." In language that
sounds like jotted notes, the singer describes eating in a restaurant
while outside a car and its dead occupants are raised from a frozen
lake. Why are the patrons in the next booth laughing, oblivious to
the tragedy? They are deaf, it turns out, and maybe that's not such a
bad thing to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of myself as a story writer for sure," says Rennie, an
admirer of Woolf, Faulkner, Kafka and Pynchon. "That's kind of the
way I think of the lyrics, as really, really small stories, like
little glimpses into something.</TE>
<TE>   "I always found stories comforting, fairy tales and things like
that. I remember reading 'The Little Mermaid,' the Grimms' fairy tale
version, when I was a kid, and it's so sad and heartbreaking, and I
cried and cried. But it was comforting. It made me feel like the
world is a beautiful, mysterious place and it's not just what I see
every day on the street. So it kind of gave me hope, even though it
broke my heart at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   That often applies to the songs on "Twilight," an alternately
chilling, tender and whimsical series of vignettes full of ghostly
apparitions and images of nature swamped by civilization. That might
shape up as the Handsome Family's fundamental theme. The final song,
"Peace in the Valley" suggests transcendence will come when the last
shopping mall is closed and animals play in the halls.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain hollowness to modern life," Rennie observes.
"All over the country there's a certain uniformity. We're starting to
all live this suburban sprawl life, and the traffic is really bad
everywhere. All this big suburban dream that we had has not improved
life.</TE>
<TE>   "And these big giant superstores are supposed to make everything
so convenient, but I'm always in tears at Home Depot because I can't
find a screwdriver."</TE>

<HD>Winter Twirls and Whirls</HD>
<DH>It's time for the five S's: skiing, sledding, snowboarding,
skating and snowshoeing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE BATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even if the mercury only drops to about 50 degrees in Southern
California's version of winter, that doesn't mean Southlanders have
to forgo fun in snow and ice. Either we drive up to the mountains to
get our snow and ice, or like our film industry, we manufacture it.</LD>
<LD>   Sledding remains one of the most exhilarating activities
non-athletes can enjoy. Pack some warm clothes, find the old sled in
the garage and head up to Wrightwood in the Angeles National
Forest--about a 90-minute drive from Los Angeles. Take some hot cider
in a thermos for the little ones, but serve it sparingly. (Anyone
who's tried to get a kid out of his snowsuit in a hurry for a
bathroom break knows what I'm talking about.)</LD>
<LD>   Skis, snowshoes and snowboards can be rented at Sport Chalet
locations throughout the Southland, though be warned that the one in
La Canada often runs out. A two-day snowboard rental will set you
back $45. REI and Adventure 16 stores are also good places to buy
snowboards and snowshoes.</LD>
<TE>   Up past the snow level in the Angeles National Forest, almost any
place where there is safe parking is good for snow fun. Call ahead to
check snow conditions, or check the National Weather Service Web site
at www.nws.noaa.gov. More than one parent has had to drive a carful
of sulking kids home from a snowless outing.</TE>
<TE>   Also, don't forget the sledding safety lecture during the road
trip: Watch for posted signs on private property, and don't sled in
heavily forested areas. If you don't have a sledding accident story
of your own, feel free to use mine to impart the hazards of the
sport.</TE>
<TE>   One harsh winter, my sister was pushing me on an old, splintered,
wooden sled across our frozen backyard. I put my legs down, suddenly
stopping the sled, sending my sister crashing into it. By the next
day, Sis had taken on a sort of Frankenstein appearance with her
stitched lip and all. Through the years, her scar got smaller, but
the story got bigger and more ghastly.</TE>
<TE>   Wrightwood's ski resorts--Mountain High East and West, and Ski
Sunrise--all offer snowboarding, snowshoe hiking and "playing in
snow" activities. No sled in the garage? Mountain Hardware in
Wrightwood sells saucer sleds starting at $8.37 and the toboggan-like
"torpedo" for $11.16.</TE>
<TE>   Big Bear Mountain Resort in the San Bernardino Mountains has the
highest elevation around and therefore is most likely to have good
snow. Tubing (riding large inflated inner tubes) has been popular for
years at the resort, where skiing lessons, cross-country skiing and
sleigh rides also are offered.</TE>
<TE>   Alpine Slide on Big Bear Boulevard is a popular controlled speed
toboggan-style slide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For winter fun a little closer to home, the Pershing Square Ice
Rink in downtown Los Angeles will be open until Jan. 21. Skate
rentals are available in case you left yours back East when you moved
here. If you close your eyes, you can almost pretend you're in a Hans
Christian Andersen ice world. Wait, don't close your eyes.</TE>

<LD>* Star of the WB series "Angel."</LD>
<LD>   Route 1: Ideally I'd spend my favorite weekend up north, only
because the Northern California coastline is such a beautiful drive.
It'd be a drive with my wife [actress-model Jaime Bergman] in an old
classic car. She's got a '66 Mustang, so maybe we'd take that. It's
beautiful up to Big Sur. It's kind of far, but the scenery is so
gorgeous. We'd have the top down, very old Hollywood, scarf blowing
in the wind. I think that when you're driving, your soul is exposed,
and it's a beautiful way to feel your colors. I'd love to go to
Carmel, where Doris Day has a bed and breakfast where you can bring
your pets along.</LD>
<LD>   The Perfect Vintage: Napa is also gorgeous. I spent some time at
Auberge de Soleil, a beautiful inn in wine country. It's a rustic
approach to life, a definite soul-drenching experience. You just lose
yourself. We go to the small cafes and restaurants in the area, check
out the vineyards. I'm one for breakfasts, too: Check out any place
with good pancakes. It's wonderful to go up in the fall when the
leaves are changing.</LD>
<TE>   Local Vacation: I like to escape to hotels. I'm pretty much a
hotel fanatic, whether it's the Peninsula Hotel--where the people are
great and it's the lap of luxury--or the Chateau Marmont. I could
easily escape to a hotel for a weekend and do absolutely nothing.
Just sitting in the lobby and watching people come in and out is
entertaining. I can use the spa. You kind of find yourself wanting to
stay once you're in the door. I've just always liked hotels. I like
the bed and the sheets and everything that comes along with it. I
love my house, too, but I love getting up and out, not worrying about
making the bed and doing whatever you want.</TE>
<TE>   The There There: Downtown's got a real sense of style to it; you
just have to know where to go. I like downtown cities, but L.A.
doesn't really have one, so you have to go look for it. But you can
go down there and just experience Broadway. There's a lot of stuff
going on. Chinatown is fascinating. There's a restaurant that I
always go to, and it's like being in San Francisco's Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   Just Browsing: The Rose Bowl on the Sundays when they have the
flea market is always fun. I love going around to thrift shops and
going antiquing, on Beverly Boulevard, and on La Brea before you hit
Wilshire. Pasadena's not bad. Or, if you head up to Ojai there's a
lot of little places, or in Saugus.</TE>

<HD>A Forceful 'Anna Christie'</HD>
<DH>Emotional truths in Eugene O'Neill's play pack a wallop
under director Gar Campbell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before he segued into the studied expressionism of his middle career,
Nobel Prize winner Eugene O'Neill revolutionized the American stage
with gritty dramas about life on the margins--a far cry from the
polite chamber comedies and melodramas that were then standard
theatrical fare.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy to see why "Anna Christie," for which O'Neill won a
Pulitzer in the early '20s, must have been such a shocker in its day.
The play concerns the plight of Anna, a classic anti-heroine who
resorts to prostitution after a lifetime of abuse and abandonment.
When we first meet Anna, she is recovering from a wasting illness and
has traveled to New York in hopes that her estranged father, Chris,
will stake her to a rest cure. At sea on her father's coal barge,
Anna meets Mat, a shipwrecked sailor who wants to marry her. But
first, she has to set him straight about the unpleasant details of
her past.</LD>
<LD>   Those who inextricably link the play with the famous 1930 film
starring Greta Garbo will find its present production at Pacific
Resident Theatre a revelation. Granted, given today's bare-all,
tell-all standards, O'Neill's drama is hardly likely to seriously
rankle anyone's proprieties. However, its emotional force remains
undiminished by time.</LD>
<TE>   That's largely due to the close-to-the-bone direction by Gar
Campbell, whose emphasis on the play's psychological truth relegates
Garbo's performance to the history books. Even potentially campy
lines like Anna's "Give me a whiskey ... and don't be stingy, baby"
sound fresh and original, given the absolute authority of Campbell's
staging.</TE>
<TE>   That authority extends to the play's fine technical elements.
Victoria Profitt's scenic art design and David Dionisio's scenic
design combine to give the production an appropriately stripped-down,
penurious look--"Lower Depths" on the waterfront. Kellie Canning's
costumes look unobtrusively well-worn, Keith Endo's lighting is as
flickering and changeable as the ocean itself and Kevin Rahm's subtle
sound design is exceptional--all creaking timbers and distant bells.</TE>
<TE>   A praiseworthy cast tackles this period drama with unremitting
genuineness, from the leads right down to the lesser roles. Paula
Malcomson (double-cast in the role with Lesley Fera) plays Anna as a
deadpan waif whose tough exterior masks her ravaging disappointment
and pain. Tim Murphy (who shares the role with Matt McKenzie)
captures both the bluster and the yearning of Mat, the Irish stoker
who idealizes Anna as the first "decent" girl of his acquaintance.
Double-cast with Bonnie Bowers, Jennifer Lonsway brings a no-frills
earthiness to the role of Marthy, a boozy floozy with a heart of
gold.</TE>
<TE>   In the most memorable performance of a memorable lot, Bruce French
(doubling with William Lithgow), plays Chris, Anna's neglectful
father, a hard-drinking Swedish sailor who blames "dat ol' debbil
sea" for his own personal shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   French makes Chris a fascinating study in contradictions, a
sentimental and irresponsible fellow-ill-met as endearing as he is
contemptible.</TE>

<HD>The Personal and Political: Celebrating Iranian Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The films featured in the 12th edition of the UCLA Film and
Television Archive's Celebration of Iranian Cinema recall the great
neo-realist works of Italian directors Vittorio De Sica, Roberto
Rossellini and Luchino Visconti. Just as films such as "The Bicycle
Thief," "Open City" and "Umberto D" were studies of the human
condition in post-World War II Italy, these Iranian movies are
heart-wrenching, emotional experiences that explore contemporary
problems in the Islamic country.</LD>
<LD>   The monthlong festival includes six features and four
documentaries.</LD>
<LD>   Among the highlights are:</LD>
<TE>   * "Kandahar" (Jan 10): Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Cannes Jury Prize
winner about an Afghan exile's attempt to return to her homeland,
under Taliban rule, to save her suicidal sister. The film is inspired
by the real-life experience of its star, Afghan Canadian journalist
Nelofer Pazira. The film also received attention recently when it was
revealed that one of its stars, Hassan Tantai, who plays an African
American medic, may be an American fugitive named Daoud Salahuddin.
"Kandahar" opens its commercial run Friday at the Fine Arts in
Beverly Hills and the Town Center in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   * "Under the Moonlight" (Jan. 15): Directed by Seyyed Reza
Mir-Karimi and winner of the Critics' Week Prize at Cannes, the
haunting drama deals with a young cleric-in-training who, during a
crisis of faith, is drawn to a community of homeless men living under
a bridge in Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   * "Unfinished Song" (Jan. 19): Maziar Miri's film about a young
musicologist who travels back to his home province to record the
songs he remembers from his childhood, only to discover that most of
the songs are unsung because of the fundamentalist ban on women
singing.</TE>
<TE>   * "Under the Skin of the City" (Feb 2): Rakhshan Bani-Etemad's
devastating drama about members of a working-class family in Tehran
trying to better themselves. The film revolves around a feisty
factory worker, her disabled, weak-willed husband and her four
troubled children.</TE>
<TE>   A Turn Toward Personal, Art-House-Type Fare</TE>
<TE>   Although previous UCLA festivals featured more commercial Iranian
films, this year the films are distinctly personal, art-house fare.</TE>
<TE>   "This could simply be coincidental, but this year we have noticed
the ratcheting up of more films that address problems in Iranian
society far more directly," says Cheng-Sim Lim, programmer for the
archive. "We have noticed in the last one or two years there has been
a definite shift in tone in the films made by some of their more
interesting directors."</TE>
<TE>   Lim says, "I actually think it is part and parcel of the debate
that is going on in Iranian society right now, because in Iran there
is a fight going on between the political reformers and the hard-core
clerical right wing. The split is reflected in the film community as
well. You have the more popular thread of Iranian filmmaking, which
tends to support the right-wing groups--the hard-liners--and the
filmmakers who make more of the art cinema are more in the reformist
camp. It is this latter group that has become more vocal in voicing
its displeasure with what is going on in Iran."</TE>
<TE>   The humanistic approach to filmmaking reflects the general nature
of the Iranian people, says Mark Amin, vice chairman of Lions Gate
Entertainment, who was born in Iran and provided funding for this
year's series.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, Iranians are emotional people and generally
humanistic," Amin says. "I think that shows in the work despite what
is going on politically."</TE>
<TE>   Still, filmmakers and their films can run into problems. Lim
points out that Bani-Etemad, despite being one of the country's top
directors, was harassed while making "Under the Skin of the City,"
which offers an uncompromising look at domestic violence and drug use
in Iran. Although Bani-Etemad is not as strong a feminist as other
Iranian directors, "she does have a reputation of being a director
who has done a number of films focusing on women," Lim says.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of her reputation and what the film is supposed to have
been about, she was harassed in production in one or two locations
and she had to quickly pack her bags. She told me she had trouble
with the scripts at various points, and she said that things had
gotten tougher under Mohammad Khatami, the president. Even though
Khatami is a reformist president, there are so many factions
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "The interesting thing about Iranian society right now is you have
this incredibly humanistic cinema that is interesting in both
artistic and political ideas," Lim says. "A cinema that is not afraid
to express those ideas--but in a poetic way, not necessarily in the
strictly polemical way. These films in large part are getting seen in
Iran, in contrast to a place like mainland China, where some of the
work of their most interesting filmmakers gets shown in international
film festivals but not in China. These [Iranian] filmmakers are
supported by the government, and the films in a large part are funded
by the government and shown in Iran publicly."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the UCLA festival has been well attended by the
Southland's large Iranian community. Movies directed by well-known
filmmakers, Lim says, have attracted a crossover audience.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Lim nor Amin will say if this year's festival will
attract more interest outside the Iranian community because of the
Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know how it is going to work out," Amin says. "It
has done really well in Europe. Makhmalbaf is a renowned director,
but there is no way this movie could have done that kind of box
office without the events in Afghanistan. So I know in the United
States there is going to be some additional interest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>   "Flower Drum Song"--Totalitarian repression, cheesecake and Lea
Salonga: These were the primary ingredients of the pop gruel known as
"Miss Saigon." The ingredients were recombined for a new dish,
"Flower Drum Song" (although Jennifer Paz took over the role during
the run at the Taper). A few tons shy of a mega-musical--no fake
helicopter here, no power ballads saccharine enough to stop communism
dead in its tracks--it's a raffishly entertaining response to the
1958 original. Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein purists may freak out (in their
genteel way, of course) regarding what librettist David Henry Hwang
has done to "their" show, based on the C.Y. Lee novel. Along with an
entirely new story line, Hwang delivers some pretty wild mood swings.
One minute, the Chinese refugee Mei-Li (Paz) is talking about her
father's death at the hands of Chairman Mao's thugs; the next, we're
inside Club Chop Suey, on Grant Avenue, San Francisco, California,
U.S.A....The production is big for the Taper, though smallish for a
Broadway-minded revival. Working with scenic designer Robin Wagner's
simple, pagoda-dominated unit set, director Robert Longbottom keeps
the action zipping.</LD>

<LD>Wilt Chamberlain, the late basketball legend, was hard to miss when
out in public, given that he stood 7 foot 1 tall. Still, Chamberlain
was reputed to have little patience for those who tried to be cute by
asking such questions as, "How's the weather up there?"</LD>
<LD>   "It's raining," he would say, perhaps apocryphally, before
spitting in their direction.</LD>
<LD>   Sighting celebrities, of course, is a far cry from actually
encountering and engaging them, which is a dicier proposition, and
certainly more uncouth.</LD>
<TE>   No matter how hard they work at getting everyone to know their
name, celebrities generally like to mind their own business. While
some are more tolerant of autograph seekers and fans than others,
many take umbrage at being harassed while they are trying to drop off
their kids at school, pick out a shirt or have dinner with friends.</TE>
<TE>   I learned this firsthand at age 5, when, on a trip to Palm
Springs, my parents sent me over to say hello to Jack Benny in a
restaurant. Cute as I was, Benny briefly looked at me as if I had
just crawled out from under the refrigerator and went back to his
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, the sighting itself is more than enough to
satisfy them. Others, however, need to be reminded that just because
celebrities enter our homes thanks to the magic of TV doesn't mean
they recognize us or are eager to invite us to return the favor.</TE>
<TE>   In this regard, a few helpful pointers--or more specifically,
"don'ts"--are particularly useful and could spare an unwitting fan
looking for a story to tell the neighbors or folks back home from
being pummeled by one or more of the Baldwin brothers.</TE>
<TE>   When you see celebrities, don't:</TE>
<TE>   * Ask if you can have a sip of what they are drinking. I know
someone who did this once. It is a little bit too familiar.</TE>
<TE>   * Tell them how much you hated their last project, or how much you
hate them. Some celebrities are sensitive about such things.</TE>
<TE>   * Expect to make a comic or sitcom star laugh by telling them a
joke. For starters, comics don't really want to be funny all the
time, and odds are you're not going to double them over when they're
just trying to get through the supermarket checkout line. In
addition, sitcom actors are seldom as witty without their writers,
and very few of them are willing to be seen in public with their
writers.</TE>
<TE>   * Tell them that they are shorter than you thought. They probably
know how tall they are (or aren't).</TE>
<TE>   * Gush all over them about how wonderful they are, unless they are
the kind of mid- to low-level celebrity that you--and only you--would
recognize. Do you really think Russell Crowe and Julia Roberts don't
have enough people, just in their daily lives, telling them over and
over that they're terrific?</TE>
<TE>   * Tell them you have a script that would be perfect for them,
unless you want to meet a burly young security guard up close and
personal.</TE>
<TE>   * Drink heavily before trying to speak with them. Heavy drinking,
it's worth remembering, has a bad habit of making us braver than we
should be.</TE>
<TE>   * Take offense that your date is looking at them, especially if
you are braver than you should be due to heavy drinking. You are
looking at them. Everyone is looking at them. That's the reason
they're celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   * Ever, ever feed them after midnight.</TE>

<HD>'Romeo' Becomes a Bawdy Comedy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JANA J. MONJI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Romeo (Rick Batalla) has a wandering mustache and a mostly Italian
accent. Juliet (Meleney Humphrey) is a giggly rich girl in sneakers.
Juliet's mother, Lady Oates (Beth Kennedy), has a makeup job straight
from the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus but is doing a mean mommy dearest
impression. The nurse (Michelle Anne Johnson) has a curiously active
chest.</LD>
<LD>   Using the music of '80s pop singers Daryl Hall and John Oates, the
Troubadour Theater Company has concocted an adaptation of
Shakespeare's tragedy that's so loose that the threads sometimes
show. It's not as well-tailored as the company's "12th Dog Night" or
as hilariously dippy as the disco version of the Bard's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," but "Romeo Hall and Juliet Oates," now at the Falcon
Theater, is still bawdy fun.</LD>
<LD>   Front-row seats can be somewhat hazardous for patrons (who might
get slightly misted), although no one is really safe, because the
actors race into the audience. There are also acrobatics, with
audience participation.</LD>
<TE>   This love story parody played earlier at the John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre, and from the looks of it, the troupe has spared every
expense on the scenery. The balcony scene involves an exceptional use
of stilts.</TE>
<TE>   Too many songs are exhausted during the party scene in which Romeo
and Juliet meet. Under Walker's direction, some scenes feel rushed.
In the end, the death scene doesn't wind down the play.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Troubadours' flippancy and physicality are winning.
Purists beware.</TE>
<TE>   But for others, this is a wonderfully silly sendup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Romeo Hall and Juliet Oates," Falcon Theater, 4252 Riverside
Drive, Burbank. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 6 p.m. Ends
Jan. 27. $20. (818) 955-8004. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Victor Salva's "Jeepers Creepers," a clever
thriller-chiller about a brother and sister's drive home from college
and their desperate race to escape a demonic force, has the scariest
opening sequence of any horror picture in recent memory. The result,
starring Gina Philips, Justin Long and Jonathan Breck, combines
laughter with creepiness and should satisfy many horror fans looking
for a diversion.</LD>

<HD>Rix's New Owner Renames It Union</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA PETTERA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The State of Union: We alluded in an earlier column to the fact that
Rix restaurant in Santa Monica has been sold. The buyer is Jeff
Peterson, the owner of Geoffrey's in Malibu. Peterson says he enjoyed
the thrill he felt when he purchased Geoffrey's from its previous
owner in 1999 and sought to have that feeling again. He hopes his new
venture will be the second in a line of three restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   His managing partners in Union (as the place will be called) are
Chuck Craig and Brian Norris. Craig, the new director of operations,
spent 1997 to 2000 as general manager and maitre d' of Spago Beverly
Hills. Norris, the general manager, comes over from his managing post
at Geoffrey's. Peterson wants Union to be a comfortable American
restaurant. "I want to take the best of what America has to offer,"
he tells us. He's hired James Grey, last at Les Deux Cafes in
Hollywood, as the chef. Look for Union to open at 1413 5th St., Santa
Monica, in February.</LD>
<TE>   Don't Drink the Water: Here's a surprise--Bruce Marder has opened
a coffee shop. Marder, the chef and owner of Capo, a pricey Italian
restaurant in Santa Monica, also owns the steeply tabbed Broadway
Deli on the Third Street Promenade and the expensive steakhouse
Brentwood, located in, well, Brentwood. Now he's taken over Cora's
Coffee Shop next-door to Capo, remodeled it, started serving Italian
food and renamed it Cora's Coffee Shoppe. The extra p and e will cost
you; tea runs $3.25 and water, sparkling or still, is $5. (We're
kidding--at those prices, you can go ahead and drink the water.)
Capo's chefs moonlight (sunlight, actually) during the day at Cora's,
so menu items have an upscale Italian bent. There's a burrata caprese
omelet ($7.75), a prosciutto egg panino ($7.50) and a chicken arugula
salad ($11.50). Cora's is currently open from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
daily. It will be opening for dinner on Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   * Cora's Coffee Shoppe, 1802 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica; (310)
451-9562.</TE>
<TE>   O Brother, Where Art Thou?: Celestino Drago, owner of Celestino in
Pasadena, Celestino Italian Steakhouse in West Hollywood and Drago in
Santa Monica, has lots of brothers. Together they help him operate
and cook at the above restaurants and more. Recently Calogero Drago
has migrated from Drago, where he worked for 15 years, to Celestino
in Pasadena. "We needed one other brother here," Calogero tells us.
With him has come chef Armando Salazar, who cooked at Rex and
Vincenti before going to Drago. Together the guys have created a game
menu, which will be available through the end of February. Dishes can
be ordered individually or as a four-course meal for $48. They
include sauteed duck liver with balsamic reduction, rigatoni with
wild boar, risotto with wild rabbit and morel mushrooms, pappardelle
with duck ragout and roasted squab with a potato timbale. Some white
truffle specials will also be available for the next couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   * Celestino, 141 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena; (626) 795-4006.</TE>
<TE>   Truffle Time: Expatriate L.A. chef Ken Frank, owner of La Toque
restaurant up north in Napa wine-country Rutherford, begins his
famous all-truffle menu Jan. 11. Every course of the menu includes
black French truffles in one form or another. Some dishes include
artichoke soup with truffles, dayboat scallop with lobster truffle

<HD>'Kandahar' Opens Celebration of Iranian Cinema</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Film Archive's 12th annual Celebration of Iranian Cinema
begins tonight at 7:30 in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater with
Mohsen Makhmalbaf's acclaimed "Kandahar," which opens a regular run
Friday at the Westside Pavilion Cinemas. It already is the most
discussed Iranian film for its depiction of life in Afghanistan under
the Taliban and for news reports suggesting that one of its key
actors, Hassan Tantai, is an American fugitive from justice. Through
the journey of an Afghan-born Canadian journalist (Niloufar Pazira),
Makhmalbaf reveals the extreme hardships the Afghan people endured
under Taliban rule.</LD>
<LD>   Seyyed Reza Mir-Karimi's "Under the Moonlight" (Tuesday at 7:30
p.m.), which won the critics' prize at Cannes last year, breaks fresh
ground in its implicit criticism of the Islamic clergy. Hossein Pour
Sattar stars as Seyyed, a young seminarian about to receive his
investiture as a full-fledged mullah. Plagued with doubt, Seyyed
finds himself reluctant to don the turban and djellaba, the
traditional garb of Iranian clerics, but dutifully secures the fabric
from which this robe will be made. When a little boy steals the bolt
of cloth from Seyyed on a Tehran subway train, the seminarian pursues
him to a homeless community under a bridge on the outskirts of the
city.</LD>
<TE>   Seyyed encounters drugs and prostitution but also a group of men
who treat each other with the utmost courtesy as a way of maintaining
self-respect and staving off hopelessness. In them Seyyed discovers
the very spirituality that he finds lacking behind the walls of his
spacious and comfortable seminary, where so much attention is paid to
petty, even materialistic matters. The contrast provokes in Seyyed a
crisis that has been long simmering, and the question becomes whether
Seyyed will leave the seminary or decide that he should not allow the
human failings he finds at the seminary to detract from his faith and
service as a mullah.</TE>
<TE>   In only his second feature, Reza Mir-Karimi, whose first, "The
Child and the Soldier," was shown in the archive's festival last
year, reveals his talent for screen storytelling and directing a wide
range of actors and for dealing with controversial subjects in a
responsible, fair-minded manner--which won him top rating from the
government censor. (More on film festival, Page 18.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The archive is launching another series, "Fantastic Voyages,"
Friday at 7:30 p.m. at the James Bridges Theater in connection with
the UCLA Hammer Museum's current exhibition, "The World From Here:
Treasures of the Great Libraries of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Opening the series is Luis Bunuel's 1954 "Robinson Crusoe," which
may well be the only one of his films intended for release in an
English-language version. Not surprisingly, Bunuel, the corrosive
critic of church, state and all manner of human folly, manages to be
true to himself as well as to novelist Daniel Defoe. A film of
Bunuel's Mexican period, it boasts lush cinematography from the
Mexican master Alex Phillips, and splendid, robust portrayals from
Daniel O'Herlihy in the title role and Jaime Fernandez as Friday. Its
imaginative screenplay was written by then-blacklisted Hollywood
veteran Hugo Butler.</TE>
<TE>   No one could accuse Bunuel of building sympathy for Crusoe, who is
heard on the soundtrack at the film's opening telling us that on his
way to Africa to buy slaves "for his fellow planters in the Brazils,"
his ship encountered a tremendous storm that sent it far off course.
Apparently the only survivor, he spots a sunny island and manages to
offload many supplies before what's left of the ship drifts off to
sea.</TE>
<TE>   In the film's first half, Crusoe struggles to conquer his
environment and himself, discovering that the Scriptures provide him
with less and less comfort. He has learned to accept his fate when,
after years without human companionship, he saves the life of a
native from a nearby island who has been brought ashore as part of
his people's ritual sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   Overcome by paranoia, and as an Englishman "of good family,"
Crusoe reflexively enslaves the native, whom he names Friday;
gradually the relationship shifts to master and servant rather than
slave. The questions then become whether true friendship between
equals will ever flower and whether, should such equality between
them come to pass, it would survive a return to the white man's
"civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Bunuel raises such questions, among others, implicitly,
and "Robinson Crusoe" is throughout a lively entertainment with
O'Herlihy engaged in continual activity and enterprise in his
struggle merely to survive. His "Robinson Crusoe" may well have been
the great director's most commercial--and surely most
accessible--venture, but it is no less rich in meaning for being so.

<TE>   The American Cinematheque commences its "Grand Master: The Films
of Stanley Kubrick" on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in the Lloyd E. Rigler
Theater with "The Shining" (1980), in which Jack Nicholson becomes
memorably unglued as a writer holed up in a vast, vacant snowed-in
mountain resort.</TE>
<TE>   Of special interest is Wednesday's program, beginning at 7:30 p.m.
with Kubrick's ultra-rare 16-minute "Day of the Fight" (1951), a
documentary on middleweight boxer Walter Cartier preparing for a
bout. It will be followed by his second feature film, "Killer's Kiss"
(1955), which has enough visual razzle-dazzle to make it a portent of
things to come. Best regarded as a precocious home movie, it is a
familiar tale of an aspiring but second-rate boxer (Jamie Smith) who
falls for a frail blond taxi dancer (Irene Kane), unfortunately also
the hapless object of her employer's mad passion.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a low but workable budget for the era ($320,000), a
solid property (Lionel White's thriller "Clean Break") and a fine
cast of Hollywood stalwarts, Kubrick made the giant leap from gifted
amateur to assured professional in "The Killing" (1956). The film
remains not only one of Kubrick's most satisfying but also one of the
best "perfect heist" movies ever made. Although celebrated for its
intricate construction involving fragmented time and shifts in point
of view (which were in White's novel), "The Killing" endures above
all for its superlative performances. Masterminding a racetrack
robbery is a stoic loner (Sterling Hayden, who played a similar role
in "The Asphalt Jungle"). Unforgettable, however, are Elisha Cook Jr.
as a nervous, henpecked track cashier and Marie Windsor as his
brassy, gold-digging wife. To watch them play right up to the edge of
all-out comedy is a delight. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<HD>Cutting a Swath on the Sunset Strip</HD>
<DH>Katana, a new venture from the Sushi Roku guys, isn't your
typical Japanese restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos, particularly hip, young Angelenos, don't yet know it, but
soon they'll probably want to check out Katana. Certainly that's what
Lee Maen, Michael Cardenas, Philip Cummins and Craig Katz, the guys
behind Katana, which opens Friday night, are banking on.</LD>
<LD>   The team does have some history with hip, having launched three
Sushi Rokus and, more recently, Balboa, the steakhouse at the Grafton
hotel. All are restaurants known not only for excellent food and
service but also for their beautiful clientele and the palpable
sexiness of the scene.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a no-brainer," says Merrill Shindler, co-editor of the
Los Angeles Zagat Survey and host of "Feed Your Face" on KLSX-FM
(97.1). "Look at their track record. My God, look at the location.
Look at how the Sunset Strip with its miserable parking has turned
into such a hot destination with Asia de Cuba and the Standard and
the House of Blues."</LD>
<TE>   In the midst of it is Katana (which means "samurai sword"), housed
in the Piazza del Sol, a gorgeous 1920s Mediterranean building on the
Strip, also home to Miramax Films. (For the record, Miramax signed
its lease after the restaurateurs.) Though technically a Japanese
restaurant, nothing about it feels typical. Nor is it a carbon copy
of Sushi Roku.</TE>
<TE>   To enter, patrons ascend a dramatic staircase, walk past two
fountains designed to look like part of the original construction,
through an antique finished steel door and into a dimly lighted
lounge area. The focal point of the room, aside from the
sure-to-be-pretty hostesses aglow in candlelight, is the chunky
concrete bar with its varied levels, wacky angles and protrusions.
Clearly interior designer Dodd Mitchell, who also did the Sushi
Rokus, Linq restaurant and the Santa Monica bar Voda, was the kid who
wanted to put the circle in the square.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the crowds, there's plenty of eye candy. One wall in
the lounge is covered with thousands of tightly packed knobs that
turn out to be railroad ties. (Only after their installation did the
partners realize that a coin tossed at the top of the wall creates a
pleasant pachinko-like tinkling as it tumbles down.) A niche in
another wall features a cluster of candle-filled, giant test tubes
suspended from the ceiling. These turn up again in the main dining
room, which is divided into several areas but retains an open feel.</TE>
<TE>   Front and center is the robata counter. Here, a variety of raw
seafood, meats and vegetables will be displayed on ice under glass.
After diners make their selection, they can watch the robata chefs
skewer, then cook their orders over an open flame fueled by imported
Japanese charcoal.</TE>
<TE>   Along the same wall is the sushi counter. Both the robata and
sushi counters were fashioned from a 600-year-old redwood tree the
owners are quick to point out was already felled when they bought it
from the Forest Service. The dining room tables were made from the
same tree.</TE>
<TE>   Going for an 'Entire Entertainment Experience'</TE>
<TE>   When they talk about the look and feel of their restaurants, Maen,
Cardenas and Cummins refer often to theater and film. "We create a
play," says Cummins, "an entire entertainment experience." This is
definitely the case with the semi-enclosed space known as the tea
room. The gentle name doesn't really fit the steel tent, which looks
more like a stylish S&amp;M venue or music video set, with its sliding
metal screens and tentacled chandelier.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the "play," lighting throughout the restaurant is
high drama. People will look good. Then again, the people who
frequent the Sushi Rokus and Balboa, and probably Katana, look good
to start with. This is an appearance-conscious crowd. They work out.
They shop at Barney's and Fred Segal, slum at Banana Republic. They
are lawyers, entrepreneurs and designers. Many are industry types:
young agents, directors, producers, actors. "The entertainment
industry is our meat and potatoes," says Cardenas. The guys insist,
however, that they don't actively pursue this business.</TE>
<TE>   Time has been spent on getting the details right. Staff will wear
custom, Japanese-style shirts and aprons. Robata items will be served
on wood paddles reminiscent of the oars used by Japanese fishermen,
who made famous this cooking style.</TE>
<TE>   There's a sake cart for the 40-plus sakes on the menu, which a
sake sommelier will wheel through the dining room. And for those who
judge a restaurant by its restrooms: walls of luminescent gold leaf.</TE>
<TE>   None of the owners seems especially worried about the competition.
Miyagi, for example, the three-story sushi bar a couple blocks to the
east, has a "completely different clientele," says Maen, a more
collegiate crowd. Nor are the four concerned about competing with
themselves. Which they might be.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Balboa is directly across the street. But Balboa serves
steak and lobster and Caesar salad. And Sushi Roku, particularly the
West Hollywood location, can't accommodate all the callers who want
to score a table.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys will do great," Shindler predicts. "They can live for
five years on the buzz alone."</TE>

<HD>'MASH' Arrives on DVD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the classic antiwar feature film comedies and the long-running
TV series based on it are making their DVD debuts this week. Just
think of it as Fox Video's "MASH" note to the die-hard fans of Robert
Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 satire and the landmark, long-running CBS
series.</LD>
<LD>   The special two-disc DVD edition of the movie "MASH" ($27) is full
of extra goodies and wonderful stories. Altman, whose current film
"Gosford Park" is nominated for several Golden Globes, oversaw the
extensive film and soundtrack restoration of this dark comedy set in
a mobile Army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Nominated for
five Academy Awards, including best picture and director, "MASH" won
its sole Oscar for Ring Lardner Jr.'s screenplay adaptation. The
digital edition features a lengthy, comprehensive and funny
documentary with behind-the-scenes footage of the production, a
vintage interview with the late Lardner and new interviews with
Altman, producer Ingo Preminger and several of the film's stars,
including Elliott Gould, Donald Sutherland and Sally Kellerman.</LD>
<TE>   Altman originally didn't mention in the movie that it was set
during the Korean War. But because the country was still embroiled in
the Vietnam War, the studio made Altman announce at the outset that
the action took place nearly 20 years earlier. Sutherland was hired
to play Hawkeye Pierce before Altman came on board, and Altman
initially wanted someone else for his part. Neither Sutherland nor
Gould, who plays Trapper John, was used to Altman's freewheeling
improvisational style. During his interview, Sutherland points out
that they both thought Altman was crazy and actually went to their
agents to see if the director could be removed from the film. "We
were so arrogant," Sutherland says.</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland also proffers a sweet story about his parents seeing
the film for the first time in a theater in Las Vegas. When Hawkeye
says "Hi, Dad!" for a news camerawoman in the film, Sutherland's
father stood up in the movie theater and said, "Hi, Donny."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition also includes the History Channel documentary,
"MASH: History Through the Lens," a look at the 30th anniversary
reunion of the cast and crew, an overview of the film's extensive
restoration, a still gallery, talent files, trailers, a "Back Story"
mini-doc that aired on American Movie Classics and commentary from
Altman, who repeats much of what he discusses in the documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after "MASH" hit the theaters, CBS premiered the
half-hour weekly comedy series developed by Larry Gelbart, which
starred Wayne Rogers as Trapper John and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce.
The series won nearly 40 Emmys during its 11-year run and remains one
of TV's most popular series ever. The three-disc "MASH Television
Season One DVD" ($40) features all 24 beautifully restored episodes
from the first season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition of last year's "Jeepers Creepers" (MGM, $27)
should definitely be watched with the lights on. Written and directed
by Victor Salva and executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola,
"Jeepers Creepers" is a classic monster flick about two college
students--a brother and his older sister--taking the back route home
for the holiday. The teenagers (Gina Philips and Justin Long) are
almost run off the road by a manic driver in a weird old truck.
Later, the siblings find the driver shoving what appear to be bodies
down a sewer pipe at an abandoned church. When they decide to stop
and investigate, they find an unimaginable horror.</TE>
<TE>   The special edition features wide-screen and pan-and-scan versions
of the film, a photo gallery, filmographies, 10 deleted and extended
scenes, including the original opening and ending, six "making of"
featurettes, talent files, a trailer and interesting commentary from
Salva.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The same week Showtime premieres the second season of its
controversial, acclaimed drama, "Queer as Folk," it is releasing the
DVD and VHS sets of the first 22 episodes ($120 for each format) of
the series (based on a British show of the same name) that focuses on
the lives of a group of gay men and women living in Pittsburgh. Hal
Sparks, Peter Paige, Gale Harold, Randy Harrison and Sharon Gless
star.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition of this strictly-for-adults series features
actor and producer commentary on three of the 22 episodes, extended
scenes hosted by Sparks, R-rated outtakes, a sneak peek at the second
season, episode summaries, a photo gallery, biographies of the eight
key characters from the series described by the actors who play them
and filmographies of the actors and producers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of John Frankenheimer's greatest films, "Seconds" (Paramount,
$25), makes its digital bow this week. John Randolph plays a
disenchanted middle-age man who changes his identity through the help
of a mysterious corporation. Though he starts life over as a
handsome, swinging bachelor (Rock Hudson in his best performance), he
soon discovers his second chance at life is more of a prison than his
original existence.</TE>
<TE>   The final film Frankenheimer shot in black and white, the
disturbing 1966 drama showcases James Wong Howe's eerie and evocative
cinematography.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD has a beautiful wide-screen transfer of the restored film,
the trailer and Frankenheimer's perceptive commentary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Dean starred only in the movies--"East of Eden," "Rebel
Without a Cause" and "Giant"--before his untimely death at age 24.
But before coming out to Hollywood, Dean appeared on TV in several
dramatic series.</TE>
<TE>   A new DVD, "James Dean Era" (Eclectic Distribution, $25) features
three of Dean's television appearances: "The Unlighted Road," "I'm a
Fool" (with "Rebel" co-star Natalie Wood) and "Something for an Empty
Briefcase." Though the first two dramas have been available on tape,
"Briefcase" is a rarity, having been missing for more than 40 years.
None of these shows is great, but it's wonderful to see Dean flex his
acting muscles on the small screen.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1965, the Three Stooges--Larry, Moe and Curly Joe
DeRita--starred in their first animated cartoon series, "The New
Three Stooges." Rhino Home Video is releasing several episodes on VHS
($10 each) and DVD ($15). Each six-minute cartoon includes
live-action wraparounds with the boys. Though the wraparounds are at
least watchable, the cartoons are pretty awful.</TE>
<TE>   Strictly for undiscerning Stooges fans.</TE>

<HD>NBC Seeking More 'Friends'</HD>
<DH>Television* The network wants the show back for a ninth
season, as it looks to capitalize on the Olympics as a lead-in to new
series and nostalgic specials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC officials called renewing "Friends" for a ninth season their top
priority on Wednesday, even as the network prepares to try parlaying
the vast audience anticipated for its Winter Olympics coverage into a
launching pad for new hits.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing TV critics and reporters in Pasadena, NBC Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker also announced an array of nostalgic specials
planned for the May rating sweeps--when NBC was already scheduled to
commemorate its 75th anniversary with a splashy prime-time
production--inspired in part, he acknowledged, by CBS' surprise
success with a "Carol Burnett Show" special in November.</LD>
<LD>   Having already canceled the new comedies "Emeril" and "Inside
Schwartz," NBC will launch three new half-hour series coming out of
the Olympics in February, including a sitcom starring "Seinfeld's"
Julia Louis-Dreyfus, "Watching Ellie." That project will run Tuesdays
at 8:30 p.m., however, while the more coveted post-"Friends" time
slot goes to "Leap of Faith," an ensemble comedy. The network is also
planning a prime-time variety show, "New York Live," hosted by
"Saturday Night Live's" Colin Quinn.</LD>
<TE>   As for "Friends," NBC indicated the issue is less about money (the
six principal cast members currently earn roughly $20 million a year)
than whether the actors wish to continue with the series, which has
enjoyed a ratings revival this year. Most assume the show will be
back, but last year's negotiations went down to the wire on NBC
setting its prime-time schedule in May, a scenario executives would
like to avoid. Zucker said NBC is "anxiously awaiting an answer"
regarding the show's future.</TE>
<TE>   The May sweeps, meanwhile, will have an '80s flavor, with NBC
planning a "Cosby Show" reunion special a decade after its finale, an
"L.A. Law" reunion movie and a Bob Hope retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also confirmed second-season renewals for three of its new
programs: the comedy "Scrubs" and the dramas "Crossing Jordan" and
"Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent."</TE>
<TE>   NBC did find itself on the defensive regarding plans to run a
Playboy playmate edition of the stunt series "Fear Factor" opposite
the Super Bowl halftime show on Fox, the decision to accept
advertising for liquor after a self-imposed ban and a snafu earlier
this week over Carson Daly's new late-night show, which NBC yanked at
the last minute because the host's contract had yet to be finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a mistake," NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa said
regarding Daly, whose show premiered a day late to reasonably good
ratings in the slot after "Late Night With Conan O'Brien."</TE>
<TE>   As for criticism of "Fear Factor," Zucker said NBC was simply
"having fun," adding, "If you don't want to watch it, there'll be a
marching band or U2 at halftime [on Fox]."</TE>

<HD>Creative Chemistry Cooks for Stallings, Trio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes the most compelling jazz moments occur in completely
unplanned settings--jam sessions, unrehearsed gigs, last-minute
bookings and the like. But they only can happen if the right players
are present, if the creative chemistry between them bubbles and
simmers with the right combination of ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   Which was exactly what took place Tuesday night at Spazio in
Sherman Oaks, when San Francisco singer Mary Stallings performed in
the supper club back room with the trio of pianist Jon Mayer, bassist
Bob Maize and drummer Frank Wilson. When the originally scheduled
pianist, Gerald Wiggins, was unable to make the booking, Mayer filled
in on short notice and the combination clicked almost immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Starting out with a medium-tempo romp through "Exactly Like You,"
Stallings and the Mayer Trio quickly found a compatible groove,
driven by a loping, briskly swinging rhythmic drive that allowed her
to soar freely overhead. Halfway through the tune, Maize answered
Stallings with a crisply melodic solo of his own, articulately
expressed, always remaining in contact with the phrase of the song.</LD>
<TE>   Other, similarly impressive numbers followed, spontaneously chosen
on the spot. ("This is what jazz is really all about," said
Stallings.) "Star Eyes" surfaced with a trace of bossa nova, and Duke
Ellington's classic "I'm Beginning to See the Light" was rendered as
a slow, sensual ballad, illuminating facets of the tune not always
seen in more up-tempo renderings.</TE>
<TE>   It was also an example of how on-the-spot interpretations can
sometimes turn up with pure gold. As "I'm Beginning to See the Light"
kicked off, Mayer initially added some soft chording. But Stallings
immediately realized that the atmosphere she was seeking would be
better served by the sound of voice and bass alone. She signaled
Mayer to drop out, and the first 16 bars were delivered with her
voice arching through Maize's harmonically suggestive bass lines.
When the piano and drums finally entered in the middle portion of the
tune, the effect was marvelously dramatic, an instant, unplanned
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   The slender, dark-haired Stallings, who has been singing since the
'60s with the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie and Cal Tjader
(among many others), has never really received the recognition her
talent warrants. Along with Rene Marie, Karrin Allyson, Kendra Shank
and others, she is part of a rapidly emerging group of female
vocalists who are bringing new, imaginative ideas to a field that was
beginning to sound worn and predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Her impressive appearance at Spazio, which was scheduled to be
followed by a performance on Wednesday night at the Westin Hotel in
Long Beach, clearly set the stage for a longer, more in-depth
Southern California booking.</TE>

<LD>   Creed Has Firm Grip</LD>
<LD>   on Album Charts</LD>
<TE>   Creed's "Weathered" tops the nation's album sales chart for the
seventh consecutive week, the longest hold on the top spot since the
Beatles' "1" anthology began a seven-week No. 1 run in December 2000.
The Creed album sold 166,000 copies last week, bringing its total to
3.75 million, according to SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" is No. 2 on the chart after selling
124,000 copies last week. The rest of the Top 10 is, in order, by
Ludacris, Nickelback, the eighth volume in the "Now That's What I
Call Music!" hit compilation series, Enya, Ja Rule, Pink, Nas and No
Doubt.</TE>
<TE>   With no strong new releases this week, Creed could command the top
spot again next week. But it may be challenged in two weeks, when
Alan Jackson's "Drive" enters the chart. The collection includes the
hit single "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)?"</TE>

<TE>   Ex-'Baywatch' Star Gets 2 Years' Probation</TE>
<TE>   Former "Baywatch" star Yasmine Bleeth was sentenced Wednesday to
two years' probation on a cocaine possession charge.</TE>
<TE>   The actress also must undergo regular drug tests, serve 100 hours
of community service and pay court costs, said Christopher Coyle, a
deputy chief trial attorney for Detroit's Wayne County prosecutor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   As part of an agreement, Bleeth pleaded guilty in November to
possessing fewer than 25 grams of a controlled substance, cocaine,
and to driving while impaired. Another possession charge was
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Bleeth, 33, spent the night of Sept. 12 in jail in Romulus, near
Detroit Metropolitan Airport, after patrol officers found what they
suspected was cocaine in her purse during their investigation of a
car accident. Charges also stemmed from a search of Bleeth's hotel
room.</TE>

<TE>   Billed as the only award recognizing both author and screenwriter,
the honors have been presented annually by the Friends of the USC
Libraries. The winning collaboration will be announced Tuesday and
honored at the 14th annual Scripter Award dinner at USC's Edward L.
Doheny Jr. Memorial Library on March 16.</TE>
<TE>   The nominees are screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith and author Sylvia
Nasar for "A Beautiful Mind"; screenwriters Helen Fielding, Andrew
Davies and Richard Curtis and author Fielding for "Bridget Jones's
Diary"; screenwriters Rob Festinger and Todd Field and author Andre
Dubus for "In the Bedroom"; screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens

<LD>Rock station KROQ-FM (106.7) retained its top-dog status among
Southland radio outlets during the final months of 2001, the Arbitron
ratings service reported Wednesday. It was the third quarter in a row
that KROQ was No. 1.</LD>

summer, hip-hop outlet KPWR-FM (105.9), fell to seventh place in the
latest survey of listeners over the age of 12, conducted between
Sept. 20 and Dec. 12. Its share of audience tumbled by nearly 15%.</LD>
<LD>   With KPWR's plunge, Top 40 station KIIS-FM (102.7) moved into the

<KH>Opera Review</KH>
<HD>The Sound of Success</HD>
<DH>At an otherwise uneven concert, the audience roars its
approval once Domingo introduces his beloved zarzuelas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Upon being named artistic director of Los Angeles Opera three years
ago, Placido Domingo promised zarzuela. Spain's distinctive form of
operetta is popular in Spanish-speaking countries but rarely found in
the U.S. On Tuesday night, the tenor delivered a down payment on his
promise, and now there can be no turning back. I don't think his
audience will let him, nor should they, given the enthusiasm that
energized the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion during the Spanish half of a
program of concert excerpts from Viennese operetta and zarzuela.</LD>
<LD>   The event came about oddly. Originally, the company planned a
Spanish-language version of Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow" this
month to follow its English-language production last month. Whether
for financial reasons or simply because it wasn't a very good idea,
the Spanish "Widow" got dumped early in the season, and a special
single night of zarzuela excerpts was added to replace it. Somewhere
along the line, the program, "An Evening of Zarzuela &amp; Operetta With
Placido Domingo and Friends," became multicultural.</LD>
<TE>   It was hard not to suspect slapdash planning. Domingo has a lot of
friends in high musical places, yet his famed operatic Rolodex seemed
little-used on this occasion. No repertory was announced
beforehand--it came in an insert with the program book. There were no
notes on the musical numbers--nothing in the way of texts or
translations, no descriptions of what was being sung, no information
about composers or works, no dates.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Domingo had hoped to reveal some of the shared qualities
between the operetta of Vienna and that of Madrid and Barcelona.
Certainly, the international craze for Lehar in the early 20th
century reached Spain and influenced the zarzuela of the time. But it
hardly seemed that way in the theater. The first half, mostly Lehar
but framed by excerpts from Johann Strauss' "Die Fledermaus," felt
like something left over from New Year's Eve, the week-old champagne
long gone flat and everyone ready to get on with the new year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the first half, beginning with the "Fledermaus" Overture,
conducted by John DeMain, had little sparkle. Julia Migenes, in an
aria from Emmerich Kalman's "Countess Maritza," fussed weirdly with
her gown, which seemed easier for her to control than her high notes.
The chorus that accompanied her was notable for its inability to
clearly enunciate a single word.</TE>
<TE>   Even Domingo sounded unusually shaky at first. The program
progressed without distinction through well-known Lehar arias, sung
by Domingo (who quickly warmed up), Migenes (who slowly warmed up)
and Charles Castronovo (a young tenor, fresh of voice, but
slight-sounding next to Domingo).</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tola and Castronovo had been exciting on stage in Los
Angeles Opera's "Merry Widow" last month; this time they sang the
"Pavilion" duet in German, flatly reading from the score, the young
Argentine soprano sounding erratic. But then, nothing much
registered. Even DeMain, an effective conductor of the company's
"Widow," was slow and dull, as if he were leading an early rehearsal
(and maybe he was).</TE>
<TE>   When Domingo opened the zarzuela half, however, everything
suddenly changed. The crowd simply erupted with pleasure, and it was
infectious. The conductor was Miguel Roa, music director of the
Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid, and he brought wondrous life to the
orchestra and chorus. Tola sang a popular Spanish song from Pablo
Luna's "El Nino Judio"(The Jewish Lad) with fire and charisma, a
wonderful performance. And there was chemistry in her duets with both
Domingo and Castronovo. Indeed, it felt as if electricity, between
stage and audience, had begun to course through the house.</TE>
<TE>   But in offering little more than the most rudimentary introduction
to zarzuela, the program missed another opportunity. The zarzuela
that is best known and was here highlighted came from early 20th
century, Viennese-influenced works, particularly those by Amadeo
Vives (his famous "Dona Francisquita" deserved more representation
than a single chorus) and Federico Moreno Torroba (whose "Poeta" was
written for Domingo shortly before the composer's death in 1982, and
something from it would have been interesting to hear). But there is
much more to a genre with a history that extends from the Baroque era
to the modern age, and a broader survey would have been welcome.</TE>
<TE>   There is no one more qualified to bring zarzuela to Los Angeles
than Domingo (his parents were zarzuela singers, and he made his
debut in zarzuela). And now he knows that it crosses cultural
boundaries. It was impossible to tell who cheered more loudly
Tuesday, those who have a cultural connection to the form or those
delighted by a new discovery.</TE>

<LD>The wheels of justice turn slowly, and occasionally they can run
right over you. Tonight's edition of "Frontline" focuses on a man it
claims bears the tread marks to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Terence Garner sits in a North Carolina prison cell today facing
at least 30 more years of confinement for a 1997 robbery and shooting
that many familiar with the case say he did not commit. Now, that
being said, most people are aware that prisons have no shortage of
inmates who make the same claim. But "An Ordinary Crime" (KCET, 9
p.m.) presents compelling evidence that Garner may be guilty of
nothing more than having the wrong first name.</LD>
<LD>   The documentary, produced by Ofra Bikel, suggests that Garner,
then only 16, was the victim of a plethora of damning factors that
included mistaken identity, racism and officials eager to cover their
missteps and keep their elected positions.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the shooting victim, a secretary who survived the three
bullets allegedly fired by Garner but lost an eye, remains "120%"
convinced that the right man is behind bars. The presiding judge
likewise has no doubts about the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The program's meticulously assembled story unfolds with an almost
dramatic flair, but it might have been even stronger if it had been
trimmed to an hour from its 90-minute length.</TE>

about the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy
task force--a group that was heavy on energy executives, including
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. Both Rep. Henry A. Waxman
(D-Los Angeles) and the congressional General Accounting Office have
insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed. The White
House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so. But
considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May,
from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air
Act, Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions. The
collapse of Enron Corp., which has led to a federal criminal
investigation, just bolsters the argument.</LD>
<LD>   The links between  administration officials and Enron, starting
with President Bush's own ties to the now-disgraced Lay, are going to
get deserved scrutiny from several congressional committees.
Democrats are gleeful at having such a fat target in a congressional
election year. Yet the White House continues releasing too little,
too late.</LD>
<TE>   In a Jan. 3 letter to Waxman, White House counsel David S.
Addington states that Cheney or members of his energy task force met
six times with Enron executives. Once Cheney met with Lay. All of the
meetings may have been perfectly innocent. But the adamant refusal of
the White House to explain what took place not only creates the
appearance of impropriety but also illuminates a dangerous penchant
for secrecy. Whether it's keeping Congress out of the loop or
preventing historians from examining past presidential papers, this
is too often the administration mind-set.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Waxman's requests may be picayune. He is asking, for
example, about any communication that may have taken place between
Cheney and Lay at a panel discussion on energy matters held at an
American Enterprise Institute forum in Colorado in June. But the bulk
of Waxman's questions are not unreasonable. Given the enormity of the
Enron collapse and the company's seeming role in determining U.S.
energy policy, it seems fair to ask for details about the meetings,
any requests for changes in federal policies by Enron executives,
copies of documents presented and the names of those attending.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's office obviously doesn't see it that way.
White House counsel Addington ends his paltry letter to Waxman by
saying, "It is our hope that submission of [this] information will
help you avoid the waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary
inquiries." This is maximum spin.</TE>
<TE>   Both Congress and the public deserve a full accounting of the
administration's dealings with Enron. The fastest way to avoid
wasting time and taxpayer money is for the White House to come clean.</TE>

<LD>The success so far of the war in Afghanistan raises the question of
the next target of the U.S. campaign against terrorism. The clamor in
some Washington quarters to put a bull's-eye on Iraq fortunately
seems to be subsiding. That is realistic acknowledgment that Baghdad,
although a major regional threat, has not demonstrated global reach.</LD>
<LD>   Countries such as Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Indonesia are thought
to be home to cells of terrorists from Al Qaeda or related groups,
which should make them top areas of interest to Washington. In
addition, Sudan and Yemen have cooperated with the U.S. campaign,
either by sharing information or accepting U.S. intelligence help and
raiding suspected militants' camps. This would probably ease the way
for at least limited operations inside either country.</LD>
<TE>   As for Iraq, despite reports of contacts between members of Al
Qaeda and Iraqi agents before Sept. 11, no one has yet produced
credible evidence of Baghdad's involvement in the New York and
Washington attacks. Many members of the coalition that Washington
successfully assembled for the fight against Afghanistan have warned
they will not sign on for an attack on Iraq. That does not
necessarily rule out unilateral action, but it would greatly raise
the stakes. Another problem is the lack of an internal opposition
force comparable to the Northern Alliance of Afghanistan, which
battled the fanatical Taliban regime for years.</TE>
<TE>   Last week U.S. officials suspended funding to the leading Iraqi
group opposing President Saddam Hussein because it failed to account
for tens of millions of dollars in U.S. aid. Bush administration
officials also told Times correspondent Robin Wright that the
opposition Iraqi National Congress wants Washington to pay for
largely covert operations in Iraq. Since the group has no viable
military operation inside Iraq and questionable support inside and
outside the country, the United States is right to decline until
conditions change.</TE>
<TE>   Congress allocated $97 million to the Iraqi National Congress
under the 1998 Iraqi Liberation Act, but the group has failed to use
most of the money because of management problems; it has failed to
send trainees to the Pentagon for months.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has refused to let U.N. weapons inspectors enter the country
for more than three years, raising reasonable suspicions that it
continues to work on prohibited chemical and biological weapons. Last
July the United States and Britain tried to revise U.N. sanctions to
ease the suffering of ordinary Iraqis. The sanctions date to the 1990
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that launched the Persian Gulf War. But
Russia's veto threat blocked the revision. It's worth asking Russia
now whether it feels differently and is willing to help Washington
revise sanctions, given Moscow's desire for closer relations with
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is a threat that must be contained. But for now this battle
is better suited to the United Nations, especially in the absence  of
credible opposition fighters inside the country.</TE>

<LD>President Bush's nomination of Otto J. Reich to be assistant
secretary of State for Western Hemisphere affairs has caused people
here and abroad to shudder, their memories flooding with images from
the bad old days of the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   Reich's legion of opponents in Congress and Latin America has
asked the president to withdraw his nomination. Bush's response was
to hint that he may bypass Congress by giving a "recess appointment"
to Reich, who was nominated in July and has yet to receive a hearing
in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   To avert this executive end run, Senate Democrats should give
Reich a prompt hearing, then promptly turn down his confirmation.
They'll have no trouble explaining their decision.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, Reich headed the
State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy. His job, paid for by
taxpayers, was to ghostwrite newspaper commentaries and speeches for
the Nicaraguan Contras--who were being funded, in violation of a
congressional ban, by Reich's bosses in the CIA and White House
(remember Oliver North?). Reich harassed and intimidated editors and
reporters viewed as hostile to his Contra crusade.</TE>
<TE>   An independent report by the comptroller general in 1987 found
that Reich's office had engaged in ''prohibited, covert propaganda
activities.'' Meanwhile, Reich had become U.S. ambassador to
Venezuela, a post he is alleged to have used to champion the cause of
Cuban terrorist Orlando Bosch, whose 30 documented offenses include
blasting away with a bazooka at a Polish vessel in Miami's harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Reich next resurfaced as a lobbyist, continuing to raise eyebrows.
While receiving a reported $600,000 fee from the Bacardi liquor
company, for instance, Reich met with Sen. Jesse Helms' office to
discuss the Helms-Burton law. This 1996 measure, which further
tightened the embargo on Cuba, included provisions that greatly
benefited Bacardi.</TE>
<TE>   Such shenanigans have not helped Reich's reputation among
democratic leaders in Latin America. Former Costa Rican President and
Nobel laureate Oscar Arias, who crafted the plan that brought peace
to Central America, has asked Bush to come up with a different
nominee. ''Appointing someone of Reich's ideological stripe and
experience," he argues, "would be a setback for hemispheric
cooperation.''</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who has shown considerable smarts in dealing with Latin
America, should listen.</TE>

<HD>Bush's First Principles: Cut Taxes, Cut Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Father-Son Parallels Begin, and End, on Economy," news
analysis, Jan. 8: Just when I thought your three-part puff pieces
disguised as news analysis of George W. Bush's first year couldn't
get any worse than Monday's installment ("Attacks Redefine Bush
Foreign Policy," Jan. 7), along comes reporter Peter G. Gosselin's
assertion that Bush was a veritable Cassandra.</LD>
<LD>   Says Gosselin, during his campaign, Bush pushed for "tax cuts as
'insurance' against a downturn almost no one at the time saw coming."
Gosselin adds that Bush was proved right about the downturn. That's
like saying someone who plans to drive a car into a wall can predict
a crash.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's consistent talking down of the economy once in office and
his all-purpose solution--the flagrantly self-serving tax cut aimed
at the wealthiest--are in large part responsible for the wipeout of
the surplus (which was vanishing before Sept. 11), the looming budget
deficit and the sad state of our economy today. Despite what Gosselin
purports, many saw this coming.</LD>
<TE>   By the way, Gosselin and readers might remember that from the
start of his campaign Bush has pushed his tax cut as an economic
panacea whatever the state of the economy--good or bad. Gosselin
could have examined the reasons why.</TE>

<TE>   Class warfare: It's always the method employed by liberals when
logic fails. Robert Scheer's attempt in "Let Down His Rich Pals? Over
His Dead Body" (Commentary, Jan. 8) to blame President Bush for the
lack of funds for homeless shelters is pathetic at best and
disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   The economic slowdown began way before Bush became president and,
thanks to Democratic stall tactics, real economic stimulus came too
late. And the deficit is occurring not because of Bush's war against
terrorism but because a Democratic Senate is insisting upon record
levels of government spending.</TE>
<TE>   If Democrats were really insistent upon returning to President
Clinton's so-called "fiscally conservative policies," they'd be
helping trim wasteful government spending instead of approving more
red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Barrett</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, Iowa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My accolades to Scheer for telling it like it is. I drive a pickup
truck that I bought when Bush's father was president, not because I
want to but because I refuse to go into debt just to "invest" in our
economy while the president flies around the country showing mock
concern for Americans suffering from the effects of this recession.</TE>
<TE>   Like his father before him, Bush indeed seems to have no clue what
it is like to have to make painful choices in life, or even to have
no choices at all. Rather, he is an underachiever who manages to be
both arrogant and stupid at the same time. My only consolation will
be to see him bring about his own undoing, and believe me, it will
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher E. Stevens</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times' Jan. 8 editorial about the current Washington economic
rhetoric points out that most American taxpayers simply cannot
understand why the president, Senate and House of Representatives
cannot agree on an economic stimulus plan. American taxpayers know a
"dirty little secret" that the elected politicos in Washington
shudder to hear--cut spending.</TE>
<TE>   An actual 5% to 10% across-the-board cut in spending (defense and
homeland security exempted), a hiring freeze (defense and homeland
security exempted) and Congress forgoing its recent midnight pay
raise will resolve the U.S. government's fiscal problems. As the
economy improves and tax revenues increase, governmental spending can
increase accordingly. The basic problem with this premise is that the
elected politicos never, ever want the American taxpayer to know the
government can exist with less during an economic downturn.</TE>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's cartoon showing Ariel Sharon circled by dead bodies
and asking for a moment of silence is intended to mock Sharon's
desire for no violence during peace talks with the Palestinians,
should they occur (Commentary, Jan. 6). Ramirez misses the point,
which is that if Yasser Arafat is a sponsor of violence, there is no
reason to negotiate with him, since his promise is meaningless; if
Arafat cannot stop the violence, his position as a negotiation
partner is similarly worthless; and if Arafat can do neither of these
things, then Israel must defend itself and there is no basis for
negotiations.</LD>

<TE>   Ramirez's cartoon showing Sharon demanding absolute silence from
the subjugated people of Palestine is one of the most profound,
simple expressions of truth in your paper's history. Any civilized
person must realize that until the brutal occupation and illegal
settling of the "territories" is ended, there is no chance for peace
between Israel and Palestine, or between the U.S. and the Muslim
world.</TE>

This is abundantly clear when you try to get a police car to respond

months. Have they all gone downtown? Have you ever tried to call
downtown for any service? Be prepared to be on hold as they switch

<DL></DL>
<LD>In her attack on the three-strikes law ("A Bad Law With No Reforms in
Sight," Opinion, Jan. 6), Sasha Abramsky notes that "the dirty little
secret of California's three-strikes law is that it has always caught
more petty criminals and repeat nuisances in its net than it has
murderers, kidnappers and rapists." To which I reply, hallelujah!</LD>
<LD>   Who wants to live in a society where petty criminals and repeat
nuisances are on the loose, people who not only committed three (and
probably many more) crimes but were also so unrepentant that they
continued to commit crimes after being incarcerated twice and so
stupid as to be caught and convicted a third time? With these pests
and banes of society put away, the police can devote more resources
to looking for and arresting the murderers, kidnappers and rapists in
our midst.</LD>

<TE>   What a waste! I am a second-striker out on parole and making it. I
spent seven years inside this state's prisons for being convicted of
possessing $5 worth of crack cocaine. So I know a little about waste.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of men and women walk through prison environments each
and every day with only a glimmer of hope, if any, of ever being free
because of the life sentences from three-strikes convictions. Their
lives are being wasted. Millions of dollars, which could go to
schoolbooks and classrooms, go to locking up folks from youths to
geriatrics.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing hasn't been wasted regarding this destructive
situation, and that is the space your newspaper has devoted to
illuminating this horrible darkness that covers California's criminal
justice system. Please don't stop. After all, newspapers can be
recycled. Wouldn't it be great if our citizenry told our politicians
to mirror the value we place on recycling newspapers toward recycling
human beings?</TE>

<LD>Hooray for "It's the People's Coastline" (editorial, Jan. 7), on the
Coastal Conservancy standing up for all of the people. I don't blame
folks for being annoyed at strangers peering at them; maybe one-way
windows are the answer. I do know that if you live by a dairy, expect
smell; if you live by a train, expect noise; if you live by the
mountains, expect coyotes; and if you live by the beach in
California, expect anything.</LD>
<LD>   I do think California should take on the task of providing and
caring for the upkeep of beach stairs and facilities. Aren't we proud
of our state? Volunteers are great, but day-by-day attention to
maintenance and cleanup is asking a lot. Why not let us all designate
an extra dollar of our state taxes to go for beach-access policing
and maintenance? After all, the feds let you give a dollar to
politicians, but they can't give you fish, waves, whales, dolphins,
great views and weather, all free, as can our ocean.</LD>

<TE>   I have a solution. No one is allowed to build on the ocean side of
the Pacific Coast Highway. All building occurs on the inland side
only. Everyone gets to see and use the beach, and no one intrudes on
anyone's privacy. Everybody wins.</TE>

<LD>Re C. Sheldon Thorne's Jan. 5 letter: I have been teaching government
for 35 years and never has a student told me that the Constitution
was ''a racist document written by rich white men.'' I've been
teaching history for the same period and have never had a student say
the westward movement was ''a genocidal march driven by capitalist
greed and a patriarchy intent upon raping the land, slaughtering
natives and exploiting minorities and women.'' (Indeed, I've never
heard words like ''genocidal'' and ''patriarchy'' from a student.)</LD>
<LD>   To suggest to teenagers that America is imperfect, much less
''rotten to the core,'' is enough to arouse them out of their usual
somnolence, prepared to fight. But after 20 years of teaching
English, I will grant that most are ''unable to write a coherent
paragraph.'' Yet if Prof. Thorne asks them plaintively whether they
have ever been taught the glories of American history, its government
or the English language, they will look at him solemnly and say,
''Nooooooooooo!''</LD>
<LD>   But I keep trying.</LD>

<HD>Failure to Follow IMF Advice Led to Crisis</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Not All Economies Fit the IMF Mold," Commentary, Jan. 7: Robert
Kuttner provides another example of efforts to attack market-oriented
economics by distorting the facts concerning the Argentine crisis. Of
course legitimate complaints can be raised about particular policies
advocated by the IMF and the U.S. government, but the Argentine
crisis is not the result of market fundamentalism. It was not
economic liberalization that caused the crisis but Argentina's huge
budget deficits and overvalued currency. The avoidance of both is a
key element of the IMF economic model.</LD>
<LD>   The IMF did not impose Argentina's ill-fated fixed exchange rate.
This was a national decision. It is hard to follow the logic of the
argument that the Argentine tragedy should be seen as discrediting
the IMF, because the failure to follow its advice led to the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas D. Willett</LD>
<TE>   Horton Professor of Economics</TE>
<TE>   Claremont Colleges</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bravo to Kuttner for his wise words about the shortcomings of the
International Monetary Fund. The policies it has imposed on indebted
countries support a corporate agenda at the expense of people and the
environment. Argentina is a fine example of the IMF's failure. The
system is designed to create winners and losers, with a bias in favor
of the banks that make the money and against the working people who
produce the real wealth. It is also a system designed to be unstable,
because it must either grow or collapse. Which country will be next?</TE>
<TE>   Julia Dashe</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kuttner tries to make a case that IMF policies have been the cause
of Argentina's current financial problems. Remarkably, he manages to
write the entire column without mentioning the causes most often
mentioned by Argentines themselves: rampant corruption and bloated
government. Remember that it was protesting Adolfo Rodriguez Saa's
Cabinet as being corrupt that caused people to come out on the
streets. If anything correlates with economic development, it is
clean government.</TE>

<HD>Ralph Richardson, 83; Professor, School Trustee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Richardson, a former UCLA professor who influenced local
education policy during 25 years as a trustee of the Los Angeles city
schools and community colleges, died of emphysema Friday in Seattle.
He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran of education wars began his political career in 1957
when he won a seat on the Los Angeles city school board as a liberal
champion. He served for the next 12 years, a period marked by battles
over the landmark Crawford school desegregation case.</LD>
<LD>   During his final year on the board he was the only member who
favored splitting the city's public elementary and secondary schools
from the community colleges.</LD>
<TE>   In 1973, a few years after the separation was accomplished, he won
the first of two terms as a trustee of the Los Angeles Community
College District.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson taught speech and communications at UCLA for 33 years.
He was an expert on Abraham Lincoln and taught a popular seminar on
Lincoln's addresses for about 15 years, continuing even after his
retirement in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "Listening to Ralph teach Lincoln, you felt you were actually
listening to Lincoln," recalled Jeffrey Cole, a former student who is
now director of UCLA's Center for Communication Policy. "At 6 feet 4
inches, he also had the physical persona. If you were going to
Central Casting to put someone in a stovepipe hat, it would have been
Ralph."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson was known for his eloquence. But he blamed his failure
to communicate for one of the most stinging losses of his political
career: his 1962 defeat for state superintendent of public
instruction by conservative Max Rafferty. He agreed to a record 32
debates with his articulate opponent, but was beaten, he said,
because "[Rafferty] was a better debater."</TE>
<TE>   Born on the family farm near Morehead, Kan., Richardson majored in
English and math at the University of Kansas. He taught high school
and college, then was drafted into the Navy in 1944 and spent the war
years teaching math and radar theory. He earned a master's from Penn
State and a doctorate from Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948 he joined the UCLA faculty and settled in Culver City with
his wife, Mary Lou. She entered politics first, being elected to a
term on the Culver City Council in 1956. She died in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's first campaign came in 1957 when a group of civic
activists persuaded him that he could win a seat on the school board.
He had little money but strong support from teachers. His tenure
endured through the 1960s, a decade of walkouts, hunger strikers
camped outside his office and demands to improve classroom conditions
for black and Latino students.</TE>
<TE>   He was school board president when he decided to run for statewide
office against Rafferty. Their many debates were leavened with humor,
sometimes at Richardson's expense. Richardson mentioned Rafferty's
book "Suffer, Little Children"--a denunciation of progressive
education--so many times that Rafferty at one point thanked his
opponent for helping him sell about 10,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   He remained on the school board until 1969, when he lost his seat
to another conservative, Richard Ferraro. The defeat soured him on
politics until 1973, when he decided to run for the Los Angeles
Community College District board.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, who had helped govern the colleges when they were part
of the city schools, had argued for their separation because he
believed that the colleges were being neglected. "At best, they were
being viewed as high schools with ashtrays," he recalled in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Touting his experience overseeing the colleges, he earned the
support of several conservative trustees and won the election. He
then played a role in building the country's largest community
college system.</TE>
<TE>   He was an early champion of West Los Angeles College, which opened
in the late 1960s when he was still on the city schools board. "He
was the father of West Los Angeles College," said former trustee Rick
Tuttle. Southwest College also opened during Richardson's tenure as
chairman of the board's building committee.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought a tremendous sense of ethics and fair play" to
education politics, said Lindsay Conner, who succeeded Richardson on
the college board. But, weary of budget battles and Sacramento's
increasing control, he decided not to stand for a third term in 1981.
His fellow trustees named him the board's first president-emeritus
when he retired.</TE>
<TE>   He spent his retirement indulging his passion for travel,
flying--he was part owner of three small planes--and bridge. A
longtime resident of the San Fernando Valley, he moved with his wife
to Laguna Hills after leaving politics. He relocated to Seattle in
1998 to be near family members.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson will be buried Saturday in Council Grove, Kan. He is
survived by four children: Riley and Roxanne, both of Seattle;
Randall, of Tucson; and Eric, of Aptos, Calif. He also leaves a
sister, Lucile Tyree, of Topeka, Kan., and seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that any donations be made to the Los Angeles
Community College District/Ralph Richardson Foundation, c/o Jeannette
Gordon, 770 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90017.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial program will be held Feb. 5 at 6:30 p.m. at UCLA. For
more information, call (310) 825-3711.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / GLASS PYRAMID HOUSE</KH>
<HD>Mystic Pyramid Presents Practical Problems</HD>
<DH>The glass structure offers fantastic views, but a heavy
circular door, lots of stairs and poor climate control pose
difficulties for the 70-year-old owner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they say in real estate, Catherine Gallagher has pride of
ownership. Her glass pyramid house is a 3,000-square-foot, New Age
landmark perched on a mountainside in Sierra Madre.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fabulous," she says. "It's unbelievable."</LD>
<LD>   Sunlight fills the interior. The dimensions and celestial
alignment are identical, she says, to those of Egypt's Great Pyramid
of Cheops. Creative touches include a wrought-iron spiral stairway
salvaged from a London sewer and a round front door that resembles an
oversized wagon wheel. It covers an 8-foot portal and opens by being
rolled out of the way.</LD>
<TE>   "As far as I know," says Gallagher, who paid $450,000 for the home
in 1991, "it's the only all-glass pyramid in the world that's a
residence."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is: She isn't quite sure what to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher is 70, plagued by back problems and slowed by a mild
stroke. The pyramid, built on five levels, is such a challenge to
navigate that she leaves it to three Abyssinian cats--they have the
run of the place--while living in the adjacent garage.</TE>
<TE>   The pyramid's carpeting is streaked with stains. The couches and
dining room chairs are cloaked in protective fabric. Gallagher
believes that the pyramid should be something more than a spectacular
cat house, but there are design problems to overcome, things the
original builders failed to address when they constructed the oddity
in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   For example, that front door: It is so heavy that Gallagher can't
open it. The original plan was to install a motor, but it never
happened. Over time, the door has fallen out of alignment, making it
harder to roll. Gallagher isn't sure how to go about fixing it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where we need some experts, people who would know how to
tackle that kind of thing," she says. "It's not the ordinary kind of
repair job."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the matter of climate control. Although the glass is
partially mirrored, the pyramid heats up in the summer like a jungle
greenhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Air-conditioning ducts along the base of the pyramid blow in cool
air, but none of it wafts to the upper levels. The system is so
flawed that Gallagher ignores the air conditioner altogether. For
cooling she relies on an almost equally imperfect mechanism--four
outdoor sprinklers mounted at the pyramid's apex. They send a cascade
of water down the glass, lowering indoor temperatures while adding a
pleasant visual effect.</TE>
<TE>   "In five or 10 minutes you can feel the difference," Gallagher
says. But, alas, the flow at the 40-foot-high apex is not enough to
coat the entire exterior.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably needs to be a series [of sprinklers] around the
apex," she says, "so the water flows down evenly."</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, the system is not equipped to handle water softeners.
Any time Gallagher turns it on--rarely, if she can help it--the glass
spots up like a crystal goblet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrific problem to then go and clean it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Headaches are part of life in extremely unconventional homes. One
reason there are so few pyramids, treehouses and the like is the
inevitable inconvenience they cause, architect Charles Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a totally, completely different lifestyle you have to adapt
to," says Brown, noted for designing Solar Terra, a home on the
outskirts of Riverside built almost completely underground. "Most
people ... want 72 degrees all the time. We want instant cool,
instant heat. With these types of structures, you might have to put a
sweater on."</TE>
<TE>   Such homes are not only a pain to inhabit, they are also a
nightmare to sell. Ron Schuster, the longtime real estate agent who
handled Gallagher's purchase of the pyramid, compares it to the
Skinny House, a well-known landmark in Long Beach that is three
stories tall but less than 10 feet wide. That home is again on the
market--and has been for months.</TE>
<TE>   Each is so bizarre that one cannot possibly interest the typical
home buyer, says Schuster.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be a special person to want to be there," he says.
"You have to be in love with pyramids, in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher is just that. She saw a sales ad in 1990 after the
pyramid's original owners filed for divorce. Her initial
reaction--"It's me!"--pushed aside more practical concerns, including
a floor plan that is eccentric, at best.</TE>
<TE>   The uppermost floor, at the apex, is all but unusable--a round
plywood platform scarcely 10 feet in diameter. This "office" is
accessible only by climbing a wooden ladder from the bedroom beneath
it. The bedroom, in turn, rests atop a cylindrical kitchen fitted
with semicircular black shelves.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen occupies the center of the pyramid at ground level.
Extending to one side are sitting and dining areas commanding
spectacular views of Sierra Madre, Pasadena and Arcadia below. To the
other side is a deeply sunken den with an arch-shaped fireplace and
space for a Jacuzzi, though one was never installed.</TE>
<TE>   Down another flight of stairs is a basement lighted by fluorescent
tubes and skylights--the only place suitably large and private enough
for a master bedroom, according to Schuster.</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher, a consultant to Los Angeles County's Department of
Children and Family Services, has scattered vases of cactus and
succulent plants along the sitting area and completed significant
amounts of new landscaping. She has hired a handyman, Micah McManus,
and begun calling experts to advise her on potential uses of the
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said, 'You could make that a fantastic ...
bed-and-breakfast,' " she says. Another idea is an art gallery. Or a
corporate headquarters. "The pyramid would be a tremendous logo,"
Gallagher says.</TE>
<TE>   McManus, who is 27 and instrumental in Gallagher's planning,
envisions an expansion of the exterior sprinkler system, to make it
the city's greatest fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Gallagher believes that the pyramid's mystical energy may provide
the appropriate guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "There very definitely does seem to be some sort of psychic power
in the pyramid," she says, citing times when a money problem or other
crisis involving the house was solved by an unexpected visitor or
phone call. "In the pyramid, I've been able to think more clearly.
The pyramid seems to know that I am working on it."</TE>

<HD>Wrapping Himself in the Flag, Davis Misses His Chance to
Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Senate leader John Burton was slipped Gov. Gray Davis' State of
the State speech the night before the governor delivered it. Burton
got the raw TelePrompTer version, including stage directions. Little
notations to "look there and bow ... point to them and applaud."</LD>
<LD>   A wily Capitol veteran with unmatched sources, Burton may have
been the first person outside the governor's inner circle to obtain a
coveted copy of the text. Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, for
example, didn't see the speech until one hour before Davis delivered
it Tuesday evening to a joint session of the Legislature.</LD>
<TE>   At any rate, Burton read it and was not impressed. In fact, he
didn't even show up for the governor's address until the very end.
"Hit traffic and fog," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said that almost straight-faced.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, it's the only time I can recall that a
legislative leader was a no-show for a State of the State.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate president pro tem would have participated prominently
in what traditionally is the grandest event of the year in the
Capitol, one that draws all the elected state officials and the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "As a new grandfather," Burton said, "I wasn't going to risk my
life to get to this speech."</TE>
<TE>   Having read the governor's remarks, what did he think? "It was a
speech." Then after a long pause: "That had no relevance to reality
in the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Davis swore off any tax hike to balance a budget that's projected
to be in the hole at least $12 billion. "It made absolutely no sense
to categorically rule out a tax increase," said Burton, an old-school
liberal who has proposed raising income taxes by $2.5 billion on the
wealthiest Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the governor has a political problem not only with
Republicans, who are yapping at him constantly this election year. He
is becoming increasingly estranged from the most powerful legislator
of his own party.</TE>
<TE>   Burton also was put off--as were many legislators privately--by
the governor's repeated introductions of invited guests, most of them
connected to the terrorist attacks or security. All the scripted
bowing, pointing and applauding.</TE>
<TE>   "Who started all that?" asked Burton.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, but royal introductions from the podium became
commonplace after President Reagan introduced Lenny Skutnik at a
State of the Union address 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Skutnik was a government gofer who became a hero when he
instinctively leaped into the icy Potomac to rescue a floundering
woman unable to hold onto a helicopter lifeline. She'd been aboard a
commercial airliner that had plunged into the river during a
blizzard, killing 78.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest,"
Reagan extolled, as only the Great Communicator could.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, such introductions became known as "pulling a
Skutnik," says political consultant Dan Schnur, former spokesman for
Gov. Pete Wilson. While drafting State of the State speeches, Schnur
recalls, "We'd sit around and say, 'We need some Skutniks.'</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis set a new world record for Skutniks."</TE>
<TE>   I counted 10 separate introductions of groups or individuals. That
doesn't include the governor's introduction of his wife and mother,
or the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   It does include three different introductions of six people who
lost family members in the Sept. 11 attacks or during military
action. And that's fine and proper.</TE>
<TE>   But those gestures were cheapened by seven other introductions--of
National Guard members, the chief of an urban rescue team, his own
security advisor, six sheriffs, a highway patrolman, police chief....
Many are backing his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "A little schmaltzy," commented one Assembly Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that Davis is politically vulnerable on the issue of
leadership, largely because of last year's energy mess. Voters
question whether he has the ability or willingness to lead California
on the issues they're most concerned about: the economy, electricity,
education.</TE>
<TE>   Add the state budget--program cuts and taxes--to this list, but
not security. Voters feel that's President Bush's responsibility, not
their governor's.</TE>
<TE>   Given that, Davis missed a good opportunity--his only sure-fire
extended free TV time of the year--to display leadership by talking
more about how he plans to guide California through this recession.</TE>
<TE>   Instead he tried to force-feed TV viewers a sugarcoated version of
his record, while tackily wrapping himself in the flag. I suspect
their eyes alternately glazed and rolled, as Burton's had.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the governor to focus on governing the state--and
let the president worry about "homeland security."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Appeals Ruling on Offshore Drilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Wednesday appealed a federal court ruling
that effectively halted new oil drilling off the California coast by
requiring state officials to review any new exploration plans.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the administration filed lengthy legal arguments after
Gov. Gray Davis rejected a proposed compromise that would have
permitted some new drilling and required the state to help buy out
the claims of other oil companies.</LD>
<LD>   "The Minerals Management Service believes this is the appropriate
action to take," spokeswoman S. Dian Lawhon said. "We want to clarify
that all this is in federal waters. People don't understand that we
are not talking about something smack dab up against the coastline."</LD>
<TE>   At issue is how oil companies might resume long-stalled plans to
drill for oil and natural gas on 36 tracts at least three miles off
the coast of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   California's waters are generally off-limits to new oil drilling
by federal and state moratoriums. But the bans on offshore oil
leasing do not apply to the 36 tracts--each three square miles--that
were leased to oil companies from 1968 to 1984.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 43 federal tracts are producing oil and gas in
coastal waters that stretch from Oxnard to San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   California officials maintain that federal law gives them the
right to review new oil-drilling plans in federal waters off the
state's coastline to make sure they conform with state regulations
protecting air and water quality, sea life and scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. District Court judge agreed in June, effectively blocking
new oil-drilling plans until they pass muster with the California
Coastal Commission and the environmental safeguards outlined in the
state's Coastal Act.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and the Minerals
Management Service asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to
overturn the decision and do it in an expedited matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush administration folks are marching off a gangplank on this
one," said Mary Nichols, California's secretary of resources. "They
are going to lose in the court of appeals, waste a lot of time and
end up with a political loss."</TE>
<TE>   Nichols said there is no support in California for offshore oil
drilling. Even the major oil companies do not rally to the cause
anymore, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are left with a number of smaller companies that bought these
[oil tract] leases when the major companies pulled out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those companies have asked the Bush administration to
consider buying back their oil leases so they can buy tracts in the
Gulf of Mexico, a region where oil drilling is less likely to get
bogged down in environmental red tape.</TE>
<TE>   That idea surfaced in one settlement proposal, officials said, in
which the Bush administration suggested that California use offshore
oil revenues to buy out these long-dormant leases.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government approached us with a possibility for
settlement that wasn't acceptable," said Jamee Jordan Patterson, a
state deputy attorney general. "There really wasn't anything to talk
about."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Krop, chief counsel of the nonprofit Environmental Defense
Center, argues against any kind of "bailout" to retire leases that
she believes should have expired years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A buyout avoids the real issue," she said. "If the state believes
any of the leases don't comply with the state's coastal management
plan, then they expire anyway."</TE>

<HD>UC to Preserve Merced Lands</HD>
<DH>Ecology: University promises to set aside 22,000 acres for
wildlife during construction of its proposed campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to assuage environmental concerns, the University of
California has promised to preserve at least 22,000 acres of
sensitive wetlands during construction of its proposed campus near
Merced.</LD>
<LD>   The university's pledge, contained in a final environmental impact
report to be voted on next week by UC regents, would more than triple
the amount of fragile vernal pool habitat to be set aside and
shielded from destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The pools are shallow bodies of water that are home to the
endangered fairy shrimp.</LD>
<TE>   The UC regents also will consider construction plans for the
Merced campus, the university's 10th, at their Los Angeles meeting
next week.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, construction would begin in May.</TE>
<TE>   But the project remains controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think they've addressed the direct, indirect or
cumulative impacts of this project," said Carol Witham, a biologist
who heads VernalPools.org, a Davis-based environmental group that
opposes the current plans.</TE>
<TE>   "And much of what they're proposing won't work."</TE>
<TE>   The new report calls for the university to preserve 10 acres of
vernal pool habitat for every acre destroyed by construction, up from
the 3-1 ratio proposed in a draft report issued in August.</TE>
<TE>   The university also says it will erect fences and create security
patrols around especially vulnerable pools.</TE>
<TE>   "We're well on the way to preserving a significant portion of the
vernal pool habitat in eastern Merced County," said UC Merced
spokesman James Grant. "It's a major difference."</TE>
<TE>   The changes follow an October hearing at which many agencies and
individuals criticized plans for development of the 2,000-acre campus
northeast of Merced.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier last year, the university sought to quell the criticism by
shifting the site of the campus and a planned adjacent community two
miles south of the original proposal, away from the heart of the
fairy shrimp's habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Still, critics remain dissatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Witham said she considers the plan to have campus security guard
the fairy shrimp's delicate habitat inappropriate and invasive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a ridiculous mitigation strategy," Witham said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that requires that much human intervention is just not
going to work forever."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she said, despite the advanced state of the plans,
university officials should still consider moving the campus farther
south and away from the sensitive area.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Miller, a Merced-based activist who heads a local wildlife
protection group, also said the report did not answer her concerns
about the project's effects on raptors and migratory songbirds.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the university has moved too fast, even making plans
for the May 3 groundbreaking before the federal permitting process is
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is opposing the UC, but we're all opposed to the way the
process has been handled," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Regent Sue Johnson echoed some of those concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who heads the Board of Regents, said she worried that the
accelerated planning aimed at allowing the campus to open as
scheduled in 2004 could lead to lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "My thought is when you're planning anything this important, you
ought to spend as much time as you need to do the best job," Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also said she continues to believe that the campus, the
first to be launched by the University of California in 37 years,
should have been placed closer to an urban center, perhaps in Fresno,
and not in an undeveloped, environmentally sensitive area.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she expects her fellow regents to approve the report
in the meeting, which will be held Jan. 16 and 17 at Covel Commons on
the UCLA campus.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental impact report will be available online at
www.ucmercedplanning.net within a few days.</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Measure Divides Environmentalists</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Critics say bill designed to protect rare
species favors developers. Others call it a step in right direction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill poised for passage in Sacramento as early as today, originally
designed to strengthen protections for wildlife, has divided
environmentalists and prompted criticism that it offers too many
concessions to businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Others say the bill is the most important step in a decade to
protect endangered animals and plants from extinction.</LD>
<LD>   First passed by the Senate and then amended by the Assembly, the
bill returns to the Senate for final review today.</LD>
<TE>   The bill has strong backing from environmental groups, along with
some business interests and the administration of Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the way for a new era of comprehensive land use and
habitat," said state Resources Secretary Mary Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the bill, sponsored by state Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford), argue that it will entice a variety of landowners,
including timber companies and real estate firms, to enter into pacts
to protect rare wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bill, including the Sierra Club, fear that the
current version could free landowners from any responsibilities for
wildlife, even if animals' numbers dwindled as the result of
unexpected events, such as fires, earthquakes or epidemics.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the Sher bill dramatizes the difficulties
government faces in California and nationwide in striking a
compromise between the needs of the economy and fast-disappearing
wildlife, especially on private land.</TE>
<TE>   The state appeared to have struck such a balance in the early
1990s with a nationally touted pilot program in San Diego and Orange
counties that allowed home building to continue while protecting a
rare songbird called the California gnatcatcher. That program allows
participating landowners to destroy rare plants and animals, or their
habitat, if they agree to set aside land or money to protect wildlife
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot program, created by the administration of former Gov.
Pete Wilson, won strong support from Southern California home
builders such as the Irvine Co., which entered into a 75-year
agreement in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The same approach was embraced by the Davis administration, which
hopes to create similar pacts in other areas of the state, such as
Yolo, Contra Costa, Santa Clara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   But the Southern California plans drew criticism from
environmental groups that said the plans promised too much to
developers, and lacked sufficient scientific guidelines to protect
wildlife--especially in legal pacts that could last 50 or 75 years.</TE>
<TE>   Further angering environmental groups was a federal policy of the
Clinton administration known as "no surprises" that promised
participating landowners that even if natural disasters killed more
species than expected, they would not be required to contribute more
money or land.</TE>
<TE>   For landowners, however, that assurance has often been the most
attractive part of the program, because it allows them to do
long-term planning without the specter of new regulatory demands.</TE>
<TE>   Many environmental groups looked to the Sher bill--sponsored by
one of the Legislature's strongest environmental proponents--to
strengthen the protections offered by such plans.</TE>
<TE>   The bill sets forth a long list of new requirements for public
participation, for monitoring of newly created wildlife reserves and
management and conservation goals.</TE>
<TE>   "It clarifies and strengthens both the scientific and legal basis
for the plan," said Nichols, who had publicly expressed doubts about
the existing program when Davis named her resources secretary three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a balance that allows for the protection of species and for
constructive development," said Robert Hight, director of the state
Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is backed by such national groups as Defenders of
Wildlife and, most recently, the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole new level of accountability," said Kim Delfino of
the Defenders of Wildlife's California office.</TE>
<TE>   But amendments to Sher's original language have prompted some
groups to oppose the measure, notably the Sierra Club and the Center
for Biological Diversity, fearing that it echoes the federal "no
surprises" policy.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the bill says the Department of Fish and Game may
grant assurances to landowners, taking into account such facts as how
much is known about the plants and animals affected and the size and
duration of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Though those assurances are drawing criticism from some
environmentalists, others disagree.</TE>
<TE>   The Sher bill offers stronger protections for species than similar
federal conservation plans, said Eric Glitzenstein, a
Washington-based environmental attorney who is leading a legal
challenge to the federal "no surprises" rule. He calls its assurances
to developers "far less draconian and far less environmentally risky"
than the federal rule.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists also criticize the Sher bill's provision
that landowners do not need to set aside reserves, as the Irvine Co.
did, but can substitute what the bill calls "equivalent conservation
of covered species." But it is exactly that language that could help
landowners with so-called working landscapes--land used for timber or
farming, supporters say. For instance, it might allow timber
companies to continue cutting trees while altering harvesting
practices to protect species, supporters say.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Suffers Setback in Battle Over Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Courts: Utility, which is under bankruptcy protection,
tried to move cases alleging injury to the federal level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In a victory for lawsuits spawned by the Erin Brockovich case, a
federal bankruptcy judge has rebuffed an attempt by Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. to halt and move state court cases involving 1,250
people who say they were injured by chromium from the utility's
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The 14 lawsuits, many alleging that the plaintiffs contracted
cancer from contaminated ground water, have been wending their way
through state court, some for years. One was scheduled to go to trial
in July. But the cases were automatically suspended when PG&amp;E filed
for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in April.</LD>
<LD>   Facing $500 million in bankruptcy claims from the plaintiffs, PG&amp;E
wanted to move the cases from San Bernardino County and Los Angeles
to U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The company contended that
the transfer was required by bankruptcy law and said consolidating
the cases made sense.</LD>
<TE>   But the claimants disputed that and said introducing a new set of
courtrooms and judges would be unjust, costly and inefficient.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dennis Montali on Tuesday ruled that the cases should
proceed in state court. Even though the amount of the claims is
great, he said the outcome will not affect PG&amp;E's multibillion-dollar
reorganization plan.</TE>
<TE>   Montali noted that sending 1,250 claims to a federal district
court would "severely and detrimentally" affect that court's docket,
but he declined to speculate whether the cases would be adjudicated
faster in state or federal court.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E spokesman John Nelson said that the judge's decision was
being reviewed and that the company would have no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys said they expect the utility to file an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope we can finally force PG&amp;E to a day of reckoning. They
appealed everything else, so I assume they will this," said Edward
Masry, who represents many of the plaintiffs and who helped win a
$33-million judgment against PG&amp;E in a now-famous 1993 case.</TE>
<TE>   The heroine in the case, onetime file clerk Erin Brockovich, is
now a legal investigator for Masry and is heavily involved in the
current cases. Her role in the 1993 case inspired the movie starring
Academy Award winner Julia Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the plaintiffs are people who lived in Kettleman, Hinckley
and Topock, where the ground water was contaminated with chromium 6
used in PG&amp;E cooling towers.</TE>
<TE>   They claimed that a wide variety of illnesses, including cancer,
resulted from drinking the water. But PG&amp;E argued that the plaintiffs
would be unable to prove that the water was the cause of their
ailments and disputed whether ingesting chromium could cause such
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Masry said the lawsuits would have been delayed if Montali had
moved them to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Some federal court judges would have to reanalyze what state
courts have done for years," he said. "They would have started from
scratch ... and that would have been a tremendous waste of judicial
energy. There are hundreds of thousands of pages of motions."</TE>
<TE>   J. Scott Belden, who represents plaintiffs in three San Bernardino
County cases, said most of the plaintiffs and expert witnesses are in
Southern California. Not only would they have the extra expense of a
trial in San Francisco, he said, but they also would have to conduct
a second trial for PG&amp;E's co-defendants in the Southland.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Criticizes Davis Over Leadership</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bill Jones, who is seeking GOP nomination,
attacks governor on tax issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones accused Gov. Gray Davis of failing to
show leadership in the state's energy crisis and current fiscal
predicament and predicted that the governor will allow substantial
tax increases if he is reelected.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, the only Republican statewide officeholder and a candidate
for his party's gubernatorial nomination, said Davis mismanaged the
energy crisis last year and turned a budget surplus into a projected
$12-billion shortage by overspending.</LD>
<LD>   Although Davis told the Legislature in his State of the State
address Tuesday that he would not advocate any new taxes, Jones said
the governor stopped short of pledging to refuse to sign a budget
with a tax increase.</LD>
<TE>   He said Davis will turn to tax increases to pay for 34,510
positions created in the last three years, representing a 12% average
staffing increase in state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "That is unsustainable under anybody's analysis," Jones told radio
and television news editors here.</TE>
<TE>   He said the governor has failed to balance a single budget in
three years, while the cost of government has grown 36%.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just not true," said Davis campaign spokesman Roger
Salazar. All three budgets, he said, were balanced, and this past
year the state set aside a record $2.6 billion in reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a candidate who was lagging so far behind in his primary
race that he has resorted to name calling instead of offering any
substantive solutions of his own," Salazar said of Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The growth in state government, Salazar said, was in response to
legitimate needs. "Our education, transportation and public safety
systems were in need of attention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis called on lawmakers to close the budget gap with cutbacks,
deferred spending, internal borrowing and "accelerated revenue." He
said he planned a $678-million bond package for public works projects
to stimulate the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones scoffed at that, saying Davis did not provide a plan for
eliminating the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his own plan, Jones said that as governor he would cut
funding for the positions created under Davis and refinance a portion
of the state debt.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who is competing with former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan and businessman Bill Simon in the March 5 primary, is the
poorest of the candidates, with about $1.3 million in his campaign
war chest. So far, he has relied heavily on news media coverage to
sustain his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan on Wednesday reached out to a gay and lesbian advocacy
group, citing his record of supporting domestic partner benefits and
promising to be sensitive to their concerns if elected governor.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm hoping to do, and will do, is to create a Republican
Party that is inclusive--inclusive in our leadership of people like
gays, lesbians and women, and make it a party ... that's not
ideological, but that cares for everybody," Riordan told several
hundred members of Access Now for Gay and Lesbian Equality in West
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   As mayor, Riordan supported domestic partner benefits for city
employees and issued a directive prohibiting workplace discrimination
based on sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would consider expanding the state's domestic benefits
law as governor.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Bay Area police intensify hunt after finding vehicle
linked to Oregon man accused of killing his family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Bay Area authorities continued their manhunt Wednesday for a
suspected Oregon mass murderer whose stolen sport utility vehicle was
found in a parking lot at the international airport here.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents and police are slowly piecing together clues to the
whereabouts of 27-year-old Christian Longo, who has been the subject
of a nationwide search since the bodies of his wife and three
children were found floating in two Oregon coastal inlets last month.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, authorities said, Longo has been on the move, using
several aliases and commandeering a stolen vehicle in Oregon to stay
one step ahead of police. He is wanted on a Lincoln County, Ore.,
warrant on suspicion of aggravated murder and unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators no longer believe that the former self-employed
businessman and coffee-shop employee boarded a plane. Instead, they
suspect that he lived out of the green Dodge Durango that was parked
at the airport before it was impounded by San Francisco police
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Longo has been sighted several times--most recently Friday--and
police said they may be closing in on him. Evidence recovered from
the truck suggests that he is a diabetic, and authorities are
monitoring local clinics and hospitals in case he seeks treatment
here.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, he's going to have to get his insulin someplace,"
said San Francisco Police Sgt. Larry Ratti. "And we hope to be
waiting for him when he does."</TE>
<TE>   Police uncovered a pillow, clothing, a personal computer, food,
wine and restaurant receipts in the stolen Durango--evidence that
Longo used the vehicle as a home base, Ratti said. Investigators this
week received a search warrant to review the computer files.</TE>
<TE>   They also found a list of low-cost San Francisco hostels, which
police are monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   "We think he's low on funds," said Andrew Black, an FBI spokesman
in San Francisco. "So we're trying to keep watch on all the
low-expense shelters."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they think Longo left the truck in the airport
parking lot out of convenience, not to throw police off his trail.</TE>
<TE>   "If he parks on the street, pretty soon somebody is going to spot
him coming and going or call to get the truck towed," Ratti said. "In
the airport parking garage, who's going to notice him for a couple
weeks? It was a good place to hide. The confusion factor we figure
was just icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   Longo is a suspect in the slayings of his wife, Mary Jane, 34, and
three children, Zachary, 4; Sadie Ann, 3; and Madison, 2. No motive
has been established.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Anne Steele, an FBI spokeswoman in Portland, Ore., said Longo
was born in Iowa and lived in Michigan before moving west to the
seaside town of Newport, Ore., in September.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are investigating how Longo--who has a history of debt
and convictions for petty crime--supported his family on his
coffee-house wages.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," Steele said. "He's wanted for a number
of fraud-related crimes back in the Midwest, so that should give some
clue. We think he's funding his present travels through fraud-related
activity."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon authorities asked that anyone with information on Longo's
whereabouts call (541) 265-4949.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area police became involved after more than 100 sightings of
people resembling Longo, who may be using two aliases--Jason Joseph
Fortner and John Thomas Christopher--and three birth dates.</TE>
<TE>   He was allegedly spotted at a San Francisco coffee shop and failed
to show up for a Dec. 28 job interview at a Starbucks. A week later,
he may have applied for a job at a Santa Cruz area Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he was reportedly spotted in Daly City, a San Francisco
suburb near the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the weekend, we looked at airport parking, and, let me tell
you, there are thousands of spaces and several lots there," Ratti
said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators pored over flight logs and area hotel registers on
the chance that Longo might have tried to take a flight out of San
Francisco using an alias. They have reviewed hundreds of hours of
videotape from airport security cameras in the hope of tracking his
movements.</TE>
<TE>   Longo, who is 6-foot-1 and weighs 190 pounds, has blue eyes and
reddish blond hair. He has several surgical scars on his back, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think he's laying pretty low," Black said. "The problem with
collaring this guy is that he's an individual who can blend in pretty
well with the public--better than most criminals. He looks very
ordinary."</TE>

<LD>San Joaquin Valley businesses will need to spend $36 million by 2006
if officials change the federal air-quality designation for the area.</LD>
<LD>   City officials are discussing changing from "severe nonattainment"
of the federal ozone standard to "extreme nonattainment," a category
currently assigned solely to the South Coast Air Basin.</LD>
<LD>   The cost to the valley could be $2 billion in federal
road-building funds as well as fee increases for new and expanding
businesses if the area misses another cleanup deadline, local air
officials said.</LD>

<LD>Officials from Japanese political organizations are visiting Berkeley
to learn about peace politics.</LD>
<LD>   The visitors held a conference Monday with council member Dona
Spring to discuss strategies for Japan's fledgling antiwar movement.</LD>
<LD>   "It is very difficult to receive accurate information about
American antiwar responses," said Kiyoshi Matsuya, of Japan's Rainbow
and Green organization. "That is why we came here, so we can learn
about the American antiwar [movement] and spread this information so
Japanese cities and towns can become just like Berkeley."</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. this week introduced a new
hands-free phone system for cars that will allow drivers to make
calls from their regular cell phones using voice commands.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola's product uses wireless Bluetooth technology. The system
is incorporated into a car kit that includes a speaker, microphone
and control panel and is installed in the dashboard.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-area company said consumers will be able to activate
the phone system by just starting the car.</LD>
<TE>   The activated system automatically will connect to the cell phone,
making hands-free calls possible.</TE>
<TE>   The hands-free car kit system, which is expected to be available
in the second quarter, offers 100 voice activation numbers and is
compatible with phones that don't support voice recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola said it also will introduce a headset incorporating the
Bluetooth technology. The headset is expected to be available in the
first quarter with a suggested retail price of $199.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. sold 1.5 million Xbox video game consoles last year,
according to Robbie Bach, head of the company's games division.</LD>
<LD>   Bach, who made the announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show
this week in Las Vegas, said the company is manufacturing more than
100,000 boxes a week.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Corp., which began selling its PlayStation 2 console in
October 2000, sold about 6.6 million consoles last year, including
nearly 2 million in December, according to company officials.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nintendo Co., which launched its GameCube console three
days after the Nov. 15 Xbox debut, sold 1.2 million units in North
America last year. Nintendo also sold 5 million GameBoy Advance
hand-held units in North America last year.</TE>
<TE>   In response to news reports that have raised questions about
faulty Xboxes, Bach said "less than 1%" sold have been returned for
repairs. Of those, more than 90% were fixed and returned to their
owners within 48 hours, Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the only first-generation machine to experience kinks.</TE>
<TE>   The first batch of original PlayStation consoles, for example,
tended to overheat, forcing some owners to set up fans or refrigerate
the units.</TE>
<TE>   Bach said there are no known systemic problems with Xbox.</TE>

<HD>'Mr. Memory Chip' Upbeat About Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prices of memory chips, which have been on the rebound, may continue
rising, though they probably won't exceed $9 apiece, Samsung
Electronics Co. Director Chin Daeje said.</LD>
<LD>   Memory prices hit lows in 2001, falling below manufacturing costs,
as the economy slid into recession, said Chin, who is known in South
Korea as "Mr. Memory Chip."</LD>
<LD>   Prices have since risen to more than $3 for a 128-megabit dynamic
random access memory chip from less than $1 last year.</LD>
<TE>   "The price will go up," Chin said in an interview at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. "It's already tripled since a couple
of months ago. It will go up more."</TE>
<TE>   Prices are unlikely to triple again because the tendency is for
chip prices to remain low as manufacturers develop cheaper ways to
make semiconductors, he said.</TE>

<HD>Keeping Out the Hackers</HD>
<DH>Best-selling novelist is careful to protect his work from
Internet intruders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When David Baldacci has a book out, you only have to wonder about
nine of the places on the fiction best-seller list. The former lawyer
has written seven thrillers, all of which have been best sellers.
Four hit the No. 1 spot.</LD>
<LD>   His first novel, "Absolute Power," was made into a film starring
Clint Eastwood (who also directed), Gene Hackman, Ed Harris and Laura
Linney. His second, "Total Control" about a missing technology
executive, delved into Internet intrigue and the world of hackers.</LD>
<LD>   Baldacci's most recent book is "Last Man Standing" about a member
of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team who searches for the truth behind an
operation during which his team is caught in an ambush. Baldacci also
has written six original screenplays, none of which have been
produced.</LD>
<TE>   He lives in northern Virginia, outside Washington. His personal
Web site, www.david-baldacci.com, includes a discussion board on
which he answers questions about his work.</TE>
<TE>   DESKTOP: I have a Gateway at home I use for most of my writing. It
has a big screen so that I can see a whole page at a time, and it's
also good for screenwriting. I use Final Draft software for that. It
has a function called "index cards" to plan scenes--you can spread
them all over the screen and move them around.</TE>
<TE>   At the office, my assistant uses a Gateway with a flat LCD screen.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You obviously like the Gateways.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: They have a store near here. I can customize to get just
what we need, which is cheaper in the long run. And their tech
support has been good.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you do a lot of research for your books on the Web?</TE>
<TE>   A: Never on the computers I use for writing. After writing "Total
Control" and learning about hackers, I made sure that the computers I
wrote on were never hooked up to a phone line. I don't care how good
your firewall is, it seems to me that if you can send something out
there, someone can get in the other way.</TE>
<TE>   If someone can hack Microsoft and the Pentagon, they can certainly
hack David Baldacci.</TE>
<TE>   LAPTOP: I use a Dell, one of the Inspiron series, that I take back
and forth from home to the office. I do my writing on it when I am at
the office.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you e-mail your material back and forth to yourself so you
can work on both computers?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh no. It's that hacker thing, again. I use floppies.</TE>
<TE>   Q: We used to think of writers as solitary figures who didn't have
offices, except maybe at home.</TE>
<TE>   A: A couple of years ago I went to the biggest annual writers
conference on Maui, which probably has something to do with it being
the biggest conference. How many writers would show up if it was in
South Dakota?</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I was talking to the other writers and I was the only one
who didn't have an office and a Web site. They said, "What are you
doing, how do you handle it all?"</TE>
<TE>   They were talking about e-mail, requests for speaking engagements,
book tours, all the things that go into having books out there these
days. Like it or not, part of it is about public image. I thought
maybe I needed to be more professional about all that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much e-mail do you get from readers?</TE>
<TE>   A: Hundreds a day. Some of it we can only answer with stock
replies, but my assistant makes sure everyone gets a reply. She gives
me a stack of all the e-mail we get, every day, and if there is an
unusual question or something that is particularly interesting, I
will answer it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does everyone who writes a regular letter also get a reply?</TE>
<TE>   A: You bet. I love it when I get a real letter--it seems so Henry
James-ish.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes I get confused by all the jargon used in e-mail, the
11-letter acronyms that people use, especially kids. Give me words!
For me as a writer who makes his living with words, it's chilling to
see kids are not using them anymore, just this shorthand.</TE>
<TE>   It goes beyond writing--when we think we use words as well. If you
get used to using just quick Internet-speak, it might mean you are
not using words to really think things through.</TE>
<TE>   HAND-HELD: I have a Palm V. My assistant wanted me to get one, but
I said that I would never get around to inputting all the information
I needed. She said, "No problem, that's what HotSync is for." Now I
use it all the time. She uses HotSync to update my schedule.</TE>
<TE>   HOME THEATER: Not so much in our regular house, but we have
another house on a lake that we bought from a guy who was Mr. Gadget.
Everything came with it, including one room that was used just to
house the amps. It has 11 TVs, plus CDs, DVDs, digital this and fiber
that. I have to use instruction manuals just to turn them on. It's
kind of fun.</TE>
<TE>   What we have in the regular house is fine, though. In my
neighborhood we are really into pingpong. The competition is just
ruthless. People bring their own paddles to matches and everything.</TE>
<TE>   I have a game that I play on the big-screen TV to practice. It
comes with a unit that uses a laser to track your paddle as you play
against the computer. It shows a table on the screen and you really
move, just like in a real game. It really hones you.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you do in real pingpong?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm the best in the neighborhood, actually. Some nights I have
to play 50 games. They keep coming at me.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A digital alarm clock that measures body fat. An electronic bracelet
that tracks a child's or teenager's location 24 hours a day. A set of
3-D glasses that can view a lingerie show online.</LD>
<LD>   If you think these products are too weird to be true, you've never
been to the Consumer Electronics Show,the annual trade extravaganza
that brings together thousands of manufacturers, inventors, dreamers
and schemers.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the items on the cavernous display floors of the newly
expanded Las Vegas Convention Center this week belonged to well-known
product categories: flat-screen TVs, MP3 players, car audio systems,
hand-held computers, multi-use watches, vibrating chairs and robot
dogs.</LD>
<TE>   But often the most wonderous, amusing and even disturbing products
were found in small booths, sans the dancers, costumed characters,
autograph-signing celebrities and magicians that the big operators
lavish on their booths. Some of these gadgets already areon the
market, others are scheduled to go on sale in the next few months,
and a few will never make it into the real world of retail.</TE>
<TE>   The show is a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. And
sometimes you get the feeling these products were developed just to
make you smile--either with delight or bemusement over the question:
"What were they thinking?"</TE>
<TE>   Here are some highlights:</TE>
<TE>   Body Mass Index Clock</TE>
<TE>   What time is it? Time to put down that Krispy Kreme.</TE>
<TE>   This digital alarm clock comes from the fertile gadget fields of
Oregon Scientific (www.oregon scientific.com), a company known for
its radio-controlled clocks, home weather stations and sports
products. At 31/4 inches by 31/4 inches, the clock is small enough to
sit innocuously on the nightstand. Only you know its secret function.</TE>
<TE>   Pick it up by the finger holds and the clock emits a tiny
electrical charge to measure body-fat ratio, from 5% to 60%.</TE>
<TE>   The company also introduced its Vibrating Alarm Clock Radio, which
has a disk that slips under a pillow. At wake-up time it vibrates,
allowing you to rise and shine without disturbing your partner. It
also comes with six "sound-soother" modes to lull you to sleep,
including waterfall, birds and ocean waves.</TE>
<TE>   Lasershield Home Security System</TE>
<TE>   Despite the name, this has nothing to do with lasers. "It's a
common term used in the field. People associate it with security,"
said Tony Dohrmann, chief executive of Lasershield Systems (www.laser
shield.net).</TE>
<TE>   The product looks like a miniature of Las Vegas' Luxor pyramid and
won't easily blend into most decors. But it is an ingenious product
that, in some cases, minimizes the need to have a hard-wire security
system installed.</TE>
<TE>   The 8-inch-tall pyramid contains a motion detector that can
monitor about 35 feet of surrounding space. It can be activated with
a key-chain remote (eliminating the keypad that comes with many home
systems) and plugs into a telephone line. If the alarm is triggered,
the monitoring company is notified.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the system, if it works as advertised, is that it
can be picked up and carried to a new abode if you move.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the main unit, which the company hopes to have on the
market in June, will be $150, plus a $15.95 monthly fee for
monitoring. Smaller, satellite units (also pyramids) for additional
rooms will sell for $60.</TE>
<TE>   Ectaco Universal Translator</TE>
<TE>   If we had to pick one product at CES that gave us the most
delight, it would be this hand-held, voice-activated unit that
translates spoken English phrases into Spanish, French or German.</TE>
<TE>   "It has 3,000 phrases, which covers a lot of human conversation
when you are traveling and don't know what you are doing," said
Andrew Ageev, product manager for the unit, which was developed in
St. Petersburg, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration did not start out well. Ageev's colleague,
Davydov Arkadiy, chose Spanish on the unit--which is about the size
of a PDA--and put his mouth near its built-in microphone. He
carefully asked, "Where is the subway map?" After a moment, the
digital screen displayed the line, "Where is the taxi?" and then
pronounced the phrase in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   A second try with the subway question resulted in the phrase, "I
want to cancel this."</TE>
<TE>   But from then on, it was mostly smooth sailing. I said into the
translator, "What size is this?" and it correctly translated the
phrase into Spanish. I asked: "What is the exchange rate?" and it
came up with, "What is the exchange rate for dollars?"</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it works!" Ageev said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   But then I tried, "How much to mail the package?" and it said in
Spanish, "How much to mail a postcard?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, a postcard is nicer," said Ageev, who added that the
translator will eventually recognize 10,000 phrases.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the mistakes, the unit--which allows cancellation of a
translation before it's uttered--was impressive. Distributed by
Ectaco (www.ectaco.com), it's currently available for $250.</TE>
<TE>   GPS Personal Locator for Children</TE>
<TE>   This brightly colored device, which looks like an oversized watch,
contains a global positioning satellite unit that tracks the wearer's
movements. The developer, Wherify Wireless (www.wherify.com),
advertises that the device provides, "peace of mind for parents. Cool
for kids."</TE>
<TE>   The basic unit, scheduled for release in March, costs $300. There
also is a monthly fee of $29.95. At any time, a parent can check on
the Internet to get the exact address or location of the wearer. The
wearer's movements during the day also arerecorded.</TE>
<TE>   The unit comes with a button that activates an alarm at the
monitoring company in emergencies. The alarm also is triggered if the
device is removed without authorization.</TE>
<TE>   Company founder Timothy Neher said the product first would be
marketed for children up to age 12. Future models will be developed
for teenagers and contain additional functions, such as paging, a
cell phone, or the ability to get sports scores, Neher said.</TE>
<TE>   Would he have been happy about wearing one as a teenager? "If I
were a teenage girl, I would probably wear one," he said. "But as a
boy, I would need more functionality."</TE>
<TE>   Poma Wearable Computer</TE>
<TE>   Can't bear to be away from your computer? Come March, you will be
able to wear this fully functional Windows machine developed by
Xybernaut (www.xybernaut.com).</TE>
<TE>   The processing unit, which clips onto your belt, is not much
larger than a PDA. The viewer is a little screen, attached to a
headband, that is positioned over one eye, making you look like a
digital pirate. You also get a device the size of a fat pen that is
your mouse. The entire system will retail for about $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Just how practical is it? It takes some getting used to. After
about 10 minutes of adjustments to the headband, I finally could
comfortably see the screen. The computer is powerful enough to play
back full-motion videos. But do you really want to watch a movie on a
screen that small?</TE>
<TE>   As for word processing, the only way to type is to use an
on-screen keyboard with the pen/mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Using the Poma is a bit disconcerting at first. If you thought
cell phones were dangerous, this device takes it to a whole new
level. "The manual explicitly spells out when this should not be
used," said product manager Adam Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   ProtecTV</TE>
<TE>   This electronic box, which hooks up to a television, blocks
profanity in any broadcast, video or DVD that is closed-captioned
(the captioning goes through the unit a split-second before the
program is on the TV).</TE>
<TE>   "We identified 100 swear words and with their variations, it comes
to about 400 words," said CEO James Gee of ProtecTV (www.
protectv.com).</TE>
<TE>   That seemed like a lot of words. "Take the word, 'hell,'" he
explained. "Some people might not consider it objectionable, but we
included it."</TE>
<TE>   At CES, a ProtecTV box, which has a suggested retail price of $70,
was being demonstrated with the film "Pulp Fiction." It played like a
silent movie.</TE>
<TE>   P5 Glove</TE>
<TE>   Engineers perpetually try to come up with an alternative to the
computer mouse. This attempt is a lightweight, plastic glove that
moves a cursor with hand motions. The developer, Essential Reality
(www.essentialreality.com), said it has many uses but it seems to be
most appropriate for first-person computer games.</TE>
<TE>   You maneuver through a game by waving your hand and fire weapons
with finger movements.</TE>
<TE>   This device, which is scheduled to come out in May, definitely
takes some getting used to. And it is not quite finished. During a
demonstration, the on-screen cursor would sometimes freeze no matter
how frantic my waving.</TE>
<TE>   "We have just a few more kinks to work out," said company official
David Devor.</TE>
<TE>   Hands-free Speakerphone Accessory</TE>
<TE>   I had high hopes for this speaker/microphone by Unwired Technology
(www.unwiredtechnology.com) that clips on a car headrest, providing
hands-free cell phone operation. Unfortunately, the test unit did not
fit the headrest of my Honda Civic, and I couldn't get the speaker to
work.</TE>
<TE>   Much more successful was the Jabra Earboom Winder, which uses an
earplug with a miniature microphone attached. It's so little that it
looked like something Barbie would wear, but the device worked
particularly well--no surprise because Jabra (www.jabra.com) is one
of the leaders in the hands-free cell phone field. What's new about
this unit is that it has a retractable wire, making it easier to keep
the plug from yanking free during use. The price is $35.</TE>
<TE>   TDV 3-D Viewing System</TE>
<TE>   The sun will come up in the morning, Tony Danza will be cast as a
single dad on a TV sitcom, and someone will announce that 3-D is
back.</TE>
<TE>   TVD Technologies (www.TDV3D.com) has just begun selling electronic
3-D glasses for $99 that can be used to view data on its Web site.
The viewable material is limited, but company officials say they plan
to present a beauty pageant, a chess tournament and the first 3-D
lingerie show on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The still images on the site do not bode well for this device.
Viewed through the glasses, pictures were fuzzy.</TE>
<TE>   Old-fashioned Viewmasters provide more satisfying viewing.</TE>
<TE>   I-Spot</TE>
<TE>   The I-Spot consists of a transmitter, docking station and
attachable receivers that go on keys, wallets and other items that
are easily misplaced. Press a button on the transmitter and a
receiver lets out a loud tone, signalling the location of a lost item
within 40 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The transmitter has a built-in alarm to remind you to return it to
the docking station so it doesn't get lost either.</TE>
<TE>   From Digital Innovations (www.digitalinnovations.com), a starter
pack with three receivers sells for $55.</TE>

<HD>The Curse of Complexity</HD>
<DH>The lack of standardization among new devices forces
exasperated users to adapt.</DH>

<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Mike Callaghan thought he'd gotten a good deal when he paid $3,200
for a 61-inch Hitachi digital TV.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly $800 later, however, he's still struggling to make the
thing work the way it did in the showroom.</LD>
<LD>   Callaghan's tale of living-room woe is emblematic of how complex
home entertainment gear has become for consumers. Digital
technologies have brought high fidelity, great choice and convenience
at ever-shrinking prices. But they've also been plagued by
incompatibility, fickleness, dizzying configurations and endless
differences among products.</LD>
<TE>   Electronics manufacturers, which are introducing thousands of new
products this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, say
they're continually working to simplify mat- ters for their
customers. But some industry analysts say the situation will get
worse before it gets better.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many new products on the horizon here that there's a
tremendous amount of ... growing pains that have to be gone through
before you get to the payoff at the end," said analyst Michael
Goodman of the Yankee Group.</TE>
<TE>   Even such basic steps as connecting a receiver to a monitor can be
daunting, as Callaghan recently learned.</TE>
<TE>   In the hands of competing manufacturers, digital technology has
become a tool to create a confounding array of formats and
specifications--and a befuddling lack of standardization.</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan, a Charleston, W. Va., general manager for a
manufactured-housing company, bought the Hitachi TV set for its
finely detailed picture and cinema-quality sound. Like other "high
definition ready" products, though, the Hitachi can't display an HDTV
picture unless it's connected to a digital receiver, which is sold
separately.</TE>
<TE>   After buying an RCA DirecTV receiver for $550, he discovered that
its HDTV plug fit only RCA TVs. He also learned that only one wire
from a satellite dish could connect to the receiver, but he had two
dishes on his roof--one for regular DirecTV programming, the other
for HDTV channels. He found an adapter online to connect the receiver
to the TV, but he's still waiting for the special box he needs to
merge the two dishes into a single feed.</TE>
<TE>   "IQs don't help a lot," Callaghan said of his dilemma. "This is a
different animal."</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan's problems stem from a common shortcoming in the world
of digital home-entertainment gear: the lack of a standard way to
connect devices.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Richard Doherty of the Envisioneering Group, a technology
research and consulting firm, blames legal disputes and corporate
greed for the proliferation of connectors. Companies developed and
patented techniques for linking devices, injecting competition into
an arena where consumers long for a standard approach.</TE>
<TE>   For example, digital TV monitors use at least five incompatible
plugs and sockets to connect to digital receivers. The field probably
will narrow to two types of digital connectors that Hollywood favors,
but the vast majority of the "HDTV ready" models sold today don't
have either.</TE>
<TE>   And every time manufacturers migrate to a new connector for better
fidelity, picture quality or security, consumers with older devices
find themselves, like Callaghan, searching for an adapter.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are trying to make things simpler and easier for
consumers, said Thomson spokesman Dave Arland. "But at the same time,
there's an engineering effort to make yourselves different from
everybody else," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The situation isn't helped by the proliferation of boxes in the
living room, some connecting to the TV set, some to the stereo and
some to both. Many consumers are confounded by the limits that these
boxes place on each other for no apparent reason--a digital satellite
receiver that wipes out a TV's picture-in-picture feature, say, or a
digital cable box that can't change channels on the VCR.</TE>
<TE>   A host of other factors is increasing the complexity of home
entertainment devices.</TE>
<TE>   Incompatible formats</TE>
<TE>   Although digital data boils down to a common language of ones and
zeros, companies have developed dozens of ways to package, compress,
store and transmit that information. Each format has its adherents,
splintering manufacturers into rival camps backing different
standards.</TE>
<TE>   For example, just because a compact disc has songs or a movie on
it, that doesn't mean your CD or DVD player can play it. There are
three types of CDs, six types of DVDs and more than a dozen ways of
encoding music or video on them. Each type may be unrecognizable to a
disc player that doesn't have the right technology.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most common complaint is that manufacturers use a
unique remote control for almost every device they make. Instead of
having a standard set of infrared commands for adjusting the volume
on a TV and changing the channel on a cable box, manufacturers use
different electronic codes even within the same brand.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Cove, a merchandising vice president for Panasonic Consumer
Electronics Co., said things were different in the analog world
because many of those standards were physical or mechanical. "In an
electronic world, you can make standard after standard built on
digital [technology]," Cove said. "It is so easy to create a
standard, or a way of doing things, that the bent is toward creating
[more] standards."</TE>
<TE>   Instability</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast to computers, consumer electronics had a long
history of reliability, said Jakob Nielsen, a consultant who
specializes in how people relate to technology. But those devices
have grown increasingly reliant on software, which is vulnerable to
inexplicable breakdowns and internal conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen said his wireless telephone stopped ringing the other day
for no apparent reason, forcing him to reboot it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just unacceptable that we have that level of problems in
consumer electronics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With digital technology, manufacturers can make their devices
highly customizable and programmable--far more than they could with
analog gear.</TE>
<TE>   For example, while turntables can simply spin records, CD players
can simulate the acoustics of a concert hall or a jazz club, play
tracks at random, fast-forward to specific passages or repeat
selected portions of songs.</TE>
<TE>   Feature overload</TE>
<TE>   Consumers may welcome extra functions. But some products, such as
camcorders and digital cameras, mystify shoppers with a bevy of minor
differences between brands, said Bentley Nelson of Maxtor Corp., a
leading manufacturer of disk drives.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of electronics products are driven by engineers,"
said Nelson, a consumer-electronics marketing executive at Maxtor.
"And engineers know what they can make the products do."</TE>
<TE>   Another explanation, Goodman of the Yankee Group said, is that
many digital product lines are still early in their development. "The
first thing is you add new features and new devices, and this makes
things more complex. As time goes on ... consumer companies begin to
simplify how the devices work and how they connect to each other," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Piling on features once was just as big a problem in the analog
world, Cove of Panasonic said. For instance, he said, "We used to be
able to make hi-fi receivers with 1,000 buttons on them."</TE>
<TE>   Overwhelming choices</TE>
<TE>   Not only have features proliferated, but so have the technologies
used to make home-entertainment products.</TE>
<TE>   Television sets are a good example. In the past, every set was
built around a cathode ray tube. Today, you'll also find plasma,
digital light projection, liquid crystal display and liquid crystal
on silicon.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, consumers can't just compare features, said Bob
Scaglione, a market vice president for Sharp Consumer Electronics.
Now they need to compare technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The same issue applies to programming, where digital cable,
satellite TV and the Internet have created a virtually endless
supply. Although it's a richer world than the one of bygone years,
with three major networks and a few independent stations, it's also a
harder one to navigate.</TE>
<TE>   Cable and satellite operators have improved the situation with
electronic program guides that consumers can search through or
organize by genre. Still, the program guides need to become more
intuitive, learning a user's preferences and describing programs with
video instead of text, said Mark Samuel, a marketing director at
Philips Semiconductors, which supplies microprocessors for set-top
boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-electronics executives say the public wants the extra
features, choices and control that digital brings. "Not everything
can be simple, but if it's logical and it works, I think that's a
better approach than just trying to make it easy," Scaglione said</TE>
<TE>   Besides, more than half the homes in the United States have
computers, and nothing in consumer electronics comes close to the
complexity of a PC, said Larry Gerbrandt, chief content officer for
the Kagan World Media research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We've actually trained a generation of people in how to hook
things up and make software run," Gerbrandt said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look back 20 years from now [at today's devices] and say,
'Piece of cake.'"</TE>
<TE>   For example, Thomson has human-behavior researchers visit
consumers' homes to ask what they want and expect from products.
These sessions have persuaded Thomson to present its products'
features in layers. Users see the basic functions first, but have to
dig deeper to find the advanced ones, said Megan Brown, Thomson's
worldwide manager of user-interface design and research.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some industry executives and analysts warn that products
are about to become significantly more complex. The Next Big Thing in
consumer electronics is hooking stereos, TVs and computers together
in a home network.</TE>
<TE>   Voicing a common sentiment, Samuel of Philips said, "Trying to set
up a home network is about the biggest nightmare you could
undertake."</TE>

<LD>From games to driving to conducting business, there are rules of
engagement.</LD>
<LD>   One place to start is Everyrule.com (www.everyrule.com). It covers
games (for kids, cards, casinos and computers, among others),
etiquette and a few other topics (not quite every rule in the
universe as it suggests).</LD>
<LD>   Each week, the site delves into all sorts of news about rules,
offering updates on changes, interpretations and violations in the
rules of sports and other activities.</LD>
<TE>   On the style front, you can check out the rules of fine writing at
www.bartleby.com/141. There, you'll find the full 1918 version of
"Elements of Style," a handbook for honing English language skills.</TE>
<TE>   One set of rules most L.A. commuters could use a refresher on can
be found at golocalnet.com/st /california/index.html. The online
study guide on road rules covers signage, pavement markings and right
of way. Yes, it is illegal to cross double yellow lines, except when
turning left, say, into a driveway.</TE>
<TE>   With random acts of patriotism popping up all over the country
these days, you might want to check out www.ushistory.org
/betsy/flagetiq.html before putting another American flag anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Before you call a meeting to order you might want to check the
standard for most meetings, Robert's Rules of Order, at www
.constitution.org/rror/rror--00 .htm. It covers how to accept
motions, from incidental to privileged.</TE>
<TE>   Now that you have your meetings in hand, you can deal with what
you're holding. If you find yourself in a tangle because you and
another player differ on the rules of your gin rummy game, you can
call a timeout and click on www.pagat.com.</TE>
<TE>   For one set of rules that could make or break your road trip,
check out www.theshotgunrules .com and members.aol.com/jgruf
/shotgun.html.</TE>
<TE>   Many folks consider sitting in the front passenger seat, or
"riding shotgun," a prize. These lists could help with the fairness
question in claiming that prime seat. (Hey, if someone's hand already
is on the door, it's too late to call shotgun.)</TE>
<TE>   Impress your friends by making the call on every major sport--and
ice hockey. A good place to start is www.eteamz.com. In addition to
the Eteamz site, you can click on nfl.com/randf/index.htm l#rules for
football, www.mlb.com /nasapp/mlb/mlb/baseball_basics
/mlb_basics_foreward.jsp for baseball,
www.basketball.com/nba/rules/index.shtml for basketball and
nhl.com/hockeyu/rule book for hockey.</TE>
<TE>   And Little League Baseball is hardly child's play. Age isn't the
only qualification. Check out www.littleleague.org for the details.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of game playing, there's one social activity for which
the rules seem to constantly change: dating. Check out
www.datingtodumping.com. It offers such insightful mandates as "Never
go whitewater rafting on a first date."</TE>
<TE>   You can find one take on the rules governing male behavior at
www.guyrules.com. For instance, one guy writes that it is not
acceptable to ridicule a buddy for saying "I love you/I love you too"
if his girlfriend is really hot or extremely cool.</TE>

<LD>As games acquire greater cinematic quality, storytelling is
increasingly getting more than passing treatment from developers.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble, of course, is games are interactive. Players get to
choose what they want to do next. In film, the director is in
control.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge for game designers is to create plot, tension and
drama--and still give players control, or at least the illusion of
it. In online games where thousands of people participate, the story
is much like hypertext, where the interaction between players becomes
a never-ending plot. But with single-player games, the designer has
to do the heavy lifting.</LD>
<TE>   One of the first games to successfully spin a compelling yarn was
"Myst," a game in which players must solve the mystery of a father
who has trapped his two treacherous sons in magical "ages." Players
assemble pieces of the story by solving various puzzles without any
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, "Myst" was the exception rather than the rule in
game storytelling, which often offered little more than good guys
going after bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   These days, game companies are hiring seasoned storytellers to
help create scenes, write dialogue, develop characters and inject
nuance and depth into plots.</TE>
<TE>   For the last three years, for example, Electronic Arts Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., has worked with Danny Bilson, the producer of
TV shows "The Flash," "Viper" and "The Sentinel," as well as the
movies "The Rocketeer," "Trancers" and "Zone Troopers."</TE>
<TE>   Bilson, 45, now an Electronic Arts vice president, discussed his
involvement with numerous EA games, including "The Sims," "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Medal of Honor" and "James Bond:
Agent Under Fire."</TE>
<TE>   Question: What exactly do you do for EA?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I focus on dialogue, sound, acting, pace, drama. I find it
very much like the film business in terms of pacing out beats. For
example, working on "Medal of Honor" is similar to laying out action
scenes in a movie. For instance, you have these guys on a bridge.
What do we want them to do? Do we give them a tank? Do we have a boat
come up? Thinking about that's really fun, and it's similar to film
writing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you create drama in a game?</TE>
<TE>   A: Drama is all about moments, memorable moments. Everybody at EA
is focused on memorable moments now. In "Harry Potter," it's the
first time you fly a broomstick. The goal we're all striving for is
creating emotion in the player, whether it's anger, fear, sadness or
joy.</TE>
<TE>   You start with how the game will capture the imagination. Is it a
game I want to play? Is the subject matter sexy? Every game should
have a beginning, a middle and an end. The stuff has to be exciting
and surprising. We're not talking just about the opening, although
the first hour of the game should suck everyone in. Even though not
everyone will finish your game, you should still have a great ending,
because the legend at the end will drive some people to play.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Game designers seem to be enamored with cut scenes. Some games
have cut scenes that last more than half an hour. As a film director
who's also a hard-core gamer, what do you think of those short video
scenes?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't like cut scenes. I don't play a game to watch a movie.
As a player, I hit the button to move on so I don't have to watch
them. How do you make the story compelling? You have moments where
the story turns constantly so you don't get bored. In "Final Fantasy
X" there are a million cut scenes, but at the least the moments are
rolling up on the beach quickly. I define moments as surprises. Let
the stuff happen interactively. The goal should be to eliminate all
cut scenes. The goal is to have the story erupting around you without
interrupting the game play.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are some common mistakes game developers make?</TE>
<TE>   A: One of the things I find is that I'm always pulling stuff out,
not adding stuff. Dealing with game designers who write their own
story, I find that they have the same experience as new
screenwriters. I'm constantly telling them to economize.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing I work on is acting. There's so much bad acting in
the animation. I usually tell people to take half the movement out.
It's hammy. It's bad acting. But that's like directing animation.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Any differences between creating a game and directing a movie?</TE>
<TE>   A: In the movie business, the marketing people come in after the
fact and ask, "How do we sell this?" They don't have creative
influence on the picture itself. In games, they are influencing the
development. You're constantly getting feedback. There's just a lot
of interaction along the way. It's good as long as they don't have
creative control. Feedback is great. Control is scary.</TE>

<HD>HDTVs Still Dark on Digital Inputs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Digital TVs are getting thinner, wider and less expensive. But one
important piece is still missing from several manufacturers' models:
the digital inputs that would enable new forms of entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers previewed the sets they will be introducing this
year at the Consumer Electronics Show this week in Las Vegas. Wide,
flat screens dominated the lineup, even in small monitors aimed at
desktops and kitchens.</LD>
<LD>   Although set makers continue to pump out exotic plasma screens
priced higher than some new cars, suggested retail prices for
high-definition sets and monitors in general continued to fall. For
example, Panasonic showed 40-inch and 45-inch liquid crystal display
monitors that will sell for less than $4,000.</LD>
<TE>   But Panasonic, like many of its competitors, plans to keep
introducing new HDTV sets that lack digital inputs, despite the
commitments that cable and satellite TV operators have made to
digital connectors for their receivers. It is an omission that could
prove important, depending on how far the Hollywood movie and TV
studios go to control digital copying.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the meteoric rise of music- and movie-copying services
on the Internet, the studios want to scramble some premium HDTV
programming in an attempt to limit piracy. This encryption also would
support new business models, such as presenting a pay-per-view sneak
preview of a movie in HDTV for $10 the weekend before it hits
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Under the approach favored by the studios, cable and satellite
operators would transmit scrambled programs through digital
connectors to HDTV sets or monitors, which would unscramble them. The
same programs also could be transmitted through analog connectors but
wouldn't be in high definition. They would have sharper pictures than
today's analog broadcasts but only one-fourth the detail offered by
HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   The cable industry publicly committed more than a year ago to a
two-way digital connection known as FireWire. The satellite industry
has announced its support for DVI, a one-way connector that delivers
uncompressed video to monitors but not digital recorders.</TE>
<TE>   No satellite or cable receivers are on the market yet with digital
outputs, but they are expected to start popping up this year. In
response, some TV manufacturers, including JVC and Thomson Multimedia
(maker of RCA), have committed to putting DVI and, in some cases,
FireWire inputs on all their new HDTV sets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, all Mitsubishi HDTV monitors already in stores have
built-in expansion ports for digital tuners with digital inputs. And
Sony announced last year that it would put FireWire inputs on some
sets this year.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, several other manufacturers, including Philips,
Zenith, Panasonic and Pioneer, say they are not ready to add digital
inputs to all their sets. There is no clear need yet, they say, and
no point in adding a feature if consumers won't use it.</TE>
<TE>   FireWire (also known as an IEEE 1394 connector) can be a costly
addition to a monitor because it uses a compressed signal, which
requires extra circuitry. And the specifications for DVI are still in
flux.</TE>
<TE>   Zenith plans to support FireWire eventually, but "right now the
cost to put in 1394 is pretty steep relative to the cost of the
product," said Richard V. Long, director of product management.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of digital connectors hasn't stopped consumers from
buying HDTVs, said Paul Liao, Panasonic's chief technology officer.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there's a market for those sets, why not sell them?"
he asked.</TE>
<TE>   JVC is putting DVI inputs into all its HDTV models because of the
reassurance it provides consumers, said Michael Holmes, vice
president of color TV.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are already apprehensive about future incompatibilities,
he said, adding: "What we're trying to do is be a little bit ahead of
the curve."</TE>

<HD>Picture Looks Brighter for $200 Digital Cameras</HD>

<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spending $200 for a digital camera used to buy you a toy, or to put
it more generously, a novelty.</LD>
<LD>   For that price, you did get the convenience and cool aspects of
digital photography--the ability to view a picture and download it to
a computer to send in an e-mail--all without visiting a photo
processing store.</LD>
<LD>   Picture quality at that price, however, was not exactly something
Richard Avedon would admire. Cameras generally turned out images
rated at 1 megapixel or less.</LD>
<TE>   That sounds like a lot, but a 1-megapixel picture--meaning the
image consists of a million color dots--lacks depth and becomes a bit
fuzzy and washed-out-looking when blown up to anything much more than
wallet size.</TE>
<TE>   Also, cameras at that price came equipped with undistinguished
lenses that had difficulty capturing moving objects, such as people
acting naturally.</TE>
<TE>   But that was then. Three big names in digital imaging--Fuji,
Hewlett-Packard and Kodak--now have 2-megapixel cameras on the market
that sell for about $200 or less.</TE>
<TE>   That's still not professional level, and most film cameras at the
$200 level can turn out images of superior technical quality when
compared with their digital cousins.</TE>
<TE>   At 2 megapixels, however, the images are certainly respectable. In
a picture I took at a local dog park, even the whiskers on an
adorable mutt, who stood still as long as I held a treat in my hand,
are distinct and sharp. The colors are vibrant and you can easily see
the anticipation in his eyes, even on a print made on a home inkjet
printer.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, these lightweight point-and-shoot digital cameras are
fun.</TE>
<TE>   They each have auto focus, automatic built-in flash, macro mode
for close-up work and a viewing screen that allows you to frame a
shot before clicking the shutter. (When bright or low-light
conditions make using the screen difficult, a built-in optical
viewfinder can be used.)</TE>
<TE>   After taking a shot, you can review it on the screen and decide
whether it's worth saving.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these cameras come with software and cables to transfer
pictures to a computer via a Universal Serial Bus port (almost all
home computers of fairly recent vintage have USB ports).</TE>
<TE>   Once in the computer, pictures can be edited, printed, e-mailed or
posted on Web pages.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the good news. The lenses on these $200 digitals are
still not very flexible. Pictures taken at fairly close range look
best--the only zoom capability is digital and of limited use. Worst
of all, the subjects have to be almost entirely still for the
pictures to be sharp.</TE>
<TE>   And because there is a delay between engaging the shutter and
capturing the image, a moving object can be well out of the frame by
the time the picture is taken.</TE>
<TE>   When the cameras are set for optimal quality, some can hold only
seven pictures with their standard memory.</TE>
<TE>   And the cameras are battery hogs, especially when downloading--you
will want to buy the optional AC adapters available for two of the
three cameras tested.</TE>
<TE>   But even with these drawbacks--the most serious of which is the
difficulty in capturing a decent picture of moving subjects--$200 can
now buy a lot of digital camera.</TE>
<TE>   And the progress that has been made bodes well for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak DX3500</TE>
<TE>   Of the three cameras tested, this one was the winner based on
image quality, versatility and out-of-the-box ease of use. To turn on
the camera, you simply flip a lever on the lens: One click for
regular photography and two for close-ups (9 to 12 inches away from
the subject).</TE>
<TE>   The first time you fire up the camera, the screen will take you
through a sequence to set the date and time (you can choose to have
your pictures time/date stamped).</TE>
<TE>   You also can decide in which resolution you want to shoot: The
"good" setting produces half-megapixel images and "best" produces
2.2-megapixel images.</TE>
<TE>   On the "good" setting, the camera's internal memory can hold about
50 pictures; on "best" it can hold about 12.</TE>
<TE>   Use of an optional 16 megabyte CompactFlash memory card raises the
total capacity to 150 and 36, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The only quibble with the image-quality choices is that it would
be nice to have an in-between selection.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to tell what quality mode you are in--one star appears
on the viewing screen for "good" and two stars for "best." Other
indicators on the screen tell you how many pictures you have left and
battery status.</TE>
<TE>   A nice feature of the DX3500 is that you can lock a picture in the
memory to prevent its accidental erasure (a particularly handy
feature when you are just getting used to the camera and likely--if
you are like me--to erase an image you meant to keep).</TE>
<TE>   The software is easy to install on both the Windows and Macintosh
operating systems and downloading is accomplished by plugging in the
cable and making a few mouse clicks.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak sells an optional docking system that is supposed to make
the transfer easier, but it doesn't seem necessary even for a klutz
like me.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the DX3500 does not have an AC adapter, although
the optional dock doubles as a battery recharger.</TE>
<TE>   Fuji FinePix A201</TE>
<TE>   This camera is not quite as user friendly--it takes a bit longer
to get used to the controls. But photographers who enjoy fiddling
with quality settings will like the options. The A201 takes pictures
at resolutions of 0.3, 1.2 and 2 megapixels.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with the choices for image compression (high compression
allows for more storage but can adversely affect quality), a total of
nine quality settings are available.</TE>
<TE>   The A201 can hold 20 to 122 pictures (depending on the quality
setting) with its standard 16-MB SmartMedia memory card.</TE>
<TE>   The A201's close-up mode is especially good at capturing detailed
shots of objects only 3 inches from the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Although use of this camera's features are not as intuitive as
those on the Kodak, the A201 does offer an erase mode that allows you
to delete several pictures at once.</TE>
<TE>   It took several tries to load the software into a Windows
computer, but it loaded onto a Mac on the first attempt. The software
is perhaps a bit more complicated than necessary, but it has one
especially welcome feature--it saves the photographs from one session
to the next in a handy thumbnail format.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart 318</TE>
<TE>   The PhotoSmart 318 is a comfortable camera--a small strip of
rubber helps provide a nifty, confidence-inspiring grip. A control
dial makes viewing images and choosing modes easy.</TE>
<TE>   The 318 has three quality settings, allowing for the storage of
seven to 113 pictures using just its built-in memory. At its
highest-quality setting, it produces 2.3-megapixel images.</TE>
<TE>   A drawback of this camera is its viewing screen, which had an odd
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the package, it came with a small promotional HP sticker
attached. Removing that sticker damaged part of the coating on the
viewer, which didn't seem to be as well illuminated as those on the
other two cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Although the software is supposed to work on both Windows and
Macintosh machines, we tried for a couple of hours but could not
successfully load it onto an iMac that met the printed requirements
of the program. It worked well in Windows, however.</TE>

<LD>Who says the weather never changes in Los Angeles? With the Davis
Vantage Pro Weather Station, you can track even the most minute
climate shifts.</LD>
<LD>   Understand, of course, that this is not a toy. It is an expensive
tool--the cheap ones cost $500 (www.davisnet.com). The station is for
folks who think home barometers and weather vanes are for kids.</LD>
<LD>   It comes in two parts. First, there's the monitor that you can
keep indoors. Icons show the forecast at a glance--sunny, partly
sunny, cloudy, rain or snow--while a moving ticker-tape display gives
more details.</LD>
<TE>   But there's more. You can create weather graphs (to chart those
good days!), maintain rain logs (to remember the rare atmospheric
bummers in California), set a weather alarm (to let you know that,
yes, the weather is nice outside and you should stop working) and
track sunrises and sunsets.</TE>
<TE>   For improved accuracy, the temperature and humidity sensors are
housed inside a radiation shield. The company says the shield
protects against solar radiation and other sources of reflected heat.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a choice of shields--a "standard" radiation shield,
or the more expensive fan-cooled model that the Hayward, Calif.-based
company swears is more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the outdoor sensor suite, which includes an
anemometer, temperature and humidity sensors and a rain collector.</TE>
<TE>   You can opt for the wired weather system, which connects the two
devices through a standard cable, or the wireless unit, which runs on
solar power.</TE>
<TE>   The wireless model can function with as little as one hour of
sunlight a day. It also allows a broader range of add-ons, including
wireless sensors that track soil moisture, ground temperature and
even leaf wetness.</TE>
<TE>   The wireless unit with the standard shield runs about $600; with
the advanced shield, it costs about $800. The cabled device with the
standard shield retails for $500; with the fan-cooled shield, it's
$650.</TE>

<HD>A Nod to Old Friends</HD>
<DH>'Cel Damage' pays respect to predecessors, whereas 'The
Simpsons Road Rage' merely rips them off. The pet project of 'Jimmy
Neutron' is rescuing adults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON CURTISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it's just
business as usual in the video game industry--truly fresh ideas being
about as rare as a Budweiser in Kandahar.</LD>
<LD>   But two recent games from Electronic Arts--"Cel Damage" and "The
Simpsons Road Rage"--highlight the difference between artful homage
and old-fashioned rip-off.</LD>
<LD>   Both titles borrow heavily from earlier games. "Cel Damage" spins
an elegant twist on its predecessors in the genre of vehicular
combat.</LD>
<TE>   "Road Rage," on the other hand, simply slaps popular characters
into a crass copy of Sega's innovative "Crazy Taxi" series.</TE>
<TE>   "Cel Damage"--available for Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo
GameCube--is straight and simple. Players cruise around in a heavily
armed vehicle in search of other vehicles to ruin.</TE>
<TE>   It's a formula that's worked since 1977, when "Combat" debuted on
the Atari 2600.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the "Twisted Metal" franchise enlivened the genre
with three-dimensional environments and fast-paced action that
spawned a fresh crop of imitators.</TE>
<TE>   In physical play, "Cel Damage" offers very little that other games
before it have not.</TE>
<TE>   But it somehow manages to create a sense of newness with graphics
unlike anything in previous console action games. The game looks like
an interactive cartoon. Players take control of stylized Cadillacs,
Studebakers, bulldozers and hovercrafts to rampage through detailed
landscapes in which Wile E. Coyote would feel right at home.</TE>
<TE>   Players can slice an opponent's car with a giant ax. Or knock it
out of the park with an oversize baseball bat. Or bludgeon it with
humongous boxing gloves. Or put it on ice with a freeze ray. In
short, the cartoon motif carries over to the action, which is every
bit as fun to watch as it is to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Cel Damage" is one of the premiere titles for Xbox, and Microsoft
used the game to highlight the console's processing power in the
months before the launch in November. The game looked great. Most
titles for unreleased consoles do--in large part because they are
shown only in carefully controlled circumstances on custom-built
components.</TE>
<TE>   When they show up on mass-produced boxes subject to whatever abuse
a player can throw at them, however, many games don't look nearly as
nice as they did before release.</TE>
<TE>   "Cel Damage" does. Even with four players duking it out at once in
split-screen mode, the scenery and action never slow down. There is a
single-player mode in "Cel Damage," but why bother? This is the kind
of game to play with friends--the more the merrier.</TE>
<TE>   Not so with "The Simpsons Road Rage"--available for Xbox, GameCube
and Sony PlayStation 2. Although players can compete against a friend
in "Road Rage," it adds little to an already unsatisfying game.</TE>
<TE>   "Road Rage" might as well be called "The Simpsons Star in a Poor
Knockoff of 'Crazy Taxi.'" Sega's "Crazy Taxi" and its sequel put
players behind the wheel of big-city cabs as they scramble for fares.
"Road Rage" puts players behind the wheel as any of several
"Simpsons" characters as they scramble around Springfield for fares.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from a few witty lines, which are looped so often that they
quickly lose their wittiness, "Road Rage" offers nothing that "Crazy
Taxi" does not.</TE>
<TE>   Stick with the original.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"</TE>
<TE>   For a simple side-scrolling platform game, "Jimmy Neutron Boy
Genius" for Game Boy Advance offers a range of diversions in both
single- and multi-player mode.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the Nickelodeon movie of the same name, "Jimmy Neutron"
follows the boy genius as he tries to rescue adults from the clutches
of aliens.</TE>
<TE>   This requires collecting parts for a busted spaceship, flying it
to the alien planet and then doing battle to free the parents.</TE>
<TE>   The nicely detailed levels will hold the interest of most kids,
although some of the repetitive collecting tasks become tedious.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy Neutron" supports up to four players; each person needs to
have a copy of the game and their own Game Boy Advance.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-player games are mainly contests to find the most amount
of stuff before competitors, but there is a racing component that can
be quite fun.</TE>

<DH>Entering the data on ExpensAble is easy enough to do. But
things get tricky when trying to transfer that information to the
desktop.</DH>

<LD>Some people may enjoy tracking business trip expenses by stashing
receipts in their wallet and sorting it out at home. But hand-held
organizers can make the process so much easier.</LD>
<LD>   Palm-compatible devices ship with a built-in expense tracking
program that uploads recorded items to a desktop computer running an
Excel spreadsheet. But the options for Pocket PC users have been
slim.</LD>
<LD>   Just out is a new version of ExpensAble from OneMind Connect. The
$40 software may be the answer for many Pocket PC users. The software
originally was developed under license from the creators of Quicken.
Despite a couple of bugs, the program works well.</LD>
<TE>   ExpensAble uses electronic envelopes into which expenses can be
placed. Entering expenses is easy. Create an envelope for a trip and
enter the amount advanced for expenses. That's it. Drop-down lists
let users select various expenses, such as airfare. Then a second
drop-down list--this one context sensitive--allows users to choose a
specific airline.</TE>
<TE>   Amounts can be entered with a pop-up calculator, which is handy
for adding up elements of a purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Once a report is complete, the envelope is uploaded to a desktop
system via ActiveSync. Or, it can be sent over the Internet to a
secure Web site for management if a user subscribes to an optional
service. Expenses can be edited on the desktop and scans of bills and
receipts can be added as well.</TE>
<TE>   Getting data from the Pocket PC to the desktop, though, can be
problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Documentation for the synchronization process is nonexistent. It
took a call to OneMind's tech support to learn what steps were
necessary and in what order. Unlike many other Pocket PC applications
that sync with desktop programs, the desktop ExpensAble application
has to be closed during synchronization.</TE>
<TE>   The desktop version of ExpensAble links to Quicken and QuickBooks
2002, providing a circuitous route from hand-held to account
software.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the lack of instructions on synchronizing the hand-held
and desktop versions, it would be nice if ExpensAble offered an
alternative exporting method so hand-held data could be used with
other applications directly, either Quicken or a spreadsheet.</TE>
<TE>   This is a necessary program for Pocket PC users, but it needs some
enhancements.</TE>

<LD>Now that's more like it. That was the mood of thousands of Apple fans
who clapped and whooped their way through a two-hour revival
meeting-cum-keynote address Monday by Apple Chief Executive Steve
Jobs at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Jobs gave them something to clap about, introducing the
long-awaited iMac redesign, a sublime (and free) new digital
photography program and a new iBook laptop with a larger screen.</LD>
<LD>   The announcements got the semiannual pilgrimage of the Mac
faithful off to an upbeat start--a stark contrast to last July's
Expo, where a lackluster keynote led to a bleak week.</LD>
<TE>   The new iMac is an attention-grabber. It's futuristic and yet
winsome--a white dome 10 inches in diameter, topped by a chrome bar
that supports a 15-inch flat-panel display. The display pivots like a
desk lamp, making it easy to position the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the iMac's dome are a PowerPC G4 chip (previous iMacs used
the slower G3), an optical drive, two FireWire jacks and three
Universal Serial Bus ports. And a cooling fan: The G4 generates too
much heat for a fan-free design. The iMac's fan is controlled by a
thermostat, so it runs only when needed. Apple says the fan is no
louder than the iMac's hard drive, but I couldn't test that claim on
the noisy show floor.</TE>
<TE>   The new iMac will debut in three flavors. This month, Apple will
ship a $1,799 model with an 800-megahertz G4, 256 megabytes of memory
and a 60-gigabyte hard drive. This model will include Apple's
SuperDrive, which can play and burn CDs and DVDs. Next month, Apple
will deliver a $1,499 model running at 700 MHz and containing a 40 GB
drive and Apple's "combo" optical drive, which plays and burns CDs
and plays (but doesn't burn) DVDs. A $1,299 iMac with a CD burner and
128 MB of memory ships in March.</TE>
<TE>   All three iMacs--indeed, all new Macs produced from this week
on--will start up running Mac OS X. "It's time," said Steve Jobs,
noting that mainstream programs such as Microsoft Office are now
available for OS X. (Microsoft announced a free trial version of
Office X on Monday.) Users who require or prefer the older OS 9 can
still use it--both operating systems come with new Macs.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain hunters may complain that iMac offers no model priced
under $1,000. There's no denying that the revamped iMac is a
relatively costly consumer computer. But the original iMac cost
$1,299--and contained a paltry 233 MHz processor and 32 MB of memory.
With the new iMac, Apple has chosen innovation over economy. Now it
must convince consumers that the iMac's price isn't unreasonable,
given the computer's design and capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Those capabilities include managing and printing digital photos
with Apple's new iPhoto software, which runs on any OS X-based Mac
and is available as a free download from Apple's Web site. iPhoto
streamlines transferring photos from a digital camera, tweaking and
organizing them, and sharing them with others. You can group photos
into albums, publish albums on the Web and order Kodak-produced
photographic prints.</TE>
<TE>   Many digital photography programs provide these features, but none
can match iPhoto's straightforward interface or iPhoto's
book-printing feature, which turns a collection of digital photos
into a hard-bound, linen-covered book. Choose one of iPhoto's six
book designs, click a few buttons and a book will arrive at your door
in about a week, according to Apple. A 10-page book costs $29.99;
each additional page is $3. The samples I saw were beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   As I walked to my hotel, I noticed the magazine stands that dot
San Francisco's sidewalks were already advertising the new iMac. Such
is life during Macworld Expo: The Mac is everywhere, and it's
possible to forget, if only for a moment, that most people use
something else.</TE>

<HD>USB 2.0: The Express Bus Arrives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE J. MAGID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until about four years ago, the only way to attach a peripheral to a
PC was either to install a card in one of the expansion slots or to
plug the device into the serial or parallel port.</LD>
<LD>   The advent of Universal Serial Bus ports made it a lot easier to
connect scanners, printers, keyboards and digital cameras.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike serial and parallel ports, USB allows a virtually limitless
number of devices to connect to a PC.</LD>
<TE>   Optional hubs allow users to add as many as 127 devices to a
single PC. Most PCs have only one parallel port and one or two serial
ports.</TE>
<TE>   The limit of USB, though, is speed.</TE>
<TE>   The original USB specification of 12 megabits per second isn't
really fast enough to run DVD players, CD recorders or even video
cameras at full throttle.</TE>
<TE>   USB 2.0 is a new protocol likely to become a standard by the end
of this year. At 480 Mbps, USB 2.0 is 40 times faster than the USB
1.1 ports on today's machines.</TE>
<TE>   Most users who transfer huge amounts of data between peripherals
and their PCs rely on a FireWire, also known as 1394, port.</TE>
<TE>   At 400 Mbps, FireWire is almost as fast as USB 2.0. But it's not
standard equipment on most PCs. Apple, which invented FireWire,
offers it on all new Macs. PC makers typically install FireWire only
on higher-end consumer systems.</TE>
<TE>   Users could always add a FireWire port to a desktop or notebook
PC, but the fact that something can be added doesn't mean that people
will.</TE>
<TE>   In the history of personal computing, the only devices that
achieved widespread popularity have been those that connect via a
standard interface.</TE>
<TE>   That's why USB devices have done so well.</TE>
<TE>   Once Intel, Apple and all the PC makers standardized the
technology, it was only a matter of time before virtually all the
peripheral makers adopted it as well.</TE>
<TE>   The industry is moving over to USB 2.0, but it won't happen
immediately. Compaq, for example, plans to include USB 2.0 as
standard equipment on desktop systems beginning in March.</TE>
<TE>   USB 2.0's big advantage over FireWire is that it is backward
compatible with USB 1.1. That means new USB 2.0 ports and hubs also
will accept USB 1.1 devices.</TE>
<TE>   It also means that peripherals designed for USB 2.0 also can
connect to the older-style ports, albeit at a slower speed.</TE>
<TE>   I tested this by installing a $70 Belkin 5 Port USB 2.0 PCI Card
in my desktop PC.</TE>
<TE>   Once the card was installed, I connected a $200 USB 2.0- and
1.1-compatible Maxtor 3000LE 40-gigabyte external drive.</TE>
<TE>   In 49 seconds, I copied a 50-MB directory from my internal drive
to the Maxtor.</TE>
<TE>   I then plugged that same drive into my machine's original USB 1.1
port.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer took 4 minutes and 6 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   True, USB 2.0 wasn't 40 times faster, but that's because the drive
itself became the bottleneck rather than the connection between the
drive and the PC.</TE>
<TE>   I plugged the same drive into the USB 1.1 port on my laptop, and
it worked just fine.</TE>
<TE>   An external USB 2.0 drive is a great backup device because if
anything should happen to your PC, you can easily move it to any
other PC--even if it has an older USB port.</TE>
<TE>   Backward compatibility is a win for the industry and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   For vendors, it means being able to build one device that they can
sell to people with older or newer systems and, by providing special
drivers, to Mac users as well.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, it means not having to worry about obsolescence.
Even if without one of the newer ports, a USB 2.0 device bought now
will work on existing machines.</TE>
<TE>   And even better on the next one.</TE>

<HD>Apple's Pricey iMac Design Falls Flat</HD>
<DH>Mac Focus Jim Heid finds much to like in the redesigned
iMac T4</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Count the days. Count the minutes. Count on being blown away,"
screamed Apple Computer Inc.'s Web site in the days leading up to the
Macworld Expo in San Francisco this week.</LD>
<LD>   Given Apple's history of downplaying its announcements, people got
pretty jazzed. Typically, Apple pooh-poohs all the rumors that
circulate leading up the show. Then Steve Jobs rambles for an hour or
so on opening day. Toward the end of the presentation, he says, "Oh,
just one more thing," and whips out something extraordinary, like a
computer that you run with a mouse instead of typing arcane commands
on a keyboard. And the crowd goes wild.</LD>
<LD>   So you can imagine what people were expecting when Apple made a
big deal out of this year's show.</LD>
<TE>   And what was the payoff? A computer you control entirely with your
voice? A box that runs all the gizmos in your household? A new
hand-held?</TE>
<TE>   Um, no. Actually, it was a computer with a flat-panel display.
Mounted on a swivel arm. It's the perfect system ... if you're
confined to a hospital bed. You can set it next to the TV mounted on
a swivel arm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best thing we have ever done," Jobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Huh? Better than the systems that literally revolutionized
computing and became the model for nearly all the user interfaces in
use today?</TE>
<TE>   Mike Detwiler, a computer consultant in Rockville, Md., watched
the presentation, which was simulcast via the Internet. "I thought
this was going to be awesome because historically they've always
undersold it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He kept waiting for the big announcement from Jobs. "I was really
surprised when it was over and nothing really amazing was out there."</TE>
<TE>   The new iMac does continue Apple's tradition of risky, innovative
design, with the arm attached to a white base about the size of an
inverted mixing bowl. Unfortunately, the system bears a striking
resemblance to a desktop lamp.</TE>
<TE>   Apple's gotten some serious mileage out of the way its computers
look and feel, which has attracted new users in sufficient numbers to
keep the company's share of the desktop computer market stable at
just under 5% for the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   But Apple hasn't attracted vast hordes of novice computer users,
and very few people who have started using Microsoft's Windows can
break those chains and walk into Apple's camp.</TE>
<TE>   Today's economic conditions make Apple's "cool design sells
computers" strategy even more problematic. When the fruit-colored,
semitransparent iMac debuted in 1998, it was cute and hip and the
economy was roaring along. People were happy to spend a little bit
more on a computer that was a fashion statement as much as anything
else.</TE>
<TE>   But times have changed. We're all terribly serious now. The new
flat-display iMac is cute and hip to some--others find it clunky and
unattractive--but at a starting price of $1,299, still well above the
price of a speedy, fully loaded Windows box.</TE>
<TE>   That's bad news for Apple. "We've seen a dramatic change in
attitudes this year," said Roger L. Kay, an analyst with IDC. "People
are much more sensitive to price these days."</TE>
<TE>   Apple isn't going to go out of business, even if the lack of
Macworld drama was a misstep. With about 30 million Apple users, the
company can turn a tidy profit from people who need to replace aging
machines.</TE>
<TE>   But the company has no real model for growth. Microsoft's monopoly
power precludes any massive shift away from Windows, so how can Apple
sell more boxes?</TE>
<TE>   The best thing Apple can do is to make computers that seamlessly
integrate into a Windows network.</TE>
<TE>   An Apple machine can indeed become, as Jobs hopes, the central hub
in a digitized home. But today's Apple computers, despite excellent
engineering and a new Unix operating system, can be remarkably
fragile in a Windows environment.</TE>
<TE>   And because we're stuck working in a Windows environment for some
time, that's going to be a problem if you want people to consider
buying an Apple box for the home.</TE>
<TE>   We're rapidly approaching a time when home networks, integrating
our computers, televisions, stereos and other home electronics, will
be linked together.</TE>
<TE>   Apple can play a key role in that development. But not if the
company's computers can't peacefully coexist with Windows
installations, which won't be disappearing anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Kicky new cases for computers aren't going to blow anybody away
these days. What Apple really needs to do is build a box that can
prop up Microsoft's creaky architecture.</TE>

<HD>Switch Box Will Solve DVD Dilemma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I first purchased a simple Philips DVD player. I attached
it to my TV by way of the VCR. All the wiring went from the DVD
player to the VCR. I called Time Warner and this is how it is
supposed to be. It seems to be the only way it works.</LD>
<LD>   I also have a digital cable box. It played and sounded fine,
except that the picture kept getting lighter and darker throughout
the movie.</LD>
<LD>   So, I returned the DVD player and bought a Pioneer DV-C5O3. Guess
what? The same thing keeps happening. Do you have any thoughts as to
why it is doing this? No one seems to know.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: You appear to be a victim of piracy. More specifically,
you're a victim of technology to thwart piracy.</TE>
<TE>   All DVD players sold in this country have a built-in chip that
messes up the picture if you want to record the output of a DVD movie
onto a videocassette tape.</TE>
<TE>   The symptoms you describe--such as the picture getting lighter and
darker--suggest you're tripping over this Macrovision technology.</TE>
<TE>   Because the signal is moving from the DVD through the VCR and then
the TV, the system assumes you're trying to make a copy of the DVD
movie on the VCR.</TE>
<TE>   The free solution is to run the DVD directly into the TV,
bypassing the VCR. If your TV has multiple input jacks--which yours
apparently does not--that's an easy fix.</TE>
<TE>   If not, you can work around this problem by simply unplugging the
VCR from the TV and plugging in the DVD player when you want to watch
a DVD movie and then reversing the process when you're done.</TE>
<TE>   We can't recommend this as a long-term solution, since you can
damage the TV jacks by repeatedly yanking wires off and shoving wires
back on.</TE>
<TE>   The inexpensive solution is to buy an external switch box for
components such as a DVD player, VCR and video game system.</TE>
<TE>   They cost $20 to $50 and consist of a small box with buttons on
the front and jacks in the back for the components.</TE>
<TE>   Connect your components to the switch box and the switch box to
the TV, then push the appropriate button on the switch box to select
which feed is delivered to the TV set.</TE>
<TE>   The switch boxes are widely available at places such as Best Buy
and Fry's, but if you strike out at places like that, check a video
game store.</TE>
<TE>   Most game fanatics have several consoles, so these boxes are quite
popular.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a disability and don't want to jump up and down to
work the switch box, we're partial to an RCA model that will carry
S-Video output and will even work with your remote control to switch
system feeds.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, if you have a couple of beans to spend, consider
resolving this problem with an inexpensive stereo setup.</TE>
<TE>   Many mid- to low-end stereo amplifiers costing $150 or so also
will route video as well as audio.</TE>
<TE>   Plug all your components into the stereo, add some speakers,
connect the TV set, and poof, your problem is solved.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, you get that great stereo sound, which is one reason to
embrace the DVD revolution in home entertainment.</TE>

<LD>The puny remote controls that come standard with TVs are utterly
inadequate to handle all the components in a modern home theater
system. Get up to switch from the radio to the CD player? What, are
you nuts?</LD>
<LD>   A slew of next-generation remotes now on the market can control
all your components and so much more.</LD>
<LD>   These gizmos come with timers, fancy five-way hat switches and
customizable displays. Essentially hand-held computers, the new
remotes can automate tasks, taking couch potatoes into the 21st
century.</LD>
<TE>   Want to research all your choices? Head to www.remotecentral.com,
which offers a complete list of what to look for, how it all works
and how much to spend; cool remotes start at about $100.</TE>

<HD>Disney to Trim Half of Staff at ABC Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. plans to cut about half the staff at its recently
acquired ABC Family channel, according to sources at the company.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 employees at the cable channel's headquarters in
Westwood will be laid off in the next several weeks, said an
executive at ABC Family who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs will cut across all divisions, but will fall more
heavily on administrative and support staff than creative personnel,
the source said. Employees will be summoned to meetings early next
week at which they will be notified of their status. Some will be
transferred to other jobs at Disney.</LD>
<TE>   The action, which was expected, comes nearly three months after
Disney acquired the channel, formerly Fox Family, in a $5.2-billion
deal with News Corp. and Saban Entertainment. To expand the audience
for its shows and generate new advertising revenue for its struggling
ABC television network, Disney is reshaping ABC Family as a secondary
outlet for a range of programs.</TE>
<TE>   And with much of the programming at ABC Family now handled out of
the broadcast television network, Disney doesn't need as many people
to run and market the cable channel. Disney, which operates several
cable channels, including the Disney Channel, SoapNet and ESPN,
already has experienced cable personnel, the executive said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is not alone in cutting back. Other broadcasters and cable
companies have been retrenching. NBC, AOL Time Warner Inc. and MTV
all have laid off hundreds of workers in the last year, owing mainly
to the weak advertising market that has deteriorated further since
the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC executive said the soft ad market was not the reason for
the Family Channel cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the job reductions are just the latest at Disney, which cut
4,000 jobs last year amid a weakening economy and aggressive efforts
to shore up its bottom line. Disney posted a net loss of $158 million
for fiscal 2001, reflecting a drop in attendance at the company's
theme parks, charges related to the closure of the Go.com Internet
portal and a slowdown in advertising at the ABC network.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts weren't surprised by the scale of the cutback at ABC
Family.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anybody who's not had some sort of staff
reduction,'' said Katherine Styponias, with Prudential Securities in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has been hit especially hard by the falloff in advertising
revenue because its ratings already were in decline. In the last two
years, ABC has fallen from No. 1 to No. 4 in the key 18-to-49
demographic sought by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging the need to recharge programming, Disney on Monday
named a new president of entertainment for ABC and announced the
resignation of veteran executive Stu Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said ABC Family will be an important testing ground for new
programs that could find their way onto the sister broadcast network
and give it a platform to cross-promote movies, such as "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone," for which Disney recently acquired the
broadcast rights in a record deal with Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   The channel, which gives Disney an additional 81 million
subscribers in the U.S., features a mix of kids and family programs,
including ABC comedies from the 1990s. ABC Family also continues to
broadcast televangelist Pat Robertson's talk show, "The 700 Club.''</TE>
<TE>   But Disney's efforts to revamp ABC Family have been complicated by
a nasty contract dispute with EchoStar Communications Corp., the
nation's second-largest satellite provider.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is suing EchoStar to keep the satellite provider from
dropping ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar has argued that under an agreement it signed in 1995, it
has the right to drop ABC Family if there is a change in its control.
The company says it needs to make room for additional channels it's
required to carry under federal regulations. EchoStar also has
complained about what it says are fee hikes Disney has levied for its
channels and weak ratings for ABC Family. Though it remains a
low-ranked channel, ABC Family saw an 18% jump in household viewers
in January, Disney said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a Disney executive accused EchoStar of making false
statements and denied that the company has sought any rate increases
for ABC Family beyond those agreed to by EchoStar in 1995. An
EchoStar spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge will review Disney's request for an injunction
Sept. 17.</TE>

<HD>Do You Need Life Insurance?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether you need life insurance, and how much you should buy, depends
on a number of factors. Here's what to consider:</LD>
<LD>   Who needs your income? Life insurance is generally designed to
replace your paycheck should you die. If you have minor children, or
your spouse couldn't cover the mortgage or pay for child care if you
died, you probably need some coverage. Some people also buy insurance
to pay estate taxes so more money can pass to their heirs.</LD>
<LD>   How much coverage do you need? The usual--and grossly
oversimplified--rule of thumb is five to eight times your income. But
you'd be smart to review your actual financial situation so you don't
buy too little or too much. You can find worksheets and articles at
www.latimes.com/money and calculators at www.insure.com.</LD>
<TE>   How much coverage can you afford? Term policies are much cheaper
than cash-value policies that have an investment component. Insurance
experts say you should make sure you can buy enough coverage before
you consider a cash-value policy. You can get quotes for term
policies at several Web sites, including www.quotesmith.com or
www.insweb.com. A chat with an insurance agent can give you some idea
of what cash-value policies will cost.</TE>

<HD>Funny Ads Make Comeback</HD>
<DH>Advertising: Companies that turned serious after Sept. 11
are having fun again as they gear up for the Super Bowl and the
Olympics, but not without discretion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advertisers that primarily limited their messages to somber or
patriotic themes immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are
having some fun again.</LD>
<LD>   Sight gags, word games and other clever twists that turn the human
condition on its head are resurfacing in television advertising, but
advertisers are handling comedy with care rather than risk offending
edgy consumers. Not surprisingly, companies that used humor before
Sept. 11 have taken the lead with the funny-bone approach.</LD>
<LD>   The funny stuff will be apparent during commercial breaks in Fox's
Feb. 3 Super Bowl broadcast--in which marketers are paying close to
$2 million for 30-second spots--and the Winter Olympic Games,
scheduled to start in early February.</LD>
<TE>   Don't expect a return to the zaniness of two years ago, when
cash-rich dot-coms commandeered commercial breaks and acted like
ill-mannered children in a candy store. Super Bowl spots and
commercials being filmed for NBC's Winter Olympics coverage don't
exist in a vacuum. Advertising is colored by what's going on in
society, and advertisers know there are limits on what they can do
for a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "People still have a sense of humor, but there's a carefulness now
because it isn't the time to offend anyone," said Cheryl Berman,
chairwoman and chief creative officer of advertising agency Leo
Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest Airlines, the first airline to return to the airwaves
after Sept. 11, in October also was one of the first to begin running
funny advertising, including an ad in which a guest heads out of town
after being caught rummaging through her host's medicine cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   The decision wasn't without risk because all airlines again pulled
their commercials Nov. 13, after an American Airlines flight crashed
shortly after departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Southwest has run ads created before Sept. 11. Two new
spots in production will air this month.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say they're designed to be fall-on-the-floor-laughing
hilarious," said Eric Webber, spokesman for GSD&amp;M, Southwest's
Austin, Texas-based advertising agency. "But they are lighter. We are
slowly moving back in that [humorous] direction."</TE>
<TE>   Nextel Communications Inc. easily could have decided to promote
the life-saving potential of its cellular telephones that double as
short-range radios. But new commercials that began to air Sunday
instead show "NYPD Blue" star Dennis Franz spoofing celebrities who
pitch products for a living. Subsequent commercials will feature
blues singer B.B. King and golfer John Daly.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel determined in late October that tasteful humor again had a
place in advertising, according to Edward Boches, chief creative
officer for Wenham, Mass.-based Mullen, which creates Nextel's
advertising. Some spots, however, no longer passed muster. Nextel
pulled a commercial that shows an unlucky guy who tumbled down an
elevator shaft because his cell phone provider failed to relay a
message about planned elevator repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is really sensitive to not inadvertently pushing the
wrong button," Boches said. "There's a bunch of things you won't do
humor about, including airlines, conspiracies, foreigners, high-rise
buildings and lots of other obvious things."</TE>
<TE>   Humor also has been a staple for Sprint PCS. In October, the
company enlisted Daryl Dragon and Toni Tennille, better known as the
Captain and Tennille, for a silly spot that began running in
November. The '70s pop stars are seen belting out one of their hit
songs during a football practice after a competitor's cellular
telephone service fumbles the coach's call for "a replacement for
O'Neill."</TE>
<TE>   "What commercials you did see immediately after Sept. 11 were
patriotic, moving and emotional," Tennille said. "I found myself
crying when I turned on the television and saw one of those spots or
heard a piece of music. I finally got to the point where I couldn't
keep crying, and I think a lot of people felt like I did, that it was
time for a little break."</TE>
<TE>   Though advertisers are again incorporating humor, they're studying
scripts to determine what's appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America was filming new spots in New Zealand when the
terrorist attacks occurred. Unlike past spots, the proposed
commercials incorporated humor, so the company had to make a quick
decision on whether to continue shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get out of New Zealand even if we wanted to, so we
went ahead with the shoot," said Frank Sottosanti, a branding and
communications executive with Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America also shot a serious commercial just in case
consumer research determined that funny stuff wasn't appropriate. The
spots that showcase the bank's Winter Olympics sponsorship are the
foundation of a $60-million campaign.</TE>
<TE>   So the company made a "gut check" in October and opted to go ahead
with the funny spots, Sottosanti said. Initially, the spots showed
bumbling bank employees falling out of bobsleds and failing to stop
hockey players from scoring. But after studying post-Sept. 11 market
research, the company changed the endings; now, the bankers gamely
return to the field of play for more action.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America's last-minute tweaking underscores what Leo
Burnett's Berman describes as a "kinder, more sensitive, gentler"
advertising climate prompted by constantly changing consumer
attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Burnett has been monitoring 10,000 Americans to track their
attitudes toward advertising. And, simply put, Americans don't
appreciate such sophomoric spots as the Outpost.com advertising two
years ago that joked about children being attacked by wolves and
gerbils being shot from cannons.</TE>
<TE>   There's no better venue for funny commercials than the Super Bowl
broadcast. Each year, it draws more viewers than any other television
program. And ratings for the early commercial breaks often soar
higher than the game itself.</TE>
<TE>   There's clearly room for reflection during the broadcast. Nike
"hit exactly the right emotional button" during a Super Bowl spot
that aired during the Gulf War, said Kevin L. Keller, a marketing
professor at Dartmouth College. The commercial blended footage of a
lone runner with black-and-white shots of famous faces who've pitched
Nike products.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Coca-Cola Co. came across as the unwanted party
crasher that same year with a preachy commercial that suggested the
wartime sports broadcast wasn't the right venue for jokes. The
soft-drink company's former marketing chief acknowledges that the
sober advertisement was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   There will be plenty of patriotism evident during the Super Bowl
broadcast from New Orleans. Some advertisers undoubtedly will wrap
themselves in the flag too. Although companies usually keep their
Super Bowl ad scripts under wraps, observers say most advertisers
suiting up for the big game will try to make viewers laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., for example, already has invited consumers to
visit its Web site and select which of three funny spots deserves to
be shown during the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers aren't alone in betting that Americans will be ready
for a break Feb. 3. NBC hopes to steal Fox's halftime thunder by
staging its own halftime show on its network. The special edition of
"Fear Factor" featuring Playboy centerfold models will begin the
exact moment Fox unveils its halftime show headlined by rock band U2.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl isn't the only sports-marketing challenge facing
advertising agency creative types. Olympic Games broadcasts typically
are heavy on flag-waving and commercials that bring a tear to
viewers' eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming broadcast won't be any different. NBC spots promoting
the network's coverage feature a newly recorded version of Neil
Diamond's "America."</TE>
<TE>   But Berman cautions that it's usually easier to hit the funny bone
than gently tug at heartstrings.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do that kind of work right now if it doesn't have a
smile, if it doesn't lift you at the end," Berman said. "Laughter and
tears are very close together, and that's where people's heads are
right now."</TE>

<HD>Broadcom Expects to Return to Profitability This Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Broadcom Corp., the largest maker of chips for cable modems, expects
to return to profitability in one of this year's quarters, Chief
Executive Henry Nicholas said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We expect to return to profitability this year, and we are very
optimistic about resuming our 50% annual [sales] growth rate toward
the end of this year," Nicholas said at a Morgan Stanley. investor
conference. Broadcom spokesman Nick Kormeluk said Nicholas meant that
the firm would report earnings for a quarter this year.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom's sales declined in the second and third quarters because
of canceled orders and an inventory glut at customers. Nicholas has
chosen to endure several quarters of losses from operations, betting
that investing in research and development now will pay off later.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of the Irvine-based company rose $2.19, or 4.4%, to close
at $51.43 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They fell 51% last year after a
38% decline in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect Broadcom to report an operating profit in the
fourth quarter of 2002 after six periods of losses, according to the
average analyst estimate from a Thomson Financial/First Call poll.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Broadcom said sales in the fourth quarter of 2001
would rise less than 5% from the previous period, the second straight
increase after two declines.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom is expected to post a fourth-quarter loss of 12 cents a
share, the average estimate from a First Call poll. Seven analysts
forecast revenue, on average, of $221 million, First Call said.</TE>

<HD>Youth Sought Investors While Dodging SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the days immediately leading up to the collapse of his
Internet-based fraud scheme, Cole A. Bartiromo worked furiously to
evade government investigators even as he frantically sought new
investors, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The filings indicate that Bartiromo's "Invest Better 2001" program
may have had more than triple the 1,000 investors the government
initially said were involved. The documents also show that regulators
are investigating whether the 17-year-old may have operated a second
fraudulent Web site.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the
Mission Viejo youth of running a scheme that may have swindled more
than $1 million from investors worldwide between Nov. 1 and about
Dec. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Bartiromo is alleged to have offered huge short-term returns with
no risk, through bets on sports events. Such claims are "the classic
bait of fraudulent schemes such as Ponzi schemes," the SEC charged in
its federal court filing in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo operated the Invest Better 2001 Web site and a separate
message board on the MSN Communities Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   The documents show that, as the government intensified its probe
of Bartiromo's scheme in early December, he sought to evade
investigators by planning to remove his operation from the Internet.
Bartiromo told his investors in a Dec. 9 electronic missive that he
would take his operation "private"--meaning he would communicate with
them only via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the Web site caused [the] government to notice us,"
Bartiromo wrote. "To preserve IB2001, we believe that we must go
completely private."</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 9 letter came as angry investors were barraging Invest
Better 2001 with complaints about not receiving scheduled payouts.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo defended his program as the "real deal" and labeled the
gripes "ridicolous." He termed his investors "pioneers" who are "like
those selected for Noah's Arc."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo promised refunds to some disgruntled investors while
telling others he was transferring their investments to a "2,500%
Christmas Miracle Program" that would net them enormous gains.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, the operation collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The court documents paint a picture of an ambitious scheme in
which Bartiromo went to great lengths to mask his troubles from
investors. When some participants first complained on the MSN board
about missed payments, Bartiromo erased their messages to prevent
others from reading them. He warned investors, "NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS
... OR YOUR GETTIN THROWN OUT JUST LIKE THAT!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo went so far as to block the SEC itself from posting
messages, according to a court declaration by SEC lawyer Alexander
Vasilescu. As the agency filed a lawsuit against Invest Better 2001
on Dec. 13, Vasilescu sought to alert investors on the MSN message
board. But his message was "rejected" by the board's administrator,
apparently Bartiromo.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is investigating whether Bartiromo may have launched
another Web site that appears to be fraudulent, according to a
declaration by SEC attorney Craig Warkol. On Dec. 11, the MSN board
had a posting from a site called goldcapsule.com promising "real"
investment opportunities. The operator of the Invest Better 2001 site
"also may be operating Gold Capsule," Warkol wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney, David Bayless, did not return a call
Wednesday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC appears to have first approached Bartiromo on Nov. 19,
when it sent an e-mail to Invest Better 2001. It received a reply the
next day from "Tom Manning," an online alias that Bartiromo used.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail claimed Invest Better 2001 had "ceased operations" and
that it was composed of only a few "Internet buddies" who had pooled
no more than $5,000, according to Warkol's declaration.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dec. 9 letter to investors, however, Bartiromo claimed to
have 3,300 investors.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently believing that the SEC was checking on the status of
his Web site, Bartiromo expunged it in early December, according to
Warkol's declaration. But on the MSN board, Bartiromo told investors
the site was "taken down" by "hackers," according to Warkol.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have declined to say whether Bartiromo actually placed
sports bets with the money that investors sent to him. But on his Web
site, Bartiromo claimed that "we actually do invest," unlike other
sites that he said were run as "Ponzi schemes."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo told investors that he placed bets on professional and
college sports, and said returns were guaranteed because "we don't
just bet on favorites to win, we bet on really favored teams" that
were unlikely to be upset.</TE>
<TE>   In early December, as his program appeared to be unraveling,
Bartiromo launched a marketing "blitz" to lure newcomers, saying his
program would be "closed" to new investors on Dec. 15, according to
Warkol's declaration. Government regulators said in the court papers
that they were conducting an "expedited" investigation in part
because of the last-ditch attempt to lure investors.</TE>

carrying its Fox Sports regional channels, which it had threatened to
drop.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas, Ergen said the rate increase probably would have been twice as
high had EchoStar not dropped ESPN Classic on Jan. 1. Ergen said Walt
Disney Co., ESPN Classic's owner, had demanded a 15% increase in its
licensing fee.</LD>
<TE>   EchoStar unveiled new products during the electronics show,
including a new line of digital video recorders that can record up to
110 hours of programming.</TE>
<TE>   Ergen spotlighted a satellite dish and receiver that can receive
both EchoStar's Dish Network and DirecTV. He said EchoStar would roll
out the dual units to its customers before its proposed merger with
DirecTV is approved so they could be turned on automatically if the
deal is finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Ergen also discussed the prospects for high-speed Internet access
via satellite, saying EchoStar's own venture in that area, StarBand,
had been largely unsuccessful and probably would have been shut down
if not for the merger proposal.</TE>

<HD>Standards Board to Set Intangible-Assets Rules</HD>
<DH>Accounting: FASB will establish guidelines aimed at giving
creditors, investors clearer picture of a company's worth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY MATHEWSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The panel that sets U.S. accounting rules decided Wednesday to set
standards for valuing brand names, customer lists, patent rights and
other intangible assets.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board also voted to seek public
comment on whether it should set standards for when and how firms
book revenue. Revenue recognition is among the issues that have
brought Xerox Corp. and many other companies under regulatory
scrutiny in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a good idea for the FASB to focus on this," said Walter
Schuetze, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange
Commission. "About 50% of all SEC enforcement cases that involve
financial accounting and reporting involve revenue recognition."</LD>
<TE>   The FASB voted 6-1 to take on the intangibles project. The goal is
to set standards for measuring intangible assets, aimed at giving
investors and creditors more useful information about the true value
of companies' assets.</TE>
<TE>   Intangible assets have become more significant to many companies
in an economy that is increasingly based on services and intellectual
property rather than hard assets such as plants and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds of recent articles, studies and consultants' reports
have decried what they consider accounting's failures to respond to
recent fundamental changes in the economy," an FASB memo on the issue
said. "Some suggest that the important value drivers in the new
economy are largely nonfinancial and that a set of measures could and
should be developed that would allow investors and creditors to
better evaluate and compare them with one another."</TE>
<TE>   The FASB's plan has support from accounting firms such as
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Its opposition includes groups such as the
Institute of Management Accountants, whose members are in-house
corporate accountants.</TE>
<TE>   The IMA said the standards would duplicate information that is
already provided in annual company reports.</TE>
<TE>   Under current accounting rules, intangible assets often are
recognized in financial statements only if they have been acquired by
themselves or as part of a merger. That makes it difficult to compare
the financial statements of a company that has just bought most of
its intangible assets with one that has developed them internally and
never had to report on them.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also voted unanimously to solicit public comment on
whether to set revenue-recognition standards, a move welcomed by
stock analysts' groups such as the Assn. for Investment Management
and Research.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue recognition at Xerox, the largest copier company, has
drawn SEC scrutiny since James Bingham, a former assistant treasurer,
claimed the company might have improperly booked about $140 million
in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone declined to comment on the FASB's
vote.</TE>

<HD>Federal Push on Fuel Cells Faces Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Autos: The development of a new distribution system for
hydrogen would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to
implement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUEJONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Energy Department's alliance with the traditional Big Three auto
makers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop hydrogen
as an energy source for cars and trucks faces daunting infrastructure
hurdles, industry executives and experts say.</LD>
<LD>   While the goal of the partnership announced Wednesday is to
eliminate America's reliance on the internal-combustion engine and
its dependence on unstable countries for oil, it would require a vast
overhaul of the nation's fuel infrastructure so drivers can buy
hydrogen as easily as they buy gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   David Garman, assistant secretary for energy efficiency and
renewable energy, acknowledged that 30% to 40% of gas stations, or up
to 70,000 locations, would have to be retrofitted to offer hydrogen
to make fuel cells viable.</LD>
<TE>   Technology exists to extract pure hydrogen from water, but it
takes energy to carry out that process, so unless the energy comes
from a renewable source, such as hydropower or solar power, the
process could consume more energy than it saves.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists say the plan, called "Freedom CAR" for
cooperative automotive research, does not do enough soon enough and
lacks tangible goals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Freedom CAR is pointed in the right direction, but by itself
it's going nowhere," said David Hawkins, director of the
Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans will buy 150 million vehicles during the next decade,
and Freedom CAR won't do anything to reduce the amount of oil they
will consume," he said. "We can't afford another research program
that just gives billions of dollars in subsidies to the automobile
industry with no commitment from them to actually produce advanced
vehicles for consumers to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom CAR will work to develop cars using hydrogen-powered fuel
cells, as well as a nationwide system to distribute hydrogen in an
efficient and inexpensive way, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term result of this cooperative effort will be cars and
trucks that are more efficient, cheaper to operate, pollution-free
and competitive in the showroom," Abraham said at a news conference
with senior Detroit auto executives at the North American
International Auto Show here.</TE>
<TE>   "For our security, it means we will no longer have to depend on
unstable regions of the world for our energy supply," amounting to
importing 10 million barrels of oil a day, Abraham said. "And
families will no longer have to factor in the cost of gasoline in
their vacations."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom CAR replaces the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, the push for an 80-mile-per-gallon car strongly supported
by former President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturers have taken leadership in
so-called hybrid vehicles that pair an electric motor and gasoline
engine to produce high-mileage cars.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity to run electric
motors, with the only byproduct heat and water. Many fuel cells
developed so far run on hydrocarbons such as gasoline, methanol or
natural gas, an imperfect solution because that process generates
carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Pure hydrogen as a fuel source is the ideal because no greenhouse
gases are produced, but the main difficulty is in delivering hydrogen
to customers because fuel-cell vehicles will have little widespread
use if drivers can't easily replenish their supplies of hydrogen.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration scrapped PNGV because it wasn't moving a
car to market. Fuel-economy technologies were developed but not at an
acceptable cost.</TE>
<TE>   "A car that gets 80 mpg means nothing in the real world if no one
can afford it," General Motors Corp. Chairman Jack Smith said at the
news conference. With Freedom CAR, he said, "we're intensifying our
focus on fuel cells. We look forward to the day when vehicles like
[GM's fuel-cell concept car] replace gasoline-powered cars."</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler Vehicle Uses Different Fuel</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche of DaimlerChrysler's U.S.-based
Chrysler Group noted that Chrysler last month showed a minivan that
runs on a fuel cell powered by sodium boro-hydride, a compound
related to borax, the natural substance used in laundry soap. "We are
seeking what is the best fuel, and this is not a question that one
auto maker can answer alone."</TE>
<TE>   William Boddie, Ford Motor Co.'s vice president for global core
engineering, echoed the need to choose among hydrogen, hydrocarbons
or borax compounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Our future success lies in getting the right fuel with maximum
benefits for the customer, the environment and society: affordable
vehicles and an affordable source of fuel," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 budget for the project as it migrates from PNGV to
Freedom CAR is $127 million. Abraham and the auto executives would
not discuss its funding level for next year, saying it will be
determined when President Bush submits his budget next month. And
they did not offer any timetable for bringing fuel-cell cars to
market.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Mark, director of the clean vehicles program with the Union
of Concerned Scientists in Berkeley, hailed the focus on fuel cells
and on hydrogen, but said the level of government funding was only a
tiny fraction of what would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that government investment can make a difference
because it's good seed money," Mark said, but building a nationwide
hydrogen infrastructure would cost $50 million to $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds us that we're not going to transform our
transportation with R&amp;D money."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the need for a hydrogen source and infrastructure is
an important first move, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   'Chicken-and-Egg' Problem Exists</TE>
<TE>   "But we have a real chicken-and-egg problem," said Phil Gott,
director of automotive consulting at DRI-WEFA in Lexington, Mass. "If
there is no technology available to use as fuel, then why should
anyone invest in infrastructure? And if there's no infrastructure,
why should anyone invest in fuel technology?"</TE>
<TE>   An infrastructure need not cover 100% of gasoline stations to be
effective, however. Diesel fuel, for instance, isn't available at
every location.</TE>
<TE>   "You may have to go an extra two blocks. Is that a deal killer?
Probably not," said Thad Malesh, director of alternative power
technologies at J.D. Power &amp; Associates in Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Winners in a hydrogen economy would include fuel-cell and hydrogen
supplier companies in the long run. Shares of several fuel-cell
developers skyrocketed Tuesday in advance of Freedom CAR's
announcement, but they shed most of their gains Wednesday after the
plan failed to provide specifics and Abraham warned it would take
decades for viable fuel-cell vehicles to come to market for
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But transportation companies and government fleets would be early
beneficiaries of fuel-cell vehicles. Buses and even locomotives are
easier to equip with fuel cells, as they operate in "closed loop"
conditions, in which a single fueling station would be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Big Oil is certainly eyeing the directions auto manufacturers are
going with fuel cells but claims to welcome the technology.
ExxonMobil, for instance, is working with GM on developing
gasoline-powered fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil companies are big investors these days. They could use their
petroleum for things other than burning to run cars," said David
Eisenhaure, chief executive of SatCon in Cambridge, Mass., which
makes electronic power systems for fuel cells. "They could make
carbon fiber, plastics or clothing out of it, which are higher-profit
products than gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the oil companies are on board or not, Detroit has seized
upon fuel cells as having the potential to change the way U.S.
consumers think of cars and driving.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to say Chevrolet was the heartbeat of America," said
Byron McCormack, head of GM's fuel-cell program. "Well, this is a
heart transplant."</TE>

<HD>Geron Settles Suit on Embryo Stem Use</HD>
<DH>Biotechnology: A new licensing agreement gives the company
exclusive rights to three cell types.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geron Corp. said it confirmed its right to use stem cells derived
from human embryos for some commercial products, settling a lawsuit
filed by a university foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The biotechnology company and the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation said they signed a new licensing agreement to develop
commercial uses for some stem cell types for which President Bush
agreed to provide federal research funds. The foundation said the new
agreement allows "wide public access to Wisconsin's stem cell lines."</LD>
<LD>   The new agreement gives Geron exclusive rights to develop products
from nerve, heart and pancreatic cell types and a nonexclusive right
to develop products from blood, bone and cartilage types.</LD>
<TE>   "Geron has the rights we need to pursue our product development
strategies, which are therapies for neurological disorders, heart
disease and diabetes--these are large markets and our top
priorities," Geron Chief Executive Thomas B. Okarma said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Menlo Park, Calif.-based Geron plans to develop products based on
the other three cell types for use in treating arthritis and
osteoporosis and in transfusion medicine, Okarma said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation had sought to bar Geron from exercising exclusive
rights to all six cell types, and accused the company of refusing to
sign agreements with companies or researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Geron shares fell 26 cents to $8.68 on Nasdaq. They've fallen by
more than a third since the suit was announced Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Research rights will be given to other academic and government
researchers, as long as they pay a $5,000 administrative fee, said
foundation spokesman Andy Cohn. If the researchers want to develop
products, licenses must be sought from Geron on the blood, bone or
cartilage types or from the foundation for other cell types not
included in the Geron licensing agreement, Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   Derived from days-old embryos, stem cells are believed to hold the
key to cures for such diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's. Because they are blank, they can develop into just about
any cell made by the human body.</TE>

<HD>Lender Settles in State Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Finances: Household International agrees to pay $12 million
over allegations its companies routinely overcharged Californians on
administrative fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parent corporation of Household and Beneficial finance companies
has agreed to pay about $12 million to settle regulators' allegations
that it routinely overcharged Californians on small loans, Department
of Corporations officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators initially sought $8.5 million in penalties from
Household International Corp., but the company wound up paying $8.9
million on Monday after an independent audit found more overcharges,
department spokesman Andre Pineda said. Household also will repay $3
million in overcharges to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which the Department of Corporations filed in November
in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleged a "pervasive pattern of
abusive lending practices" by Household and Beneficial, including
routinely imposing $75 administrative fees on loans of $2,500 or
less. The maximum permitted by state law is $50.</LD>
<TE>   Household International acknowledged that overcharges occurred but
denied any intentional wrongdoing. The settlement requires the
Prospect Heights, Ill., company to pay Arthur Andersen to regularly
audit its California operations; to create a special office at a
Household facility in Pomona where regulators can review electronic
images of loan files, and to establish "technological and human
controls" to prevent overcharges.</TE>
<TE>   Household had promised to correct the violations after the
department discovered them in 1998. But an examination two years
later found continuing problems, prompting Corporations Commissioner
Demetrios A. Boutris to complain that "economically disadvantaged
Californians found themselves illegally nickeled and dimed by a
$26-billion company."</TE>
<TE>   Household spokeswoman Megan Hayden said the company thought it had
fixed the problems earlier but found "to our dismay" it had not.</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad it's resolved and that our customers have been made
whole," she said.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Says It Bungled Drug Application</HD>
<DH>Medicine: CEO explains FDA rejection of Erbitux to irate
investors. New clinical trials may be necessary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chairman and chief executive of embattled ImClone Systems Inc.
told irate investors Wednesday that the biotechnology company had
"screwed up" its application for a highly touted cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug, known as
Erbitux, on Dec. 28. ImClone, a New York-based start-up with no
products, has been hit with eight shareholder suits since details of
the FDA's rejection were disclosed in an industry journal Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the company's stock has lost more than 50% in
the last month. It was trading as high as $75 in early December. On
Wednesday, it lost an additional 14%, closing at $31.85, down $50, on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Sam Waskal told investors attending a health-care
conference in San Francisco that the company was working with its
partner, industry giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., to refile the
application for the drug. But Waskal said he did not know when a new
application would be ready and said the company may have to conduct
new clinical trials on patients to prove that Erbitux works.</TE>
<TE>   Erbitux was regarded by investors and oncologists as one of the
most promising cancer drugs in development. ImClone had been seeking
approval to use the drug in colorectal cancer, but said it expected
the drug to be useful in treating pancreatic cancer and cancers
affecting the head and neck.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, ImClone announced that Erbitux, used with the
chemotherapy drug irinotecan, shrank colo-rectal cancer tumors in
22.5% of the patients who used it. The company said all 120 patients
in the study had failed to respond to irinotecan alone.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol Myer-Squibb, citing the blockbuster potential of the drug,
last fall paid $1 billion for 20% of ImClone and agreed to pay as
much as $1billion more for marketing rights to the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The last two weeks have yielded nothing but bad news. On Dec. 31,
ImClone told investors that the FDA could not review its application
for the cancer drug. ImClone said at the time that the agency needed
more documentation, which the firm hoped to provide by the end of
March. The FDA wanted ImClone to show how it concluded patients had
responded to the combination of Erbitux and irinotecan but not
irinotecan alone.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cancer Letter, a Washington-based newsletter, reported
this week that the FDA's nine-page letter to ImClone raised
additional concerns. It said the FDA warned ImClone as far back as
August 2000 that it would have to show why irinotecan, a toxic
chemical, was needed with Erbitux, which has mild side effects.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, according to Cancer Letter, told ImClone that it did not
justify the dose it used and did not fully report on patients who
died. The FDA rejection letter said "new clinical trials would be
needed to provide more robust data documenting response."</TE>
<TE>   Waskal acknowledged many of those problems in a session with
several hundred investors. "We put together a faulty package. We
screwed up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waskal said ImClone expects to meet with FDA officials soon to
discuss its options. He called Bristol-Myers "highly supportive" and
said, "We could not have a better partner at this time."</TE>

<HD>Requests for Life Insurance Slowing</HD>
<DH>Policies: Applications rise in December from a year
earlier, but number falls from October peak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Post-Sept. 11 jitters are still sending more Americans in search of
life insurance, but applications appear to be trailing off, industry
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Life insurance applications nationwide were up 10.7% in December
compared with the same period a year ago, according to MIB Group
Inc., a Westwood, Mass., research and database firm.</LD>
<LD>   But the number of applications continued to fall from its October
peak, with a 9.9% drop between October and November and a further
4.6% drop from November to December, the MIB figures show.</LD>
<TE>   "People are not plugged in [to the possible need for life
insurance] the way they were earlier," said Fran Marinelli,
spokeswoman for MIB. Applications in the U.S. and Canada peaked at
1.4 million in October, an increase of 9% from the year before and a
26% rise from September, Marinelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Marinelli said the decline in applications could be a brief,
holiday-driven interruption. Some analysts expect life insurance
sales to improve this year, while others said the flurry of interest
in life insurance may have only temporarily reversed a long-term
trend of fewer policies sold each year.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Sept. 11 reminded a few people of their mortality, but
it looks like [the sales increase] is a bit of a short-term
phenomenon," said Ira Zuckerman, an analyst with Nutmeg Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Increased interest in life insurance may be offset by concerns
about the economy, with fewer people willing to commit to policies
when their job prospects are uncertain, said Julie Burke, an analyst
and managing director with Fitch Inc., a rating agency. Fitch is
expecting "moderately higher sales" of insurance this year compared
with previous years, Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   "Insurance is at the forefront of people's minds because of Sept.
11, but that may be somewhat moderated by the economic situation,"
Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, the number of policies sold has steadily declined
as insurance agents sell fewer policies to middle-class consumers and
concentrate instead on wooing the rich--leading to fewer but bigger
sales, industry analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is that trend more apparent than in Los Angeles, which
topped the nation for the first time in 2000 in the dollar amount of
coverage sold, even as the number of policies sold declined,
according to figures compiled by LIMRA International, a research
association.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums for new policies sold in Los Angeles totaled $569.6
million in 2000, the latest year for which statistics are available.
That was a 42% increase from a year earlier, LIMRA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the actual number of policies sold dropped 10%, to
264,100.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the trend toward bigger premiums here and nationwide
was helped by robust sales of cash-value life insurance--policies
that combine a death benefit with an investment component. These
policies are more expensive--and provide higher commissions for
insurance agents--than term insurance, which is pure insurance
without the investment component.</TE>
<TE>   Some types of cash-value life insurance, particularly variable
policies that allow investments in stocks, suffered last year as
equity markets faltered. In the first nine months of 2001, premiums
for variable life policies fell by 27%, said LIMRA researcher Elaine
Tumicki.</TE>
<TE>   But more-traditional whole-life policies, which offer a fixed
return, became more popular, as did universal life policies, which
invest in fixed-income securities such as bonds, Tumicki said.</TE>
<TE>   Because premiums for whole-life and universal policies tend to be
higher than those paid for variable policies, the total amount paid
for policies last year continued to grow, and that growth is likely
to continue, said Rodney Clark, director of financial services for
Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean cash-value policies are a good fit for most
people, warned Martin Weiss, chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc., a rating
agency that reviews insurers, banks, mutual funds and brokerage
firms. People should first determine if they need life insurance at
all, said Weiss, who has written a soon-to-be-published book about
money and investing called "The Ultimate Safe Money Guide." Those who
have minor children, or whose spouses would be unable to pay the
mortgage, typically need coverage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If your agent tells you everybody needs life insurance, tell him
to take a hike," Weiss said. "Some people need insurance and some
don't."</TE>

<HD>Loral Settles China Satellite Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN BERR</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd. reached a settlement Wednesday to
pay the U.S. government a civil fine of $14million over allegations
it may have violated rules in 1996 that govern the transfer of
satellite technology to China.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes Electronics Corp., which also is under investigation, also
expects to settle with the State Department, said company spokesman
Richard Dore. The Justice Department ended its investigation of both
Hughes and Loral, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   "The cloud has been lifted," said Loral Chief Executive Bernard
Schwartz. Loral, the second-biggest U.S. satellite-communications
company, neither admitted nor denied the government's charges as part
of the settlement. "We are very happy that we have been able to
resolve this."</LD>
<TE>   Regulators were reviewing whether Loral and Hughes knowingly sold
sensitive satellite and missile technology to China, damaging
national security. Loral has said one of its engineers, a member of a
committee reviewing a failed satellite launch, accidentally faxed a
copy of its findings to the Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government feels there is not much difference of intent
between a launch vehicle that is used for satellites and nuclear
ballistic missiles," said William Kidd, satellite analyst at Lehman
Bros. Inc., who has a "strong buy" rating on shares of Loral. "But it
wasn't a malicious plot by the company."</TE>
<TE>   A committee headed by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach)
released a 700-page report in 1999 that included the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The report alleged that China engaged in a 20-year spy campaign to
obtain U.S. nuclear weapons technology, high-performance computers,
aircraft and guidance systems and rocket launch know-how.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cox report is irrelevant to what happened here today,"
Schwartz said. Officials in Cox's Washington office couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time it came out, it was tied with some heavy Clinton
politics," said Jimmy Schaeffler, chief executive of the Carmel
Group, a Carmel, Calif.-based satellite researcher. "It caused some
major changes within the way the government reviewed exchanges of
technology."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes Electronics, the satellite-television broadcaster that
agreed to be bought by EchoStar Communications Corp., sold its
satellite making business to Boeing Co. Hughes is currently owned by
General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of Loral's fine, about 4 cents a share, will be reflected
in the company's fourth-quarter results. Under the terms of the
agreement the fine is to be paid over seven years, without interest,
resulting in a cash impact annually of about $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps them somewhat," said Robert Friedman, an analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Service, who covers the aerospace and
defense industries. "I think investors are more interested in the
financial health of the company as well as the health of Loral's
primary markets."</TE>

<HD>Investors Suddenly Turn Skittish, Put Brakes on Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Jitters about upcoming earnings reports and
speeches by Greenspan take the steam out of markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharp late-day turnaround took the starch out of Wall Street's
latest rally Wednesday as concerns about the market's dramatic
post-September rally overshadowed upbeat forecasts from technology
bellwethers Cisco Systems and Oracle.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are questioning whether the market is due for a pullback
after its massive surge off the three-year lows hit in the wake of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The fourth-quarter earnings season
heats up next week and should bring the worst quarterly performance
since the last recession in 1990-91.</LD>
<LD>   Investors had been content to funnel money into the market on bets
for better results later in 2002, but now they are fretting that an
economic rebound has already been baked into prices.</LD>
<TE>   "The market's running out of gas," said Peter Boockvar, equity
strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co. "We're entering earnings period, and
they better be good, because the market expects that. Unless they're
dramatically better than expected, it's going to be tough."</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed down 10.85
points, or 0.5%, at 2,044.89, after climbing 43 points. The blue-chip
Dow Jones industrial average, up 120 points earlier, closed down
56.46 points, or 0.6%, at 10,094.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
fell 5.57, or 0.5%, to 1,155.14. It was the third straight losing
session for the Dow and S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market was only narrowly negative, with losers edging
winners 16 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and 19 to 17 on
Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   There were varying explanations for the late sell-off. Some
traders blamed reports that a U.S. military refueling plane, carrying
seven Marines, crashed into a mountain in Pakistan while trying to
land at a base used by U.S. forces fighting in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be more deaths," said Ned Collins, a trader at
Daiwa Securities America. "It's just a constant reminder."</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, some said Nasdaq futures traders became skittish on
concerns that comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
scheduled for today, and the release in two days of December producer
prices might roil markets. Greenspan also is scheduled to speak on
economic policy Friday in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "In the face of Greenspan speaking and the [producer price index]
on Friday, no one wanted to step out," said Jack Broz, a trader with
TeamNKO Ltd. at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Fed President Robert McTeer added more pressure to the
market in the early afternoon, saying that the central bank's series
of interest rate cuts, begun about a year ago, has been helpful in
providing a base for recovery but that the central bank would have
liked a bigger effect.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco turned tail with the market, ending down 10 cents at $20.85
after holding gains through much of the day. Cisco said the outlook
for growth in the economy and technology industry is still murky, but
it expects to expand its market share and make several small
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle managed to hold onto gains, finishing up 98 cents to
$16.73, while rival SAP rallied $3.22 to close at $36.44.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * The yen rose from a three-year low after a Japanese government
spokesman called the currency's 9% fall against the dollar during the
last two months "a bit rapid." The yen rose to 132.66 to the dollar,
compared with 132.74 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Gateway fell 98 cents to $6.71 after Moody's Investors Service
lowered the credit rating of the PC maker to "junk" status, citing
concern that the company will lose sales and market share. Gateway
fell 33% in two days. Other PC makers declined. Dell Computer lost 25
cents to $29.39 and Compaq Computer fell 49 cents to $10.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Homebuilder Lennar rose $1.73 to $48.75, after saying earnings
rose about 50%, beating estimates, as low interest rates bolstered
demand for housing.</TE>
<TE>   * Merrill Lynch rose $1.55 to $57.99. The biggest U.S. brokerage
said it will take a $2.2-billion quarterly charge for about 9,000 job
cuts, but Merrill said its restructuring is winding down and it has
seen the worst of the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom companies fell for a second day. SBC Communications was
off $1.57 to $38.17 and Sprint Corp.'s PCS Group fell $1.86 to
$19.25. Their profits might not recover until 2004 as competition
squeezes earnings, said Jaye Morency, money manager at David L.
Babson &amp; Co.</TE>

<LD>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., owner of a library with more than 14,000
movies and television shows, is in talks with EchoStar Communications
Corp. to start an MGM-branded channel on the Dish satellite TV
service.</LD>
<LD>   "We are now in discussions with EchoStar about that very subject,
on putting an MGM channel on their platform," Chief Executive Alex
Yemenidjian said at an investor conference in Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   MGM has been investing in TV networks in other countries, such as
Brazil, India, Israel and Turkey, to broadcast MGM programs and
movies. The Santa Monica-based company owns the rights to many hit
films, including the "James Bond" and "Rocky" series.</LD>
<TE>   Yemenidjian said in an interview that the talks are in an
"embryonic" stage. A spokeswoman for Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar is the second-largest U.S. satellite TV broadcaster. If
it completes its planned acquisition of rival Hughes Electronics
Corp.'s DirecTV satellite TV service, it will have 16 million
subscribers, more than any U.S. cable TV company.</TE>
<TE>   MGM shares fell 15 cents to $20.60 on the New York Stock Exchange,
and have increased 23% in the last year. EchoStar fell 32 cents to
$29.05 on Nasdaq and has climbed 19% in the last year.</TE>

<LD>Napster Inc., once the copyright-flouting bad boy of the music world,
is relaunching its online song-sharing system today as a subscription
service that pays for music and deters piracy.</LD>
<LD>   The launch is limited to an invitation-only trial with about
20,000 participants, who will receive the service for free. The
service will have a familiar look and feel but far fewer songs to
download.</LD>
<LD>   In the new version, the only music available will be songs that
record labels and music publishers have authorized for downloading.
Redwood City, Calif.-based Napster has deals with many independent
labels and publishers but not with the five major record companies
responsible for the vast majority of popular music.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers said Napster plans to make its new
service available to all comers by the end of March. It also hopes to
have deals with the major labels by then, he said, adding that he has
not decided whether to broaden the service without them.</TE>
<TE>   Napster needs songs from all five majors if it wants to appeal to
the mass market, said P.J. McNealy, research director for the
technology consulting firm GartnerG2.</TE>
<TE>   "Napster faces exactly the same challenge as any other music
service," he said. "The Napster brand is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   The major record companies are suing Napster over its free
service, which enabled users to find and copy songs from one
another's computers without paying for them. U.S. District Judge
Marilyn Hall Patel ordered Napster in July to shut the service, which
attracted more than 10 million users a month at its peak, until it
could stop users from making unauthorized copies of the labels'
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to meet that test, Napster has not revived the free
service. The new version still is based on users copying music from
one another's computers, but Napster's software won't let them find
songs that are unauthorized for sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Fanning, Napster's inventor and chief technical officer,
said the company built the new software virtually from scratch. The
result preserves the original Napster's easy-to-use tools for finding
songs while improving the software for sending instant messages,
chatting online and perusing songs other users have collected, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the songs on the new version will have electronic locks,
preventing them from being copied or played by nonsubscribers,
recorded onto a CD or moved to a portable audio player. Napster's
system also prevents songs from being traded without authorization,
and it records each download to calculate royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Because the original version allowed users to share all the MP3
files on their computers, the service made available a huge and
diverse collection of studio recordings, live music, rarities and
outtakes. The new version will be unable to offer such breadth unless
it gets a favorable ruling from the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Both Napster and the record companies have challenged the order in
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Although the labels have asked
for tight limits, Napster wants the ability to let users share all
music that has not specifically been ruled out by the copyright
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Napster also wants to encourage artists who hold their own
copyrights to distribute their music through its system. Hilbers said
the company will put 55% of its subscription revenue into a pool that
copyright holders will split according to how often their songs have
been downloaded.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly subscription fee is tentatively set at $5 to $10 for
50 downloads, Hilbers said. The company hopes to let users download
more songs per month for an extra fee, but some of the major labels
want to keep a low limit in place, he said.</TE>

<HD>Oakley Says Counterfeiting Arrests Tripled Last Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunglasses maker Oakley Inc. said Wednesday that law enforcement
officials arrested a record 663 people last year for counterfeiting
its products, nearly triple the number of arrests in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The value of knockoffs seized by authorities more than doubled to
$24 million, the Foothill Ranch company said.</LD>
<LD>   Oakley, which has been battling counterfeiters for years, said
authorities overseas began arresting suspects in counterfeiting
operations last year. One-third of last year's arrests were outside
the U.S., spokesman Gar Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   Oakley attributed the jump in the number of arrests to closer
cooperation with law enforcement agencies both in and outside the
U.S., including stronger efforts to educate and train them to
identify counterfeit products.</TE>
<TE>   "The counterfeit stuff is just junk, and we don't want consumers
buying junk that has the Oakley name and logo on it," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley is more aggressive than any other sunglasses manufacturer
in protecting its products, said Eric M. Beder, an analyst with
Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co. The sporty shades sell for as much as $400,
and the company has 600 patents and 800 trademarks worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the increase in arrests and confiscations, Oakley has made
only a dent in the counterfeit market, said Vance Lommen, the
company's director of legal affairs and security. He said more than
half of the Oakley knockoffs come out of China, which has ignored
Oakley's pleas for a crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lommen said he plans to visit China this week to discuss the
company's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley shares closed at $15.89, down 31 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Airbus Outdoes Boeing in '01 Deals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airbus won contracts for more new aircraft than U.S. rival Boeing Co.
last year as airlines placed orders for the European plane maker's
new 550-seat A380, which will be the largest commercial jet.</LD>
<LD>   The Toulouse, France-based company had about 367 new orders, down
30% from the year earlier, while Chicago-based Boeing won contracts
for 335 aircraft, a drop of 45%, as the economy slumped and the Sept.
11 attacks hastened the decline in air travel. Airbus received 85
firm orders for its new plane.</LD>
<LD>   The A380, which is scheduled to enter service in 2006, will break
the U.S. firm's monopoly in large aircraft, dominated by the 420-seat
Boeing 747 for three decades. Airbus now competes with Boeing in all
plane sectors.</LD>
<TE>   "With the range of aircraft Airbus now has out there, it's no
surprise they beat Boeing," said Howard Wheeldon, an analyst at
Prudential Bache Ltd. in London. "It's a pattern that we don't expect
to alter over the next few years."</TE>
<TE>   The A380 has a list price of $240 million, though the first
customers were given discounts by Airbus, which analysts have
estimated at about 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Customers for the plane include Air France, Deutsche Lufthansa,
Singapore Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Qantas Airways, Emirates
Airlines and International Lease Finance Corp. FedEx Corp. has made a
commitment to buy 10, though it hasn't yet signed a firm contract.</TE>
<TE>   Winning more orders than Boeing doesn't necessarily mean more
profit for Airbus, said analysts, who expressed concern that the
European plane maker may be too willing to cut prices to beat the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "More orders bringing more profitability is not always the case by
any means," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research in Newport,
R.I.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing put market share ahead of profitability in the early 1990s,
then reversed that policy when Harry Stonecipher became vice
chairman. "Presumably they have not taken any orders that are not
deemed to be profitable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus' orders last year were the lowest since 1995, while
Boeing's were the lowest since 1994. Airbus has beaten Boeing two of
the last three years. Boeing delivered 527 jets last year, compared
with 320 for Airbus.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International's plan to pay a group of alternative-energy
producers owed $1.1 billion by the company's indebted Southern
California Edison utility unit was approved by California regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The state Public Utilities Commission approved the plan on a 5-0
vote. The plan calls for Southern California Edison to pay the debts
as soon as the utility can arrange financing, which is expected by
March 31. A previous agreement for the generators not to sue Edison
expired Dec. 31. The new plan expires May 31.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California Edison, the state's second-largest utility,
accrued $3.3 billion in debt buying power for more than state law
allowed it to charge customers. In October, the utility averted
bankruptcy by persuading the PUC to allow it to pay the debt using
money from customer bills.</LD>
<TE>   Edison shares rose 14 cents to $15.36 on Wednesday. The shares
have fallen 3.4% in the last year.</TE>

<LD>Argentina will ban withdrawals of dollar term deposits until 2003 to
avert a collapse of the banking system, Todo Noticias reported. The
decision will affect about $23 billion in deposits, economists said.</LD>
<LD>   The government, which has ordered banks to convert
dollar-denominated loans totaling as much as $100,000 into pesos to
help individuals cope with a devaluation of the currency, is taking
steps to help banks that otherwise would be unable to meet their
dollar liabilities, analysts said. Central bank officials wouldn't
comment.</LD>
<LD>   Argentines pulled almost $16billion in dollar-denominated term
deposits from banks in the two months leading up to the withdrawal
restrictions.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigna Corp., the third-biggest U.S. health insurer, will cut about
2,000 jobs as part of a restructuring in its health-care business.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts will increase expenses by about $65million in the
fourth quarter, the company said. The restructuring is expected to
save $45million to $55million a year in 2003 and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Cigna, which has 14.2 million customers, has struggled with rising
medical costs, while job cuts have slowed growth in its employer
health plans. The insurer also has had lower profit in its pension
business as falling stock prices cut into management fees it charges
corporate customers.</LD>

<LD>Best Buy Co. said earnings this quarter will exceed expectations
because of increased holiday demand for video games, cameras and
other digital products.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said profit for the fiscal year that begins March

March 2003, including its first stores in Alaska, Idaho, Utah, West
Virginia, Wyoming and Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   December same-store sales climbed 6.2%, helped by strong demand
for video-game systems.</LD>
<TE>   With stronger sales of high-margin digital goods, Best Buy said it
will earn $1.35 to $1.40 a share for the fiscal fourth quarter, up
from 89 cents a year earlier. Analysts' average estimate was $1.27.</TE>

<LD>Lennar Corp., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder, said fiscal
fourth-quarter profit rose a better-than-expected 49% and that it
will beat analysts' estimates in 2002 as low mortgage rates boost
sales.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $162.9 million, or $2.32 a share, in the
quarter ended Nov. 30, from $109.5 million, or $1.59, a year earlier,
the Miami-based company said. Revenue rose 14% to $2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Lennar was expected to earn $2.20 a share, according to analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. The company's shares rose
$1.73 to $48.75 on the NYSE, their highest price since July 19. The
results helped the Standard &amp; Poor's super-composite home-building
index gain 1.8%, its biggest increase since Dec. 24.</LD>

<HD>Merrill Lynch to Take a Charge for Job Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. will take a $1.7-billion charge, its largest
ever, as President Stanley O'Neal leads a retreat from an expansion
that left the firm less profitable than its rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-quarter charge reflects the cost of eliminating 9,000
jobs, scaling back in Japan and selling brokerages in Canada and
South Africa. The firm will put less emphasis on winning market share
in bond sales and focus more on profitability, O'Neal said.</LD>
<LD>   The slide in mergers and stock sales has crimped earnings and
pushed brokerage stocks lower. Merrill's shares have lagged behind
rivals', falling 20% in the last year versus a decline of 12% for the
S&amp;P index of financial services companies. The shares fell 24% in
2001, their biggest drop since 1987.</LD>
<TE>   Since O'Neal overhauled top management, installing his picks atop
the firm's four main businesses in October, Merrill shares have
surged 40% as investors anticipated cost cuts. That rise topped
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s 22% rise and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp;
Co.'s 18% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill shares rose $1.55 to close at $57.99 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Consulting firm Accenture said fiscal first-quarter profit fell 45%

<LD>   Net income fell to $81.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the

earlier. Excluding funds received from clients for reimbursed
expenses, revenue rose 5.6% $2.99 billion.</LD>

would have earned $258 million, or 25 cents, a penny better than
analysts' expectations.</LD>
<TE>   The company, formerly called Andersen Consulting, also said it
expects to meet the average analyst estimate of 22 cents a share in

clean-burning fuel owned by inventor William Talbert and his Talbert
Fuel Systems Patents Co. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal

<HD>Collectors in Card Dispute With Teen</HD>
<DH>Internet: Soured deals for sports memorabilia may have
helped SEC identify suspect in larger scam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two sports memorabilia collectors frustrated over several soured
deals may have helped the Securities and Exchange Commission identify
a Mission Viejo teen as the primary suspect in a $1-million
investment scam.</LD>
<LD>   Cole A. Bartiromo, the 17-year-old who on Monday agreed to settle
the SEC case without admitting or denying guilt, is an avid sports
card collector who apparently offered to sell mint rookie cards of
such stars as basketball great Michael Jordan via the Internet
auction site EBay last year.</LD>
<LD>   But according to two collectors, Bartiromo failed to deliver the
cards in several instances and delayed or declined to return buyers'
deposits. One of the collectors, Danny Matson of San Francisco, said
the teen still owes him nearly $25,000.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute appears to have tripped up Bartiromo, whom the SEC
accuses of operating the "Invest Better 2001" program that
fraudulently advertised "risk-free" returns of as much as 2,500%. The
SEC said more than 1,000 participants worldwide sent money to
Bartiromo, who under the alias "Tom Manning" claimed he had figured
out how to make huge profits through sports betting.</TE>
<TE>   In his settlement with the SEC, Bartiromo agreed to return
$900,000 that he had deposited in an account at a Costa Rican casino.</TE>
<TE>   Matson told The Times that federal investigators called him in
November because they saw that he was registered as the purported
administrator and billing contact for Invest Better 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Matson told the investigators that he had never heard of the
investment program and had no idea how his name became linked with
the scheme. However, he said his curiosity was piqued when an SEC
attorney asked whether he knew a Tom Manning.</TE>
<TE>   Matson said he was in a dispute over an unraveled sports-card
transaction on the Internet with an individual with a similar
name--"Tim Marino."</TE>
<TE>   Matson said he then called Ramon Sanchez, a San Jose sports card
collector who Matson knew had previously run into trouble with
Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Trolling the Internet in October, Sanchez had come across a
collector using the name "2001SeattleMariners2001" who was offering
to sell a mint 1986 Michael Jordan rookie card for $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that this card usually sold for $12,000 to $13,000 and
even though the auction had closed, I contacted the person and said
if the deal fell through I would like to buy the card," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 12, he said he received an e-mail back from cbartiromo
@yahoo.com offering to sell the card for $8,500 and instructing
Sanchez to use PayPal, an Internet payment system, to transfer the
money.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said he also was directed to make the arrangements online
through an instant messaging system with an individual using the
screen name "Tigercards," who identified himself as Tim Marino,
Bartiromo's associate.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said he used PayPal to put up two $500 deposits to hold
the Jordan card while he made arrangements to meet Marino and take
delivery of the card.</TE>
<TE>   Marino then directed Sanchez to use PayPal to make the second
deposit into an online betting account at EFS Caribbean, Sanchez
said. EFS Caribbean is an online currency converter and payment
system for offshore casinos and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said he noticed that the account belonged to Danny Matson,
a name unfamiliar to him. To be cautious, Sanchez wrote down the
information about Matson in case a problem developed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of October, the deal to purchase the Jordan card had
fallen apart because, Sanchez said, he was never able to pin down a
firm delivery time. Sanchez, an analyst at a San Jose computer
company, said he then ran into trouble getting his deposits back from
Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Out of frustration, he said, he contacted Matson, thinking he also
was a Marino associate.</TE>
<TE>   Matson said he told Sanchez that Marino owed him thousands of
dollars in deposits for deals that never took place. Sanchez said the
pair started to comb the Internet and to e-mail EBay sports card
customers to try to determine Marino's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of November the SEC called Matson asking about the
Invest Better 2001 scheme, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the suspicion that the unauthorized use of Matson's
identity may have linked the activities of Marino and Manning, the
pair started to e-mail customers of Invest Better 2001, asking what
they knew about either individual.</TE>
<TE>   They plugged the two names plus "Bartiromo" and "Tigercards" into
an Internet search engine and discovered through an ESPN story
broadcast last summer that Cole Bartiromo was a teenager with a keen
interest in sports who said he and his father sold collectibles.</TE>
<TE>   On ESPN, Cole Bartiromo and his father, John Bartiromo, described
big-money dealings in 1996 Tiger Woods cards from Sports
Illustrated's SI for Kids magazine.</TE>
<TE>   When Cole Bartiromo heard that prices for the prized card--the
closest thing to a rookie card for the golf superstar--were soaring,
he said he tracked down more than a dozen copies of the magazine,
extracting at least two cards that were later graded as perfect or
near-perfect by leading rating services, according to the ESPN
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The Bartiromos said a winning Internet auction bid for one card of
$125,000 was later retracted, but subsequent private offers were as
high as $400,000. That price would have made it the
third-most-valuable card ever sold, according to rating service
Professional Sports Authenticator of Newport Beach. John Bartiromo
told ESPN the card was sold for "mid-six-figures," but ESPN could not
confirm whether a sale was actually completed.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and Matson also started searching for the identity of an
e-mail account, mariners116@ hotmail.com," an apparent reference to
the record-tying 116 wins the Seattle Mariners team collected this
baseball season. Cole Bartiromo, a senior on the Trabuco Hills High
School baseball team, is said by friends to be a big Mariners fan.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, an Invest Better 2001 customer forwarded a string of
postings on the scheme's investor forum to Sanchez, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the postings praising the program was from someone using
the name mariners116.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and Matson said they passed all the information to SEC
investigators just before Christmas. "We got help from five or six
other people," Sanchez said. "I would like to think that we were
helpful."</TE>
<TE>   SEC officials declined to talk about how they learned that
Bartiromo was behind the Invest Better 2001 scheme.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department said they
were familiar with the sports-cards allegations against the teen but
had referred the case to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney, David Bayless, did not return a call
Wednesday seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Malls to Offer Deep Discounts</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Shopping program is part of Mayor Hahn's
economic recovery effort to revive retail sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to breathe new life into the region's retail sector, public
officials today will announce a major marketing push aimed at luring
consumers into 19 Los Angeles County shopping malls next week.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed Shop LA County, the program will encourage retailers at the
19 malls, including nine in the city of Los Angeles, to offer
discounts of up to 70% and other incentives from Jan. 17 through
Jan.21.</LD>
<LD>   Participating malls include the Citadel Factory Stores, the
Fashion Square Sherman Oaks and Los Cerritos Center.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes about a month after the conclusion of a similar
Dine LA program, which was launched late last year to encourage area
residents to dine out on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</TE>
<TE>   Both the dining and shopping programs are part of Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn's economic recovery effort, launched in the wake
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Los Angeles and other cities rely
heavily on sales tax revenue for their general funds.</TE>
<TE>   Several restaurant owners said the dining program, which ran for
six weeks, generated little additional business--but they still
believed the idea was a good one.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I could count everybody that participated
on my fingers," said Steve Kim, general manager of Kyoto Restaurant
in the Wilshire Grand Hotel. "And two times it was the same person.
I'd say it had not a lot of impact. We were expecting a bigger
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Some restaurateurs speculated that the dining program was not
well-publicized.</TE>
<TE>   To promote the Shop LA program, promoters are planning an
advertising campaign and a public kickoff today.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Chen, the mayor's director of economic recovery, said the
shopping program is being supported by media outlets including the
Los Angeles Times and KTLA-TV Channel 5, both of which are owned by
Tribune Co.</TE>
<TE>   Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the International Council of
Shopping Centers, said he was unaware of similar programs in the U.S.
in which so many competing malls worked together on a joint marketing
program.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything right now that can be done to help stimulate the economy
is good," Kavanagh said. "It's good for the consumers, and it's a
win-win for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Kavanagh said retailers typically offer deep discounts in
mid-January to move out the previous year's merchandise and to make
room for the spring arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   Although nationwide mall revenue rose by about 2% from Christmas
2000, Kavanagh said, overall the holiday season was seen as
disappointing for many retailers who have seen business slide since
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping program is being undertaken with about $57,000 in
cash from the participating malls, $10,000 from American Express Co.
and additional in-kind contributions.</TE>
<TE>   For every purchase during the promotion, a donation will be made
to Book Ends, a nonprofit group that provides books to schools.</TE>

<HD>Major Software Stocks Surge on SAP Outlook</HD>
<DH>Technology: German company's forecast fuels optimism that
sector is pulling out of last year's sales slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major software stocks surged Wednesday after SAP, the largest maker
of business-management programs, said it surpassed a reduced 2001
sales forecast.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the stocks closed below their highs for the day, but the
rally was another sign that many investors are hungry to jump back
into beaten-down tech shares, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Germany-based SAP, whose software helps businesses manage
inventory, accounting and customer relations, said 2001 sales rose
more than 16%, beating the 15% growth rate the company forecast in
October when it lowered the target from 20%.</LD>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter alone SAP's license sales, the basic measure
of its software sales, totaled about $891 million, well above
analysts' forecasts of about $780 million. The company will report
complete results Jan. 23.</TE>
<TE>   SAP's U.S.-traded shares jumped $3.22, or 9.7%, to $36.44 on the
New York Stock Exchange, after trading as high as $37.98.</TE>
<TE>   SAP's better-than-forecast results bolstered optimism that
software companies are pulling out of last year's sales slump, when
corporations clamped down on spending as the U.S. economy fell into a
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of software leaders Oracle and Siebel Systems have said
in recent months that sales are beginning to recover. Oracle
executives made upbeat comments Tuesday at a brokerage conference.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle shares rose 98 cents to $16.74, Siebel gained $1.26 to
$34.56 and PeopleSoft added 41 cents to $40.90, all on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Other gainers included Rational Software, up $1.59 to close at
$21.84, and BEA Systems, up $1.09 to $20.92, both on Nasdaq. But
Microsoft slipped 67 cents to $68.71.</TE>
<TE>   "SAP's the real catalyst," said Noah Blackstein, portfolio manager
of the $138-million Dynamic Power American Fund, which holds Siebel,
PeopleSoft and Microsoft shares. "You could assume that there's money
being spent" on new software.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley on Tuesday reiterated
the fiscal third- and fourth-quarter earnings forecasts he gave Dec.
13, suggesting that sales are on track.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time we pick up one of these straws in the wind, it's a good
indication," said Bill Rutherford, whose Rutherford Investment
Management oversees about $100 million and holds PeopleSoft shares.
"The next three months will tell us a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle is the biggest maker of database software, used to store
and organize libraries of computer data. At least two analysts raised
their ratings on the company Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some investors said they're skeptical that sales at
software companies will bounce back quickly enough to justify the
stocks' gains since September.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle shares have rallied 65% from a 52-week low of $10.16 on
Sept. 21. Siebel, the largest maker of software to track sales and
customer contacts, has more than doubled after falling to a 52-week
low on Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle shares now are valued at 38 times analysts' consensus
earnings estimate of 45 cents a share for the fiscal year that will
end in May, according to earnings-tracker Thomson Financial/IBES.</TE>
<TE>   Siebel shares are valued at 73 times analysts' consensus estimate
of 2002 earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is getting a little bit ahead of itself," said
Francois Olivier, a software analyst at Murphy Investment Management,
which holds Oracle shares. "We're not going to go back to where we
were 18 months ago."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, business-software makers benefited as companies
rushed to automate more of their operations using the Internet and as
dot-coms, flush with venture capital, spent heavily on software and
computer hardware.</TE>
<TE>   That spending ground to a halt last year as Internet companies
shut down and more established companies decided to hold off on
software projects.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Avaya Inc. said it will report a fiscal first-quarter loss, instead
of a profit as expected by Wall Street analysts, sparking a sell-off
of its stock.</LD>
<LD>   Avaya, a leader in call centers and voice messaging and office
telephone systems, said it will likely report revenue of $1.3 billion
for the quarter, contrasted with the $1.41 billion analysts expected.</LD>
<LD>   The company said its loss from ongoing operations will be 8 cents
to 10 cents a share, after an accounting change related to goodwill
amortization, for the quarter ended December. Analysts were expecting
4 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Avaya fell 17%, or $2.12, to $10.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, however, the stock reversed
direction, rising 11%, or $1.15, to hit $11.50.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. asked a federal judge to allow it and the nine states
suing the software company to conduct their pre-trial depositions of
experts and company executives in private.</LD>
<LD>   The company asked U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to
toss out a 1999 ruling by the previous judge in the antitrust case
that required all parties to conduct depositions of experts in
public, in accordance with a federal rule encouraging open
depositions in antitrust cases.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Justice Department has dropped out of the lawsuit,
Microsoft is arguing that the federal rule no longer applies. The
nine states still suing Microsoft are not expected to oppose its
request. But numerous media organizations have expressed interest in
attending the depositions.</LD>

<HD>Verizon Adds More Long-Distance Clients in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. local telephone company,
Wednesday said it ended 2001 with more long-distance customers, but
wireless customer additions fell well short of analysts'
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon said it recorded about 7.4 million long-distance customers
at the end of the year, 51% more than a year ago, and more than its
target of 6.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon is the nation's fourth-largest long-distance telephone
company.</LD>
<TE>   The company's long-distance business only comprises about 5% of
its current total revenue but is considered to be one of the biggest
growth drivers for Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company also said it is in "no rush" to proceed
with the initial public offering of Verizon Wireless, citing weakness
in wireless stocks and the collapse of a deal for wireless licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Verizon were off 92 cents at $48.88 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Comack, telecommunications analyst with Guzman &amp; Co.,
blamed the stock's weakness on investor disappointment with the
results at Verizon Wireless, its joint venture with Britain's
Vodafone Group.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon also ended the year with about 1.2 million digital
subscriber line or data customers, which met its expectations and was
more than double the customers of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon said it continues to expect adjusted earnings per share of
$3 to $3.03 for 2001, compared with $2.91 for 2000. Analysts on
average were expecting $3.01, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company still expects revenue growth of 4% to 5% from the
$64.71 billion reported a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless, the nation's No. 1 wireless firm, added only
715,000 new customers in the quarter, less than the 752,000 customers
it added in the third quarter. This widely missed analysts' estimates
which ranged from 900,000 to 1.1 million net new customers.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless said it ended the year with 29.4 million
customers, 6.9% more than a year ago.</TE>

<HD>SEC Blocks Toks' Request for IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission said it blocked a first-time
stock sale by Toks Inc., crimping Ade Ogunjobi's apparent vision of
acquiring General Motors Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and other major U.S.
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal by Toks, which has one employee--Ogunjobi--and no
revenue, to buy some of the world's biggest companies isn't credible,
an SEC administrative law judge decided in rejecting the filing for a
$100,000 initial public offering.</LD>
<LD>   If the SEC had cleared the initial offering filed last August,
Toks said it planned to register an additional $10 billion of bonds
and $2 trillion of Class A stock to fund the takeovers.</LD>
<TE>   "The registration statement goes well beyond hyperbole with a
series of assumptions that it presents as realistic events," said an
order this week by SEC Chief Administrative Law Judge Brenda Murray,
suspending the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem: Toks didn't explain how the company would have
securities worth $2 trillion to complete its takeover plans, which
also called for the acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp., AT&amp;T
Wireless Services Inc. and General Electric Co., among others.</TE>
<TE>   Ogunjobi, who operates Toks out of his Los Angeles apartment,
didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The registration describes Ogunjobi as a naturalized U.S. citizen
born in London and educated at a Catholic school for boys in Nigeria,
his parents' homeland.</TE>
<TE>   The case is of interest to securities lawyers because the SEC
rarely suspends registration statements. The agency stopped using
such suspensions about 25 years ago because the process is so
cumbersome, requiring a detailed set of proceedings, said Richard
Rowe, a securities attorney with the law firm Proskauer Rose.</TE>

<HD>Insider Filings Pour Into SEC After Quarantine</HD>
<DH>Regulators: Postal Service delivers stock trade reports
delayed by anthrax incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Postal Service is belatedly delivering thousands of insider
stock transaction reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission--paper filings delayed when anthrax contaminated
Washington's postal center three months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The reports of executive stock trades from October through early
December are just now arriving at the SEC, where they are studied by
investors as a sign of how company insiders view the value of their
own companies' shares.</LD>
<LD>   "You can truly see what people are doing with their own funds,"
said Mark Buckingham, an analyst with Muzea Consulting, a firm that
tracks insider data for institutional investors. "If you believe in
your company and you are willing to put your money where your mouth
is, that is a stronger testament than words."</LD>
<TE>   About 1 million letters and packages were quarantined when the
Postal Service shut down Washington's Brentwood mail-sorting facility
on Oct. 21, after an envelope containing anthrax was delivered to the
office of Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Two Brentwood postal
workers died from inhalation anthrax in what authorities described as
a probable terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The quarantine and an irradiation treatment applied to Brentwood
letters created a backlog in paper filings going to the SEC and other
U.S. government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Some filings reached the SEC, but many did not. Now, the SEC is
dealing with a flood: In the first five business days of January, the
agency made public more than 1,400 documents known as Form 144s that
were originally mailed in October, November and early December.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the documents had turned yellow and brittle because of the
treatment to kill anthrax spores. Some of the filings crumbled in the
hands of document researchers who sift through the reports to gather
information for Wall Street brokerages and institutional investors.</TE>
<TE>   SEC filings are required to be made by top executives who buy and
sell shares in the companies that they run, as well as by large
shareholders and people who receive stock through private
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Insider reports are an exception to rules that require U.S.
corporations to file their disclosure reports through the SEC's
electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval (EDGAR) system. The
agency has yet to require electronic filing by insiders because it
believes that many lack the resources to use EDGAR.</TE>

<HD>Putnam to Close Fund to New Investors</HD>
<DH>Regulators: Postal Service delivers stock trade reports
delayed by anthrax incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Putnam Investments, the fourth-biggest U.S. mutual fund company, will
close its Small Cap Value Fund this month, making it the 11th
small-company stock fund to shut its doors to new investors in the
last year.</LD>
<LD>   The fund, managed by Edward Shadek and Sheldon Simon, has grown to
more than $1 billion in assets since it opened in May 1999. The fund
will close on Jan. 31, Putnam said.</LD>
<LD>   Many small-cap funds stop taking new investors before they reach
$500 million in assets because managers say it's harder to stay
nimble buying and selling stocks with too large an asset base.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest small-cap fund is the $12.4-billion Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock Fund, also a value-oriented fund. It remains open to
new investors.</TE>
<TE>   According to fund tracker Morningstar Inc., there are 501
small-cap funds, 132 of which are value-oriented, meaning they hunt
for stocks that appear undervalued relative to their earnings
potential.</TE>
<TE>   The small-value-fund category was the best performer in 2001 of
major fund categories tracked by Morningstar. The average small-value
fund rose 17.4%, compared with a 10.9% decline in the average
domestic U.S. fund and an 8.6% decline in the average small-growth
stock fund.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam Small Cap Value Fund gained 19% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Investors responded to small-value funds' strong performance last
year by shifting significant new money into the funds, fueling more
fund closings.</TE>
<TE>   Among the funds that closed to new investors in 2001 were Lord
Abbett Small-Cap Value, Wasatch Small Cap Value, American Century
Small Cap Value and Turner Small Cap Value.</TE>

<LD>Steve Spurrier is still responsible for big numbers, even after
resigning as Florida's coach. Mike Thomas of the Orlando Sentinel
reports at www.Poynter.org that the paper ran 17 pictures of
Spurrier, eight in color.</LD>
<LD>   Also: "We had stories on why Steve quit, who will replace him,
where Steve may go, what Steve's players think of Steve going. ... We
had columns on the reason Steve is going, the feud between Steve and
the 'Noles [Florida State] and the post-Steve mood in Gainesville.</LD>
<LD>   "We ran Steve's resignation letter, a list of Steve's 18 career

<TE>   Whoa! Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News writes that if the
Sacramento Kings can wrest the home-court advantage from the Lakers
in the playoffs, "they're the best bet to end the dynasty."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won back-to-back NBA championships after not
winning a title since 1988. That's a dynasty?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tick, tick: Jerry Colangelo, owner of the Phoenix Suns, says the
team has underachieved this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to believe this team is better than what it's shown," he
said. "I'm not pointing fingers at anyone. It's way too early to
throw grenades in the locker room or grenades at the team or coaching

<LD>I received an invitation to an event Wednesday announcing, "It's a
Red Dawn for the Anaheim Angels." I don't get invited to many places
anymore so I went.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously I was concerned, having seen the movie "Red Dawn"
starring Patrick Swayze, in which a Soviet-led invasion takes over
what we hold so dear, and now fearing we were about to be told Disney
has been overrun by communists.</LD>
<LD>   But the first thing I saw when I arrived was World Series-like
bunting--immediately making me angry because I had forgotten my
camera and I might never see this again at Edison Field. Then I
noticed a bunch of red balloons, red-dressed employees, red carpet,
800 school kids wearing red T-shirts, and got this sinking feeling
I'd made the wrong turn, and I was in Nebraska.</LD>
<TE>   I was further confused when I spotted a line forming at what I
thought was the Angels' ticket window. I asked the people in line why
anyone would buy Angel tickets, and each one told me the same thing:
They were there to buy seats for the monster truck show. I was
relieved, but I still could not be sure I wasn't in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS had a stage outside Edison Field, and had a hung a
sign: "THINK RED INSTEAD." The sign didn't make any sense. I know the
Angels lost 19 of their final 22 games so I could see: "STOP THE
BLEEDING," or knowing Disney's interest in the bottom line maybe:
"WE'RE IN THE RED AGAIN."</TE>
<TE>   But THINK RED INSTEAD of what? Tim Salmon's batting average?</TE>
<TE>   I was given a press release, explaining, "It's a Red Letter Day
for Orange County" because the Angels were announcing a new team logo
and uniform and were going to have school kids painting the Big A
outside the stadium red.</TE>
<TE>   I know what professional painters charge by the hour and Disney's
commitment to hiring cheap labor, but asking sixth graders to climb
to the top of the Big A for a T-shirt seemed a bit much. That's when
I ran into Rex Hudler, and while I expected Mr. Positive to tell me
not to worry and every tyke falling from the top of the Big A would
be caught--I noticed Garret Anderson was one of the fielders, and
everyone knows if it comes to making a diving catch, there's no way
he'd do it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT APPEARED the kids were being played for fools, invited to sit
as a cute audience while a bunch of politicians read off
proclamations declaring it was a great day in Angel history because
everyone would have to go to the team store and buy Angel
paraphernalia with the new logo.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the kids wore a "One Finger Painted the Town Red" T-shirt,
and fortunately by the time they understand what it really means to
paint the town red, someone will also have given them a "Just Say No"
T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   It was up to Hudler and Ed Arnold, the emcees for this Earl Scheib
special, to keep the kids' attention. Hudler introduced the kids from
the Walt Disney School, and told them they were special, "because
Walt Disney is 100 years old today." No one dies in Hudler's world,
of course, so I'm sure it was just an oversight when he didn't tell
the kids from the Dr. Albert Schweitzer School--Al is 126 years old
today.</TE>
<TE>   You could tell some of the kids had already been to an Angel game
because they weren't bothered by the fact nothing exciting was going
on. The two most recognizable Angels--Manager Mike Scioscia and the
Rally Monkey (and not necessarily in that order)--did not speak. That
left the microphone in the hands of Paul Pressler, who oversees the
Angels and Ducks for Disney, but apparently didn't get the Red Dawn
memo, because he wasn't even wearing a red tie.</TE>
<TE>   "We're incredibly thrilled to unveil our new look," Pressler said.
"We have a fantastic team and we're thrilled about it." Obviously it
doesn't take much to thrill this guy, which makes him the ideal
person to oversee the Ducks and Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler mentioned "The Hunt for Red October" while thrilling the
crowd, and I'll have to be honest with you--I have no idea what the
search for a Soviet submarine attempting to defect has to do with the
Angels. Unless it's Disney's way of telling us the franchise is
willing to sink even deeper if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS had a high school band playing, and blowers showering
the kids with red confetti when they unveiled the logo. A fire engine
arrived with the players, who modeled the uniforms. Anderson,
sporting the new home look, told the crowd, "It looks like a baseball
uniform," which tells me he came up with last year's Angels' slogan:
"It's about baseball."</TE>
<TE>   The wings have been replaced by a halo, although I would think
with this new emphasis on red, the devil's pitchfork would be more
appropriate--and a good indication of where this organization has
been the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   The new home uniform looks like something a team with the
nickname, "the Reds," might wear, while the road uniforms will have
"Anaheim" across the front. I was just happy to see it didn't say
"Nebraska."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE ceremony was over I stopped by the ticket office, but the
Angels' schedule for 2001 was still posted--despite the grand
marketing push to pump up the new season. I figured this would have
been the day to pass out new schedules to everyone, but I guess you
can't really blame them.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels open the 2002 season on April Fools' Day, which might
be hitting a little too close to home, and why they want you to THINK
WHITEWASH INSTEAD.</TE>

<HD>Bench Seating Assumes Priority Role for Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>On the road, the Laker reserves have to do more than score, rebound
and defend. They have to be cheerleaders as well.</LD>
<LD>   They can't dance as well as the Laker Girls, but they're making
their own contribution to the Lakers' success away from home.</LD>
<LD>   "At home, you get energy from the crowd," guard Brian Shaw said.
"You feed off your home crowd. When you're on the road, you know it's
just us. Everybody around the arena, especially in the close seats,
has something to say. We just look to one another for support--more
so than we do at home--to keep us together and keep us unified."</LD>
<TE>   "We take it seriously," forward Mark Madsen said after the Lakers
improved to 10-4 on the road with a 109-90 victory over the Indiana
Pacers at Conseco Fieldhouse Wednesday night. "There's nothing better
than getting a score or a rebound and just feeling or hearing the
bench just erupt. There's no better feeling. I appreciate it when I'm
out there making a play, and I think Shaq and Kobe appreciate it when
they're out there making plays. It's just a tight group. The
closeness of the group is what makes us very good right now."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone likes acknowledgment, whether it's a kid looking for her
parents at the piano recital or a superstar playing on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "You make a spectacular play, you point at them, you look at
them," said Kobe Bryant, who had the fellas howling and hollering
with a sweet reverse layup in the third quarter. "We get each other
pumped up that way. You can see the camaraderie that we have."</TE>
<TE>   Spectacular is all relative, of course. When guard Mitch Richmond
got his creaky legs together for a fastbreak dunk, it brought all of
the bench players out of their seats for one of their biggest cheers
of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Mess up, and it's cause for review. When Devean George failed to
spot an open Richmond on the break and took an ill-advised shot, he
got an earful from Robert Horry. Shaw and Lindsey Hunter spent the
next 30 seconds critiquing the play for themselves. They broke it
down like Statler and Waldorf, the cranky old critics on "The Muppet
Show," noting how you have to go to Richmond in that scenario,
especially after he had just made a three-pointer on his last shot.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Shaw spent most of the night sitting next to each
other. Hunter played 21 minutes, Shaw didn't see any playing time.
Laker Coach Phil Jackson asked him if he wanted to play the final
3:18 of the game, but Shaw said he felt cold and tight, so he stayed
in his comfortable chair at the end of the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some good leather on this seat," he said, rubbing it.</TE>
<TE>   There's a protocol that dictates seating assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "The person with the most seniority sits where they want, then it
just trickles down," Shaw said. "I like going to the end, because
sometimes the coaches stand up and they get in the way [up front].
You get a better vantage point from the end of the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Madsen has been sitting between George and Horry. He likes
sitting next to Horry so he can ask the nine-year veteran for tips on
playing power forward. (On Wednesday, for example, Horry told him not
to leave his man to double-team a point guard who is as skillful a
passer as Indiana's Jamaal Tinsley.)</TE>
<TE>   On the bench, as stationary targets, the players have to absorb
trash talk tossed their way by the fans. The Indiana fans spent most
of their time spewing venom at the referees Wednesday, so that made
it easier for the players. Besides, there wasn't much they could say
when the Lakers were pounding their team for the whole second half.</TE>
<TE>   It was hotter against the Detroit Pistons at the Palace of Auburn
Hills the night before.</TE>
<TE>   A fan behind the bench was getting on Bryant, so Madsen turned to
him and pointed at the scoreboard during a timeout. That only made
the heckler switch targets and start pouring it on Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   He told him: "Turn around one more time, see if you don't get
twisted up," Shaw recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I stepped up for [Madsen]. Then I talked about the guy so bad
that he apologized. I talked about how he looked. I told him he
looked like Jill Scott."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw found the locals much nicer at Conseco Fieldhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Some state congressmen had the Indiana Gas Company seats on the
baseline next to the Laker bench, and Shaw spent some time chatting
with state Sen. Bob Meeks, state Rep. Win Moses and Moses' wife,
Tammy.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had a playful, running feud with some fans seated across
the court from the Laker bench. They howled especially loud when
Bryant missed two open dunks in the second half. But when Bryant left
with 9:07 left in the fourth, there were 31 points next to his name
on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant walked to the bench, looked across the court at his rivals,
and put his hand to his ear. That didn't shut them up, so he
responded with a couple of words: "Two rings."</TE>
<TE>   Then Kobe tossed his wristband over his shoulder to a fan wearing
his jersey. Other players followed. It looked like they were feeding
the dolphins at Sea World. O'Neal threw a rolled-up towel toward
press row.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker superstars are spending quality time on the bench in the
fourth quarter lately, as the Lakers have won these three road games
by an average of 22.7 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," O'Neal said. "I'm resting, I'm chilling."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing he hasn't been able to do is work on his
synchronized head-bobbing routine that he and Hunter displayed during
a blowout in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We will," O'Neal said. "We're going to get it."</TE>
<TE>   In case you were wondering, it has a name.</TE>
<TE>   "Step, step, unh," O'Neal said, bobbing his head twice and then
snapping it to his left.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Enjoys Angel Additions</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Manager says Sele, Appier give team
'championship-caliber' pitching staff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said Wednesday that he likes his club's
look--and he wasn't referring to its new uniforms.</LD>
<LD>   As he watched several players model their redesigned game wear for
fans, local dignitaries and about 800 school children at Edison
Field, Scioscia focused on how two recent veteran additions have
bolstered the Angel pitching rotation.</LD>
<LD>   In two days last month, the club signed free-agent right-hander
Aaron Sele to a three-year, $24-million contract, and acquired
right-hander Kevin Appier from the New York Mets in a trade for Mo
Vaughn.</LD>
<TE>   Sele was 15-5 with a 3.60 earned-run average for Seattle last
season. Appier was 11-10 with a 3.57 ERA. They are set to join
young-but-promising Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott
Schoeneweis in a suddenly formidable five-man rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a championship-caliber staff and hopefully that is going
to make us contenders not only this year, but a perennial contender,"
Scioscia said. "I thought everyone did a good job targeting some
things we hoped to improve on. There are some things that still have
to come together, but I really feel that we've got the ingredients
that put us in position to contend in our division."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who are scheduled to begin spring training in
mid-February, finished third in the American League West last season,
41 games behind Seattle. And until lately, not much positive had
happened during the off-season. First, Vaughn surprised the team by
telling a Boston radio program that he wanted to leave the Angels and
return to play in the East. Then, at the winter meetings, a trade
that would have sent outfielder Darin Erstad to the Chicago White Sox
was nixed at the last minute by Disney executives above General
Manager Bill Stoneman.</TE>
<TE>   But then Sele signed, Appier was acquired and last week Paul
Pressler, who oversees the Angels as chairman of Disney's parks and
resorts division, acknowledged that the best way to attract fans to
Edison Field is with a winning team.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon said the signing of Sele and the trade for
Appier showed that Angel decision-makers are on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   "They are making the right moves," Salmon said. "They made their
assessment--that we need pitching--and they are going out and doing
what they need to get it.</TE>
<TE>   "As a player, I'm pretty comfortable with that direction."</TE>
<TE>   So is third baseman Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all played this game our entire lives to win, and we play
because it's fun," Glaus said. "When you're losing it's not fun. For
an organization to set forth that they are going to do what it takes
to win, that's what we all want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Pressler, who has seen attendance fall 25% the last three seasons,
said: "I think we've given the fans hope this year. We've set
ourselves up for success."</TE>
<TE>   The improved pitching staff will no doubt help the Angels'
chances, but questions on offense remain. Last season, the Angels
ranked 11th in the American League in batting and 12th in runs.
Salmon struggled through injuries and batted a career-low .227 with
17 home runs and 49 runs batted in. Erstad, who batted .355 in 2000,
also tried to play through injuries and hit .258 with nine homers and
63 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing we're looking for is for guys like Tim Salmon
and Darin Erstad to rebound," Scioscia said. "If they get close to
what you're looking for in terms of their average stats, we'll be in
good shape."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said he is feeling, "healthy and strong," and plans to
regain previous form.</TE>
<TE>   "If I come back with my normal numbers, that's like picking up
another player," he said. "Troy is going to give you the big numbers
and Garret [Anderson] is too."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, however, are still searching for a few missing pieces.
They bid unsuccessfully for the right to negotiate with Japanese
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   They could move Erstad to first base and try to add another
outfielder, or leave switch-hitting Scott Spiezio at first.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Kenny Lofton and first baseman Andres Galarraga are
among the available free agents.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many of the guys still out there are going to
have a major impact on us," Scioscia said.</TE>

<HD>Selig Wants Players to Accept a Luxury Tax</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig asked players Wednesday to accept a
luxury tax that would slow the increase of salaries and proposed that
teams vastly increase the amount of local revenue they share.</LD>
<LD>   Selig spoke for nearly four hours during a bargaining session at
major league baseball's headquarters in New York and explained
management's central economic proposals for a labor contract to
replace the agreement that expired Nov. 7.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing eight players and lawyers from union and management,
Selig asked for a 50% luxury tax on the amounts of payrolls above $98
million, according to three people familiar with the meeting who
spoke on the condition they not be identified.</LD>
<TE>   Selig also proposed that teams put 50% of their locally generated
revenue, after deductions for ballpark expenses, in a pool that is
redistributed equally to all teams, up from 20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees, who generated the most revenue among the 30
major league teams last year at $242 million, would pay an additional
$36 million to the other teams next year under the plan Selig
outlined.</TE>
<TE>   One management projection estimated the tax would affect four or
five teams next season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Selig told players that owners would like a worldwide
draft, which would eliminate the ability of Cuban defectors to become
free agents and gain the leverage that has gotten many multimillion
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides were guarded in their comments.</TE>
<TE>   "Bud outlined his basic position, as did we," union head Donald
Fehr said. "There have been a lot of preliminary discussions. Neither
party was surprised. It was a workmanlike initial meeting. I really
don't want to characterize the substance of the discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, management's top labor lawyer, called it "a full
constructive day."</TE>
<TE>   Players are happy with the current system of free agency and
salary arbitration, which has existed with little change since 1976,
boosting the average salary from $51,500 to $2.14 million in a
quarter century, a period in which baseball's revenue increased from
$182 million to $3.55 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Under the labor agreement that covered 1996 to 2001, the union
agreed to a luxury tax for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 season, but owners
regarded it as largely ineffectual.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seven members of the Dodgers' 40-man roster showed up for the
club's first winter workout--starting pitcher Eric Gagne, relief
pitcher Matt Herges, catchers Paul Lo Duca and Chad Kreuter, right
fielder Shawn Green and utility players Dave Hansen and Dave Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans would not elaborate on any potential
trade of Gary Sheffield or the possibility of the outfielder still
being a Dodger when the team meets in Vero Beach, Fla., next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get through it," Evans said, "and I'm confident that when
it's all said and done, we'll be a good ball club again."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Billy Wagner agreed to a $27-million, three-year contract
with the Houston Astros.... The St. Louis Cardinals turned to Japan
to fill a vacancy in the outfield, agreeing to a three-year contract
with So Taguchi worth about $3 million.... Reliever Mark Wohlers
signed a two-year, $4-million contract with the Cleveland Indians....
Infielder Craig Counsell re-signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks for
three years at $7.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez has been throwing without
pain for three weeks and is expected to be ready for spring training,
Manager Joe Kerrigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kerrigan, who was promoted from pitching coach when Jimy
Williams was fired in August, has not spoken to Martinez since the
end of the season, the Red Sox ace has been in touch with the team's
trainer and strength coach.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was 7-1 with a 1.44 earned-run average on Memorial Day,
but he went on the disabled list with inflammation in his rotator
cuff. He returned to make two starts in August, but he clearly wasn't
the same pitcher who had won three Cy Young Awards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three former umpires who lost their jobs as part of a failed mass
resignation in 1999 are each suing major league baseball for at least
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Kaiser, Dale Ford and Mark Johnson sued Monday in U.S.
District Court in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul O'Neill will become an analyst for the New York Yankees' new
YES Network this season, the first since his retirement as a player.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Padres filed a lawsuit in San Diego Superior Court accusing
Bruce Henderson of malicious prosecution, saying Henderson filed
"baseless" lawsuits to stall stadium construction.</TE>

<HD>At Least Duke's Logic Is Unbeatable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Duke won't go undefeated.</LD>
<LD>   You didn't really imagine the Blue Devils would, did you?</LD>
<LD>   The last team to go unbeaten and win the NCAA title was Indiana,
in 1976.</LD>
<TE>   Just to remind us all how long that has been, consider that Scott
May, one of the stars of that team, will have a son playing for North
Carolina next season.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas made the last run at a perfect season, winning 34
games by an average of 27.6 points with Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony
and Stacey Augmon before losing to Duke in the semifinals of the 1991
Final Four and disappearing into a swirl of NCAA trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The point is, yes, somebody might pull off an undefeated season
again, but it's nothing to wager on.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "[But]
that was never a goal and has never been a goal of mine. I think it's
a ridiculous goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time we want to be undefeated is when we're playing for
the national championship."</TE>
<TE>   These days, until a team makes it through the first round of
conference play in hostile environments against teams that know each
other inside and out, don't waste your speculation. It wasn't
coincidence that the last of the unbeatens--Duke, Miami, Oklahoma
State and Virginia--fell as conference play began.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise was that Duke didn't lose to Maryland or Virginia or
even Wake Forest or North Carolina State, but to Florida State--a
team that lost to American four games earlier.</TE>
<TE>   And Florida State didn't win by shooting lights out: It took only
five three-pointers and shot 44.6% overall to fell the Blue Devils.</TE>
<TE>   Count on this: Until Jason Williams--still the best player in the
country--starts making free throws down the stretch, fouling him
might be almost as common a strategy as Hack-a-Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' 0-for-6 performance was alarming.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a complete anomaly either.</TE>
<TE>   The player who will have the ball in his hands down the stretch
more than any other is shooting only 64.4% from the line, and shot
only 65.9% last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen every player miss free throws. I think it's called
being a human being," Krzyzewski said. "You're 20 and you're going to
miss. These kids are not machines.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased he had the courage to take it to the basket and get
fouled. I'll live with that."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Duhon, the Blue Devils' other terrific guard, has been to
the line only 18 times but has struggled too, shooting only 61.1%.</TE>
<TE>   As a team, Duke shoots 67.7%, fourth in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   So Duke lost a game, and such weaknesses as free-throw shooting,
rebounding, and surprisingly enough, defense, become fodder for
future game plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils can lose a few more and still be considered the
best team in the country. But no team is remembered as the best
unless it wins the NCAA championship. It would be a shame if Duke
lost one from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Krzyzewski doesn't act alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few teams, very few people play every game to maximum
intensity. That's your goal, but you don't always achieve it. Last
year's team didn't do it either, and we won the national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long season. Each team has to develop.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is, let's get on to the next play."</TE>
<TE>   There's one less thing for the Blue Devils to worry about, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "There were the only undefeated team, and that's pressure," said
Maryland Coach Gary Williams, whose fourth-ranked Terrapins meet Duke
for the first time this season Jan. 17. "Now they get the opportunity
to go play without the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "For Duke, it might be a positive. It certainly gets everyone's
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "For the league, it gives you hope. If you play really well like
Florida State, you have an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Leave the last word to Krzyzewski: "You don't get a trophy for
winning all your games--unless it's the last game."</TE>
<TE>   Gooden Plenty</TE>
<TE>   Kansas benefited from Duke's loss, becoming No. 1 in the
Associated Press poll.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that, along with the Jayhawks' CBS game against UCLA at
Pauley Pavilion on Saturday, will give Drew Gooden the notice he
deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden is the nation's leading rebounder at 12.5 a game and
entered the week as the Big 12's leading scorer, averaging 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Already this season, he has 11 double-doubles, including six in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   You decide which was most impressive: a 30-point, 18-rebound
performance against Valparaiso that included 11 offensive rebounds
and five assists, or a 25-point, 21-rebound game against South
Carolina State that made him the first Kansas player since Dave
Robisch in 1971 to have a 20-20 game.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Rim</TE>
<TE>   Oregon takes over the title of most intriguing Pacific 10 team
from Arizona, beating the Wildcats for the second time, 90-80, this
time in Tucson. The Ducks completed their first sweep against Arizona
since 1982-83--only to lose at Arizona State before going home.
"Frankly, the two times we've played them they've been the best team
we've played against all year long," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said.
"That includes Maryland and Florida at that stage." (That also
includes Kansas, which also defeated Arizona in Tucson.) "They're a
very solid, solid basketball team that without any doubt is going to
challenge for the top spot [in the Pac-10]," Olson said.... Arizona
expects to have Luke Walton, the Wildcats' leading rebounder and a
key component to the team chemistry, back from an Achilles' tendon
injury for its trip to play the Washington schools. Walton sat out
three games, and without his passing and inside play, Arizona
struggled.... Memphis super freshman Dajuan Wagner gets all the
notice, but the leading scorer in the country--not only among
freshmen--is Virginia Military Institute's Jason Conley, averaging
28.1 points.... Kentucky's attempt to block center Marvin Stone's
transfer to Louisville is a tremendous display of pettiness. The
Lexington Herald-Leader took Kentucky to task, skewering Kentucky's
"unwritten policy" by noting two athletes in other sports who were
given releases to transfer to Louisville. Writes John Clay: "It is
hereby our policy that whenever a basketball player does not live up
to his high school clippings, and the player wants to transfer to a
school coached by a former Kentucky coach, who once owned horses with
the current Kentucky athletics director, that player should not be
allowed to do so." And the last line: "It is our policy that we are
The University of Kentucky, and you're just going to have to live
with it."</TE>

rebounded from a loss to UC Riverside with a victory over Cal State
Fullerton. Senior guard Ron Johnson is averaging 12.5 points and is
fifth in the Big West in steals with 25. Idaho guard Justin Logan
played all 80 minutes in the Vandals' games against UC Santa Barbara
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine (10-4, 3-0) at Utah State (11-2, 3-1), 8, ESPN2, KUCI-FM
(88.9)--In a pivotal conference matchup, the Anteaters must prove
they can win in one of the toughest arenas. The Aggies have won 31 in
a row at home and 76 of their last 79, including a 67-52 victory over
Irvine last season.</TE>

<HD>Connecticut Leaves Opponents Smarting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that Connecticut has settled the question of which is the best
team in the country by throttling second-ranked Tennessee, the rest
of the country have until the end of March to find a way to beat the
Huskies.</LD>
<LD>   That great Connecticut team everybody expected to steamroller
women's college basketball after winning the 2000 NCAA title but was
stopped by Notre Dame in the 2001 Final Four?</LD>
<LD>   This year's edition may meet those expectations, as evidenced by
Saturday's 86-72 victory.</LD>
<TE>   Seniors Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams, and
sophomore Diana Taurasi are more than a well-oiled machine. They are
a seamless entity, satisfied in their roles, unselfish in their play,
and united in their cause to win the national championship that
eluded Connecticut last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The other four play like seniors," Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt
said. "Taurasi plays like a graduate student. They all play with
great intelligence. When something breaks down, they know where they
need to be and how they need to counter."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Geno Auriemma knows he has something special. "When you have
four seniors that are pretty smart in their own right, and Diana may
be the smartest young player we've ever had, you can do certain
things to take advantage of how the game's being played. And I'm
fortunate to have the kind of kids who can do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies also showed the Volunteers a thing or two about effort
and desire in big games. "They played physical and with a lot of
heart," Tennessee center Michelle Snow said. "They wanted every
rebound and loose ball, and they got them. That was something we
hadn't seen as much from other teams."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's still one game. Unless some other Big East team
rises in league or conference tournament play, the Huskies won't face
another ranked team until the NCAA tournament. Tennessee will have
plenty more high-level Southeastern Conference competition to get
through for another shot at Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   As good as they are, the Huskies don't want any comparisons to the
2000 team, or the 1995 NCAA champion that went 35-0. It's too early
for that.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to just keep focusing on what we want to
get done for this year," Jones said. "We have to get better every
day, and the team will be reminded of that by the seniors. They
understand how to win and how to lose."</TE>
<TE>   So what did the showdown mean for women's basketball?</TE>
<TE>   "It means we're all chasing Connecticut right now," Summitt said.
"And it may be a marathon. But we hope to finish the race."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One reason Connecticut has won three of the five meetings played
at Tennessee's Thompson-Boling Arena is an inspirational speech given
by senior forward Paige Sauer on Jan. 8, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came down here as sophomores," Cash said, "Paige really
got in our faces because she wanted to win so bad. As a sophomore you
don't really know what's involved. But the look on her face was like,
'We better win down here or don't get back on the plane.' And she was
somebody who didn't play.</TE>
<TE>   "So [Saturday] I did the same thing to the younger players coming
out before the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just a thought: Bird, a guard, figures to be the first or second
player chosen in the WNBA draft in April. And even though she scored
only 12 points against Tennessee, she did not hurt herself in the
scouts' eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Snow is a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   She is considered an inside player, yet she had no inside presence
against Connecticut despite her 6-5 height. She has time to regain a
prime spot in the draft, but the loss and her play had to damage her
pro prospects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC dodged a devastating loss when Tiffany Elmore's injured ankle
turned out to be a bad sprain instead of a fracture. Nonetheless,
Elmore will sit out the UCLA game Sunday, and there is no target date
for her return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's 14-1 start (best in 32 years) and 11-game winning
streak became more credible after the Wildcats beat fourth-ranked
Iowa State and seventh-ranked Baylor last week. It was the first time
Kansas State had ever beaten two top-10 teams in consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The wins moved the Wildcats into the rankings at No. 14--the
highest debut during a season since the poll was expanded from 20 to
25 teams in 1989.</TE>

<HD>Issue of a Rival for Tiger Is Still Nothing Major</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here we go again. Somebody wins a tournament that Tiger Woods is
playing and you've got the New Rival or The Gap is Closing. It
happened again last week at the season-opening Mercedes
Championships, where Sergio Garcia won in a playoff with David Toms,
thus establishing an even more hackneyed story line as it relates to
Woods (which everything in golf does) ... New Old Rival.</LD>
<LD>   Remember when 19-year-old Garcia challenged 23-year-old Woods at
the 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah--which Woods won, by the way?
Why, it would be El Nino vs. El Tigre for years to come, no?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, not. Of course, that may happen, just not until Garcia
beats Woods in a major. And at the present time, Tiger leads in that
department, six majors to zero.</LD>
<TE>   There always seems to be a huge rush to push somebody in Tiger's
way (hello, David Duval), and because everyone loves comparisons,
check out where Woods and Garcia both stood at age 22. By the way,
Garcia turned 22 Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   By his 22nd birthday, Woods had won six PGA Tour events--four in
1997--including the Masters. Garcia has three--the Mercedes, plus the
Colonial and the Buick Classic last year.</TE>
<TE>   If you go by statistics alone, Garcia had a semi-comparable year
to Woods in 2001. Woods won five tournaments, the money title and had
the best scoring average, but Garcia was close behind Woods in
scoring and was a much better putter (No. 24 to Woods' No. 124).</TE>
<TE>   Before he turned 26 two weeks ago, Woods won 29 PGA Tour events.
Sergio has three years to win 23 more to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Tiger is in New Zealand collecting a $2-million
appearance fee and Garcia is in Honolulu at the Sony Open. The next
time Woods and Garcia will be face to face is at Pebble Beach Jan.
31-Feb. 3. Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   Face Time</TE>
<TE>   From Hale Irwin, 57, on 17-year-old Ty Tryon, who makes his debut
as a card-carrying PGA Tour member in two weeks at the Phoenix Open:</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 17, I was looking in the mirror wondering when those
pimples were going to go away."</TE>
<TE>   More Irwin</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, who is playing in the Senior Skins in two weeks, thinks
Tryon should have stayed in school.</TE>
<TE>   "Those years in school give you a maturation you just can't get
otherwise. I think you need to be in your peer group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The tour is not normal. The traveling is not normal. And, God
forbid, if he ever gets a health problem, what would he fall back on?</TE>
<TE>   "We are shortsighted in seeing the great success he has had. I
worry more for the individual than I do whether or not he is going to
make a big splash on the tour.... Somewhere along the line, that
education is really helpful."</TE>
<TE>   The Economist</TE>
<TE>   All right, so we're in a recession. And that extends to the Senior
PGA Tour as well, according to Irwin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are issues out there," he said. "Are we losing some
sponsorships? Do we have sponsors who are wobbling? Yeah. Look at the
number of people who have lost their jobs. I don't think we're in
worse shape than anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Is that supposed to be comforting?</TE>
<TE>   Phil of It</TE>
<TE>   Remember Phil Mickelson? Sure you do. Lefty, makes a mint on his
off-course bets, makes a mint on it (for that matter), still trying
to win a major. It's just that we haven't seen much of Mickelson
lately, if you don't count the air time he got during Game 7 of the
World Series when the Fox cameras found him in the box seats ...
instead of defending his title at the Tour Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, however, was a new father--his second daughter was born
Oct. 23--so he gets some slack. But Mickelson still wasn't working
last week at the season-opening Mercedes Championships and hasn't
played an official event since Aug. 26, a mere 41/2-month layoff that
ends next week when he tees it up at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
If the Hope seems like an odd place for Mickelson to show up, it is
... sort of. He has played it three other times in his nine-year
career, but only once (in 2000 when he tied for 16th) since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Food Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Noted chef Wolfgang Puck to open a restaurant in a 640
square-foot tent between the third and ninth holes at Riviera during
the Nissan Open.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Suddenly, players will find those bogeys on No. 3 and
No. 9 no longer leave a bad taste in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Birthday Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Ben Crenshaw turns 50 on Friday and will make his
Senior PGA Tour debut in three weeks at the Royal Caribbean Classic
at Key Biscayne, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: If he's 50, then that blade putter of his is eligible
for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   It's a Grueling Job</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour moves from Maui to Oahu this week for the Sony Open,
but the players who were at the Mercedes are probably going through
some withdrawal this week.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't just pampered at the Ritz-Carlton at Kapalua, they
were everything but powdered.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only the greeting at check-in with scented oshibori
towels, it was the "bath butler" who was available to draw a bubble
bath that included music, a towel warmer, champagne and chocolate
truffles.</TE>
<TE>   Different Too</TE>
<TE>   From Joe Durant, defending champion at the Hope, about the pro-am
format: "It's quite an eclectic mix of people."</TE>
<TE>   Eclectic? Usually, when an athlete uses that word, he's describing
a light bulb.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   The SBC Senior Classic, to be played March 1-3 at Valencia Country
Club, is looking for volunteers. Details: (661) 295-4690.</TE>
<TE>   Another one bites the dust? For 2003, Anheuser-Busch is
reconsidering its sponsorship of the Michelob Championship on the PGA
Tour, a tournament that has been held in Williamsburg, Va., for 21
years and has had the brewery as a sponsor since 1977.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't get much attention, but Justin Leonard's signing to use
a Precept ball is noteworthy because he has been a major endorser
with Titleist since he turned pro in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The new name of the Nabisco Championship (formerly the Nabisco
Dinah Shore, the Colgate Dinah Shore) is the Kraft Nabisco
Championship. The tournament will be played March 28-31 at Mission
Hills Country Club.</TE>

<HD>De La Hoya, Vargas Will Meet at Last</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Longtime bitter rivals need only to work out
details for May 4 bout in Las Vegas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of trading trash talk and menacing stares, Oscar De La
Hoya and Fernando Vargas have finally agreed to trade punches in the
ring.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for both fighters concluded a deal Wednesday for De La
Hoya and Vargas, both Southern California fighters, to meet May 4 in
a pay-per-view match to be held, if final details can be worked out,
at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Barring any last-minute snags, the contracts will be signed today.
De La Hoya is guaranteed $14 million for the match, Vargas $6 million
with additional revenue for each fighter based on the pay-per-view
numbers.</LD>
<TE>   Still to be determined is if the titles of the two 154-pound
champions--De La Hoya is the World Boxing Council titleholder, Vargas
the World Boxing Assn. champion--will be on the line. De La Hoya must
decide if he will pay the sanctioning fees and Vargas must get an
exemption from fighting WBA mandatory challenger Mamadou Thiam.</TE>
<TE>   The fight reunites De La Hoya with promoter Bob Arum. The two had
an ugly, name-calling split after De La Hoya's loss to Shane Mosley
in 2000. A court ruled De La Hoya could break his contract with Arum.
Arum appealed that decision but will drop that appeal when he and De
La Hoya sign a new multi-fight deal, which is expected to happen in
the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, De La Hoya and Arum had dinner at a Las Vegas
restaurant, their first face-to-face meeting since the day after the
Mosley fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be even more fun the second time around," De La Hoya told
Arum.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so bad the first time, De La Hoya earning $125 million
in the ring under Arum's guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very emotional," Arum said of the dinner. "I was
determined to break the ice and we had a great time. It just seemed
natural to be back together."</TE>
<TE>   There was also euphoria over Wednesday's agreement on Vargas'
side.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic," said Gary Shaw, Vargas' promoter. "I'm high as a
kite. This is a fight the boxing public wants. I feel so good I may
even spend tonight listening to Oscar sing on his CD.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fight should be named Bad Blood, because there is a
lot of bad blood between these two and that blood is going to begin
to boil."</TE>

<HD>Westlake's Stavro Doesn't Miss a Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Injuries sidelined Steve Stavro of Westlake Village Westlake High for
several games during the first three weeks of the boys' soccer
season, but the center forward had become an integral part of the
Warriors' offense entering Wednesday night's game against Moorpark.</LD>
<LD>   Strained tendons in his right ankle and a strained abdominal
muscle had sidelined Stavro, but he had six goals and an assist in
five games of the Simi Valley Royal tournament last week.</LD>
<LD>   "My injuries were gone and my confidence was up," Stavro said when
asked about his offensive outburst. "I was able to move about without
any limitations."</LD>
<TE>   Stavro was a part-time starter last season on a 7-10-4 Westlake
team, but he undertook an off-season training program that included
weight lifting and running.</TE>
<TE>   The regimen helped Stavro shed 10 pounds from his 5-foot-11,
185-pound frame, improved the strength in his upper and lower body
and left him feeling stronger and faster than he'd ever been.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely in better shape," Coach Bill Propster said. "He's
always been enthusiastic, but this year he's even more excited about
playing soccer."</TE>
<TE>   With eight goals and two assists, Stavro is one of Westlake's top
offensive weapons, but he said there were plenty of reasons why
Westlake was 11-1-3 entering its match against Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of strong players on our team," he said. "Our team
is doing pretty good because we have a lot of players playing well
together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lucky break: Westlake defeated Woodland Hills El Camino Real in a
shootout in the ninth-place game of the Royal tournament, but
Propster said the Warriors could have lost that game if not for an
incorrect call by a referee that credited Todd Slater with a goal.</TE>
<TE>   According to Propster, Slater took a shot that hit the outside of
the goal post and bounced downward on the outward side of the net.
But the referee ruled it a goal, giving Westlake a 1-0 lead in a game
that was tied, 1-1, after regulation play.</TE>
<TE>   "Their players were saying, 'It's not a goal. It's not a goal,'''
Propster said. "And I agreed. I tried to tell the referee that the
ball didn't go in, but he didn't seem to want to hear that from me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back in goal: El Camino Real (11-3-3) has been without senior
goalkeeper Raul Calderon for 13 games this season, but the defending
City Section champions hope to have him for the remainder of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon, who had 19 shutouts as a junior, missed the first seven
games of the season while he was rehabilitating a broken foot and
missed the last six while he was in Germany, playing with a U.S.
Olympic development team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injury report: An MRI exam has revealed that junior forward Matt
Basin of Santa Margarita suffered a partial tear of the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee during the Puma Invitational
tournament in Tampa, Fla., last month.</TE>
<TE>   Basin, an All-Southern Section Division III second-team pick last
season, has missed the last 10 games because of the injury, but Coach
Curt Bauer hopes to have him back for a Jan. 30 game against Santa
Ana Mater Dei, the defending Division II champion.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgia hadn't beaten Kentucky in 16 meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Jarvis Hayes and Ezra Williams were determined to make sure the
eighth-ranked Wildcats weren't going to win a 17th in a row.</LD>
<LD>   The two combined to shoot 19 of 32 from the field and made key
baskets down the stretch as the Bulldogs beat Kentucky, 88-84,
Wednesday at Lexington, Ky.</LD>
<TE>   Hayes scored a career-high 30 points and Williams added 20 as
Georgia (13-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference)  stopped the losing
streak and won in Lexington for only the third time in history.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew coming in it was going to be tough," said Hayes, who was
12 of 18 from the field. "We knew with the crowd on their side, we'd
have to come in and make a statement. I think we did.''</TE>
<TE>   Jules Camara had a career-high 16 points for Kentucky (9-4), which
lost its second in a row and dropped to 0-2 in the Southeastern
Conference for the first time since 1978-79.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing well defensively and we're not making plays,"
said Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith, a former Georgia coach. "We lack the
toughness to make the clutch plays down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Kansas 96, Nebraska 57--Nick Collison had 20 points and 13
rebounds as the Jayhawks (13-1, 2-0 Big 12) opened the game with a
25-4 run en route to victory at Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks, who replaced Duke atop the AP poll this week and
have won 13 in a row, connected on their first six three-pointers and
11 of their first 13 shots in taking a 57-24 halftime lead over
Nebraska (7-6, 0-2).</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Florida 104, Tennessee 100--Brett Nelson scored 20 points,
including two key free throws and a three-pointer in overtime, to
help the Gators (13-1, 2-0 SEC) extend their winning streak to 12
games by beating the Volunteers (6-7, 1-1) at Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Florida, which had six players score in double figures, trailed by
three points with 10 seconds left in regulation before Nelson's
three-pointer with 3.1 seconds to go tied it at 94 to force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Higgins tied it in overtime, but Nelson's fourth three-pointer
put Florida ahead for good, 99-96.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Hamilton led Florida with 22 points and 10 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Yarbrough scored a game-high 26 points for the Volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Maryland 112, North Carolina 79--Juan Dixon had 29 points at
College Park, Md., as the Terrapins (12-2, 2-0 Atlantic Coast
Conference) cruised past the Tar Heels (5-7, 1-2), Maryland's most
lopsided victory in the 79-year-old rivalry and the most points ever
allowed by North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The margin of victory easily eclipsed Maryland's 25-point rout of
North Carolina in February 1939.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 84, No. 9 Illinois 75--Rodney Smith had 17 points to lead
six Boilermakers (9-8, 1-2) in double figures as they avoided their
first 0-3 start in the Big Ten in 38 years by beating the Illini
(12-4, 1-2) at West Lafayette, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Williams led Illinois with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Iowa 70, Northwestern 60--Reggie Evans scored 21 points and
Luke Recker added 20 to lead the Hawkeyes (13-4, 2-1 Big Ten) past
the Wildcats (8-5, 0-2) at Iowa City.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Alabama 92, Vanderbilt 79--Erwin Dudley scored a
season-high 24 points and the Crimson Tide (14-2, 2-0 SEC) made 31 of
36 free throws in the second half to beat the Commodores (10-5, 0-2)
at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Boston College 88, Villanova 81--Troy Bell sank a floater
in the lane with 6.5 seconds left in regulation to send the game into
overtime and finished with 36 points as the Eagles (13-2, 2-1 Big
East) escaped at Villanova, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Villanova (9-3, 2-1) turned the ball over five times in overtime.
All its losses have been in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State 71, No. 17 Missouri 67--Tyray Pearson scored a
career-high 28 points, Jake Sullivan added 20 and the Cyclones (9-7,
1-1 Big 12) made one key shot after another down the stretch in
beating the Tigers (11-4, 1-1) at Ames, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Rush broke out of a shooting slump to lead Missouri with 29
points.</TE>

<HD>No X-Rays as Brand's Elbow Improves</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Clippers decided against sending power forward Elton Brand to get
his sore right elbow X-rayed Wednesday. His elbow has improved,
although it's still not 100%. He continues to receive treatments.</LD>
<LD>   Brand is expected to play tonight against the New Jersey Nets, the
third stop on the Clippers' six-game trip. His elbow didn't keep him
from helping to ring the opening bell Wednesday at the American Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Teammate Corey Maggette, Coach Alvin Gentry and assistant Rex
Kalamian joined Brand. They were cheered by traders at the exchange
and pressed for autographs.</LD>
<TE>   Later, the players and coaches viewed ground zero in lower
Manhattan, site of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They also visited
a nearby fire station.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Quentin Richardson was selected to play in the
rookies vs. second-season players game during the NBA's all-star
weekend next month in Philadelphia. But Darius Miles was not, which
upset Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand the selection process," Gentry said. "If it's
something that's done on stats.... How does anybody select anything
based on stats? If the fans don't select them and the coaches don't
select them.... I think it's unfair to the kid. He's worked hard and
he's still only 20 years old."</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons removed from East St. Louis (Ill.) High, Miles is
averaging 8.4 points and 5.5 rebounds. Richardson, who left DePaul
after his sophomore season, is averaging 13.6 points and has made 64
of 155 shots from beyond the three-point arc (41.3%).</TE>

<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570), delayed at 6:30.</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 18-17, Nets 22-11.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Nets--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Atlantic Division-leading Nets haven't exactly
captured the imagination of local fans at the expense of the
struggling New York Knicks, who are 14-20 and in sixth place. Only
8,195 showed up Tuesday at the Meadowlands to watch the Nets defeat
the Miami Heat, 104-95. Kenyon Martin served the second game of his
two-game suspension for mugging Tracy McGrady of the Orlando Magic
last week. Martin is eligible to play tonight. The Clippers lost to
Philadelphia and Washington in the first two games of the trip. They
also play Friday at Charlotte, Sunday at Toronto and Tuesday at
Minnesota. The Clippers are 2-10 on the road.</TE>

<HD>Speed Thrills in First Round</HD>
<DH>Ice dancing: Lang and Tchernyshev, trying for fourth title
in row, take the lead despite flaws. Couple in second ineligible for
Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skating noticeably faster and with more flair than their competitors,
Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev easily waltzed and glided their way
into first place after the first round of ice dancing competition at
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Wednesday night at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Lang and Tchernyshev, three-time defending champions, weren't
flawless but were the leaders in both rounds of compulsories. All the
couples first skated the Ravensburger waltz and then the blues.</LD>
<LD>   In the second dance, Tchernyshev lost his edge and nearly slipped,
but the slight bobble was more than compensated for by the greater
speed and more intricate steps performed by the couple.</LD>
<TE>   "We were a little rusty today," Lang said, "because we haven't
competed in half a year." The Russian-born Tchernyshev, who gained
his U.S. citizenship in 2000 to make the couple Olympic-eligible, was
sidelined all fall because of shin splints. This kept Lang, 23, and
Tchernyshev, 30, out of their Grand Prix assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Lang and Tchernyshev are trying to become the first to win four
consecutive U.S. titles since Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert won
five in a row from 1981 through 1985.</TE>
<TE>   In second place after the compulsories, which count for 20% of the
final score, are Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto. Belbin, 17, is
from Kirland, Canada, so she and Agosto, 19, are ineligible for
either of the two U.S. Olympic ice dancing spots.</TE>
<TE>   When Belbin and Agosto became a team three years, Agosto said that
"we never thought it would even be a factor for this Olympics. We
weren't thinking of 2002 as an option. Now everybody keeps asking
about how it feels [to be ineligible] and it's almost mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   Belbin said she and Agosto are trying to think only of placing
well in these national championships even while everybody else is
concentrating on the Olympics. "We're here to enjoy this," Belbin
said, "and to focus on doing what we love well."</TE>
<TE>   In third place are Beata Handra of San Rafael and Charles Sinek of
Lexington, Mass. Handra and Sinek finished fourth at last year's
nationals. Last year's bronze medalists, Jessica Joseph and Brandon
Forsyth are in fifth place. Forsyth said that he and Joseph "are
still getting our legs. The real competition starts [Thursday]."</TE>
<TE>   Forsyth would be referring to the original dance, which counts for
30% of the final score. The free dance, which counts for 50%, is
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Win Bid for Ishii</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Pitching coach Colborn says 28-year-old Japanese
left-hander is a smaller version of Randy Johnson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In introducing Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii to fans Wednesday,
Dodger pitching Coach Jim Colborn offered an encouraging comparison.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a scaled-down version of Randy Johnson," Colborn said.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii stands 6 feet 2, not 6-10. His fastball tops 90 mph but
never hits 100 mph. He does not come equipped with scraggly hair or a
Cy Young Award. But he is a left-handed pitcher who does not hide
behind breaking balls.</LD>
<TE>   "He's not a touchy-feely pitcher like Tom Glavine," said Colborn,
who became familiar with Ishii when he worked in Japan. "He goes
after the hitters."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, he likely will do so in Dodger blue. The Dodgers won
negotiating rights to Ishii, outbidding the Angels, New York Mets,
Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners by agreeing to pay $11.3 million
to the Yakult Swallows, Ishii's Japanese club.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' rights expire in 30 days, but neither the team nor
Ishii's agent anticipates difficult negotiations. The Dodgers are
expected to sign Ishii to a three-year contract worth at least $11
million.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Urbon, the agent for Ishii, said the pitcher was "elated" that
the Dodgers won his rights. Ishii, whose wife formerly lived in Los
Angeles, wanted to pitch for the Dodgers, Angels or Mariners. That
desire helped persuade Dodger Chairman Bob Daly to approve a high
bid.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of Ishii, General Manager Dan Evans has
reconstructed the Dodger pitching rotation. Where the club had Chan
Ho Park, Terry Adams, James Baldwin and Terry Mulholland, they could
open this season with Ishii, Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby, Hideo Nomo and
Omar Daal.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest beneficiary could be Matt Herges, or whoever replaces
him as the setup man if the Dodgers cannot find a closer and must use
Herges in that role. He wore down as last season wore on, so Evans
made it a priority to acquire starters capable of pitching into the
seventh and eighth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo pitched 198 innings last season, Daal 186 and Ishii 175.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scouted Ishii extensively last summer, when he often
spoke of his desire to pursue a major league career. The Dodgers made
no effort to retain Park, Adams or Baldwin, all of whom filed for
free agency. Park signed a five-year, $65-million contract with the
Texas Rangers, but Adams and Baldwin remain unsigned.</TE>
<TE>   "As early as July and August, we evaluated Ishii ahead of those
two," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said that Brown and Ashby, each recovering from surgery, are
expected to be ready for opening day. With Ishii, Evans said, the
Dodgers need not be tempted to push Brown or Ashby if either pitcher
struggles in spring training. If all five starters are healthy, the
Dodgers could return erratic prospect Eric Gagne to triple-A Las
Vegas, use him in relief, or include him in a trade, possibly for a
closer.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, 28, went 12-6 with a 3.39 earned-run average last season,
ranking second in Japan's Central League in strikeouts and walks. He
struck out a league-leading 210 in 183 innings in 2000, when he went
10-9 with a 2.61 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   While the Dodgers have not won a postseason game since 1988, the
Swallows won five Japanese championships in Ishii's 10 seasons with
the club.</TE>
<TE>   In his only start in last season's championship series--his final
start for the Swallows--he pitched eight shutout innings, giving up
one hit and striking out 12.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a polished pitcher," Colborn said. "He's no rookie. He knows
what big-game pitching is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy thanked his employers for acquiring a
left-hander that might neutralize the big left-handed bats that
dominate the National League West, including Barry Bonds of the San
Francisco Giants, Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Larry
Walker of the Colorado Rockies and Ryan Klesko of the San Diego
Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, the Dodgers' star left-handed hitter, joined Bonds
and other major league all-stars on a tour of Japan after the 2000
season. He faced Ishii and said it wasn't fun.</TE>
<TE>   "He shut us down," Green said, "a team full of guys like Bonds and
[Toronto left-handed slugger Carlos] Delgado. Everyone was really
impressed with him. He was the most impressive pitcher we saw there
for sure."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Need New Script</HD>
<DH>Hockey: As they have so many times this season, they play
hard but don't end up with a victory, losing this time to St. Louis,
3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only the likes of "I Love Lucy" have been repeated as often as the
type of show the Mighty Ducks put on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   They played hard. They even took an early lead. They withered and
lost. Call it deja lose.</LD>
<LD>   A 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues before an announced 9,374 at the
two-third empty Arrowhead Pond was another in long line of encore
performances by the Ducks. It was also their fifth consecutive loss,
one shy of their season longest streak.</LD>
<TE>   The results have been repetitive, only the circumstances change.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, the Ducks managed to crawl back and tie the score, 2-2,
on a Keith Carney goal early in the third period. That lasted four
minutes, then Doug Weight set up behind the Duck net. He fed Cory
Stillman, whose point-blank one-timer was in the net before goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere could react.</TE>
<TE>   Game. Set. Season.</TE>
<TE>   Weight also had a goal, giving him 14 points in the last eight
games. Offensive prowess that might make Duck Coach Bryan Murray
salivate.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had plenty of chances, especially early. Yet they had
only two goals, the 15th time in the last 20 games they have scored
two or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Blues goalie Brent Johnson survived an early onslaught, then made
a back-breaker of a save in the third period, when he stopped one
shot, then snagged Matt Cullen's rebound flip as he fell to the ice.</TE>
<TE>   So the Ducks were left with another A-for-effort from their coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys have been great, think they have played hard," Murray
said. "Like some other teams in the league, we don't score very
easily. We've played hard and very disciplined for the most part."</TE>
<TE>   They did for one period Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks owned the first period, even though they only had a 9-8
advantage in shots. But the Duck scoring chances were prime ones,
starting when Marty McInnis hit the left post six minutes into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Leclerc had two good chances in close that Johnson managed to
keep out of the net. A wide-open Oleg Tverdovsky had a shot stopped
late in the period.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the best teams in the league, one that could make a
run at the Stanley Cup," the Ducks' Jeff Friesen said. "For us to
come out and have a period like that is a big lift. They are a great
defensive team, so for us to get chances like that is nice."</TE>
<TE>   And they even managed to convert one, when they had a two-man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk went off for interference, when he slammed into
defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski, who had just leveled Pavol Demitra.
Chris Pronger was called for high sticking 28 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks may have the third-worst power play in the NHL, but even
they can be a handful on a five on three. Paul Kariya blasted a shot
from the blue line that Johnson stopped. The rebound sat in the
crease and Patric Kjellberg chipped in a shot for a 1-0 lead midway
through the first period.</TE>
<TE>   But not even Giguere, whose play has been exceptional in the last
month, could make that stand.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere had a 1.37 goals-against average and .949 save percentage
in his previous 12 games. Yet he had a 4-6-2 record in that time,
which reflects the black hole the Ducks find themselves in inside the
opponents' zone.</TE>
<TE>   A scrap behind the Blues' net resulted in a roughing penalty for
Vishnevski and a double-minor roughing penalty for Scott Mellanby,
putting the Ducks on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Eastwood beat Andy McDonald on the faceoff, slipped a
pass to a wide open Dallas Drake, who beat Giguere to tie the score,
1-1, 12:21 into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks nearly got out of the period with a tie for a moral
victory and a chance to regroup. But Weight skated into the Duck zone
and, with defenseman Pavel Trnka hanging on his back, fired a
backhander through a crowd and past Giguere with four-tenths of a
second left in the period.</TE>

<HD>Nagging Injury Sidelines York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Jason York sat out Wednesday's game because of
a sore right shoulder, a precautionary move according to Coach Bryan
Murray.</LD>
<LD>   York, who signed a three-year, $6-million contract last summer,
underwent a MRI exam Tuesday. Duck officials said the tests were
negative and that York was resting a "sore shoulder." But York said
that it revealed tendinitis in the rotator cuff and said it was a
"day-to-day thing."</LD>
<LD>   Vitaly Vishnevski, who had missed the previous five games because
of a sprained left ankle, took York's place.</LD>
<TE>   "I basically have been playing with my right shoulder at 50%
strength," York said. "There was a lot of hockey coming up and I've
been banged up pretty good. I haven't been able to do the things that
I'm accustomed to doing. As far as strength, it's just not there."</TE>
<TE>   York said he first hurt the shoulder when he went head first into
the boards during a Nov. 16 game at Columbus, Ohio, and re-injured it
a week later against the New York Islanders. He has played in pain
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't lift my arm [after the Islander game]," York said. "It
hasn't gotten any better in the month and a half I've been playing
with it. I use a lot upper body strength and that's not there and
that's not a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're playing hurt, a lot of scar tissue builds up. I kept
playing and playing and it kind of gets chronic."</TE>
<TE>   Murray hoped that two days of treatment would have York ready for
Friday's game at Minnesota.</TE>

<LD>If only the Louisville High girls' soccer team had wheels, then the
Royals might really roll.</LD>
<LD>   Without five players, including four starters, because of
protracted knee and ankle injuries, Louisville was 10-3, with a 1-1
mark in Mission League play heading into a game against Chaminade on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Our team is really hurting with injuries right now," senior
forward Jenny Farenbaugh said. "It's hard to deal with, but we've had
some seniors who have really stepped up."</LD>
<TE>   Farenbaugh is among them. She has 21 goals and eight assists. She
credits Santa Clara-bound sweeper Carrie Schuler and fullback Joey
Lucas, both seniors, for helping to hold the defense together in
front of goalkeeper Ashley Englehart, a junior transfer from
Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore center midfielder Megan Merritt has also played well
filling in for Melanie Wong, one of three players who suffered torn
anterior cruciate ligaments and has been out all season.</TE>
<TE>   April Millado, a senior forward who will attend Boston College on
a soccer scholarship, and senior forward Celeste Hayden have been out
because of knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Right fullback Claire Ianiro and senior midfielder Kayla Spears
each suffered sprained ankles in recent tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Millado and Wong probably will not make it back this season, but
Hayden has been running recently and the Royals hope Spears and
Ianiro will recover soon.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Louisville is keeping its eyes on the prize it won
last season, when the Royals shared the Southern Section Division IV
championship with Harvard-Westlake after a 2-2 tie in the title game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a good team, even without those players," Coach Jose
Perez said. "If we can get three back, I think we're going to [be
able to] make another run at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Mission madness: Defending Mission League champion Chaminade
had its 24-game league unbeaten streak, which dated to 1999, ended
Monday with a 1-0 loss to Harvard-Westlake, No. 3 in The Times'
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Evans called the loss disappointing but added it was
nothing to be ashamed of.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvard-Westlake is one of the best, and really, that game could
have gone either way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade won or shared four consecutive Southern Section titles
from 1996-2000 and advanced to the semifinals last season.</TE>
<TE>   But this year's team is a bit younger than those of recent years,
with four starters who are freshmen or sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles (13-5, 2-1) have taken their lumps during a challenging
schedule that also includes losses to top-ranked Santa Margarita, No.
8 Huntington Beach Edison, Canyon and Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Futbol, not football: Serra League rivals Santa Margarita (11-1-2,
1-0) and No. 10 Santa Ana Mater Dei (12-3-2, 1-0), which will meet
today at Mater Dei, each scored 3-1 wins last week over a common
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Concord Carondelet, the sister school of football power De La
Salle, was considered one of the top teams in the nation when it
visited Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "That was based on last year," Mater Dei Coach Austin Sharp said
of Carondelet's reputation.</TE>

<DH>Already the Subject of a Book, 16-Year-Old Sarah Hughes Is
Well on Her Way to Stardom on the Ice</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Sarah Hughes' brothers had indulged their baby sister and dawdled
when she chased them around the makeshift rink in the family's
backyard, she might not be where she is today--on the cusp of figure
skating superstardom and the subject of a syrupy unauthorized
biography.</LD>
<LD>   Because if Hughes had caught her brothers, David and Matthew, she
might have decided there was no challenge to this skating stuff and
given it up. But even as a child, she loved challenges.</LD>
<LD>   Family legend has it that Hughes' mother, Amy, took her kids to a
rink near their home in Great Neck, N.Y., for a day of skating,
lining them up on a bench in age order to lace their skates. She put
3-year-old Sarah first, as the youngest of a brood that numbered four
and later grew to six.</LD>
<TE>   After Sarah's skates were on, she eagerly ran onto the ice by
herself. Afraid the adventurous toddler would get hurt if she skated
alone, Amy Hughes resolved the next time to tie Sarah's skates last,
after everyone else was ready.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah foiled that plan, figuring out how to tie her skates herself
and heading for the ice.</TE>
<TE>   And why not? She had places to go and older brothers to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't really catch them," she said, giggling. "That was the
problem. I never skated fast enough. They would always beat me. Then
I started winning, but I started becoming interested in doing spins
and jumps. They stuck with hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Her brothers play club hockey at Ithaca College and Cornell, in
upstate New York. But they still keep an eye on Sarah, now 16 and
virtually certain to finish in the top three at this week's U.S.
Figure Skating Championships at Staples Center and win a spot on the
U.S. Olympic team for the Salt Lake City Winter Games. The women's
competition begins today with the short program, worth one-third of
the final score.</TE>
<TE>   "Their friends watch football and hockey and basketball, and now
they watch figure skating on TV because of me," she said. "Whenever
they have parties, they have to turn on the figure skating."</TE>
<TE>   Her performances usually give them another reason to party. She
has enjoyed three impressive seasons, displaying increasing grace,
sureness and technical proficiency.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so long ago that Hughes was crowned the junior national
champion and was in awe of Michelle Kwan and the other skaters she
had seen on TV. "Four years ago Monday," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she's in their class, having competed in 22 international
events and three national championships, with 18 medals to show for
her efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of these last four magical years," said her coach,
Robin Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes opened eyes last season, when she finished second in the
U.S. competition, third at the Grand Prix final and third in the
World Championships at Vancouver, Canada. She followed that by taking
another significant step in November, when she defeated Kwan--the
U.S. and world champion--and world silver medalist Irina Slutskaya of
Russia at Skate Canada.</TE>
<TE>   She had come close to defeating Kwan a week earlier in Skate
America. The crowd gave Hughes a standing ovation and booed the
results, but she gracefully accepted the silver. She knew this
sometimes infuriating sport obliged her to be superior to Kwan to get
the same marks as the four-time world champion.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but when somebody establishes themselves, they've earned
it," said Wagner, a former junior national competitor who became
Hughes' choreographer in 1994 and her coach in 1998. "But we've done
it, and that's the thing I'm so proud of in Sarah's career, that
she's had a nice, steady, consistent climb.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a lot of work, but over the past four years she's made
consistent progress and consistent improvement. Anytime somebody's
been a champion, as Michelle has been, for so long, it takes a 'Wow!'
performance to win."</TE>
<TE>   When Hughes won, it changed how she perceived herself, Wagner
said. "She's in a place she hasn't been in before. She has a new
perspective, from the top of the podium."</TE>
<TE>   In her next competition, the Trophee Lalique, a fatigued Hughes
fell on a triple flip in her short program but pulled up from fourth
to second and qualified for the Grand Prix final at Kitchener,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   At that event, which gathered the six best men, women, pairs and
dance duos, she fell on a triple loop in her long program and wasn't
sharp in her first long program. She rallied with a strong final
routine to finish third, but was startled to learn how highly she is
esteemed when a local newspaper ran a picture of her fall with a
caption describing it as a rare occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised to see people were surprised that I fell," she
said. "At first I was surprised and kind of hurt. If you're down,
sometimes people will let everyone know. I saved it and brought it
some and showed it to my mom. She was laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother was also amused by the unauthorized biography, "Sarah
Hughes, Skating to the Stars," written by Alina Sivorinovsky, a TV
producer and skating fan. It contains no revelations and was
assembled mostly from previously published interviews. Nonetheless,
it was a hit in the Hughes family.</TE>
<TE>   "The lady must have written it because she knew my mom would order
so many," Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   She herself was amazed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought nobody would ever write a book about me," she said. "I
mean, I'm only 16 and I haven't lived that long."</TE>
<TE>   But she's packing a lot into every day.</TE>
<TE>   An 11th-grade honors student, she tries to attend classes at Great
Neck High. That hasn't happened much this season, so her teachers
often drop work off for her and she studies during the long drive to
her training rink in Hackensack, N.J. Amy Hughes, who was diagnosed
with breast cancer in 1997 and underwent a life-saving stem cell
transplant, and her husband John, a lawyer who played hockey at
Cornell, have kept their daughter grounded and have given her a solid
sense of responsibility. She has learned to deal with heightened
expectations, and that the better her results, the more intensely
she's scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   Her main technical flaw, noticed only by savvy skating observers,
is she sometimes "flutzes" her triple lutz. When she launches herself
into the air, she should take off from the back outside edge of her
skate but instead takes off from the back inside edge. That turns the
jump into a flip, which is less difficult because the entry curve of
the flip and the direction of the spin in the air are the same. In a
lutz, there's a reversal of direction from the entry curve into the
spin.</TE>
<TE>   It's a common flaw, but skating commentator Dick Button, a
two-time Olympic gold medalist, believes it's outweighed by her
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, she flutzes, but she has a dozen other elements that
are simply exquisite and that are wonderful," he said, listing her
graceful layback spin, the precise edging on her flying camel and the
overall security of her skating. "Tell me what's not to like, except
the flutz?"</TE>
<TE>   There's much to like, including a solid repertoire of jumps and an
intuitive feel for music. Hughes is capable of pushing Kwan this
week, but she insisted she's not thinking about winning the title,
but merely making the Olympic team. Not that she hasn't thought about
prevailing.</TE>
<TE>   "If I won, I don't think I'd take it badly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It might even give her material to write her own life story,
instead of leaving it to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't include everything," Hughes said, laughing. "I can
write some more things."</TE>

<LD>Although he is not a serious threat to Jerry Hollendorfer in the
trainers' race at Golden Gate Fields, Armando Lage is winning at a
higher percentage than the perennial leader.</LD>
<LD>   Lage, who used to be based locally, has won with 23 of 106
starters--nearly 22%--compared to Hollendorfer's 19% winning rate (33
for 171).</LD>
<LD>   Trying to add to his victory total, Lage will have three runners
today at Golden Gate--Royal Brew in the sixth, Ida in the seventh and
Dannys Battle Wise in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   A 3-year-old gray son of Falstaff, Royal Brew is the one to beat
in his race, a one-mile route for California-bred maidens running for
a $12,500 claiming price. He has been second in his last pair,
failing against Southern California shipper--and
dropper--Gottalovefaith most recently on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Ida, a 5-year-old Water Bank mare, is an outsider in the seventh,
a one-mile allowance race. She has won three of 20 in her career, but
has been more effective on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Dannys Battle Wise, a 3-year-old gray son of Battle Wise, will be
making his first start in Northern California after three futile
tries versus better competition at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Lage has had much success with horses shipping from the south and
the California-bred should improve with the change in scenery. He
will be running a mile against six other 3-year-olds running for a
$12,500 tag.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Santa Anita attracted a full field
of 10 California-bred fillies and mares running a mile on the turf.
The 3-1 morning-line favorite in a race where contention goes deep is
Broke The Slump, a 4-year-old filly trained by Doug O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Stars In His Eyes. The 5-year-old Pleasant Colony will
seek his third consecutive win and fourth in his last five starts in
today's eighth at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. He is trained by
Michael Pino for active owner Richard Englander.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bill McLean. The veteran trainer is 0 for 49 at Golden
Gate Fields. He's a cinch to maintain that total today because he
isn't starting any horses.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three using Rockin Robannier, Gratis
and Daddy Grace in the third; Bemsha Swing, Forget You, Nahulalula
and Tonietta in the fourth, and singling Sunset Serenade in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/30. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $22.60/$200.60. Total money bet: $190.</TE>

<HD>Allison Returns to Boston</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jason Allison is not sure what kind of reception to expect from the
fans tonight in FleetCenter when the former Bruin all-star makes his
first visit to Boston since the Oct. 24 trade that sent him to the
Kings.</LD>
<LD>   But he suspects it will be civil.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always been pretty good there," he said, "so it should be
all right."</LD>
<TE>   Allison was the Bruins' leading scorer in three of his last four
seasons and their captain last season.</TE>
<TE>   But after holding out last fall in a contract dispute that turned
ugly, he was shipped to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin fans should have no quarrel with the trade, which also
brought Mikko Eloranta to the Kings and sent former Bruins Glen
Murray and Jozef Stumpel back to Boston. The deal has worked out
wonderfully for the Bruins, who have won eight of their last 10
games, are 20-9-1-4 since the trade and trail the Toronto Maple Leafs
by one point in the race for the best record in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, on pace for the most productive season of his career at
the time of the trade, has not slowed since leaving the Kings. He has
19 points and 19 assists in 43 games, 13 goals and 14 assists in 34
games since the trade. Stumpel's 23 points in 43 games include 19 in
34 games with the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are 15-12-6-1 since the trade. Allison, with 30 points
in 34 games, is their leading scorer, but Eloranta has been
inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--FleetCenter.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KSPN (1110).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Kings 18-16-7-2, Bruins 24-12-3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bruins (2000-01)--1-0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Kings are unbeaten in their last six games against the
Bruins, going 3-0-3 since Oct. 15, 1997, when they lost, 5-3, at the
Forum.</TE>

<HD>Hard Part for Kings Is Showing Up</HD>
<DH>Hockey: After being stuck in traffic, they beat Rangers and
are first to defeat New York teams, Devils in same trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Kings learned the travails of the road Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   En route to Manhattan after checking out of a New Jersey hotel,
they got stuck behind a traffic accident inside the Lincoln Tunnel
and were forced to sit idle on their bus for about 40 minutes on the
New Jersey side of the tunnel.</LD>
<LD>   Once in the city, however, their troubles subsided.</LD>
<TE>   Running their winning streak to four games, they got goals from
Mikko Eloranta, Steve Heinze, Ziggy Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky and
defeated the New York Rangers, 4-0, before a sellout crowd of 18,200
in Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise starter Jamie Storr turned aside 34 shots for his first
shutout of the season, helping the Kings end a 10-game winless streak
in the Garden and become the first team in NHL history to sweep the
Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils in one trip.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hours earlier, the Kings were making frantic calls to
the Ranger and league offices, trying to arrange a police escort out
of their predicament.</TE>
<TE>   When the traffic finally cleared, they made it on their own,
arriving about an hour before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray, playing a hunch, opted for Storr over Felix
Potvin, who will face the Boston Bruins tonight at Boston, and the
backup goaltender responded with a brilliant performance.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping 17 shots in the third period, Storr earned his first
shutout since Feb. 16, when he blanked the Minnesota Wild, 4-0, at
St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt that Jamie maybe had something to prove in this
building after the way it had gone the last couple years," Murray
said. "He's been playing real good hockey, and I just thought he'd be
good tonight. Fortunately, I was right."</TE>
<TE>   In his last two starts at the Garden, an 8-3 loss two seasons ago
and a 7-6 defeat last season, Storr was pulled in the first period.
Last season's loss ran the Kings' winless streak in the Garden to
0-9-1 since a 6-2 victory on March 12, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   With the streak finally ended, Storr said he felt vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of the building," he said, "that's the type of effort
I expect from myself, but there was a little bit of sweetness at the
end of the game when you actually beat the team that's been crushing
you every year in their building."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Kings doing the crushing this time, avenging a
particularly galling 5-4 loss to the Rangers on Dec. 29 at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the most disappointing losses we've had this year
because we gave up five goals, and that's not the way we play
hockey," Murray said. "We didn't respect their talent enough to play
smart.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this time we were a lot more focused defensively and
played with a little more structure in our game than what we had in
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   After going 40 games into the season without a shutout, the Kings
have two in three games. Potvin blanked the Islanders, 3-0, Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great game from the whole team," said defenseman Mathieu
Schneider, who assisted on Palffy's goal, picking up his first point
in four games since returning to the lineup after sitting out 23
games because of an abdominal injury. "It was a great game from Jamie
Storr. That's where it started.</TE>
<TE>   "His last two times in here haven't been kind to him, but he
played an unbelievable game. I thought he was really focused. He made
some great plays on some really tricky plays."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are 10-2-3 since Dec. 8.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers don't roll their eyes anymore. They laugh together after
games, and sometimes before them.</LD>
<LD>   They don't fear Shaquille O'Neal's bad mood, forced because of a
tact Kobe Bryant took the night before. And they don't measure
Bryant's quiet, caused by O'Neal's rants.</LD>
<LD>   Those things don't happen anymore. Bryant is happy. If O'Neal
isn't, more likely it is because his feet are killing him, and not
because of something Bryant did or didn't do.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes for good harmony," Phil Jackson said before Wednesday
night's victory against the Indiana Pacers, the Lakers' sixth
consecutive win.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball's not bad, either. But they won two championships
at each other's throats. So this is more about living in peace than
playing with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I compared it the other day to like a dog and a cat," Jackson
said. "The dog goes around and makes the cat hump its back and spit a
little bit. Then, all of a sudden, when they get to be friends, the
cat starts bouncing around all over the dog. That's the way it
appears to be, with Kobe being the cat."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant may have gained a few more fans with his 360-degree dunk
Tuesday in Detroit, but he scared Jackson when he landed hard on his
backside. Jackson often pleads with Bryant to be more careful.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was a little bit excessive," Jackson said. "But he
came out of it OK. That's how you jam your feet. It's also the way
you sell tennis shoes, I suppose."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dick Jauron is next.</TE>
<TE>   He may have coached the Chicago Bears to a 13-3 record, the NFL
Central Division title and a first-round bye in the playoffs, picking
up a contract extension along the way, but there are greater forces
at work here.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are on their way, and they are three for three in
shortening careers on a four-NFL town trip.</TE>
<TE>   They began in Detroit, where the Lions canned defensive
coordinator Vince Tobin, merely putting off the bad news for Marty
Mornhinweg.</TE>
<TE>   Then they landed in Indianapolis, where the Colts fired Jim Mora.</TE>
<TE>   This morning they arrived in Minnesota, where the Vikings had
fired Dennis Green.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers get to Chicago early Saturday. Jauron packs by noon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have never won road games on successive days by 20 or
more points. They beat Detroit by 29 on Tuesday night, and Indiana by
19 on Wednesday.</TE>

<DH>Lakers: After they beat rested Pacers for sixth win in nine
days, Jackson proclaims chances of title repeat are good.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson has stood away from the view many times, enough to know
substance from a little good fortune.</LD>
<LD>   Well into Wednesday night he did again, a quarter-hour after the
Lakers routed another team with another reputation. He looked across
six consecutive wins over nine nights, and three road wins in four
nights, and decided the Lakers won again not simply because of their
top-end height, but also because of their breadth.</LD>
<LD>   "For that reason," he said evenly, "we have a real good chance of
repeating this year."</LD>
<TE>   The Indiana Pacers, rested and primed for the Lakers, were the
latest to go, and to go big, by 109-90 at Conseco Fieldhouse. Kobe
Bryant scored 31 points, awkwardly at times, and Shaquille O'Neal
scored 20 in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine O'Neal had 18 points and 18 rebounds, but was three for
14 from the floor, and the Pacers made only 35.4% of their attempts,
including a four-for-26 second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   While it was Bryant who made the splashy shots finally, and O'Neal
who had the brutish third quarter that spent the otherwise game
Pacers, Samaki Walker had a team-high 13 rebounds, and Derek Fisher
had 10 points and six assists. And guys such as Slava Medvedenko and
Mitch Richmond helped push the game through the in-between places,
through the slivers of defenses the Pacers attempted, and bungled.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a bench behind our first unit that plays well together,
and has a good concept of what we're trying to do," Jackson said. "In
fact, sometimes they play better than the first unit does.</TE>
<TE>   "The little things make the difference. And right now, we're
rebounding better than we were. We're not turning the ball over like
we were earlier in the year. We're being a little more patient with
the basketball. That's the key."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers finished the Pacers, or nearly did anyway, with a
32-point third quarter, when O'Neal scored 13 points and had three of
his five blocked shots. He made six of seven shots in the quarter, a
period in which the Lakers scored the first 15 points to drive their
lead to 64-43.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good," said O'Neal, whose sore feet still require him to limp
before and after games. "I just could never get into the game."</TE>
<TE>   The fouls and, eventually, the blowout, limited O'Neal to 24
minutes. He played 25 Tuesday in Detroit, and averaged 28.8 minutes
in four games since he came off the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep playing like this," he said, "we'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   This trip--the Lakers are successfully through the first of two
back-to-back series--was supposed to be the hard part. Instead,
through Toronto, Detroit and Indiana, and with Minnesota and Chicago
ahead, the Lakers are averaging 113 points in the three victories,
109.7 on the overall winning streak. On average, they are winning by
more than 20 points on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not shocked by it, because this team has played well on the
road," Jackson said. "But, the level they're going through their
opponents is impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is averaging 27.3 points on the trip, and against the
Pacers made 11 of 22 field-goal attempts and eight of 14 free throws.
It was the worst free-throw shooting game of his career with a
minimum of 10 attempts. He missed six of his first seven.</TE>
<TE>   "We laughed about it a lot in the locker room," Bryant said, "but
I told them, 'Look, I gotta chase Vince Carter, Jerry Stackhouse and
Reggie Miller [over three games in four nights]. I can't do
everything.'"</TE>
<TE>   He made all seven free-throw attempts in the second half, and four
of nine field goals on a night when he said his legs felt thick and
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant left the game, all but over with more than nine
minutes left, he went down the bench and pounded every hand with his,
a big show for the fans who taunted him all game.</TE>
<TE>   It was all part of a very odd game for Bryant, who, among other
things, missed two break-away dunks in the third quarter. He
frequently appeared frustrated on both ends of the floor, both
defending and trying to post Miller, and during timeouts he often
sparred with fans in the first few rows.</TE>
<TE>   When his shots fell early in the fourth quarter, the 19-foot
fade-away from the right corner, the 21-foot step-back from the top,
the floating left-handed finger roll, he stared into the crowd and
cupped a hand behind his ear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pretty confident guy," he said.</TE>

<HD>QB McCann  Will Transfer  From UCLA</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quarterback Ryan McCann, who led UCLA to victories over Alabama and
Michigan as a sophomore but was third string last season, said
Wednesday night he will transfer today to a Division I-AA school.</LD>
<LD>   McCann, a 6-foot-3 junior from Agoura High, must transfer to a
program below the Division I-A level to be eligible next fall. He has
narrowed his choice to two schools but declined to identify them.</LD>
<LD>   McCann's departure leaves UCLA with Cory Paus as the only
experienced quarterback. Paus, who will be a senior, has started 24
games but faltered late last season and must serve a four-day jail
sentence for drunk driving later this month.</LD>
<TE>   Also competing for the job will be John Sciarra, who will be a
redshirt freshman, and incoming freshmen Matt Moore of Hart High and
Drew Olson of Piedmont High. A third freshman, Trent Edwards of Los
Gatos, might sign in February.</TE>

<HD>Goebel, Eldredge Are Locked in a Rare Tie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Goebel skated an imperfect short program and still managed to tie
Todd Eldredge for the lead after the first phase of the men's
competition at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine what Goebel could do if he masters his full repertoire of
technical tricks tonight, when the men perform their long programs at
Staples Center. The results will determine the three U.S. men's
Olympic berths for the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   "Going into the long, I wanted to skate as clean as possible,"
said Goebel, who pulled off a difficult quadruple-triple combination
jump but stumbled on the easy footwork section during Tuesday's short
program.</LD>
<TE>   "I've had some good programs with three quads. I'm just pleased to
be in the top three going into the long and I want to go in and give
it my best shot."</TE>
<TE>   The tie was the first since the U.S. championships adopted the
present competition format in 1991, after compulsory figures were
abolished. Goebel, who has trained in El Segundo for the past 18
months, and five-time U.S. champion Eldredge each won four
first-place votes, three second-place votes and two third-place votes
from the nine-judge panel.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining first-place vote went to Matt Savoie, who is third.
Johnny Weir is fourth, ahead of two-time U.S. champion Michael Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the top three can earn the title by winning the long
program, worth two-thirds of the final score.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, who will perform his program to "American in Paris," was
in good humor after getting marks of 5.5 (out of 6.0) to 5.8 for his
required elements Tuesday despite his stumble. "With the fall, in the
short program, that's a deduction of 0.1," he said. "Those marks
would have been higher if I hadn't splattered across the ice."</TE>
<TE>   It was hardly a splatter, but the key was he recovered quickly and
finished his program well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the perfect skater that wins, it's the best skater," his
coach, Frank Carroll, said.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, who didn't attempt a quad in the short program, said he
plans to perform a quadruple toe loop in his "Lord of the Rings"
soundtrack. However, he has the luxury of waiting until almost the
last second to make his decision. He will skate 17th among the 18-man
field, before only Weir. Goebel will skate 16th.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great to win," said Eldredge, who was 10th at the
1992 Albertville Olympics and fourth at the 1998 Nagano Games. "It's
great to win anytime, whether it's your first, second, third,
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Savoie, of Peoria, Ill., was third at last year's national
competition but didn't compete at the world championships because the
U.S. was allotted only two berths. He battled a groin injury for much
of this season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only the third or fourth competition I've done this
year," he said, "and I usually have six or seven."</TE>
<TE>   Because he hasn't had the time or fitness level to be sure he can
do a quad consistently, he won't try one tonight. "That's basically
the first clean short [program] I've done all year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even a clean program might not be enough for Weiss to move up to
third place. He fell on his combination jump and two-footed the
landing of his required triple axel, earning a 4.8 and a 4.9 among
his required elements. His presentation scores were 5.7s and 5.8s,
but they weren't enough to lift him on a night Savoie and Weir skated
cleanly.</TE>
<TE>   "I did everything perfect all day. Go figure," he said. "It's time
to get it back in the long program and hold back nothing and do it
all."</TE>

<HD>Smith Steps Up for San Antonio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Antonio Spurs counted on Steve Smith against Boston instead
of their usual inside combination of Tim Duncan and David Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Smith scored 13 points in the final 6:20, including a go-ahead
jumper with just over a minute to play, to lead the Spurs over the
Celtics, 93-90, Wednesday night at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio needed Smith's clutch shooting to beat the Celtics for
the eighth consecutive time.</LD>
<TE>   There were nine lead changes and five ties in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim O'Brien has done a heck of a lot better job with his team
than I have with mine," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said. "They're not
just improved, it's ridiculous the steps they have taken."</TE>
<TE>   With 1:28 remaining, Kenny Anderson rebounded Antoine Walker's
three-point shot and made a 10-foot jumper to give the Celtics a
90-89 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Smith then made a fallaway jumper to give the Spurs the lead for
good. Smith made two free throws with 14 second left. He finished
with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce and Walker each missed a shot in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   "You get so focused in on their big men," Pierce said. "Their
perimeter players knock down shots and leaving Smith open cost us the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce led the Celtics with 31 points, including 26 in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   Walker had 21 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan had 25 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   There was a 21-minute power outage with 5:08 remaining in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 102, Philadelphia 91--Tracy McGrady scored 26 points and
Horace Grant had 21 at Philadelphia, helping the Magic win its fourth
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia, which had won three of four after losing 13 of 18,
fell to 15-20. The defending Eastern Conference champions lost only
26 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 27 points, making 12 of 28 shots, and Dikembe
Mutombo had 13 points and 20 rebounds for the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller had 18 points, including four three-pointers, and nine
rebounds for the Magic.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 111, Atlanta 87--Elden Campbell had 22 points and 13
rebounds at Charlotte, N.C., and the Hornets won consecutive games
for the first time in a month.</TE>
<TE>   The victory came amid reports that team owners are close to filing
with the league for relocation.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell was seven for eight from the field and made his eight
free throws. Baron Davis added 20 points and 11 assists for
Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Atlanta with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 111, Seattle 106--Kevin Garnett scored 29 points and
Anthony Peeler scored 26, including seven three-pointers, at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Peeler's seven three-point baskets were the most by a Minnesota
player this season.</TE>
<TE>   His final three-pointer put Minnesota ahead, 86-73, with 8:53 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton had 25 points for Seattle, but only attempted three
field goals in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Rashard Lewis led Seattle with 30 points and Vin Baker scored 23.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 85, Chicago 73--Vince Carter scored four of his 19 points
at Chicago after returning from a twisted ankle and Alvin Williams
scored 18 to help the Raptors beat the Bulls for the 12th consecutive
time.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto ended a two-game losing streak and handed the Bulls their
fifth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors moved within a half-game of second-place Indiana in
the Central Division.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis added to Toronto's balanced attack with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Artest led the Bulls with 21 points.</TE>

<LD>In a sport rife with Machiavellian relationships and entanglements,
the fact that Commissioner Bud Selig appeared to violate a major
league rule when he secured a short-term loan for his Milwaukee
Brewers from a company controlled by Minnesota Twin owner Carl
Pohlad--who may now receive a handsome payoff via elimination of his
franchise--is just one more embarrassing development for baseball and
its commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   It is the type of thing that can happen, as one major league
executive pointed out Wednesday, when you make the mistake of having
a club owner as commissioner, increasing the risk of potential
conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the last time baseball had a semi-independent
commissioner, Selig and his Great Lakes Coalition--which included his
longtime friend and ally Pohlad--led the backdoor assault that forced
Fay Vincent to resign and ultimately gave Selig the reins as acting
commissioner.</LD>
<TE>   It was in that capacity, and while still president and chief
executive of the Brewers, that Selig received a $3-million bridge
loan from a financial firm owned by Pohlad. This was in mid-summer of
1995. Selig put up $795,000 of securities and money market funds as
collateral, and the loan was paid off at 10.5% interest--1.5% above
prime rate--within 90 days, when the Brewers secured longtime
financing from Nationsbank Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The process clearly seemed to violate Major League Rule 20 (c),
which states that no club or owner or any other member of a club
"shall directly or indirectly loan money" to anyone from another club
without the loan being disclosed to and approved by the commissioner
and the other clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Because Selig was already serving as acting commissioner, he may
have felt that he could act autonomously and did not need the
approval of the other clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Robert DuPuy, who is Selig's lawyer and baseball's chief legal
officer, has acknowledged that Selig did not ask for approval nor
receive it. DuPuy, however, said he did not consider it a rules
violation because "this, in my view, was a loan made by a bank at
arm's length. It would be different if [Pohlad] was lending the
money, but this was a regulated financial institution lending money."</TE>
<TE>   Interpretation aside, it is difficult to believe that Selig simply
chose Tempus Investment Corp. out of the yellow pages without dialing
his pal, Pohlad, to see if he might be able to arrange a loan through
one of his financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The rule exists to protect one team from having undue and unfair
influence over another, and Selig--responsible for setting the tone
and example for the industry he now headed--disregarded it, a
transgression appearing more sinister now because of contraction and
the possibility that Selig and his fellow owners will buy out Pohlad
for about $150 million or considerably more than he might
receive--Forbes values the Twins at $99 million--if he sold
privately.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, a little quid-pro-quo favor for that favor Pohlad
did for Selig in '95?</TE>
<TE>   Major league owners hurrying to Selig's support have denied that,
insisting that it is Pohlad who is doing them a favor by agreeing to
eliminate his Twins at a time when there are too many teams, that the
'95 loan was negotiated in the aftermath of a long work stoppage when
many teams were scurrying to secure financing any way they could and,
said Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, it wasn't as if the
acting commissioner violated a federal statute.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of our rules," Reinsdorf said, "and if we choose to
enforce it or not enforce it, that's our thing."</TE>
<TE>   A cynic, of course, might question the purpose of having a rule if
it's not going to be enforced, but let's not dwell on that.</TE>
<TE>   The real issue--if not one of trust and credibility--is one of
perception, and the public view of Selig and his industry, on all
counts, has been damaged again.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), seizing the rules violation for
political advantage, went so far as to send a public letter to Selig
in which he accused the commissioner of a conflict of interest in the
contraction scheme, questioned how much Selig's Brewers (now in trust
and operated by his daughter) would profit regionally from
elimination of the nearby Twins and demanded he resign.</TE>
<TE>   Conyers also said he is asking the House Judiciary Committee, of
which he is ranking member, to reopen its probe into the possible
removal of baseball's antitrust exemption and may subpoena Selig to
appear again.</TE>
<TE>   Should Selig resign?</TE>
<TE>   Was the '95 violation--revealed Tuesday by the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the St. Paul Pioneer Press--that grievous?</TE>
<TE>   Is the Selig/Pohlad relationship as it relates to contraction a
little too cozy?</TE>
<TE>   Well, what's the big deal?</TE>
<TE>   This is simply the deteriorating and insidious nature of a game in
which baseball itself loans money to clubs and guarantees loans, in
which teams loan money to players they are already paying millions
to, in which a TV network of the Fox stature is allowed to own a team
while negotiating and maintaining regional contracts with teams it
competes with for players and wins, not to forget a national contract
that pays the teams up front, lockout or not.</TE>
<TE>   Pohlad, at least, is in the banking business, and Selig took
advantage of it.</TE>
<TE>   That the acting commissioner and Brewer owner should have
recognized the conflict as represented by the rule is as obvious as
the odor that has surfaced when it is linked to contraction and the
relationship with Pohlad.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, however, Selig's constituency doesn't care about conflict
or perception or they never would have hired one of their
own--initially giving Selig a five-year contract and recently
extending it for three.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, it is one more storm in a winter clouded by the
ongoing absurdity of contraction and the union and legal challenges
to it.</TE>
<TE>   A winter in which the commissioner's orchestrated outcome of
bidding for the Boston Red Sox has drawn the attention of the
Massachusetts attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   A winter in which his appearance before the House Judiciary
Committee to plead baseball's economic woes was lampooned by
committee members and media.</TE>
<TE>   A winter in which Selig has talked about baseball's role as a
social institution while wasting a) little time in erasing the memory
of a classic World Series and b) showing little regard for a
distracted nation's disinterest in another baseball dispute by
persisting with the controversial contraction scheme at a time when a
new labor agreement seems far more important to the game's welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, Selig appeared before wary union lawyers and players to
finally and officially begin the labor negotiations, laying out
management's case for a more restrictive tax on high payrolls and
increased revenue sharing among owners.</TE>
<TE>   Selig believes the system has to change if baseball is going to
bridge the revenue disparity, restore competitive balance and remove
the need for further ... well, loans.</TE>

<HD>Holmgren Gives Lots of Assistants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Holmgren is nowhere--and everywhere--in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   His Seattle Seahawks are history, extinguished Monday when the
Minnesota Vikings lost to the Baltimore Ravens, but Holmgren's shadow
still stretches across the postseason. Five of his former Green Bay
assistants are coaching playoff teams: San Francisco's Steve
Mariucci, Oakland's Jon Gruden, Chicago's Dick Jauron, Green Bay's
Mike Sherman and Philadelphia's Andy Reid.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to most of them today--those who would accept my calls,"
Holmgren told reporters with a smile.</LD>
<TE>   "One of my regrets was not getting into the playoffs and
disrupting those guys a little bit. They're wonderful guys and I'm
very proud of them, proud of the job they did."</TE>
<TE>   Holmgren is the Vito Corleone of coaching. Not only did his
Packers reach the Super Bowl twice in the 1990s, the franchise
doubled as a coaching think tank. The 49ers did the same thing
throughout the 1980s, when Bill Walsh assembled staffs that included
Holmgren and other eventual head coaches such as Mike Shanahan, Ray
Rhodes and George Seifert. Even Gruden worked there for a season,
fetching coffee and soaking up every ounce of information he could.</TE>
<TE>   As Walsh did, Holmgren asks a lot of his assistant coaches. He
entrusts them with real responsibilities, holds them to exacting
standards, lets them run part of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh flirted with the idea of trading Joe Montana to San Diego in
1988, but reconsidered after polling his staff. Another coach might
have traded first and listened to opinions later (or never).</TE>
<TE>   With Holmgren, strong opinions aren't only encouraged, they're
mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no cruising," said Gil Haskell, Seattle's offensive
coordinator who was part of Holmgren's Green Bay staff from 1992
through 1997. "You can't go into a meeting and say, 'I don't know
what I would do in that situation.' You have to have ideas. He's not
going to agree with all of them, but he wants to hear them."</TE>
<TE>   Said Reid: "I've talked to a lot of assistant coaches throughout
the league about [Holmgren's] ability to lead the football team, to
take over a team with great pride and history and bring them back
from a dead state to a world-champion state. It was remarkable. And
he had a great ability to involve everybody in that process.
Everybody felt a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Packer President Bob Harlan, in his 31st year with the franchise,
said there was a special air about Holmgren's staff, especially in
the early '90s. The assistants would keep the lights burning at all
hours and devote every spare moment to either football or family.</TE>
<TE>   "Green Bay was a special place," Harlan said. "They were a bunch
of guys who would get on a plane for a road game and work and work.
The plane would be quiet, almost silent. They'd have their game plans
out, going over the details."</TE>
<TE>   Pity the fool caught unprepared by Holmgren.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone respects him tremendously, whether you're a coach or a
player, because they know what his philosophy is, what he believes
in," Gruden said two years ago. "You know that from the very
beginning. If you do something wrong, you're not going to hear about
it after the ninth game or 11th game, you're going to hear about it
right after it happens."</TE>
<TE>   Gruden craved the added responsibility Holmgren gave him. Usually.
But, for a 29-year-old assistant who looked 18, carrying out a
Holmgren dictum wasn't always easy. Once, in his first season as
receivers coach, Gruden was instructed to chew out Sterling</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe, who was surly during the week and downright uncoachable on
Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the worst," Gruden said. "Absolutely the worst. You'd get
Monday through Saturday to coach him, but Sunday was his day to play.
If you're going to make adjustments, that's fine. But if you're going
to try to change his stance or his route-running on game day, you're
out of your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe was running his routes a few yards too shallow in a game
against New England, and Holmgren instructed his wide-eyed assistant
to "get on his ... "</TE>
<TE>   "And," Holmgren added, "I'm going to be watching to make sure you
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Gruden came up with a plan. He walked over to the bench where</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe was sitting and pretended to angrily bark out an order.
Really, he only mouthed the words. Holmgren didn't know the
difference, and Sharpe merely gave Gruden a confused look.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, now that he has a staff of his own, Gruden might feel
a tad guilty about that transgression. But there's an easy way he can
make it up to his former boss.</TE>

<HD>Warner Edges Faulk as MVP</HD>
<DH>NFL: Quarterback beats teammate in close vote, winning his
second award as league's top player in three seasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner won his second MVP award in silence.</LD>
<LD>   Plagued by damaged vocal cords, Warner was unable to talk about it
Wednesday when he won the NFL most valuable player award for the
second time in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, showing the resourcefulness that defines his performances
as quarterback of the potent St. Louis Rams, Warner responded to the
honor via email.</LD>
<TE>   "It is always a tremendous honor to be mentioned with the likes of
those great players," wrote Warner, who stormed onto the NFL out of
Arena Football and NFL Europe in 1999, leading the Rams to their
first Super Bowl title.</TE>
<TE>   "But, it is still very early in my career and my hope is that I
can be mentioned in the same sentence as these guys [and Marshall
Faulk] when my career is finished."</TE>
<TE>   Warner, 30, is just beginning what could be one of the greatest
careers among NFL passers. He already has equaled Joe Montana, Steve
Young and John Unitas with his two MVP awards. Only Brett Favre, with
three, has more.</TE>
<TE>   And Warner, working in an offense perfectly suited to his skills,
guided the Rams (14-2) to the NFL's best record this season. Although
Warner threw an NFC-high 22 interceptions, he easily led everyone in
yards passing (4,830, second most in league history), touchdown
passes (36), yards per attempt (a stunning 8.85), completions (375),
completion percentage (68.7) and overall rating (101.4).</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Warner completed 325 of 499 passes for 4,353 yards, a
65.1 completion percentage, 8.72 yards an attempt, 41 touchdowns and
13 interceptions. His rating was 109.2.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk won the 2000 award. Only once has a team won three
successive MVP awards: Favre took it in 1995 and 1996 and shared it
with Detroit's Barry Sanders in '97. The only other Ram voted MVP was
Roman Gabriel in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the MVPs we have won the past three years have been
awards that reflect the accomplishments of our whole team," Warner
said. "We see these awards as team awards, for we know that we
benefit from all the great talent surrounding us.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think that this year's award should have been split
between Marshall and myself."</TE>
<TE>   Warner edged Faulk, 211/2 votes to 171/2.</TE>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When associates of Tonya Harding's husband struck Nancy Kerrigan on
the right knee before the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships,
they unwittingly did more for the sport than anyone since Sonja
Henie.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't say, quite honestly, that what has happened in the sport
since then, and what we've received from TV and so forth, hasn't
added to the drama and the popularity among the general public. It
did," said John LeFevre, executive director of the U.S. Figure
Skating Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "The short program at the [Lillehammer] Olympics was one of the
highest-rated sports events ever. And the result of it was a TV
contract for the USFSA and sustainable revenue over a period of
years. Of course, as for the integrity of the sport, that's another
side of the picture. I think people understand that despite what you
do, things happen, and what they need to be sure of is that we make
every effort to make sure those things don't happen again."</LD>
<TE>   Sparked by the Tonya-Nancy soap opera, interest in figure skating
skyrocketed. The USFSA happily went along for the ride, getting a
deal with ABC Sports that will eventually allow it to reap $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   But with growth comes growing pains, and the USFSA faces several
issues:</TE>
<TE>   * How can it distinguish between "Olympic-eligible" events, such
as this week's U.S. championships, pro-ams that include
Olympic-eligible skaters and those who gave up their eligibility, and
the made-for-TV competitions that are often judged on different
standards?</TE>
<TE>   * How does it ensure the TV money will get to skaters who need it
to continue pursuing a prohibitively expensive sport?</TE>
<TE>   * Where is the balance between advancing the sport technically and
safeguarding skaters' well-being?</TE>
<TE>   The pendulum appears to have swung away from the contrived,
made-for-TV events and toward competitions featuring skaters on the
Olympic track.</TE>
<TE>   Each segment of the six-competition Grand Prix series was seen on
ABC, and more TV hours will be devoted this season to such events
than to the "ice wars" that use celebrity judges or different judging
systems.</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA, which sanctions only a handful of events each season,
has also made an effort to explain its judging system--though
probably not enough--and allows referees to comment on controversial
decisions after competitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very interested in making our events special from the
point of view of athletic performance and integrity of judging and
essentially being the ones people recognize as part of the road to
the Olympic Games, which all our competitions really are," LeFevre
said. "It is a challenge.... We're sort of headed, I think, toward
having just Olympic-eligible skaters in our international and
domestic competitions. It probably does tend to confuse people."</TE>
<TE>   Taking such a road would provide an avenue for Todd Eldredge or
Michelle Kwan to reduce their competition schedules while leaving
their Olympic options open. "We can continue to provide opportunities
for those skaters who perhaps are not continuing to compete in the
Olympic Games or already have," said Phyllis Howard, president of the
USFSA.</TE>
<TE>   To sustain the talent stream, Howard said, USFSA executives are
working with local rinks to emphasize "the ease of entry into the
sport" through learn-to-skate programs.</TE>
<TE>   Clubs often help skaters financially, and the USFSA has a support
fund for skaters at the lower rungs of the competitive ladder, in
addition to its Memorial Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletic funding is very important," she said. "It's a high
priority."</TE>
<TE>   Moving the sport forward while educating athletes about the risks
of performing difficult moves is another priority.</TE>
<TE>   Howard said the overall proficiency level has increased, although
no woman is performing a triple axel in competition, as Harding and
Midori Ito of Japan did a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   But she and LeFevre expressed concern about the number and
severity of back and hip injuries sustained in recent years by young
female skaters, particularly, as the result of practicing triple
jumps and triple-triple combinations.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when the association says, 'Wait a minute here. Nobody's
looking to put somebody in a situation where 10 years from now they
won't be mobile or alive,'" LeFevre said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone would say that a wonderful program without a quad could
win over a lousy program with a quad. The USFSA is looking for a
balance between technical requirements and artistry. We'd love to see
a wonderful program with a quad in it. There are skaters who are
technically superior but perhaps not as artistically mature as
others, and vice versa.... You've got to have both sides equally."</TE>
<TE>   All Bodes Well for Miller</TE>
<TE>   He might change his mind later, but skier Bode Miller said last
week he'd prefer a World Cup championship to an Olympic medal.</TE>
<TE>   "A World Cup title is more important," he said after earning his
third circuit victory this season in a slalom race at Adelboden,
Switzerland, and became the first American to win three World Cup
races in a season since Phil Mahre did it in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympic medal is great, but it shows either you were lucky or
you picked a great day to rip it. A World Cup title shows you were at
the top of your sport all year long."</TE>
<TE>   The Franconia, N.H., native led after the first run on a steep and
inconsistent course that had more than a few holes. He skied
aggressively but intelligently on his second run to win with a time
of 1 minute 33.24 seconds, ahead of Croatia's Ivica Kostelic
(1:35.16) and Slovenia's Mitja Kunc (1:35.39).</TE>
<TE>   Miller had previously won a giant slalom at Val d'Isere, France,
and a night slalom in Madonna diCampiglio, Italy. "I've had
confidence for all four years I've been on the team, on the World
Cup," he said. "I come into every race ready to win.... You have to
minimize the things you can't control. I definitely have the speed,
no question. If I'm skiing as fast as I can, I'm about the fastest in
the world. But sometimes I go too fast. I have to know when to take
it back."</TE>
<TE>   Miller credits some of his success this season to being free of
injuries last summer and better able to train hard, as well as to new
slalom skis custom built to his preferences. "And some of it's just
time and experience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not too jaded to appreciate his good fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a bad job," he said. "You can imagine, basically, what
you like to do the most and getting paid for it. It's good."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Glow Lingers</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Olympic gold medalist Katarina Witt, now touring with
Stars on Ice, thinks back fondly on her competitive days--but she
doesn't really miss them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thankful for the experience and I went through three
different kinds of Olympics, and I'm able to sit back and be very
proud of what I have achieved," said Witt, who won in 1984 and 1988,
and returned in 1994 to finish seventh. "You look at the Olympics and
you look at the skaters now and you'd like to be part of it with the
knowledge you have now. But in some ways, it's better to go in and be
innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Stars on Ice will stop in Anaheim Jan. 19 and at Staples Center
Jan. 20. Shortly afterward, Witt will take a break from the tour to
work as a skating commentator for German TV at the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always drawn to the Olympics," the 36-year-old German said.
"I'm really excited to be part of it, to be in the building, and to
have it take place in Salt Lake City, in America, where they
appreciate good skating."</TE>
<TE>   She also said performing tougher jumps isn't necessarily the way
the sport should go for women.</TE>
<TE>   "I think where it is right now, it is difficult enough," she said.
"Eliminating compulsory figures, in some ways, was good. In some
ways, especially for girls, it was not good because they're doing all
those jumps and putting pressure on their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at the ladies now and I think they have very difficult
programs, but I also want them to have movement and grace. I don't
want to watch them run from one triple to another. I don't want to go
'Wow! Wow! Wow!' I want to see beautiful elegance and sexiness too."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   More additions to the list of torchbearers who will carry the
flame when it arrives in Southern California Monday: former Laker
Magic Johnson, Olympic gold medal decathlon winner Rafer Johnson and
Olympic soccer gold medalist Julie Foudy.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Williams will compete in the women's 50 meters at the L.A.
Invitational indoor meet Feb. 23 at the Sports Arena. Williams, a
senior at USC, has won the NCAA 100-meter championship the past three
seasons. She won a gold medal at last year's world championships as a
member of the 400-meter relay team.... USA Track and Field's Golden
Spike indoor tour will consists of four events. Those will be at
Boston, Jan. 27; the Millrose Games at New York's Madison Square
Garden, Feb. 1; at Lincoln, Neb., Feb. 9 and the U.S. indoor
championships March 1-2 at the Armory track and field center in New
York.</TE>

<TE>   Bobsled/Luge/Skeleton: Mike Gonzales, a USC alumnus who competed
in the four-man bobsled for Puerto Rico at Nagano in 1998, thought he
had qualified for the Salt Lake City Games. However, confusion over
points awarded during one or more events led international bobsled
officials to tell Gonzales and brakeman Don Young they hadn't
qualified. They planned to compete this weekend in St. Moritz,
Switzerland, to get the necessary points.... The confusion also
affected teams from Armenia, Hungary and Brazil, among others.... The
U.S. luge team, which completed its roster last weekend when Nick
Sullivan beat Jon Myles in a race-off, will train in Latvia for the
sixth round of World Cup racing. The next event will be Jan. 19 at
Sigulda, Latvia.... The U.S. must move up a place in World Cup
skeleton standings to add a third member to its Olympic women's team.

<LD>Laura Handy was scowling as she left Staples Center ice Wednesday
night. Her partner, Jonathon Hunt, had taken a hard fall when the
figure skating pair tried their side-by-side triple toe loop jumps.
Hunt got up, chased Handy down and the performance continued. A few
moments later, Handy two-footed her landing on the throw triple
salchow move.</LD>
<LD>   There was triumph in the completion of the program, victory in the
getting up. Handy and Hunt are still learning about each other,
figuring out when to turn left, when to spin right, how far to jump,
how long to reach. They have skated together less than two years and
that is two years longer than Handy once thought she'd be skating.</LD>
<LD>   They are in sixth place after the short program at the 2002 U.S.
Figure Skating Championships.</LD>
<TE>   Leading, as expected, are two-time defending champions Kyoko Ina
and John Zimmerman, who skated the 2-minute, 40-second program which
counts for one-third the final score, to a raucous selection of music
from Pink Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 29, 1999, Handy and Paul Binnebose were a promising,
young American pair. They finished second in the 1999 world junior
championship and third at their first U.S. senior nationals.</TE>
<TE>   In practice that day, at a Delaware rink, Binnebose lifted Handy
above his head with one hand. The move is called a star lift. It is
not easy but it is not an extraordinary move. But Binnebose had been
having back trouble and when Handy was high in the air, Binnebose's
back went into a spasm. As Binnebose fell, he tried his best to break
Handy's fall. And he did. But in doing so, Binnebose cracked his
skull on the ice. His coma lasted a month. Twice he stopped
breathing.</TE>
<TE>   That Binnebose recovered is amazing. That he is teaching skating
in Pennsylvania is uplifting. That Handy is  championships with a
serious hope of qualifying for the Olympics is a triumph of another
kind.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost quit," Handy said Wednesday night. "I didn't know if I
wanted to do this. I didn't think I could find another partner. I
just wasn't sure of myself."</TE>
<TE>   For several months after the accident, Handy spent nights crying
herself to sleep. And after she fell asleep, Handy would wake up
screaming. The memories of the fall broke her heart and scared her
awake.</TE>
<TE>   She blamed herself. Was she too heavy? Had she made life too
difficult for her partner?</TE>
<TE>   And in the guilt was hesitancy to move on. Handy told Binnebose
she wouldn't skate again until he could. Binnebose encouraged Handy
to find someone else because Handy was too talented to sit and wait,
maybe forever. So Handy, 21, found Hunt, 20, in her rink.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like starting all over," Handy said. "Everything you did
before with someone else, it's all different. The style, the timing.
All of it."</TE>
<TE>   Handy and Hunt finished sixth last year at their first senior
nationals and were eighth at Skate America last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nerves for me tonight, definitely," Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't nervous," Handy said. "I just think I tried too hard."</TE>
<TE>   All the early skaters had trouble. Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler,
the sister and brother duo from Manhattan Beach, skated first and
fell hardest.</TE>

<LD>Here's a deal you don't find every day in L.A.:</LD>
<LD>   Parking for ice dance compulsories: $20.</LD>
<LD>   It's impressive, really, when you stop and consider the cold
figures. You sit in your car, blinking over and over at those big red
numbers blocking your entrance to the Staples Center parking lot, and
you start thinking about what that $20 is buying you: The right to
dock your car awhile so you can pay another $25 to $75 to watch 14
pairs of skaters perform the same set of moves, to the same two
songs, for the next three hours.</LD>
<TE>   Either that, or you can drive a couple more blocks and take that
$20 to the Pantry for an early dinner. You'll get change back too.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, not many were buying into ice dance compulsories
Wednesday. Word apparently leaked. A year ago, in Boston, the ice
dance team of Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won the U.S.
championship. The team of Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto finished
second. And those, ladies and gentlemen, are your 2002 gold and
silver medalists. No need to make the trek up the 110. No need to pay
the parking attendant $20. No need to actually hold the
"competition," as purists refer to it, at all.</TE>
<TE>   Ice dance exists, not to surprise or excite, because the winners
have been established months or sometimes years in advance, but,
evidently, to give the Zamboni some practice before the women's short
program. In fact, the Zamboni break is where the ice dance really
picks up steam. You wade through 14 renditions of the Ravensburger
Waltz and you find yourself placing bets which side the rink the
driver first picks to resurface, left or right.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, reporters covering ice dance have become as
ritualistic as the event itself. Most of them stay in the workroom,
pounding out their advance stories for the women's short program and
nodding when a publicity staffer hands them the final ice dance
results. Those who actually venture out into the arena--they do so
because they have a local ice dance team entered--come equipped, the
same way ski writers arrive at the mountain with parkas and fur-lined
gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Vital equipment: Unread sections of today's newspaper. Or
yesterday's. A crossword puzzle. A paperback novel. Magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio are
the first Italian ice dancers to win a gold medal at both the
European and World Championships, are known for their great speed and
footwork and perform original dances that have been among the most
authentically represented rhythms in recent years?</TE>
<TE>   (That's from "Blades On Ice" magazine.)</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that accuracy, placement, style, unison, time and
expression are the requirements ice dancers must observe when
performing their compulsory routines?</TE>
<TE>   (That's from the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 2001-2002 media guide.)</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that "The Princess Diaries" just eclipsed "Rush Hour
2" as the No. 1 video rental in the country?</TE>
<TE>   (That's from "Entertainment Weekly.")</TE>
<TE>   Another good way to cover ice dance compulsories, I have found, is
to take a walk around the concourse. Maybe pop into Fox Sports Sky
Box and see how the Lakers are making out against Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking news! The Sky Box is closed until Thursday. Tough break,
sports fans.</TE>
<TE>   Onto the food stands. Hmm, long lines. Lots of activity. Of
course. The Ravensburger Waltz--sure-fire cause for the munchies.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away is a concession stand worker with time on his
hands. He's manning the figure skating souvenir kiosk. A big women's
handbag with a figure skating logo goes for $75. A small women's
handbag, with one extra strap, goes for $80. A hooded figure skating
sweatshirt is listed for $50.</TE>
<TE>   Conveniently located 30 feet away is an ATM.</TE>
<TE>   I ask the young man behind the kiosk how business has been.</TE>
<TE>   He shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice dance is not the most popular event," he says. "It'll pick up
later tonight, when the pairs start. I guess each sport has its
favorites."</TE>
<TE>   Above his head, a television monitor shows ice dancers going
through the motions. The people milling around the lobby, heading for
the pizza lines or the Laker souvenir stands, don't even notice.</TE>
<TE>   The man behind the kiosk shakes his head again.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only event where they leave the arena during the
competition and don't even watch it," he says. "[Tuesday] night, with
the men, no one was in the lobby."</TE>
<TE>   That's because Timothy Goebel and Michael Weiss were on the ice,
some of the time, spending much of it over the surface, spinning
three times in the air and landing on a razor-thin blade of
steel--or, in Weiss' case, trying to spin four times in the air and
landing on his pants.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, the 1999 and 2000 national champion and a 1998 Olympian,
wound up fifth after Tuesday's men's short program, virtually
eliminated from a return trip to the Winter Games two days before the
start of the long program.</TE>
<TE>   That's something that would never happen in ice dance.</TE>
<TE>   The top two ranked teams after Wednesday's ice dance compulsories:</TE>
<TE>   1. Lang and Tchernyshev.</TE>
<TE>   2. Belbin and Agosto.</TE>
<TE>   But you already knew that.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorsey High guard Drew Gibson didn't realize he was making
history--or did he?</LD>
<LD>   The smooth manner in which Gibson drove the baseline and scored
the winning basket in Dorsey's 82-79 victory over host Crenshaw on
Wednesday in the teams' Coliseum League opener seemed to indicate he
realized the significance of his accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, Gibson had no idea he had just helped the Dons hand
Crenshaw only the eighth homecourt loss in Cougar Coach Willie West's
31 seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "It's good to be one of the eight," said Gibson, who scored 15 of
his 19 points in the first half. "All we have to do is build on
this."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw (11-5), No. 13 in The Times' rankings, tied the score,
78-78, when Derrick Clark drove for a layup with less than a minute
to play in the back-and-forth contest.</TE>
<TE>   But Gibson took a pass, drove the baseline and elevated for a
basket that put Dorsey ahead, 80-78. The Dons (9-4) stole the ball on
Crenshaw's next possession, and Donald Wilson made two free throws
with nine seconds remaining to make the score 82-78.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw's Money Brown made one of two free throws with five
seconds remaining to pull the Cougars within three points, but no one
could grab the rebound before time expired.</TE>
<TE>   LeBoise Gladden made six three-pointers and finished with a
team-high 26 points for Dorsey. Marcus Williams scored 23 points and
Clark had 21 for Crenshaw, which made only 12 of 30 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could make layups and free throws, we might be undefeated
right now," West said. "That has hurt us all [season]."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fremont 105, Jefferson 66--Mark Bradford scored 21 points for the
second-ranked Pathfinders (14-1) in a Coliseum League opener at
Fremont. Darren Brown had 18 points and 15 rebounds and Glen Bullard
had 18 points for Fremont (14-1), which led, 28-14, after the first
quarter and 56-26 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 68, St. John Bosco 60--Len Collins had 28 points
and seven rebounds to lead No. 3 Santa Margarita (17-1) in a Serra
League opener at St. John Bosco (16-3).</TE>
<TE>   Gio St. Amant had 30 points for 19th-ranked St. John Bosco.</TE>
<TE>   Downey 64, Dominguez 63--Day Hardy hit a three-pointer at the
buzzer to win the game for host Downey (10-7), in a San Gabriel
Valley League opener that ended Dominguez' 62-game league winning
streak. The Vikings rallied from a 59-50 deficit with 1:30 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   In girls' basketball:</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly 68, Long Beach Wilson 50--The fifth-ranked
Jackrabbits had 18 steals against No. 17 Wilson, leading by as many
as 28 points en route to their 17th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Poly (17-0, 2-0) beat its strongest challenger for the Moore
League title for the second time in a week.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits defeated Wilson in the final of the Ayala Best of
the West tournament on Saturday, 61-44.</TE>
<TE>   Poly used its press to open a 17-6 lead after one quarter. The
defense forced 10 turnovers in the third quarter and the Jackrabbits
outscored Wilson, 20-8, to take a 54-32 cushion into the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we could put some pressure on them and cause some
mistakes," said Carl Buggs, Poly's coach. "We came out in the third
quarter the way we did in the first."</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Buggs led Poly with 17 points, 13 in the first half,
including three three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (12-4, 0-1) got 14 points from Neka Mixon and 12 from
Brandi Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In girls' water polo:</TE>
<TE>   Riverside North 9, Arlington 8--Alaina Whitaker scored seven goals
and Kasey Weaver stopped 17 shots to lead North in an Ivy League game
at Arlington (8-3).</TE>
<TE>   After Whitaker's seventh goal gave the Huskies a 9-6 lead with
3:48 remaining, Arlington's Jennifer D'Anna scored 44 seconds later
on a four-meter penalty throw and teammate Meghan Rosenberger cut the
lead to one with 2:34 left.</TE>
<TE>   Arlington's defense stopped North on its final three possessions,
but the Lions couldn't get the ball past Weaver, even with the player
advantage the final 25 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In boys' soccer:</TE>
<TE>   Millikan 3, Long Beach Poly 0--Scott Mason, Raul Larios and
Agustin Nunez each scored to help visiting Millikan extend its league
unbeaten streak to 46 games, a Southern Section record. The
second-ranked Rams (16-1, 3-0) broke the record of 45 set by La
Canada from 1989-93. Millikan is 36-0-10 during the streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In girls' soccer:</TE>
<TE>   Diamond Bar 3, St. Lucy's 0--Annica Perez had two assists to lead
host Diamond Bar (10-3, 1-0) in an upset of the Times' ninth-ranked
team.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps it's the post-holiday blues, the economy or late-night
scheduling, but the first few sessions of the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships have not drawn huge crowds.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's attendance was announced as 6,100. Tickets remain for
all sessions, including Sunday's exhibition. However, fewer than
2,000 tickets remain for the women's final Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Hopefully, the crowds will continue to grow," U.S. Figure Skating
Assn. spokesman Bob Dunlop said. "The last two years we set
attendance records. We would love to do the same here."</LD>
<TE>   The event drew 124,372 last year at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defying that unwritten sports rule of taking it one inning,
period, quarter, game or Olympics at a time, anyone interested in a
glimpse of the future of figure skating might get a hint by watching
13-year-old Beatrisia Liang of Granada Hills tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Liang, coached by 1985 U.S. champion Tiffany Chin, was sixth at
last year's national championships. Since then, she has added a
triple-triple to her arsenal and a good deal of maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just getting better and better," Chin said of Liang's triple
toe loop-triple toe loop combination, which she performed in practice
Wednesday at HealthSouth Training Center. "She's a good kid and easy
to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "It's made a huge difference. I was surprised to see how it
affects her stamina and affects her confidence, knowing she can do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Liang, nicknamed "Bebe," will do the jump in her long program
Saturday. "Regardless of what she does, I'm pleased she made her goal
of landing it," Chin said.</TE>
<TE>   Liang, remarkably poised, said she's not nervous about skating in
her hometown. "I'm probably more excited than anything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Helene Elliott</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Experience can mean as much as talent in competitive figure
skating. Knowing how to perform under pressure, and what judges
respond to, is as critical as executing the spins and jumps.</TE>
<TE>   Learning how to deal with bright lights and strong performances by
opponents is a big reason Loren Galler-Rabinowitz and David Mitchell
are the U.S. junior dance champions.</TE>
<TE>   Galler-Rabinowitz, 15, from Boston, and Mitchell, 19, from Ann
Arbor, Mich., who won the title Wednesday at the Sports Arena, are in
their fourth season as a team. They won the novice dance championship
in 2000; last year, their first in juniors, they finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "That [competition] helped us a lot for this year," Mitchell said.
"Not so much for getting used to the environment, but giving us
something to compare ourselves with. We learned it was a very big
step from novice to junior, in terms of maturity in skating what the
judges were looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Added Galler-Rabinowitz: "In novice there is much less hype. When
you're a junior, it's a bigger arena and a bigger audience. It's open
judging. It's a completely different world. To step into that world
last year was more of an experiment."</TE>
<TE>   They also had to feel the competitive fire of Melissa Ralph and
Ryan O'Meara, whose athletic, sprightly skating captured the crowd's
heart and the judges' top votes in the free skating final.</TE>
<TE>   But Galler-Rabinowitz and Mitchell, who led after both the
compulsory and original dance rounds, never panicked or hurried their
routine, which flowed as easily as Galler-Rabinowitz's white outfit.</TE>
<TE>   "Ralph and O'Meara, third after the first two rounds, settled for
second.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really satisfied with our performance," said O'Meara, 18,
of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good enough to win," added Ralph, 16, of Stamford, Conn.
"But we're not disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   In other skating, Louann Donovan was the leader in the ladies'
juniors after Wednesday's short program, and Amy Howerton and Steven
Potteger led the junior pairs competition.</TE>

<HD>McGowan Supplies Power for Pepperdine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pepperdine men's basketball team opens West Coast Conference play
Friday at St. Mary's, and the return of forward Glen McGowan from his
semester suspension should give the Waves a stronger lineup.</LD>
<LD>   McGowan made five of 11 shots and scored 13 points in 22 minutes
last Saturday in his first game of the season, helping the Waves end
Brigham Young's eight-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   McGowan, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound sophomore, looked rusty, forced
some shots and missed others he would normally make. He resumed
practice only last week after sitting out the first semester of the
school year on suspension for instigating a fight with teammate Will
Kimble in September.</LD>
<TE>   "Glen is one of our top players," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal
said. "We missed him."</TE>
<TE>   McGowan presents matchup problems for opponents because he is a
power forward who can score from the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal said McGowan will help narrow the Waves' deficit in free
throws and rebounding. Pepperdine (7-6) has attempted 94 fewer free
throws than its opponents and is being outrebounded by an average of
six per game.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams had been shooting 10 to 15 more free throws than us,"
Westphal said. "[McGowan] gets to the line. That'll help even things
out."</TE>
<TE>   McGowan said he felt good in his first game appearance in four
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to do too much and I was rushing my shots," he said.
"At halftime, Coach told me to not force things and let the game come
to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine plays at Utah State tonight in a key early season Big
West Conference men's basketball game. Utah State (11-2, 3-1 in
conference play) has won 31 consecutive games at home and 41 of its
last 42 Big West games at home.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (10-4, 3-0) will need Adam Parada to continue his strong
play in order to challenge the Aggies. After a slow start, the 7-foot
sophomore has put together consecutive strong games, giving opponents
a player to worry about other than guard Jerry Green, and providing
the Anteaters with a much-needed inside scoring threat.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Parada scored 15 points in a 68-58 victory over Cal
State Fullerton, then matched his career high with 20 points in a
72-53 victory over UC Riverside on Saturday. Against Riverside, he
scored 10 consecutive points during a decisive second-half run.</TE>
<TE>   "He was active," Irvine Coach Pat Douglass said. "He started
attacking the rim. He looked much better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team has used a
different starting lineup in each of its 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Inconsistency, injury, illness and absences have led to all the
shuffling, but after a 70-59 victory over Pacific in a Big West
Conference game Saturday, when Joseph Frazier started in place of
guard Ed Estavan, the Matadors (3-9, 2-1) may have finally found the
right combination.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope so," Northridge Coach Bobby Braswell said. "We're young,
things aren't set, and sometimes guys don't always do what they
should.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on what guys do in practice. We work on a merit system
and if a guy's not doing what he should, I put somebody else in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's men's basketball team is 9-3 and 3-1 in
the Big West Conference, its best start since the 1991-92 season when
the Mustangs started 13-1. Leading the way in victories over Utah
State and Idaho last week was forward Brandon Beeson, a senior who
played at Irvine Woodbridge High.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 18.5 points and 6.5 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Topping of Fullerton is among 22 players who have been
selected by USA Softball as core athletes for its World Championship
Team Camp that will be held in May in Oklahoma City. Topping, a
junior catcher from Whittier, was an All-American and the Big West
Conference player of the year in 2001 when she batted .423 with 14
home runs and 59 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, which reached the NCAA men's volleyball national title match
last season, will open against UC Irvine in the Wyndham West Coast
Challenge on Friday at UC Irvine's Crawford Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine and USC will meet in a 5 p.m. match preceding the
UCLA-Irvine meeting. The same teams will continue with pool play on
Saturday with UCLA vs. USC at noon, Pepperdine vs. Irvine at 2 p.m.,
Irvine vs. USC at 5 p.m., and Pepperdine vs. UCLA at 7 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   College baseball teams across the Southland began practice this
week for the Division I season that begins, for some, in a little
more than two weeks. USC is ranked fourth, Fullerton 15th and
Northridge 22nd in Baseball America magazine's preseason poll.
Stanford is ranked No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine will play its first game since 1992 when the Anteaters
play host to San Diego on Jan. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge and Riverside are competing in the Big West Conference
for the first time.</TE>

not join the team this season.</LD>
<LD>   Fey, a 7-foot, 255-pound center from Olympia, Wash., has been
trying to gain admission to UCLA since last spring. He attended
Harbor College in the fall but did not play basketball.</LD>

<HD>A Rival Is Right on Time</HD>
<DH>USC-UCLA: Bibby's Trojans have narrowed the gap, but a
victory over Bruins at Forum tonight would help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the surface, it seems like a mismatch of a rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   When one team has won 13 of the last 14 games, how does it
continue to be classified as a classic rivalry?</LD>
<LD>   And when a coach has won only one of 10 meetings against his alma
mater, how does he keep a straight face when he talks about the
rivalry being "do-or-die for each school" before every game, every
season?</LD>
<TE>   "I've only beaten them once since I've been here," Trojan senior
point guard Brandon Granville said. "So that pretty much says it
all."</TE>
<TE>   USC senior power forward Sam Clancy added: "When you only beat a
team one time, obviously they've got your number."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is a feeling that the vast gap between the championship
tradition of UCLA and the precociousness of USC is closing under the
direction of Henry Bibby, the Trojans' sixth-year coach who won three
national championships as UCLA's point guard.</TE>
<TE>   The unranked Trojans (12-2 overall, 4-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference) and No. 11 Bruins (11-2, 4-0) meet tonight at 7:30 at the
Forum and, for the first time since USC stunned UCLA with a season
sweep in 1992, the Trojans have realistic hopes of claiming the
Southland as their domain. They seem to be making inroads on the
Bruins' turf.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually have a chance this year," USC senior small forward
David Bluthenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, UCLA has its 11 national titles, but in the college
hoops world of what-have-you-done-for-me-lately, USC has garnered
gobs of attention after advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA
tournament last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm building. I'm pioneering," said Bibby, who is 1-9 against
UCLA. "I think I'm building the program and people are getting some
recognition that we're a good basketball school that has to be
reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   "But to be up there every year and to be in the Final Four every
year, I probably won't see that in my tenure. But I think down the
road, somebody's going to get the job, eventually, after my time is
up, and make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get things quickly in life."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Bibby is being fatalistic. He's simply being
realistic.</TE>
<TE>   After serving on an interim basis to close out the disastrous
1995-96 season, in which USC lost 11 of its final 13 games, Bibby was
hired by Athletic Director Mike Garrett to take over the moribund
program for good on March 15, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty obvious that we didn't have a program when we hired
him," Garrett said. "But the fact is we were in the Elite Eight last
year and because of how well we did and how well we're doing, we're
right on the cusp [of a traditionally good] program, contrary to what
you read or hear in the rankings."</TE>
<TE>   USC made it to the NCAA tournament in Bibby's first full season as
coach and, on Aug. 4, 2000, Garrett rewarded Bibby with a three-year
contract extension that takes him through the 2004-05 season. There
have also been talks of sweetening the pot financially after last
spring's run in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy with what he's done," Garrett said. "I always
thought Bibby had the ability to create a program."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time Troy has infringed on Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   During Bob Boyd's 13 years as USC coach from 1967-79, the Trojans
won at least 15 games nine times, including the 1971 season when they
went 24-2, both losses coming to the Bruins, and finished ranked No.
5. But that was when only one school per conference could qualify for
the NCAA tournament and Boyd beat UCLA only twice in 28 games.</TE>
<TE>   George Raveling and his letter-writing campaign as Trojan coach
from 1987-94 yielded Harold Miner, six wins in 14 games against UCLA
and two NCAA appearances. But a bad car accident left Raveling
fatigued and he could not keep up with the UCLA mystique either.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA leads the all-time series, 118-93.</TE>
<TE>   As a former Bruin, Bibby need look no farther than Westwood to see
a model on which to base his program.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what UCLA has over there," Bibby said. "They go back to
1963-64, when they won their first championship. You're looking at
[38] years later and it's still the same thing. We don't have that
tradition here in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what Steve Lavin is getting at UCLA: what John Wooden did
years ago, what Larry Farmer did, what Gary Cunningham did. [Lavin
is] kind of reaping that 'We know how to win' tradition and get
20-win seasons every year. So hopefully it's going to be like that
[at USC]."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans win the occasional recruiting battle with UCLA for
Southland players--the Craven twins went to USC as a package deal
because Lavin wanted Errick but didn't have room for Derrick--but the
Bruins still win the war.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried and it's really tough," Bibby said. "We were recruiting
kids on their team now and the kids didn't give us a look at all.
Dijon Thompson, Andre Patterson--his father played for me. I go back
20 years with Andre Patterson's father. And Stais Boseman played for
me and Cedric [Bozeman] is his nephew. So there's three guys right
there you'd think you'd have a shot at getting into your program who
don't give you any look at all, like 'SC doesn't exist to three local
kids. ... That's the difference. If we can pull in some of those guys
that are local like that, then we're in the same ballpark they're in.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Lavin is good, but also, the UCLA tradition helps get those
guys into their program, a tradition that we don't have yet."</TE>
<TE>   Building an on-campus arena, an idea that has been floated since
Paul Westphal made his recruiting visit to USC in the late 1960s,
would be a step in that direction. Beating UCLA tonight would also
help.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Elite Eight last year, that set the tone," Clancy said.
"There's no real drop-off [next year] with me, Dave and Brandon
leaving. People are saying that we're no longer second to UCLA. But
you've definitely got to beat them or be seen as the little
stepchild."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Forum conjures images of the most fabulous Lakers--Magic Johnson,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Gail
Goodrich.</LD>
<LD>   Those names, in fact, are still listed on banners that hang above
the court  alongside six others commemorating the six NBA
championships the team won there.</LD>
<LD>   But since the Lakers moved to Staples Center in 2000, the Forum is
more closely associated with Neil Diamond and Stevie Wonder--two of
the top-name acts to perform recently--and with Bishop Kenneth C.
Ulmer, who conducts services of the Faithful Central Bible Church,
the current owner of the 17,600-seat facility.</LD>
<TE>   Besides a few state high school playoff games every year,
basketball was a thing of the past until USC scheduled four games
there this season. The Trojans already have played Pepperdine,
Washington and Washington State at the Forum, and tonight's game
against UCLA is more than a matchup between cross-town rivals.</TE>
<TE>   For the Bruins, playing at the Forum is a special treat. Memories
are flooding back to players who idolized the Lakers while growing up
in the Southland. In fact, UCLA's three freshmen--Cedric Bozeman,
Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson--spent much of their childhoods
living near the corner of Manchester and Prairie.</TE>
<TE>   A sampling of reflections on the Forum:</TE>
<TE>   Thompson grew up in Inglewood and attended Redondo Union High: "I
played my last high school game there, the state semifinals against
Dominguez. When I walked on the floor I was like, 'Wow, I'm actually
playing at the Forum.' But it was a rough game, a rough memory, we
lost bad. This time when I walk out there I'll feel like I finally
made it."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Billy Knight grew up in Los Angeles and attended
Westchester High: "I never went to a game there. The tickets were out
of my reach. But I go to church there all the time now. I sneak a
look at the banners and retired jerseys. I always did want to play
there and it will be incredible to have that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman attended Mater Dei High and was a McDonald's All-American:
"It's really cool to play there, especially with all the tradition. I
was always aware of that, and so is my dad. I played CIF games there
and I grew up real close, just a few minutes away. I always looked up
to Magic as a big man who could play point guard."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore T.J. Cummings is the son of former NBA veteran Terry
Cummings: "It's in San Diego, right? Oh, that place. I have been
there, to watch my dad when I was 14 or 15 and I lived in La Jolla. I
think he was with San Antonio then. I just remember going in the back
and waiting for him after games."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson grew up in Inglewood, moved to Indiana before starting
high school, then moved back and attended Washington Prep as a
senior: "I played for five minutes at halftime of a Laker game when I
was 7 or 8.  I scored, I remember that, but it all happened so quick.
I grew up three minutes from the Forum and went to a lot of Laker
games. I didn't get a chance to play there in high school because we
got eliminated in the playoffs. I was disappointed. I've always
dreamed of playing there and now I'll have my family and all my
friends there watching."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Jason Kapono grew up in Long Beach and attended Artesia
High: "When I think of the Forum, I think of Chick Hearn's voice.
I've never played there, I never even went to a Laker game. In fact,
I never saw a pro basketball game until [Dec. 14], I went to the
Laker-Clipper game at Staples Center. But the Forum is all about
Magic, Kareem, [Michael] Cooper, Byron [Scott], Worthy. It's where
all the greats played. I will definitely be high thinking about all
the great players. I hope it's a sellout."</TE>

<HD>Conyers Asks Selig to Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The House Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat urged Bud Selig to
resign Wednesday, saying the commissioner appeared to violate major
league rules in a 1995 loan from a company controlled by the owner of
the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan said the loan created an
"irreparable conflict of interest" for Selig in his plan to fold two
franchises, a proposal that most likely would include the Twins.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of this disclosure and your apparent unwillingness to
reveal other financial information that you assert supports your
decision to eliminate two baseball teams, I regret that I must call
on you to resign as commissioner of major league baseball," Conyers
wrote in a letter to Selig that the congressman released.</LD>

defending Big West champion Aggies (11-2, 3-1) play host to the
Anteaters (10-4, 3-0) in a key conference matchup. Utah State has won
31 consecutive conference games at home while guard Jerry Green and
7-foot Adam Parada give Irvine the best inside-outside duo in the Big
West.</LD>
<TE>   Men's volleyball: Wyndham West Coast Challenge tournament, Friday

<LD>An Oxnard man who received thousands of dollars in disability pay
while working as a security guard and training to be a police officer was
sentenced Wednesday to three years in state prison, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Rene Pilon, 42, was convicted of 14 counts of workers'
compensation fraud.</LD>
<LD>   After he was fired from his job with a Santa Barbara security company,
Pilon filed a disability request with the company claiming he had been
injured in January 1999 when he was hit on the head with a coffee mug
while responding to a disturbance call.</LD>
<TE>   In total, Pilon was paid $48,300 in disability benefits and medical
costs, said Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Leventhal.</TE>

<LD>A 35-year-old Anaheim man was severely burned Wednesday when fumes
from gasoline he used as a cleaning solvent ignited inside his home,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The father of four, who was not identified, suffered second- and
third-degree burns over at least 40% of his body, including his head.</LD>
<LD>   The man was using gasoline as a cleaning agent in the bathroom of his
home in the 1100 block of South Lemon Street. A pilot light in a nearby
hallway wall heater apparently ignited the fumes, a fire department

<HD>Police Aide Says He Regrets Words About Slayings</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Spokesman apologizes to the City Council for calling
officers 'equal opportunity' shooters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the parents of a slain Oxnard man listened, a police spokesman
who had publicly described Oxnard officers as "equal opportunity"
shooters apologized for "poor judgment" and said he did not mean to
demean their son.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman David Keith, speaking to the Oxnard City Council and a crowd
of 200 on Tuesday evening, offered his "sincere apologies" to the
council, the Police Department and "most importantly, the family of
[Robert] Jones. No malice whatsoever was intended."</LD>
<LD>   At a neighborhood meeting in September, a month after police shot the
black artist, Keith noted the races of five police homicide victims and
of the officers involved, then said the shootings were "equal
opportunity."</LD>
<TE>   "I was trying to dispel any thought that these incidents were racially
motivated," Keith told the City Council. "I certainly regret making these
statements."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' mother and stepfather, Ida and Steve Perkins, declined to
comment on the apology.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still very much a fresh wound to the family," said their
attorney, Gabriella Navarro Busch. "But I can say they were very touched
by the show of support by the community, and it really warmed their
hearts."</TE>
<TE>   The Perkinses flew in from Oregon, where they moved after Jones'
slaying, to join community groups in a protest of Keith's comments and
his suggestions that the 23-year-old may have been on drugs when he was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers for black and Latino groups told the council Tuesday
that it should be more involved in the city's law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Greg Ramirez, who spoke for the local Mexican American Bar
Assn., said the council should take a forceful leadership role with the
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "When something is wrong, you've got to stand up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez accused police of distorting the truth about Jones' shooting
and attempting to blemish his reputation by making inaccurate statements
that he had a criminal record. Jones had been acquitted of resisting
arrest. A weapons possession charge was pending.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to condemn a practice," Ramirez said, "essentially a
character assassination of the person who was shot, to justify the
shooting."</TE>
<TE>   He challenged the council to sanction Keith or stand guilty of
ratifying his conduct.</TE>
<TE>   John Hatcher, president of the local chapter of the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People, and David Rodriguez of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, also asked the council to act on Keith's
comments and the spate of police shootings in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Redirect the leadership of the Police Department or change it,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was shot Aug. 24 during a standoff in his north Oxnard home. His
mother had called police to take the distraught and severely depressed
young man to a hospital for treatment. Police said Jones was shot because
he was brandishing a 13-inch knife and had moved toward officers after
they entered his bedroom and opened a closet where he was hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said he wasn't pressured by his superiors to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said he considered the apology heartfelt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very unfortunate comment," Lopez said. "But we are all
human. He made a mistake, and he acknowledged it."</TE>
<TE>   Keith did not apologize for comments he made at the same September
meeting suggesting that Jones might have been high on the drug PCP.
Toxicology tests found no illegal drugs in Jones' system.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he would reserve judgment on that issue until he reviews a
transcript of Keith's comments. The transcript was prepared for Ramirez,
who was initially the Perkinses' lawyer but has handed off the case
because of a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The transcript says Keith stated repeatedly that the department did
not know whether Jones was on PCP. But Keith also said Jones acted like
someone under the influence of drugs. He said Jones showed no effects
when twice doused with pepper spray and was not slowed much after being
shot twice with a beanbag shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, you think of PCP and things like that when someone doesn't
react to those kinds of things," Keith said, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said he does not believe that police used pepper spray,
because the coroner's report makes no mention of finding the noxious
substance on Jones' skin or clothing.</TE>
<TE>   When the Police Department's investigation of the shooting is
completed, the results will be given to the district attorney's office.
The district attorney found that the other four lethal shootings in 2001
were justified.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI are
also conducting inquiries into Jones' death.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Jones killing, Chief Lopez vowed to better train
members of his department to avoid fatal confrontations with mentally ill
people.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Oxnard officers finished a 40-hour training course in December.
Twenty to 25 of the department's 200 officers eventually will be trained,
Lopez said.</TE>

<LD>An appeals court has sided with Huntington Beach in its battle with
a power company over the language used to describe the AES power plant in
a March ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   The ballot measure, if approved, would impose a 5% utility tax on the
AES plant. The ballot measure included the lines: "The AES plant is ugly,
pollutes our air, and our ocean" and "The AES plant has been a blight on
Huntington Beach for over 40 years."</LD>
<LD>   An appellate court on Tuesday allowed the language to stay.</LD>

<HD>When Surfing Is Just Swell</HD>
<DH>Sea: High waves stirred up by a storm far to the north pound
Ventura County beaches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ankle-deep in Pacific Ocean foam, Ron Zachow tucked his surfboard
under his arm and wiped a thick froth of salt water from his goatee.</LD>
<LD>   Zachow was one of the few hearty souls who battled choppy seas and
churning currents Wednesday in their quest to ride the first big waves of
2002 along the Ventura County coast.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like being a salmon swimming upriver," Zachow, 37, said as he
emerged from four hours of riding waves between Emma Wood State Beach and
Rincon Beach. "It's the kind of day where you're glad it's not your third
day ever on a surfboard. I was nervous, and I've been surfing for 20
years."</LD>
<TE>   Sets of waves as big as 12 feet were reported off several stretches of
Ventura County coastline Wednesday but had tapered off by the early
evening, said officials at the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   High tides flooded several campgrounds facing the water, and in some
areas near Faria Beach, homeowners hired bulldozers to shore up muddy
sand washed up by the tide and high waves.</TE>
<TE>   The high surf, which started pounding local beaches Tuesday, was
stirred up by a large winter storm off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   As the storm moves east and is replaced by an offshore flow, waves of
4 feet to 6 feet will continue to hit along shore break points at least
through the weekend, said Bruce Rockwell of the National Weather Service
office in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not been a day for amateurs," Rockwell said of the
surfing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The skies will remain mostly clear through Sunday, with daytime highs
along the coast in the upper 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Inland areas will experience a warming trend that could see 80-degree
days in some spots by the weekend, Rockwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with clear skies and a bright sun, few boaters ventured beyond
the rocky breakwater at Ventura Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   One who did was Capt. Dave Delano of Vessel Assist, who was trying out
a new fiberglass boat.</TE>
<TE>   "We got airborne going over the first wave," said Delano, who operates
a boat towing service from a dock near the entrance to the harbor. "It's
nasty out there."</TE>
<TE>   Zachow and others hungry for high surf took a different approach
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We follow the big waves," said Matt Rapf, who drove up the coast from
Malibu with Zachow to catch the big sets. "You have a lot of people
calling in sick today."</TE>
<TE>   As the two friends were finishing up for the day, freelance writer Ted
Reckas was about to paddle to breakers crashing near a reef about half a
mile out.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the year, wave riding along the Ventura Coast is just average,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the winter a dedicated surfer willing to paddle out to a remote
spot far from lifeguards or other people can bank on some of the best
waves on the West Coast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets strong and disorderly," Reckas said as he waded into the
surf. "It's complete chaos."</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't waiting around to take advantage of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the surf is big, but tomorrow it could be back to 2 feet."</TE>

<HD>For Cop, Lunch Is on the Neighborhood</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach: Lt. Luis Ochoa, retiring after 37 years, is
honored for making a difference in the city's beleaguered Oakview
section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Latino residents of the Oakview neighborhood, Huntington Beach
Police Lt. Luis Ochoa seemed to be everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   He met regularly with the residents. He helped the soccer league get
on its feet. He even regularly read his favorite children's stories to
kids at the library.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Huntington Beach's first Mexican American police officer is
retiring after 37 years on the force. He leaves behind an Oakview that is
no longer a battleground for gangs nor a magnet for drug buyers from as
far away as Los Angeles, police and residents say.</LD>
<TE>   Oakview, which covers about 12 city blocks of aging apartments between
Beach Boulevard, Slater Avenue, Nichols Street and Warner Avenue, still
has its problems. But residents say they are more confident, in part
because of the lessons Ochoa taught them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a member of our family," said Martha Cervantes, who has
lived in Oakview for 16 years and said she watched the neighborhood
become a place families could live in safety.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, who was honored at a community luncheon Wednesday along with
retiring Lt. Clyde Stuart, was one of the few Latino role models in
Huntington Beach when he began his job, many city residents said. And
while there are other Latinos in the school district and other community
agencies these days, they are still few, say residents. The Police
Department still has only 12 Spanish-speaking officers among the 230 in
the department.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a lot of satisfaction from working in a place like Oakview,"
said Ochoa, a 60-year-old father of two and grandfather of three. "People
really appreciate what we do. And I made sure to bring officers in that
neighborhood who would be comfortable in that neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   On streets where brigades of baby strollers outnumber cars at midday,
families are learning how to deal with local government and how to
improve relationships in their homes, said Lillian Chacon, a counselor at
the Oakview Family Resource Center, which helps the families of at-risk
students.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of dollars was pumped into the neighborhood for street
improvements, additional police and code enforcement campaigns, said
Police Lt. Chuck Thomas, who thanked Ochoa for some of them.</TE>
<TE>   When Ochoa became police area commander for north Huntington Beach in
1993, he said Oakview became a pet project of his, in part because he
felt at home in a place that reminded him of where he grew up in west
Wilmington, near Los Angeles Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa convinced the department to open a police substation at Beach
Boulevard and Slater Avenue in 1996. By 1998, crime had gone down and the
substation had become a local hangout for a newly formed band of police
volunteers and, on Halloween, for 5,000 children who enjoyed a haunted
house set up there.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa also persuaded the city to open a center for day laborers where
immigrants could seek work in construction and gardening instead of
standing on street corners. After nearly five years of planning, the
center opened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents remained suspicious of police and officials, who tried
to regulate code violations such as overcrowding, as well as trucks that
sell groceries to a community that relies heavily on public
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Then on May 5, a police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old who had
pointed what turned out to be a toy gun. Rafael Torres, a member of the
newly formed group United Neighbors, said the anger that roiled the
community eventually resulted in increased activism and more contact with
police.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa participated in a series of meetings conducted to cool tensions
after the shooting. They appear to have had mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   "They had those meetings, and I remember [Ochoa], but I still have my
doubts. I still feel like the police are not always on our side," said
Luis Martinez, 31, who lives with his mother, sister and son in an
Oakview apartment. "What they did will take years to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some residents have mended fences. Speaking at the luncheon,
Rafael Torres addressed Ochoa: "How many children have been saved from
domestic violence? How many parents have learned from you, learned about
the law?"</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Zapata said he met Ochoa in the late 1980s when, as a young man
recently arrived from Mexico, Zapata was arrested for repeatedly throwing
stones at pigeons at a local beach. Ochoa was sent to interpret the
conversation between Zapata and the arresting officer. The arrest turned
out to be the beginning of a long friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Zapata, now president of the Huntington Beach Soccer League, has since
turned to Ochoa for help in getting drug dealers off the soccer fields
and in building a bathroom near the fields.</TE>
<TE>   "It really hurts that he's retiring. It is something he has to do,"
Zapata said. "He's made an impact that will help this neighborhood for
many years to come."</TE>

<HD>Flight to Vancouver Planned From OC</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Alaska Airlines will launch the first international
nonstop air travel from John Wayne Airport in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Come April, Orange County will have an international
airport--barely--when Alaska Airlines debuts a flight from John Wayne
Airport to Vancouver, British Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   The new nonstop route was announced Wednesday by Seattle-based Alaska,
which began service from Orange County in 1987. The new flight begins
April 28.</LD>
<LD>   "This service opens new opportunities in both directions for both
business and leisure travel," said Gregg Saretsky, Alaska Airlines'
senior vice president of marketing and planning.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement took airport employees by surprise. The facility has
never had a customs office or other accommodations for international
flights, including a secure area for unloading passengers who must be
processed into the United States. There are no plans to add customs areas
because of space constraints, airport officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But such facilities aren't necessary for the Alaska Airlines flight
because of an agreement between Canada and U.S. officials allowing
passengers to clear customs in Vancouver, which is 140 miles north of
Seattle, Alaska spokesman Jack Walsh said. No such agreement exists
between, for example, the U.S. and Mexico, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As long as a regularly scheduled flight crosses an international
border, the airport can call itself international, said Mike Fergus, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Renton, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of exciting for us," airport spokeswoman Ann McCarly said.
No decisions have been made about whether to change the airport's signs
to include "international." The airport's FAA designation will remain
SNA, for the city of Santa Ana, which is the airport's mailing address.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect to book a flight to London any time soon. Other
physical constraints at the airport include its single 5,700-foot runway,
which is too short for most aircraft headed to foreign destinations.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by Alaska Airlines to add the flight comes even though
air travel has dropped at U.S. airports since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. The airline wanted to open a market for Orange County that
hadn't been served, Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian travelers are attracted to Orange County by Disneyland and
other tourist attractions, and Alaska Airlines is one of the largest
sellers of vacation packages to Disneyland, Walsh said. For Southland
residents, Vancouver is an appealing destination, as well as a gateway
for Alaskan cruises through its famed Inside Passage.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Orange County's plans to build an international airport
at the former El Toro Marine base hailed the Vancouver flight as evidence
that John Wayne Airport, between Newport Beach and Irvine, can
accommodate the needs of local airline travelers. Opponents of the
airport want a park built at El Toro instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Newport Beach has wanted an international airport for years; now they
have it," said Meg Waters, spokeswoman for the El Toro Reuse Planning
Authority, a coalition of South County cities fighting an airport at El
Toro. "We'll throw them a party at the park."</TE>
<TE>   Don't print the invitations just yet, countered David Ellis of the
pro-El Toro Airport Working Group of Orange County. "An international
airport with one flight?" he said. "Tell that to the people waiting in
line for three hours for international flights at LAX."</TE>

<HD>Panel Delays Vote on Tough Runoff Rules</HD>
<DH>Water: After a 10-hour hearing, regulators say they want to study
issues raised about the south Orange County plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water regulators Wednesday postponed a vote on stringent new
runoff rules for south Orange County, a controversial proposal that some
officials fear could cost local cities $15 million a year and not improve
water quality.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important for us to deliberate carefully on all the comments
that were made," said John Minan, chairman of the state's San Diego
Regional Water Quality Control Board. "In my opinion, to encourage
deliberations, it was useful to postpone [the voting] part of the
hearing."</LD>
<LD>   The board decided to put off a decision after a nearly 10-hour public
hearing in Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   Board staffers said the matter will be reconsidered after members have
a chance to consider issues raised during the meeting, including some
revisions that were never disclosed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed restrictions are intended to decrease the amount of
pollutants flowing into local waterways and the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that urban
runoff--the car oil, pet waste and other contaminants washed off streets
and lawns into storm drains, creeks and eventually the ocean--is the No.
1 cause of coastal pollution in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The strict measures are part of a permit required by the federal Clean
Water Act every five years. They would apply to 12 cities, Orange County
and the county's Flood Control District in the south.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal states that "fundamental changes and practices about
urban development" are needed because it is a leading cause of water
pollution in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Key provisions would include:</TE>
<TE>   * Requiring most new developments and major redevelopment projects to
install devices that slow and cleanse the first wave of runoff after a
rainfall, which is typically the dirtiest because it picks up
contaminants that have accumulated on streets for weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibiting runoff from flowing out of storm drains and polluting
waterways.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspecting construction, industrial, commercial and municipal sites
for possible contamination.</TE>
<TE>   * Educating residents, city workers, construction site owners,
developers, businesspeople and others about the effects of urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they have to do a new plan is because their current plan
is so atrocious," said David Beckman, a senior attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "This permit does the best it can possibly
do."</TE>
<TE>   Beckman was one of more than 50 environmentalists, government
officials, lawyers, builders and residents who testified at Wednesday's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   County and city officials say they are already spending nearly $7
million this fiscal year to comply with storm water regulations in the
southern part of the county, and expect the new requirements to add at
least $15 million to that cost.</TE>
<TE>   Many expressed concern that the proposed regulations would accomplish
little beyond cracking down on people hosing off their driveways, washing
their cars and watering their lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from some newer cities such as Aliso Viejo and Rancho Santa
Margarita said they are worried about the financial impact of these major
unplanned expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a fan of water policemen," said Joe Brown, mayor of Laguna
Niguel. "I think in some communities this will lead to a reaction
[resembling something] between the Boston Tea Party and the French
Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita Mayor Jim Thor agreed. "This is definitely a
waste of taxpayer dollars," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hells Angels Leader Leaves Jail on Bail</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Judge allows drug suspect George Christie to use $2
million in real estate to go free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly a year in custody, Hells Angels leader George Christie
Jr. left Ventura County Jail on Wednesday after a judge ruled that he
could use $2 million worth of real estate to post bail.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, who will be under house arrest until his drug and
racketeering trial, walked out before noon and was greeted by his
girlfriend, Nikki Nicoletti.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great," the 54-year-old biker said outside the jail. "I feel
like a million dollars."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, $1 million was the bail set after Christie's February arrest
on suspicion of running a ring that peddled prescription drugs to high
school students in Ojai and Ventura. He is charged with fraud, tax
evasion, firearms possession, drug sales to minors and the use of a
street gang in a criminal conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also obtained indictments against his son, 25; his
ex-wife; and two dozen Hells Angels members and associates. Several have
already pleaded guilty to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Christie denies the allegations, and his attorneys have fought for his
release from jail for months so he could help prepare for trial. They
argued unsuccessfully for a bail reduction and took the issue before the
appellate court, but were rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Then they turned to his friends, five of whom--all with ties to the
Hells Angels--offered equity in their homes and other real estate.</TE>
<TE>   At recent hearings, prosecutors questioned the source of money behind
those properties. But Superior Court Judge Barry Klopfer concluded that
all were obtained legally, and he allowed the defense to use them for
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Christie was required to put up twice the amount of bail because he
secured the bond with property instead of cash.</TE>

<HD>Igor Cassini, 86; Wrote N.Y. Society Column</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he wrote his first society column in the nation's capital, a
few irate scions of tony Virginia hunt society kidnapped him from a
country club dance, beat him up and tarred and feathered him.</LD>
<LD>   That was 1939, and he was definitely on his way to bigger things.</LD>
<LD>   Igor Cassini, who later wrote Hearst Corp.'s syndicated Cholly
Knickerbocker column from New York for 19 years until he was toppled by
an even stronger Washington censor in the form of the U.S. Justice
Department, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<TE>   Cassini, the brother of fashion designer Oleg Cassini, died Saturday
of natural causes in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Charming and gregarious, "Ghighi," as his friends called him, coined
the term "jet set" and became a part of it. He took credit for launching
discotheques and promoting the 1960s dance craze the twist.</TE>
<TE>   His chatty writing style made his column bubble with gossip, sometimes
a bit barbed. And he appointed himself official arbiter of what
constituted ever-changing society.</TE>
<TE>   Cassini did not originate the Cholly Knickerbocker column, which
during his tenure was carried by more than 100 newspapers nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The name was coined from an early nickname for New Yorkers alluding to
the city's Dutch settlers. The name belonged to Hearst, and the column
was originally written by Maury Paul for Hearst's now-defunct New York
Herald-American.</TE>
<TE>   But Cassini's columns for the Washington Times-Herald-including the
one that got him tarred and feathered-did not escape notice in New York.
So when Paul died in 1942, Cassini was invited to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Sam had other ideas. Cassini was drafted and served in Army
intelligence in Europe from 1943 to 1945, also writing for Stars &amp;
Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   His first Cholly Knickerbocker column appeared Sept. 4, 1945, less
than a week after his discharge. Cassini immediately signaled a sea
change.</TE>
<TE>   Paul had written about what he called "cafe society" and strictly
adhered to the official "Four Hundred," or those listed in the Social
Register.</TE>
<TE>   "I declared in my first column that times had changed, the world had
changed," Cassini once said in an interview. "The 'Four Hundred' had been
replaced by the 'Forty Thousand,' and their sacred bible-the Social
Register-had no meaning in a country where only a meritocracy, a society
of achievement, could exist.'</TE>
<TE>   Society may have been shocked, but readers generally loved the change,
and the column helped boost circulation for the Journal-American and
gained wider syndication. Cassini promoted himself into a television
series, the "Igor Cassini Show," for NBC and later the Dumont network
from 1951 to 1956.</TE>
<TE>   The columnist survived the tar-and-feather treatment-although it took
doctors three hours to remove the goo, allegedly applied because he wrote
about one assailant's sister getting engaged before she did and said
another one's father had been snubbed for a royal party.</TE>
<TE>   But his next debacle more than two decades later was more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Cassini, who moved easily through the salons of power, had become
close to the Kennedy family. He attended the wedding of future President
John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier. His brother designed many of the
fashionable first lady's clothes, and his father-in-law lived next door
to the Palm Beach estate of first father Joseph Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   As a sideline-which earned Cassini nearly $1 million a year in the
early 1960s-he operated a public relations business in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Cassini told the president's father that there was a
left-wing revolution brewing in the Dominican Republic. Word was passed
to the president, and former Undersecretary of State Robert D. Murphy was
dispatched to talk with dictator Rafael Trujillo in the troubled country.
Six weeks later, Trujillo was assassinated in a coup.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that Cassini and his public relations firm were
accepting fees to represent Trujillo's government but had not registered
as an agent of a foreign country, a requirement of the Foreign Agents
Registration Act.</TE>
<TE>   Cassini was indicted for violating the act, fined $10,000 and placed
on six months probation.</TE>
<TE>   He lost the Knickerbocker column, and his public relations company
failed.</TE>
<TE>   His wife committed suicide. As one political columnist summarized
years later, "Igor Cassini was ruined.'</TE>
<TE>   Well, sort of.</TE>
<TE>   Cassini, the grandson of a former Russian ambassador to the United
States, was born in Sebastopol, Russia, spoke five languages and studied
at the Universities of Florence, Perugia (Italy) and Georgia. He never
counted himself out.</TE>
<TE>   He immediately founded a new magazine from which to dispense his
social wisdom and modestly called it Status.</TE>
<TE>   "The world is full of people who love to be told what to do," he said
at the time. He planned to decree what was "in" and what was "out.'</TE>
<TE>   Debutantes, he offered as an example, were definitely out. "It's a
mass, public display of girls, like cattle, on the marriage market.'</TE>
<TE>   When the magazine failed, Cassini moved to Europe, living in Italy and
Spain and writing for Italian editions of Esquire and Harper's Bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote his autobiography, "I'd Do It All Over Again," published
in 1977, and a novel, "Pay the Price," in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a 1983 book party in New York if the indictment that cost him
his column embittered him, Cassini said : "I was making a lot of money. I
had a lot of power. I was on the crest of a wave, and I slipped.'</TE>
<TE>   Married multiple times, Cassini is survived by his four children,
Marina, Alexander, Nicholas and Dimitri; his brother, Oleg; and several
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Juan Garcia Esquivel, 83; Bandleader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Garcia Esquivel, who became a pop-music cult icon when his
eccentric music from the 1950s and '60s was rediscovered in the '90s,
died Jan. 3 at his home in Jiutepec, Mexico, after a stroke. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   The pianist-composer-bandleader, who used just his last name (followed
by an exclamation point) professionally, was known for bold,
idiosyncratic orchestrations marked by radical dynamics, odd, wordless
vocals and unexpected sounds such as steel guitar and whistling.</LD>
<LD>   His meticulously recorded albums, bearing such titles as "Exploring
New Sounds in Hi-Fi" and "Infinity in Sound," were nominated for several
Grammys and were used to promote the wonders of the era's hot new
technology, stereophonic sound.</LD>
<TE>   "What I tried to do was not follow the style that was popular at that
time," Esquivel told The Times in 1995. "We had no synthesizers at that
time, so I tried to get different sounds out of conventional and
nonconventional instruments. I explored a little.'</TE>
<TE>   That music struck a nerve among young fans in the 1990s when the
Bar/None label launched a series of reissues of his vintage work,
catching a wave of nostalgic interest in the sounds and symbols of '50s
and '60s "cocktail culture." The title of the first reissue captured the
zeitgeist: "Space Age Bachelor Pad Music.'</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel wasn't expecting a revival, but he was pleased when it
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised, because those recordings were made 35 to 36 years
ago," he said. "Perhaps the fact is that my music was too much for the
time. The audience wasn't ready for that type of music. Now they are used
to the sounds and the technology. I'm glad the young artists are trying
to follow my style of writing. I love that."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, his music has been used in such Hollywood films as
"The Big Lebowski," 'Four Rooms" and "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America."
The Kronos Quartet has recorded a string arrangement of his 1967
composition "Mini Skirt" for its upcoming album, "Nuevo," and according
to the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Steely Dan cited Esquivel as the
inspiration for the use of marimba and vibes on the group's album
"Pretzel Logic." Actor John Leguizamo is developing plans to star in a
movie based on Esquivel's life.</TE>
<TE>   The musician was born Jan. 20, 1918, in Tampico, a city in the Mexican
state of Tamaulipas. He became a popular pianist and bandleader in his
homeland, starring in and scoring two films, "Cabaret Tragico" and "La
Locura de Rock 'n' Roll.'</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, RCA Victor Records brought him to the U.S., where he turned
out 10 albums in six years. His most widely heard piece of music is
probably the two-second fanfare that for decades has accompanied the
Universal Studios logo at the end of the company's television shows.</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel also led a troupe of performers on tour and hobnobbed with
Frank Sinatra, Liberace and other celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol and prescription drug abuse eventually curtailed his work, and

<HD>Pakistanis See Their Nation Transformed</HD>
<DH>Politics: Prospect of Musharraf clinging to power doesn't seem to
disturb his people, who have been on a ride with surprising twists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>This was to have been the year that democracy returned to Pakistan.
But Gen. Pervez Musharraf has changed his mind. In recent months, he has
said that no matter how the October parliamentary election turns out, he
intends to stay on as president.</LD>
<LD>   This doesn't entirely displease Pakistanis, who have been taken on a
breathtaking ride by Musharraf. In four months, they have seen Pakistan
transformed from a country that gave refuge to international terrorists
and comfort to home-grown Islamic militants to one that cracks down on
extremists and has become a key Washington ally in the war against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "Musharraf has taken initiatives that would have seemed impossible a
few months ago," said Hameed Haroon, the publisher of Dawn, one of
Pakistan's most influential daily newspapers. "I can't fault his
instincts. The initiatives against terrorists were the right ones to
make. They were essential for the survival of the world, and they have
rescued Pakistan from the brink."</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf, a 58-year-old former commando who came to power in a 1999
coup, speaks these days of wanting to make Pakistan "a dignified and
responsible nation." In response, U.S. senators, European prime ministers
and Asian heads of state laud him for ending the "Talibanization" of
Pakistan and deciding to crack down on extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Given the country's history since it was patched together as a nation
more than 54 years ago as the British empire faded, his actions put
nothing less than his life at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's first prime minister was assassinated. One ousted prime
minister was sent to the gallows. One military ruler died when his plane
mysteriously blew up. Another was forced to hand over power at gunpoint.
For half of its life, Pakistan has been governed by dictators.</TE>
<TE>   The rigid rule has brought neither peace nor prosperity. Pakistan has
fought three wars with India, and now a fourth threatens in the bitterly
disputed region of Kashmir, where hundreds of thousands of Indian and
Pakistani soldiers are facing off against one another.</TE>
<TE>   And Pakistan is saddled with a $38-billion external debt and a
population in which one in three adults is jobless and two in five can't
read.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf will announce additional moves against extremists in a
speech to the nation this week. His challenge will be to convince New
Delhi that he is conciliatory enough to help end attacks on India from
the Pakistan-controlled sector of Kashmir; to convince his people that he
is firm enough not to back down in the face of Indian demands; and to
convince the international community that he is committed to preventing
Kashmir from becoming another terrorist-infested Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It is a tall and conflicting order.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of every challenge Musharraf faces are two obstacles: one,
that Islam has become a divisive, rather than unifying, force in
Pakistan; and two, that Pakistan is a mix of ethnic groups, languages and
competing forces that do not coalesce into a clearly defined national
identity. Culturally, Pakistan's heart is in the South Asian
subcontinent; spiritually, it's in the Middle East where the pillars of
Islam are implanted.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere are the challenges Pakistan faces on more prominent display
than in Karachi, the country's teeming, unruly harbor city and commercial
center.</TE>
<TE>   Its population has grown during half a century from 200,000 to 14
million, yet its infrastructure appears to have changed hardly at all.
Except for an occasional garden, everything has been paved over, coated
with dust and become the color of the earth.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 250,000 of the city's students attend religious schools, known
as madrasas, that breed fundamentalism and have produced moujahedeen
(holy warriors) for Afghanistan and Kashmir. The education system has
fallen into such disrepair that a college English professor apologizes to
an American visitor for having only the vaguest grasp of the language.
Almost half the population is younger than 15.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the country's 300,000 heroin addicts live here, and drug lords
run the periphery of the city. In the mid-1990s, 200 people a month were
being killed on the streets, many in drive-by shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's top announced domestic priorities are the restoration of
law and order and economic development. On the latter, he has had some
help from the international community because of his 180-degree policy
shift in turning against the Taliban and cracking down on terrorists and
religious zealots at home.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a lifting of sanctions by the United States, the Asian
Development Bank has resumed making loans to Pakistan, the Paris Club has
rescheduled $12 billion of Pakistan's debt, and the International
Monetary Fund has launched a $1.2-billion poverty-reduction program.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently willing to put concerns about Pakistan's lack of democracy
and its nuclear armaments on the back burner while Musharraf supports the
war on terrorism, Washington is also offering $600 million for social
welfare projects and $73 million to help with law enforcement along the
border.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf says he is still committed to a return to democracy. But as
a retired general, Sayed Refaqat, said: "The irony is that if he really
wants democracy in Pakistan, what's he doing in the presidency in the
first place?"</TE>

<HD>Powell to Stop in India, Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary of State will attempt to help ease tensions
between the nuclear-armed nations. He urges cooperation from both
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that he will
visit India and Pakistan next week, and he asked India's home affairs
minister to help work out a solution to a 4-week-old crisis between the
two nuclear-capable neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Powell, who visited the two countries in October and has made
countless telephone calls to their leaders in recent weeks, will visit
India and Pakistan en route to Japan, where he will attend a meeting to
discuss the reconstruction of Afghanistan, aides said.</LD>
<LD>   Relations between India and Pakistan have deteriorated since a Dec. 13
attack on the Parliament in New Delhi that killed 14 people, including
the attackers. India has blamed the assault on Islamic extremists opposed
to Indian rule in Kashmir, a Himalayan region claimed by both nations.
The tensions have led to a buildup of forces along the nations' border, a
downgrading of diplomatic relations and the end of transportation service
between the countries.</LD>
<TE>   Powell signaled his understanding of the Indian position by calling on
Pakistan to take "appropriate action" against 20 suspects alleged to have
been involved in terrorist actions against India. The Indian government
has called for the extradition of the men.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing President Bush, Powell praised Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf for taking action against Islamic militants in his country.
But, Powell said, "there is room for additional work on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Aides said Powell also has urged Indian Home Affairs Minister Lal
Krishna Advani to be understanding of the difficulties Musharraf faces in
moving against terrorists in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Advani, who has taken a hard line on the Pakistan issue, is a key
figure in the government of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Powell, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and CIA Director
George J. Tenet in Washington on Wednesday, Advani repeated Indian
arguments that Pakistan has not done enough to halt terrorist attacks.
Infiltrators continue to pour into India from Pakistan to carry out
sabotage and terrorism, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan could shut off the flow of infiltrators at any time," he
said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Advani said, India has shown "immense restraint" in
dealing with its neighbor. "India has not taken a single step that could
be regarded as a provocation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He called on Pakistan to close all terrorist facilities on its soil,
halt infiltration of terrorists and their arms, and renounce terrorism
"in all its manifestations."</TE>
<TE>   Advani called the United States and India "the twin towers of
democracy" and said both nations have become victims of terrorism. He
reaffirmed India's policy of not being the first to use nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his telephone diplomacy, Powell called Musharraf on Tuesday
and Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh on Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Postpones Currency Devaluing</HD>
<DH>S. America: New president comes under fire as he delays action on
the peso for a second time. The nation nervously awaits the official
exchange rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Reinforcing the impression that his government is still struggling
to find ways out of Argentina's financial mess, new President Eduardo
Duhalde postponed for a second day Wednesday the reopening of
currency-exchange businesses and the debut of the devalued peso.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde, who took office Jan. 2 as the country's fifth president in
two weeks, also was hit with criticism from a prominent member of his own
Peronist party as former President Carlos Menem called the new chief
executive "inept" and described the devaluation and other measures as
"the worst."</LD>
<LD>   After Congress granted Duhalde sweeping emergency powers, his
government announced a 28% devaluation Sunday and said it was abandoning
the peso's 10-year parity with the dollar. He confirmed that Argentina is
defaulting on $135 billion in public debt and continued restrictions on
bank savings withdrawals, which since Dec. 3 have been limited to 1,000
pesos a month.</LD>
<TE>   Although this capital city was quiet Wednesday, the nation waited
nervously for the new official exchange rate to take effect at exchange
houses and banks, which have been forbidden to exchange money since Dec.
21. Wednesday's inaugural date for the devalued currency was pushed to
today, and now to Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions boiled over in the provincial capital of Cordoba, where
government employees who haven't been paid in weeks clashed with police.</TE>
<TE>   A government official who asked not to be identified said Argentina
hopes to open discussions with the International Monetary Fund on a
possible debt renegotiation and aid package in 15 days, after details of
the government's new monetary policy and its 2002 fiscal budget were
determined.</TE>
<TE>   The official said Argentina has no intention of repudiating its debt.
"The president didn't say, 'I am not going to pay.' He said that we
cannot pay," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov told reporters Wednesday night
that although the government wants to eliminate withdrawal restrictions,
it cannot because there isn't enough cash in the banking system to pay
depositors. Withdrawals by nervous Argentines last year totaled $20
billion, equal to one-quarter of all accounts and half the federal
budget.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, Menem accused
Duhalde and Carlos Ruckauf, his new foreign minister, with promoting the
public demonstrations that helped force President Fernando de la Rua from
office Dec. 20. Ruckauf was Buenos Aires provincial governor at the time.</TE>
<TE>   After Lenicov announced to reporters the postponement of the new
currency measures for another day, he did not take questions, respond to
Menem's charges or address published reports that dollar savings accounts
would be frozen and inaccessible to savers until next year.</TE>
<TE>   He reiterated Duhalde's promise that Argentina will not "confiscate"
or automatically convert dollar accounts into devalued pesos.</TE>
<TE>   The government also agreed to raise the monthly limit of withdrawals
on salary accounts to as much as 1,500 pesos, which covers 96% of all
salary accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The savings account measures have been highly unpopular, causing
demonstrations and some violence. But Lenicov said the only other option
is to force borrowers to pay off loans early, which in turn would cause
bankruptcies and job losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to disarm the restrictions, but under these circumstances we
want to do it with the highest prudence," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hamas Takes Responsibility for Attack</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Militant Islamic group says shooting that killed four
Israelis at an outpost was in retaliation for seizure of arms-laden ship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The militant Islamic movement Hamas claimed responsibility
Wednesday for an attack on an Israeli army outpost that threatened to
derail U.S. efforts to secure a cease-fire between Israelis and
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called the assault
on the outpost, which lies inside Israel near the southern Gaza Strip,
"particularly disturbing because it came at a time when the situation on
the ground had been relatively quiet."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials also said that Israel had presented strong evidence
Wednesday of involvement by senior Palestinian Authority officials in a
shipment of weapons and explosives seized by Israel on the Red Sea last
week.</LD>
<TE>   Four Israelis and two Palestinian gunmen were killed in the attack on
the outpost Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas said the assault was in retaliation for Israel's capture last
week of the Karine-A, a ship laden with 50 tons of arms that the Israelis
said were purchased by the Palestinian Authority and bound for Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack on the outpost. It said
in a statement that the assault would only lead to an escalation of
measures against the Palestinians by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   But angry Israeli officials blamed Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat and promised a harsh reaction. Meeting with his Security
Cabinet, Sharon said it is Israel's policy to respond to every such
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The escalation came after more than three weeks of relative calm that
followed Arafat's televised demand that all Palestinian organizations
observe a cease-fire in the 15-month fight with Israel. At the time,
Hamas said it would honor Arafat's demand.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Hamas official insisted Wednesday that the organization had
only agreed to suspend suicide bombings inside Israel and attacks against
Israeli civilians. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said
Hamas will continue to strike at Israeli soldiers if the Palestinian
Authority presses on with arresting militants.</TE>
<TE>   "We will react against the Israelis if the authority takes measures
according to Israeli pressures," the official said. "We see the Israeli
pressure on the authority [to arrest Hamas members] as a kind of
aggression against us."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security organizations evacuated buildings in Gaza that
they considered likely targets of Israeli retaliation. After dark
Wednesday, Israeli tanks and bulldozers flattened two Palestinian
security posts near the spot where the attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell discussed the raid on the outpost
in a phone call with Arafat, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said. The spokesman said the raid was "another in a series of direct
challenges to the authority of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority." Arafat, he said, must dismantle "terrorist groups."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also took issue with the Palestinian leader's insistence that
he knew nothing about the Karine-A or its load of Katyusha rockets,
plastic explosives and other weapons that Israeli commandos intercepted
at sea last Thursday, Boucher said. He said the secretary of State told
Arafat "that the indications of Palestinian involvement were deeply
troubling to us, and that that's what we felt required a full
explanation."</TE>
<TE>   A team of senior Israeli intelligence officers on Wednesday shared
evidence about the arms shipment with officials of the State Department,
CIA, Pentagon and National Security Council in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said Israel had provided "extensive and
compelling evidence" about the direct involvement of senior figures in
the Palestinian Authority and the mainstream Palestinian movement Fatah.</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. officials said Israel had laid out evidence implicating
Arafat as well as top officials in the Iranian government, disputing
suggestions that it might have been a rogue operation.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Israeli security source involved in the briefings said the
radical Lebanese group Hezbollah played an important intermediary role in
organizing the shipment. The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, singled out Hezbollah security chief Imad Mughniyah for his
role.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis are hoping to persuade the Bush administration that the
capture of the Karine-A and Wednesday's attack prove that the
Palestinians are uninterested in a cease-fire and a return to
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni said Monday before leaving the region that
the two sides had made progress toward restoring security cooperation and
eliminating violence. He is due to return Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said the assault on
the outpost proved "beyond any doubt that the Palestinian Authority is
not fighting against the infrastructure of terrorism." Mofaz said he
believes "that all those who assumed that we are in the midst of some
sort of a calm period understand today that the Palestinian Authority's
actions are a mere show."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon on Tuesday said that the Palestinian Authority has formed a
dangerous strategic link to Hezbollah and to Iran. He called on the Bush
administration to add Fatah, its Tanzim militia and Arafat's Force 17
presidential guard to the U.S. list of terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing, Maj. Gen. Doron Almog, commander of the Israeli army's
southern division, said two Palestinian gunmen cut the outpost's security
fence about 4 a.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The heavily armed pair sneaked up on what the army calls the "Africa"
outpost, which lies near the southeastern corner of Gaza close to the
Israeli farming community of Kerem Shalom. Three soldiers of a mostly
Bedouin unit were on duty at the rain-soaked position.</TE>
<TE>   Bedouin, who are Arabs, are not required to serve in the Israeli army.
However, they are allowed to volunteer, and about 2,000 Bedouin serve,
according to an army spokesman. The unit attacked Wednesday is a
reconnaissance unit whose soldiers have been serving on the
Israeli-Egyptian border--one of the most active fronts in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Almog said the gunmen, who wore the uniforms of one of the Palestinian
security services, lobbed grenades at the outpost, then opened fire on
it. Two soldiers and one of the gunmen were killed in the battle. One
soldier and the other gunman were wounded. A four-man Israeli patrol
arrived on the scene, and the injured gunman opened fire on it, killing a
commander and a driver before he was shot dead.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby Jewish communities were put on high alert as the army combed
the area, looking for six accomplices that Almog said remained on the
Gaza side of the border during the gun battle.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the attack, senior Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal claimed
responsibility for what he called the "bold operations." In a joint news
conference in Beirut with Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
Meshaal said the two gunmen were Hamas members from the southern Gazan
town of Rafah.</TE>

<HD>Israel Halts Construction of Mosque</HD>

<DL>NAZARETH, Israel
</DL>
<LD>Christians celebrated Israel's decision Wednesday to halt
construction of a large mosque that would sit next to the main Christian
shrine in Nazareth, considered the town of Jesus' boyhood, but Muslims
were irate.</LD>
<LD>   The building project had angered Christians worldwide--including in
the Vatican--who said it was disrespectful to build a mosque just outside
the Basilica of the Annunciation, the largest church in the Middle East.
Tradition says the angel Gabriel foretold the birth of Jesus at the site.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to halt construction drew a furious response from local
Muslim leader Salman abu Ahmed, who called it a "declaration of war" on
Israel's large Muslim minority.</LD>
<TE>   "It is an irresponsible decision," he said. "If [the government]
insists on its position, we will not hesitate to continue building."</TE>
<TE>   Police in Nazareth, a town of 70,000 in northern Israel, braced for
protests by Muslims. The mosque has become a symbol of the growing
political aspirations of Israel's more than 1 million Muslim citizens,
who make up about one-sixth of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's handling of the Muslim-Christian dispute has drawn fire from
Christian leaders, who protested the mosque construction and made
repeated appeals to the Israeli government to step in.</TE>
<TE>   During Easter 1999, the issue sparked street clashes between
Nazareth's Muslim and Christian residents.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has raised the subject with Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, who pledged to try to resolve the dispute. Pope John Paul
II threatened to cancel a millennium visit to the Holy Land over the
issue, and the Vatican said in November that construction of the mosque
would "put this holy place in a permanent state of siege."</TE>

<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic appeared before war
crimes judges Wednesday, a month before he goes on trial for alleged
atrocities in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   The ousted leader has been charged with five counts of war crimes for
the 1998-99 Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. Prosecutors will open their case
Feb. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic has said he will represent himself in court.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for prosecutors at the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia will be to link the widespread
persecution and killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to Milosevic and
his policies. They will call dozens of witnesses, including former
Serbian officials awaiting trial in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   It was Milosevic's fifth appearance at the United Nations tribunal
since he was transferred to the Netherlands in June. He has refused to
cooperate with the court or to appoint a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The court has entered innocent pleas on his behalf to all counts.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kosovo case, Milosevic is charged in the deaths of nearly 900
Kosovo Albanians, the deportation of 800,000 people and sexual assault by
Yugoslav army troops under his command.</TE>
<TE>   He also faces charges of genocide for alleged crimes in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia between 1992 and 1995, including the
massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica. Those charges
will be heard at a second trial.</TE>

<LD>An ex-diplomat convicted of spying for South Korea lost his appeal
in Russia's Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Valentin Moiseyev, a former deputy chief of the Foreign Ministry's
Asia desk, was convicted in August and sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison
for passing secrets to Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   Moiseyev's trial is one of several recent cases of Russian citizens
accused of espionage because they have had contacts with foreigners.
Human rights groups have criticized the cases. Moiseyev said he will
appeal to the Supreme Court presidium, a higher body within the court.</LD>

12 years of political deadlock.</LD>
<LD>   The releases bring to 207 the number of political prisoners freed

<HD>U.S. Is Urged Not to Attack Somalia</HD>
<DH>Africa: Nation may be target in terror war. U.N. official says
strike would disrupt a fragile security and worsen the poverty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>As speculation mounts that Somalia might be the next target in a
widening U.S. war on terrorism, United Nations officials here warned
Wednesday that any intervention in the war-ravaged country would
aggravate the poverty and hunger of hundreds of thousands of Somalis.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm concerned about the impact on a society which had begun to
develop a level of security it hadn't seen for the last six or seven
years," said Randolph Kent, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for
Somalia. "Any disruptive factor--be it from within or, dare I say, from
without--can undermine a fragile situation."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials have acknowledged that American forces are patrolling
the airspace and seaports around Somalia to prevent Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda fighters who might have escaped Afghanistan from relocating there.</LD>
<TE>   The concerns come as several hundred troops from neighboring Ethiopia
have crossed into Somalia to train the militias of warlords loyal to
Ethiopia, according to Somalia watchers. The Ethiopian-backed warlord
armies are believed to be spoiling for a fight with the military of
Somalia's fledgling Transitional National Government in the capital,
Mogadishu.</TE>
<TE>   Ethiopia is opposed to the transitional government, which it describes
as too Islamist and hostile to Ethiopian interests. Some Somalia experts
say Ethiopia, a historical enemy of Somalia, would prefer to have a weak
neighbor that poses less of a threat to its security.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the observers willing to discuss the situation in Somalia
requested anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Ethiopia has armed and supported rival factions opposed to the
transitional government, which was established at a conference in
neighboring Djibouti in 2000 and controls only pockets of Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   Some Ethiopian-backed warlords, who control other portions of Somalia,
were recently prevented by Ethiopia from attending peace talks with the
transitional government here in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats in Nairobi say Ethiopia recently expressed a desire
to broaden its role in Somalia. During the last few weeks, Ethiopian
officials have declared that a Somalian group known as Al-Itihaad
al-Islamiya, which has ties to the Al Qaeda terrorism network, is rampant
in Somalia and even has representatives in the transitional government.
The Bush administration put Al-Itihaad on its terrorist list after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Western journalists, U.N. officials and Somalia watchers who have
traveled to Mogadishu in the last few weeks have not been able to find
much evidence that Al-Itihaad is a vibrant group in Somalian society.
U.N. officials and others say Al-Itihaad has long disbanded and no longer
poses a real threat in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But that does not quell daily reports that the U.S. and its allies are
preparing to launch strikes in Somalia, which they fear could be a haven
for terrorist groups. Other reports suggest that American forces might
use Ethiopia and its surrogate warlord armies as proxies to attack
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Somalia descended into anarchy after the ouster of dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre in 1991 and has been struggling to stabilize.</TE>
<TE>   Kent, the U.N. humanitarian worker, said he did not know what
intelligence the U.S. and its allies had gathered on Somalia. He said the
United Nations feels that Somalia is safe enough for the operation of
medical, social and humanitarian projects to help tens of thousands of
sick and hungry people.</TE>
<TE>   "There are U.N. officials crawling all over Somalia trying to provide
assistance," Kent said. "We are working in Somalia because we can work in
Somalia. We feel safe, and we are there increasingly."</TE>
<TE>   Many Somalis, Kent said, are still reeling from President Bush's
decision in November to freeze the assets of Al Barakaat, the country's
largest remittance firm. U.S. authorities say Al Barakaat helped fund Bin
Laden's terrorism network, a charge the company denies. Kent said
thousands of Somalis can no longer receive small remittances to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Kent also said hundreds of thousands of people in Somalia's Gedo
region are suffering from hunger after last year's poor harvest. Any
intervention, he said, could result in more tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Any factor that destabilizes a fragile situation is always a danger,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Calls On Afghans to Unite</HD>
<DH>Policy: Interim leader addresses public to outline plans. He
pledges a just government that will empower the people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In his first public address, interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai
urged the Afghan people Wednesday to unite and work for peace in this
still-troubled country.</LD>
<LD>   "Dear compatriots, Afghanistan is in dire need of peace," Karzai said
near the beginning of his 10-minute speech, which, because it was
broadcast on limited-range Kabul Television, wasn't seen by much of the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Since being installed Dec. 22, Karzai has spent much of his time
behind closed doors in a round robin of private meetings with elders from
various provinces as well as international emissaries and government
ministers.</LD>
<TE>   His first public speech staked out a clear position in opposition to
the former Taliban regime and underscored his sensitivity to the need to
improve, as quickly as possible, the country's deprived economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The existence of armed people is a hindrance to the peace and
security," he said, referring to the remaining Taliban members and
fighters with the Al Qaeda terrorism network who are adrift in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan should have a national army that can protect the country's
borders from incursions, Karzai said. Many of the Taliban's members came
from outside the country, he pointed out, and the fundamentalist regime
wouldn't have been able to win political power if the country hadn't been
split into disparate territories controlled by local commanders.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's speech outlined his policy priorities and emphasized the hard
road ahead for the country. In a style that was reminiscent of President
John F. Kennedy's famous exhortation to "ask not what your country can do
for you; ask what you can do for your country," Karzai urged every Afghan
to join in the effort to remake the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But he also pledged his commitment to bring a just government to
Afghanistan. He announced that the Afghan Constitution that was written
during the reign of the exiled king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, which ensures
"social and political freedom for all Afghans," will again be in effect.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he wants a government that empowers the people--a sharp
contrast to the many years in which ordinary Afghans felt subjected to
the whims, successively, of the country's Soviet rulers, feuding warlords
and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   And he assured Afghans that he is committed to the process of a loya
jirga, the tribal council that Afghans traditionally use to choose their
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   His top four policy priorities are:</TE>
<TE>   * Protection of the country from illegal bills that devalue
Afghanistan's currency.</TE>
<TE>   * Enhancement of productivity in small factories and other business
and manufacturing concerns.</TE>
<TE>   * Job creation.</TE>
<TE>   * Privatization and a reduction in government interference in
business.</TE>
<TE>   "I want your cooperation and the cooperation and participation of
every Afghan, individually and collectively, to help in this project," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Terror Trial Judge Wary of TV, Won't Rule It Out</HD>

<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Wednesday that she was concerned that
television could have a chilling effect on witnesses at the Zacarias
Moussaoui terrorism trial, but she did not decide immediately whether to
permit cameras.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Moussaoui and the television networks asked U.S. District
Judge Leonie Brinkema to overturn a ban on cameras in federal courtrooms,
drawing sharp opposition from prosecutors in a case that will focus on
the Al Qaeda organization.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department contended a worldwide broadcast "might assist
Al Qaeda in retaliating against the witnesses who testify against it."</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a French citizen, sat in his green prison jumpsuit,
sometimes cocking his head to one side as he listened to the lawyers. He
stands accused of six conspiracy counts of being an accomplice to the
Sept. 11 attacks and could receive the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema pointed to two small cameras to indicate that television
would not physically disrupt the courtroom--but also said she was
concerned about the potential effect on participants. The cameras on
Wednesday provided closed-circuit coverage to an overflow room for those
who couldn't find seats.</TE>
<TE>   Televised images of the trial, set to begin Sept. 30, "are forever out
there," she said. "It does pose a security risk. If witnesses felt that
photographs would be out there, that could be a chilling problem."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said she would rule Tuesday at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's lawyer, Edward MacMahon Jr., spoke briefly and supported a
televised trial with some restrictions.</TE>

<HD>Private Airports Get Security Steps</HD>
<DH>Aviation: With Florida crash in mind, the FAA urges 11 measures to
lessen risks of unsupervised access to planes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration urged the private aviation
industry Wednesday to adopt stricter security measures after a student
pilot's suicidal flight into a Tampa, Fla., high-rise last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   In a notice distributed around the country, the agency outlined a
series of voluntary steps to limit unsupervised access to aircraft by
novice pilots.</LD>
<LD>   The Tampa crash "has raised concerns among the public and federal law
enforcement organizations about the security of general aviation [private
planes] and how that can be improved," the FAA noted.</LD>
<TE>   The 11 recommendations made by the agency included using different
keys for aircraft ignition and door locks, limiting access to aircraft
keys by student pilots until they are ready for solo flight and requiring
students to pass a medical examination--including psychiatric
screening--before beginning flying lessons.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also recommended closer scrutiny of teenage student-pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Charles J. Bishop, the 15-year-old in the Tampa crash, was performing
a preflight check without an instructor present and had the keys to a
single-engine Cessna. He took off without authorization, flew over the
military base housing the U.S. Central Command, which directs the troops
in Afghanistan, and crashed into a downtown office building. Police found
a note in his pocket expressing sympathy with Osama bin Laden. Police
disclosed Tuesday that Bishop had a prescription for Accutane, an acne
drug that has been linked to suicides.</TE>
<TE>   Though the FAA recommendations are voluntary, the Airline Owners and
Pilots Assn., which represents private pilots, said it believes most
flight schools and general aviation support facilities will adopt at
least some of them. The association is concerned that security worries
will prompt a crackdown that could restrict the freedoms private pilots
have enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   "We think these are practical suggestions that can be implemented
immediately," said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the group. "When
you stand back and look at them, what they are really saying is you make
sure a student can't fly until the flight instructor is ready for them to
fly."</TE>
<TE>   Previously, many flight instructors had seen nothing wrong with giving
a student the keys to an aircraft. It was considered part of the normal
process of building confidence and trust as the student worked up to a
solo flight.</TE>
<TE>   The aviation security bill passed by Congress and signed by President
Bush in November requires flight schools to provide the Justice
Department with information on foreign students. Additional security
measures are being considered for private aviation, including
tamper-proof pilots' licenses and security training for operators of
small airports.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 200,000 private aircraft in the United States,
with 18,000 small airports and more than 500,000 pilots. With the
national publicity surrounding last weekend's crash, many of those pilots
fear their cherished pastime will be curtailed.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do, put 24-hour security at every gravel-and-grass strip
in the country?" asked a commercial airline pilot who did not want to be
identified. "What would security be checking for? It would not have
stopped this event, because the student pilot was supposed to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Added the Boeing 737 pilot: "I was once a student in a Cessna too."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Blocks Funds of 2 Charities Allegedly Tied to Terror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. crackdown on charities suspected of having links to Osama
bin Laden widened Wednesday as Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill blocked
financial assets of two groups and accused them of "stealing from widows
and orphans to fund Al Qaeda terrorism."</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill identified the groups as the Afghan Support Committee and the
Revival of Islamic Heritage Society. At a news conference at Treasury
headquarters, he said the organizations were raising money under false
pretenses.</LD>
<LD>   "They were leading people to believe that they were giving money for
good and worthy charitable purposes that compassionate people around the
world would be inclined to give money to," O'Neill said. "In fact, they
were taking these monies and feeding them into terrorist activities."</LD>
<TE>   Neither organization is believed to have financial assets in the
United States, Treasury officials said, but the move allows U.S.
officials to freeze any assets that are found. It is unlikely that
Americans have given a significant amount of money to the two
organizations, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan Support Committee, O'Neill and other government officials
said, was set up by Bin Laden and has offices in Peshawar, Pakistan, and
Jalalabad, Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The group's finance chief, Abu Bakr Jaziri, also served as the head of
organized fund-raising for Bin Laden, according to Treasury Department
documents released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jaziri collected money for Al Qaeda in Jalalabad through his role as
local head of the Afghan charity group. Separately, he raised money from
other private Afghan organizations by claiming the funds were for orphans
and widows created by political strife in the region, the Treasury
documents said. Jaziri later moved from Afghanistan to Pakistan, "where
he continued to raise and transfer funds for Al Qaeda," one Treasury
Department document said.</TE>
<TE>   The other group, the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society, is based in
Kuwait and is affiliated with the Afghan Support Committee, Treasury
officials said. The U.S. order applies only to the society's Pakistan
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Neither group could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials identified Abd Mushin Libi as the man who runs the
Peshawar offices of both organizations and said he provided Bin Laden and
other terrorists with facilities in that city near the Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   Libi also has carried money and messages on behalf of Bin Laden, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials also said the Pakistan office of the Revival of
Islamic Heritage Society padded the number of orphans it claimed to care
for by using names of orphans who had died or did not exist. Funds sent
on their behalf were then funneled to Al Qaeda, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Brothers Agree to Plan for Everglades</HD>
<DH>Environment: Threatened ecosystem will get first rights to water
reclaimed in a huge Florida project. Congress set conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush and his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signed an
agreement Wednesday aimed at ensuring that the water-deprived Everglades
has first claim to water reclaimed through a massive $7.8-billion
restoration project.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is a key step in implementing a 2000 law that pledged
the federal government would pay for half of the 30-year South Florida
project to stop the loss of fresh water from the fragile Everglades
ecosystem, a victim of growing population demands and decades of flood
control efforts.</LD>
<LD>   After signing the pact in a White House ceremony, President Bush
hailed the Everglades as a "unique national treasure" and declared that
"restoration of this ecosystem is a priority for my administration."</LD>
<TE>   Congress required that the president and the Florida governor sign a
legally enforceable agreement guaranteeing adequate water for natural
resources such as the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National
Preserve before any federal funding would flow to the dozens of
construction projects included in the restoration plan.</TE>
<TE>   These projects are at least a year away from breaking ground, but
environmentalists and some Florida lawmakers sought to ensure that the
state would not promise the water to meet the needs of new housing
developments and agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the health of the Everglades took a back seat to
development and agriculture in the fast-growing state. As water was
diverted from the wetlands, 68 species in the region came to be
classified as threatened or endangered.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement "puts the Everglades first in line for new water," said
Shannon Estenoc, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Everglades
program.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress gave the Everglades project overwhelming
bipartisan support.</TE>
<TE>   The restoration project is designed to capture 1.7 billion gallons of
the fresh water flowing out of the Everglades into the ocean every day
and to store it in underground and surface reservoirs. Although Congress
wanted the natural resources to have first claim on this water, it
understood that state officials would be under pressure to provide the
water to its growing population.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the state "can't willy-nilly give away water to
new users until it has proven that the water hasn't come out of the
Everglades bank account for the future," Estenoc said.</TE>
<TE>   The water is intended to benefit four national parks, 16 national
wildlife reserves and a national marine sanctuary, as well as state
parks.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement was only one of the provisions Congress put into the
legislation to try to prevent the state from depriving the Everglades
ecosystem of the additional water reclaimed by the restoration project.
It also required the administration to draft regulations that, among
other things, would prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from launching a
project unless the water is reserved for the natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and some members of Congress criticized the draft
version of these regulations, which was released last month, as lacking
the teeth necessary to protect the Everglades. A final version is due
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress will be monitoring this process to ensure that, together,
the agreement and the programmatic regulations ensure the protection of
the natural system and the long-term restoration of America's
Everglades," said Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee.</TE>

<HD>Hockey Fight 'Self-Defense'</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Defendant says he wanted the victim, another father, 'to
stop hitting me.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>His voice alternately calm and choked with emotion, hockey dad
Thomas Junta on Wednesday testified that he was acting in self-defense
when he beat another sports father to death.</LD>
<LD>   "I just wanted him to stop hitting me," the 44-year-old truck driver
told jurors.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutor Sheila Calkins challenged Junta's argument that he was
acting in self-defense during the fistfight that took the life of
40-year-old Michael Costin.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a 156-pound man lying on his back holding your wrist, and you
want this jury to believe you couldn't get away from him?" Calkins asked.</TE>
<TE>   Junta, 275 pounds at the time of the incident, replied, "Yes, I do,
because that's the truth."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of manslaughter, Junta could face up to 20 years in
prison. The defense rested its case Wednesday, and final arguments will
be heard today.</TE>
<TE>   The lethal altercation followed a children's pickup hockey game in
which both men's sons participated. When the informal "stick practice"
turned rough, Junta charged onto the ice to challenge Costin, who was
skating with the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Junta and Costin, who had not met until that day, traded angry words.
Their animosity turned physical in a locker room, but that first scuffle
was soon broken up by a college-age hockey player.</TE>
<TE>   Junta left the skating arena in Reading, Mass., but said he returned
to encourage his son to change out of his skating equipment. Once again,
he and Costin were face to face, this time in an area alongside the rink.
They began to fight again.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Costin died. The left side of his head was so badly
injured that a medical examiner said it was nearly severed from his body.</TE>
<TE>   In a Cambridge courtroom Wednesday, Junta insisted Costin swung at him
first.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what that guy was doing. Why was he even jumping at
me?" Junta said. "It was crazy. I didn't know if he had something in his
hands."</TE>
<TE>   He also maintained he landed just three blows on the other man--and
that those swings were off balance.</TE>
<TE>   Several prosecution witnesses testified they saw Junta pummel Costin
repeatedly, pounding at his head until Costin lost consciousness. The
former Massachusetts medical examiner who performed Costin's autopsy
testified that such severe injuries could only have been the result of
brute force.</TE>
<TE>   A medical expert summoned Wednesday by the defense said one punch
could have ruptured Costin's vertebral artery--an organ the prosecution's
medical specialist said is well protected and difficult to damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's generally accepted with this type of injury a minimal amount of
force is necessary to cause this type of injury," Ira Kamfer, an
associate medical examiner from Connecticut, told the court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Junta's 12-year-old son, Quinlan, a witness to the fight, told the
court Tuesday that his father gave Costin just three quick blows.</TE>
<TE>   The beating also was witnessed by Costin's three sons, ages 12 to 14.
The Costin boys were not called to testify.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen other children--along with assorted parents,
grandparents and baby-sitters--also were at the rink when the fight took
place.</TE>

<HD>Deputy Fired for Lying About School Shooting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>The sheriff's deputy who gave conflicting accounts of the shooting
death of a student in the 1999 Columbine High School massacre was fired
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Jim Taylor told the parents of Daniel Rohrbough that he saw the
15-year-old fall to the ground while fleeing the school, apparently shot
dead. That contradicted another statement Taylor made to his superiors,
in which he said he didn't see the shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan said Wednesday that Taylor's
actions violated department policy against lying. Sullivan also said
transcripts of police radio transmissions prove Taylor was not in a
position to see any of the shootings in front of the school.</LD>
<TE>   "I am extremely disappointed that false information regarding the
tragedy of Columbine High School was provided to the families of the
victims of Columbine by a member of my staff," Sullivan said. "I
sincerely apologize for the unacceptable conduct of one former member of
my organization."</TE>
<TE>   The action comes as allegations in the Columbine case are heating up.
On Tuesday, the families of five of the shooting victims called on the
U.S. attorney's office to convene a federal grand jury to look into what
they say has been a police cover-up of the Columbine investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the same group demanded a coroner's inquest and again asked
the Jefferson County district attorney to convene a grand jury into the
shooting of Rohrbough.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's family has long claimed that Daniel was accidentally shot as
he fled the school. Only one of the three bullets that struck him has
been recovered, and ballistics reports have been inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who has been a friend of Rohrbough's stepfather for more than
20 years, met with family members in March 2000. Unaware that the
conversation was being taped by the family, Taylor told them he saw a boy
running on the day of the school attack. Suddenly, he said, the boy fell
to the ground, apparently shot. Taylor said he realized the boy was
Daniel when he saw newspaper photos the next day.</TE>
<TE>   If Taylor did see Rohrbough when he claimed, that would conflict with
the day's official timeline, which places Rohrbough's death much earlier.
Officials believe the shooters--Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold--killed
themselves within 30 minutes after initiating the attack with bombs and
automatic weapons fire. The only weapons discharged after that came from
law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy's other statement, made in writing about two weeks ago,
differs greatly from what he told Rohrbough's parents, Brian Rohrbough
and Sue Petrone. In the statement, he claimed to have seen little of the
day's events and said he told the family only what he had seen on
television and read in newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   The Arapahoe sheriff says Taylor was in a group of officers who were
on the periphery of the school that day and unable to see much of what
happened. Because they were so far from the scene, they were not required
to fill out an incident report at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all very sad, the whole thing," said Barry Arrington, attorney
for Rohrbough's parents. "I wish Deputy Taylor hadn't lied. I am
absolutely persuaded he told Brian Rohrbough and Sue Petrone the truth.
If someone could give me a motive why a man would pack up his wife and
kids and drive over to tell people heartbreaking news, I'd listen. There
are too many facts that Deputy Taylor knew and discussed for him to have
been so far away that he couldn't see anything, as the sheriff says."</TE>

<HD>Bush Enters Political Arena for His Brother, Florida GOP</HD>
<DH>Campaign: President attends fund-raisers for Jeb Bush's reelection
and other candidates. Some experts see risks in being overly partisan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush embarked on a delicate balancing act Wednesday as he
ended a self-imposed moratorium on overt campaigning to keynote a
$500-a-head fund-raiser for his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The president also attended a $10,000-per-couple fund-raiser for the
Florida Republican Party; the event's beneficiaries will include
Katherine Harris, the secretary of state who played a controversial role
in the disputed 2000 presidential election. Harris is now running for a
seat in the U.S. House.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's twin appearances signaled the start of an election year in
which control of the House and Senate is at stake.</LD>
<TE>   For Bush, the challenge will be to maintain his aura as a highly
popular commander in chief leading the war on terrorism while doing his
partisan best to help elect Republicans around the country--and bolster
his own chances for reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>Bush Aide Underscores Importance of Vote</TE>
<TE>   "The president always said that, in times of war and times of peace,
our elections are what sets us apart as a freedom-loving country," White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Wednesday. "This is an election
year. The president is going to support candidates in this election year
who support his agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warn that if Bush comes across as too crassly political, he
puts at risk his stratospheric job approval ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But in Ohio, New Hampshire and Massachusetts on Tuesday--and back in
Washington on Wednesday--Bush amply demonstrated that he is mindful of
the fine line he must walk.</TE>
<TE>   Before meeting with supporters in New Hampshire, he lavishly praised
the two liberal Democrats who helped him enact education reform: Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. George Miller of Martinez.
Bush repeated his plaudits in a speech to state and local educators hours
before attending the Wednesday night fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Wednesday night at the fund-raiser for Jeb Bush a few blocks
from the White House, the president lauded his brother's agenda and
leadership qualities. But his brief remarks were largely devoid of the
partisan rhetoric that traditionally marks such events.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in what may serve as his model for future political
appearances, he offered a progress report on the war in Afghanistan. He
touted the U.S. military's success in disrupting the Al Qaeda terrorist
network that was based in that country. And he characterized the
continuing efforts to hunt down terrorists as "the calling of our time."</TE>
<TE>   Bush decided to forgo politicking after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As a result, he refrained
from campaigning for the party's gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey
and Virginia, both of whom lost in elections last November.</TE>
<TE>   That Bush broke his moratorium by attending a fund-raiser for his own
brother is likely to blunt criticism of his reemergence as a campaigner.</TE>
<TE>   "Even people who are cynical about partisan politics and fund-raising
would say, 'Hey, it's the guy's brother. If you're going to help anybody,
you help the family,' " said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the two fund-raisers for Florida Republicans are the
first of many Bush will attend this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be others. . . . The president will work to support
candidates who share his views," Fleischer said. "That way, his ideas as
president and commander in chief can be carried out into law."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has not been completely disengaged from politics since Sept. 11.
He dispatched surrogates, including Vice President Dick Cheney, to
various party functions, including a $1-million dinner for Republican
governors in October.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington fund-raiser for Jeb Bush's reelection campaign
initially was scheduled for Nov. 28 but was postponed.</TE>
<TE>   In New Hampshire on Tuesday, the president attended a private
reception to thank GOP donors for past contributions. No funds were
collected at the event, however. In early December, after a town hall
meeting in Orlando, Fla., Bush attended a similar "donor maintenance"
gathering.</TE>
<TE>A Mix of Partisanship, Bipartisanship</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg said he expects Bush to continue mixing partisanship with
bipartisan events, such as this week's rallies spotlighting the education
bill.</TE>
<TE>   "If he were to begin a cross-country political tour, attacking
Democrats at every spot and raising money for Republicans and we didn't
hear anything else, it would recast his presidency to pre-9/11,"
Rothenberg said. "But I suspect that Bush will avoid that."</TE>
<TE>   Echoing that view was Norm Ornstein, an analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The leverage that Bush has had over Democrats to some degree was
built upon his ability to transcend partisan politics," Ornstein said.</TE>
<TE>   But that edge would erode, Ornstein said, "if the image emerges that
he's just another politician . . . who's trying to exploit the war on
terrorism for partisan advantage."</TE>

<HD>Polygamist Can Face Child Rape Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Salt Lake City judge ruled that a convicted polygamist can be
charged with child rape for impregnating a 13-year-old girl that he
married in 1986.</LD>
<LD>   The defendant, Tom Green, had asked the judge to dismiss the charge
because the statute of limitations for child rape expires four years
after the crime is reported to law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney John Bucher had argued that law enforcement knew of
Green's marriage long ago; hence, he said, the four-year statute of
limitations has expired.</LD>
<TE>   However, Judge Guy Burningham ruled there is no proof that officials
knew of the alleged crime before 1999, when Juab County Prosecutor David
Leavitt began a bigamy investigation against Green.</TE>

<HD>More Questions Raised Over Ambrose's Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Author Stephen E. Ambrose is facing still more allegations of
lifting material from other sources.</LD>
<LD>   Forbes.com reported Wednesday that two more books by the best-selling
historian, "Citizen Soldiers" and the third part of his Richard Nixon
trilogy, contain passages similar to those in other texts.</LD>
<LD>   Four works by Ambrose are now under question.</LD>
<TE>   The author's son and agent, Hugh Ambrose, declined to comment.
Victoria Meyer, a spokeswoman for his publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, said
any errors would be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are indeed additional passages or sentences that are
footnoted but not in quotations marks when they should have been, we will
work with our author to make the necessary corrections," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Ambrose acknowledged that his current bestseller, "The
Wild Blue," included passages from Thomas Childers' "Wings of Morning."
Ambrose footnoted Childers in the sections in question but did not
acknowledge quoting directly from the book. Both books are about World
War II bomber pilots.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Forbes.com reported Ambrose's "Crazy Horse and Custer"
included passages close to Jay Monaghan's "Custer." In Wednesday's
editions of the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Ambrose said: "There are
places where I used some of his words, and I should have put quote marks
around them."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose was unsure if his other books had similar problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. It's a lot of books," said Ambrose, author of more than
20 historical works, including "Undaunted Courage" and "Nothing Like It
in the World."</TE>
<TE>   In "Citizen Soldiers," a World War II book published in 1997, Ambrose
includes an author's note that says he "stole material profitably if
shamelessly" from Joseph Balkoski's "Beyond the Beachhead," which came
out in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The text includes material, without quotation marks, that closely
resembles the Balkoski book.</TE>
<TE>   In "Citizen Soldiers," Ambrose writes:</TE>
<TE>   "Men from the 3rd Battalion draped the body with the Stars and Stripes
and hoisted it on top of a huge pile of stones that once had been a wall
in the Saint Croix Church, a block from the cemetery. Howie's body
remained on display through the next day, July 19. GIs and some of the
few civilians remaining in the town adorned the site with flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Balkoski's version:</TE>
<TE>   "The next morning, the 29ers draped the body with the Stars and
Stripes and hoisted it on top of a huge pile of stones that once had been
a wall of Sainte Croix Church, one block west of the cemetery. The body
remained on display throughout July 19. The 29ers and some of the few
civilians remaining in the city adorned the site with flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Forbes.com reported that the Nixon volume, "Ruin and Recovery,"
published in 1991, contains sentences and passages that are identical or
very similar to parts of "Exile: The Unquiet Oblivion of Richard M.
Nixon," a 1984 book by Robert Sam Anson. As in the other books, Ambrose
cites Anson but does not put quote marks around the borrowed material.</TE>
<TE>   Historians are not questioning Ambrose's integrity. They believe
Ambrose might have so internalized his source material that he
unconsciously replicated it, or that the problem originates with his team
of research assistants. Ambrose is also highly prolific, increasing the
chance of error.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of plagiarism in history books are nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Haley acknowledged he had lifted material for "Roots," his 1970s
bestseller. More recently, Atlantic Monthly Press canceled distribution
of the biography "I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight: A Life of John Paul
Jones" after author James Mackay was found to have been accused of
plagiarism in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Haley nor Mackay were professional historians like
Ambrose, and notable instances of plagiarism within the field are
relatively rare. Since 1993, only 14 cases have been accepted for full
review by the American Historical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's very prevalent," said Eric Foner, a professor of
history at Columbia University and author of the acclaimed
"Reconstruction."</TE>

<HD>White House to Try to Restore Food Aid to Legal Immigrants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, seeking to put a gentle face on an austere
domestic budget for next year, said Wednesday that it would propose
restoring food stamp benefits to 363,000 legal immigrants who lost them
under welfare reform.</LD>
<LD>   The move, long sought by congressional Democrats and advocates for the
poor, came as the White House finishes up a spending plan that is
expected to provide little growth for most domestic programs, while
strongly expanding areas of defense and anti-terrorism. A major emerging
theme on Capitol Hill this year is a Democratic claim that last spring's
tax cut is siphoning off funds needed in such areas as health care and
social services for the poor during hard economic times.</LD>
<LD>   "It certainly would be a move in the right direction to restore [food
stamp] benefits for vulnerable, hard-working people," said Ellen
Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research and Action Center in
Washington. She described the White House proposal as "a very important
ingredient in moving in the direction we need to go."</LD>
<TE>   The announcement comes amid a recession that has exacerbated hunger
and homelessness in many areas of the country, sparking new appeals for
federal help. A survey of more than 20 major cities by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors found that requests for emergency food aid increased
23% in the year ending Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The signs of distress are a striking turnabout. Food stamp rolls
plunged from 25.5 million in 1996, when Congress toughened the welfare
rules, to below 17 million early last year. But in 2001 the rolls began
to expand, jumping to 18.4 million by October, the most recent month for
which statistics are available.</TE>
<TE>   "These food stamp benefits were denied by Congress in 1996, and it's
long past time to correct that injustice," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) in a statement Wednesday supporting the White House decision.
"Legal immigrants are respected and contributing members of our society,
and they deserve this assistance."</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing for reporters, administration officials said the
proposal would apply to legal immigrants who have been in the United
States for at least five years. The estimated cost is $2.1 billion over
the next decade. The measure, which does not include a work requirement,
will be part of the White House budget proposals for fiscal 2003 to be
unveiled early next month.</TE>
<TE>   "Restoring benefits to legal immigrants was the right thing to do.
It's time to do it," said a senior administration official, noting that
the recommendation was part of a larger initiative to make the food stamp
program "more accessible to those in need."</TE>
<TE>Congress Removed Benefits in 1996</TE>
<TE>   In one of the more contentious skirmishes of the 1996 welfare reform
debate, Congress took away food stamp eligibility for most noncitizens,
cutting off benefits for 838,000 legal immigrants. Two years later,
Congress partially rolled back the prohibition for certain groups of
children, senior citizens and the disabled, bringing an estimated 200,000
immigrants back onto the rolls.</TE>
<TE>   As some see it, the rising political attractiveness of restoring food
stamps for immigrants has coincided with the rising political clout of
immigrant communities. At the time of the 1996 benefit cutoff, immigrant
issues were seen as mostly affecting population centers in such states as
California, Texas, New York and Florida. California became one of several
states to establish its own program of food stamps for ineligible
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   But the 2000 census underscored the reality that immigrants are
settling in growing numbers throughout the country, altering the terms of
the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased and gratified that the president has moved on this
issue," said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La
Raza, a Latino civil rights organization. "He has courted the Hispanic
community very strenuously and very aggressively before the election and
since the election. We've always said that he needs to match the rhetoric
with substance--and we're pleased that he's beginning to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Noting support on Capitol Hill for the measure, including that of
Republican senators, Yzaguirre said: "Whether [Bush] is following or he's
leading, he's doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Others said it would take more than an occasional overture from the
White House to capture significant new support among Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything the White House can do to make the Republican Party more
appealing to Hispanics would benefit candidates in 2002 and in 2004, when
the president runs for reelection," said Stuart Rothenberg, a political
analyst in Washington. But, he added, "Republicans have deep problems
among Hispanic and minority voters in general. If this is just one
isolated thing, I think it will be quickly forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Even some who were pleased by the move wondered about the timing of
the announcement and whether the administration was seeking to gain
favorable publicity for a budget that may be less generous in other areas
of social spending.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has kept an unusually tight lid on its budget
proposals. But some outside analysts say it may recommend defense
increases of 5% to 8%, inevitably squeezing some other areas, such as
labor and social service programs that may be in line for freezes and
other curbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Where does [the money] all come from?" asked Stacy Dean, director of
food stamp and immigrant policy at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, about White House plans to pursue tax cutting and selected
spending increases. "The numbers don't add up, and we're concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Under current rules, most adult immigrants must be able to document 10
years of work inside the United States to qualify for food stamps. The
White House proposal would dispense with that requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is considering revisions that would reduce the work
requirement, but not eliminate it, as part of its pending farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   Although details vary among different food stamp proposals, advocates
took heart Wednesday in their similarities. "It seems that what the
administration is giving its voice to" is the principle that restoring
aid "is an important priority," Vollinger said.</TE>

<HD>Snow's Free for Taking in Buffalo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>After a recent 7-foot snowfall, Buffalo thought it couldn't give
the stuff away.</LD>
<LD>   Wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The nearby city of Rochester, still green as its winter festival draws
near this weekend, has offered to come take some of the snow away.</LD>
<TE>   "The more the better," was Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello's reply.</TE>
<TE>   A convoy of trucks is to make the 90-mile trip west today to collect
the snow.</TE>
<TE>   In five days beginning Christmas Eve, Buffalo was socked with 81.5
inches of snow--nearly a winter's worth--and has all but run out of
places to dump it. At the same time, Rochester is embarrassingly bare of
snow, despite a weekend full of events planned to promote winter tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody else wants any, we'll send it anywhere they want," said
Buffalo Streets Commissioner Paul Sullivan. "Send the trucks in and we'll
load them up."</TE>
<TE>   While Rochester asked only to "borrow" the snow, it is a pretty sure
bet no one in Buffalo will ask for it back.</TE>

<HD>Put Parts of Missouri River Back as We Found It, Panel Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Missouri River should meander freely along some stretches,
returning to the conditions that existed before dams and channels created
barge traffic routes, the National Research Council said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A more natural flow might entail an end to navigation along portions
that are open to towboat traffic, but entire species of birds and fish
may disappear without it, the council said after two years of study.</LD>
<LD>   Dams and channels have straightened the river's loops and meanders
over the years, providing flood control and allowing navigation, but
stopping nearly all of the sediment flow responsible for the nickname
"Big Muddy."</LD>
<TE>   The Missouri flows 2,341 miles through one-sixth of the country, from
Three Forks, Mont., to St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the council's findings hearten environmentalists seeking
the changes, they satisfied a recreation and tourism industry that earns
tens of millions of dollars a year from boating and fishing on upriver
lakes that would keep more of the river's water in the busy summer
season.</TE>
<TE>   Besides benefits to ecology, the economic benefits alone "could
justify reforming dam operations to create a spring rise and low summer
flows," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   The issue is the subject of bitter dispute between upriver and
downriver communities and divides otherwise like-minded lawmakers, such
as Daschle and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.)</TE>
<TE>   The recreation industry insists it contributes millions of dollars
more to the economy than does navigation, estimated at $87 million versus
$7 million. The council agreed, saying consideration should be given to
ending navigation along some segments of the lower 735 miles "where it is
economically inefficient."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers who depend on the river to lower the cost of shipping grain
say they would be devastated without the steady flows and 9-foot depths
that allow eight months of navigation each year.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins in Alleged PCB Poisoning Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GADSDEN, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>Claims that a chemical plant poisoned an Alabama community with
PCBs for decades went to trial Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs contend Monsanto Co. and spinoff Solutia Inc. let
hazardous PCBs leak off a plant site in Anniston from 1929 to 1971,
harming people's health and reducing property values to nearly nothing.</LD>
<LD>   The government banned production of PCBs, or polychlorinated
biphenyls, in the late 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   The current trial involves claims of property devaluation and
emotional distress by 16 people and one business. Trials over health
claims will be heard later.</TE>
<TE>   In opening statements, plaintiffs' lawyer Donald Stewart said company
documents show executives knew PCBs were dangerous but did nothing to
protect residents.</TE>
<TE>   Monsanto attorney Jere White argued that none of the 16 plaintiffs is
sick, and that there is no firm evidence linking PCBs to the conditions
of residents who are ill.</TE>

<HD>Little Hope Is Seen in Reviving Bills on Patients' Rights</HD>
<DH>Health care: Frustrated backers see the issue drop on the priority
list after the terrorist attacks and economic stumbles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about star-crossed legislation: The patients' bill of rights
just can't seem to catch a break.</LD>
<LD>   Every time new protections for the nation's HMO enrollees appear
imminent, something happens to push them off track.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a patient
protection bill in 1998, a gunman burst into the Capitol, killing two
police officers. The Senate never took up the issue that year.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next two years, the House and Senate passed competing
versions of the legislation but failed to reach a compromise because of
politics surrounding the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after bills passed the House and Senate last year, terrorists
struck and the economy faltered, and patients' rights lost its place on
the nation's list of priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 have pushed patients' rights so far afield that
it might be hard to resurrect with any vigor. In fact, one expert now
calls it a dead issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I don't know what to think other than it's frustrating," said
Rep. Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican who has championed patients'
rights for six years. "Some days I throw things and other days I get
ahold of myself, be calm and keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including Greg Scandlen of the conservative National Center
for Policy Analysis, attribute the bill's problems to fate. "Maybe God is
telling us something," Scandlen said.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which has broad general support, would provide
certain protections for health maintenance organization members,
including access to specialists, the right to appeal treatment decisions
to independent experts and insurance coverage of experimental trials.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the whole legislative arena changed after Sept. 11.
Proposals to offer prescription drug coverage to senior citizens and
increase coverage for the uninsured are off the health care agenda, at
least for now.</TE>
<TE>   But the patients' bill of rights--the subject of campaign commercials,
public opinion polls and multimillion-dollar lobbying efforts--is the
only piece of health legislation that has been around for so long.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it grew out of the failure in 1994 of the proposed
overhaul of the health care system proposed by the Clinton
administration. That debacle led to the growth of managed care and to
calls by critics for government to protect patients in the medical
marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, lawmakers broadly agree that all 161 million Americans with
private health insurance deserve some blanket protections.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, both sides said they were more optimistic than ever
about finally breaking the logjam and passing legislation that President
Bush would sign.</TE>
<TE>   But the pressure to resolve disagreements over the legislation has
dissipated--and neither side sees much incentive to budge.</TE>
<TE>   The key dispute is about whether patients should have the ability to
sue HMOs in state court and collect punitive damages if they are injured
as a result of poor care provided by the HMO.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Republicans want to send those cases to federal court and
impose stiff monetary limits on awards. Democrats typically support
sending lawsuits to state court, where each state's damage limits would
apply.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the House passed a bill reflecting Republican priorities and
the Senate voted for legislation in line with Democratic desires.</TE>
<TE>   The president has said he strongly supports the House bill but not the
Senate version.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides are ready and eager to move on these issues--but only
their way," Washington health analyst Robert Laszewski wrote in a recent
client bulletin. "Compromise is not only hard but also, maybe,
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   At a Capitol Hill health retreat last winter, legislative staff
members predicted that the reforms would be completed in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "What they agreed unanimously was that they were sick of it," said
Edward Howard, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Alliance for
Health Reform, which sponsored the retreat.</TE>
<TE>   When planning this month's retreat, Howard said, "we didn't even
bother to schedule a session on it because there isn't anything
substantive to say at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians now face tough questions: Do they keep pressing for an HMO
reform bill, use the issue in next year's elections or drop the issue
entirely?</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, the most ardent backers of HMO reform, now are fighting for
government subsidies to maintain health coverage for the 1.1 million
people who have lost their jobs in the last three months.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO industry trade group, which opposes the Democratic bill, said
its polls now show that voters are less interested in HMO reform than in
the rising costs of health care and in keeping their insurance coverage.
In fact, officials say, HMO lawsuits will only raise costs and force more
employers to drop health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make sure that the left hand and the right hand are
connected to the extent that Congress does not focus on legislation that
will make problems worse," said Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Assn. of Health Plans. "Congress is just now getting the message."</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University health policy expert Robert Blendon said patients'
rights is a dead issue from the public's perspective. At the same time,
"when you have something in a conference committee, usually that's pretty
far along to just quit."</TE>
<TE>   "When it's all said and done, it is a casualty of Sept. 11," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't stopping Norwood, the longtime backer of HMO reform.</TE>
<TE>   "Little old me is just going to be sitting here screaming about it,"
he said. "I can assure you [the Congress is] going to hear about it for
10 more years."</TE>

<HD>New GOP Chief to Drop Lobbying</HD>
<DH>Politics: Marc Racicot says he will continue to be paid by his law
firm for other services when he takes the party helm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Bowing to public and private criticism, Marc Racicot announced
Wednesday that he will stop working as a lobbyist when he becomes
chairman of the Republican National Committee later this month.</LD>
<LD>   But Racicot, the former governor of Montana, left the door open for
further controversy by indicating that he will continue to draw a salary
for providing other services to the law firm that hired him last year.
Those services could include "strategic advice" to clients, according to
Mindy Tucker, an RNC spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   When President Bush tapped him last month as his choice to head the
RNC, Racicot said he planned to continue his work as a lobbyist in the
Washington office of the Houston-based firm of Bracewell &amp; Patterson.
Racicot's clients have included the Recording Industry Assn. of America
and Enron Corp., the giant energy firm that recently filed for bankruptcy
and is now under criminal investigation by the Justice Department.</LD>
<TE>   His initial decision to remain a lobbyist drew criticism from
government reformers. They maintained that Racicot's access to the White
House and control over GOP campaign funds would give him improper
leverage when lobbying for private clients.</TE>
<TE>   RNC and White House officials rejected the criticism, noting that
other party leaders, including former Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ronald H. Brown, continued to lobby while in their political
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But Racicot told Associated Press on Wednesday that after listening
"to discussions both public and private," he had decided to terminate his
work as a lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   "That means I will not be contacting, either directly or indirectly,
members of the administration or Congress on behalf of my clients,"
Racicot said. "Nor will I advocate [clients'] issues with any of those
people. Nor will I be arranging conversations between those people. In
other words, I'm just not going to be a part of those activities."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Harshbarger, president of the government watchdog group Common
Cause, praised Racicot's announcement. "I think it answers the majority
of our concerns on the face of it."</TE>
<TE>   But Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee, said that Racicot's decision to continue accepting paychecks
from his law firm left open a conflict-of-interest risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem to be a distinction without a difference," she said of
his decision. "I have to wonder what this lobbying firm is paying him
for. . . . If he is concerned about the appearance [of impropriety], he
should pick one job or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Racicot told Associated Press his salary from the law firm would
remain the same for now but could be reduced in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Racicot said last month he would serve as GOP chairman as a volunteer,
meaning he would not accept the post's $150,000 annual salary. RNC
spokeswoman Tucker said Wednesday that was still the case.</TE>
<TE>   The RNC is expected to formally approve Racicot's appointment to
succeed outgoing Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore on Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Racicot, 53, served as Montana's governor from 1993 to 2000. He was
one of the earliest supporters of Bush's presidential candidacy and
gained national attention as a campaign spokesman during the contentious
recount in Florida that ultimately determined the election.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Three California Democrats who voted last spring for President
Bush's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut now say Congress should consider
delaying some of the law's provisions.</LD>
<LD>   The shift by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Ellen O. Tauscher of
Alamo and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara shows the strains in the bipartisan
coalition Bush assembled for one of his most significant legislative
achievements.</LD>
<LD>   It also portends a rancorous debate on taxes in the 2002 congressional
campaign as the federal government for the first time in several years
confronts budget deficits instead of surpluses.</LD>
<TE>   Feinstein, Tauscher and Capps were among 40 Democrats--12 in the
Senate and 28 in the House--who broke party ranks last May to vote for
the largest federal tax cut in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who opposed the measure,
has stepped up his criticism of it in recent weeks as his party gears up
for an election year in which control of the Senate and House are up for
grabs.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle so far has stopped short of proposing a delay or repeal of
any of the measure's provisions. As a practical matter, the law's critics
acknowledge that no proposals to scale back or delay the tax cut are
likely to succeed until after November's elections--and could be doomed
as long as Bush is in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The president has made clear he would view any push to revisit the tax
cut as a bid to raise taxes. And he declared Saturday that "not over my
dead body" would such efforts succeed.</TE>
<TE>   But the second thoughts voiced by the three California Democrats show
how the fiscal terrain has shifted since the tax cut was signed into law.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted for the tax cut because I believe we should return surplus
dollars to the American people," Tauscher said Wednesday. "But I am not
for huge deficits."</TE>
<TE>   The new tax law, enacted at a time when the federal treasury was flush
with extra revenue, produced an immediate $300-per-taxpayer rebate. But
its major provisions are scheduled to take effect gradually over the next
decade, including across-the-board reductions in income tax rates, cuts
for married couples and a phase-out of the federal estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher and the other two Californians say they stand by their votes
and still support the general thrust of the new law. "My view is we ought
to stay the course," Feinstein said earlier in an interview on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   But in various ways, the lawmakers say some of the law's provisions
should be reopened for debate in light of new economic conditions and the
pressures on government spending since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein suggested in December that tax cuts for the wealthiest
Americans should be frozen. Her spokesman, Howard Gantman, said Wednesday
that the senator believes the top tax rate should be reduced no further
than an initial cut to 38.6% from 39.6%. Under the law, the rate is
scheduled for additional cuts, reaching 35% in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Capps said Wednesday that she would still support additional tax cuts
if she believes they would help stimulate the economy. But she added that
some provisions of last year's law may need to be delayed to ensure
adequate funding for the military, domestic security and Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher said Congress should consider delaying cuts due to take
effect after 2005 in any year when the budget shows red ink. This idea,
known as a "trigger," was advanced and rejected last year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of proposed triggers, led by the Bush administration, said
they would effectively force tax increases at the worst possible time,
when revenues are dwindling and the economy is slowing. Tauscher insisted
a trigger "would never raise taxes or reverse a tax cut but would instead
implement the next phase of rate cuts only when it was fiscally sound to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans on Wednesday said Democrats such as Feinstein, Capps and
Tauscher would pay a political price for second-guessing the law.</TE>

<HD>A Truthful Glow From Galaxy's Center</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: The Chandra X-ray telescope has taken the first clear
shot of the middle of the Milky Way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though it is a mere 25,000 light-years from Earth, the center of
our own galaxy has long been one of the universe's most mysterious
places. It's so full of dust and gas that visual telescopes, even those
that can gather light from the most distant reaches of space, haven't
been able to see inside.</LD>
<LD>   "It's invisible to most astronomers because only one photon in a
trillion can break through," said Mark Morris, a professor of astronomy
at UCLA who has spent much of the last two decades probing the Milky
Way's center with telescopes that do not detect visible light but pick up
electromagnetic radiation emitted in radio, infrared and X-ray
wavelengths.</LD>
<LD>   Those images have offered tantalizing but vague hints. When X-ray
telescopes first peered at the center of the Milky Way about 20 years
ago, they found the area gave off a massive X-ray glow. Recent evidence
has pointed to a super-massive black hole in the galaxy's center. X-rays,
a highly energetic form of light, are emitted from some of nature's most
violent creations: supernova blasts and black holes.</LD>
<TE>   But astronomers didn't know exactly what fearsome objects, if any,
emitted the X-rays. The first pictures in the 1980s, from an X-ray
telescope called Einstein, were low resolution and too fuzzy. They showed
only a diffuse glow of X-rays over a large area. Because X-rays are also
created at extremely high temperatures, many astronomers suggested the
center of the galaxy was filled with a huge, searing ball of gas.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a modern X-ray telescope 100 times more sensitive than its
predecessor has given the first clear glimpse of the Milky Way's center.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the image would be fantastic, but it's better than we
thought," said Q. Daniel Wang, the assistant professor of astronomy at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who led the team mapping the
galactic center.</TE>
<TE>   The image shows that the X-rays don't come from hot gas but from about
1,000 points of light, a vast collection of what appear to be glittering
star remnants, plus black holes. (Black holes give off X-rays when they
swallow big chunks of matter or other stars.)</TE>
<TE>   "Our galaxy is like a big city," said Wang. "The center of the galaxy
is downtown, where the action is."</TE>
<TE>   The finding from NASA's $1.5-billion Chandra X-ray telescope provides
more evidence of how advances in technology in recent years are resolving
decades-old mysteries about the skies.</TE>
<TE>   The results "finally settle important aspects of the 20-year-old
debate surrounding the origin of X-ray emission" from the galaxy's
center, said Andreas Eckart, an astronomer at the University of Cologne
who studies the galactic center and helped confirm the existence of the
massive black hole located there.</TE>
<TE>   The new image was unveiled Wednesday at a national meeting of the
American Astronomical Society in Washington. It is also being published
in today's issue of the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the images "really fabulous," Morris said the findings
resolved problems he and other astronomers have long had in explaining
how enough super-hot gas to generate all the X-rays could be continually
created in the Milky Way.</TE>
<TE>   "This relieves the pressure on us to evoke outrageous events and
circumstances," including nonstop supernova explosions or gas traps
created by magnetic fields, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The X-rays appear to come from a bright but more mundane collection of
objects: hundreds of small, collapsed stellar remnants like white dwarf
and neutron stars and also the black holes created when bigger stars
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The new map suggests that the center of the galaxy, unlike the quiet
suburb where Earth resides, is a violent place where stars are forming,
dying and exploding at furious rates and being buffeted by supernova
shock waves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nice place to visit with a telescope, but I wouldn't want to
live there," said Cordelia Lang, a University of Massachusetts astronomer
and coauthor of the new study.</TE>
<TE>   The climate, though, is more benign than previously thought. The
hypothesis of a ball of hot gas would have required temperatures of
hundreds of millions of degrees. Instead, said Eric Gotthelf, a coauthor
of the study from Columbia University, "it's only a relatively mild 10
million degrees."</TE>
<TE>   Studying our own galaxy is likely to help astronomers understand the
workings of all galaxies, how they formed and why super-massive black
holes seem to reside at the centers of many of them.</TE>
<TE>   Our own largest black hole gives off a relatively weak X-ray signal,
although a team including UCLA's Morris did capture a "burp" last year, a
dramatic X-ray flare after the hole swallowed some matter.</TE>
<TE>   The study was not able to explain the diffuse X-ray glow that remains
or some small dust grains of iron that were detected.</TE>
<TE>   Eckart and Morris said the diffuse X-rays and the iron may have been
emitted by the black hole in a tremendous flash of energy as recently as
a few hundred years ago.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Breaks Off Peace Talks</HD>
<DH>Conflict: FARC rebels, however, say they aren't leaving a special
zone despite evacuation order.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The Colombian peace process collapsed Wednesday, sparking fears of
a bloody new chapter in this country's long civil war.</LD>
<LD>   In a nationally televised address, President Andres Pastrana announced
that the government is breaking off talks with the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.</LD>
<LD>   Pastrana said the leftist rebels weren't negotiating in good faith and
gave the group 48 hours to evacuate a demilitarized zone created three
years ago for the talks.</LD>
<TE>   "The FARC continue putting obstacles before the peace process, making
it impossible to continue advancing in the process," Pastrana said. "It
takes two to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials were on high alert and reportedly began planning to
retake the Switzerland-sized zone ceded to the FARC when the talks began
in January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In statements earlier in the day, FARC officials said that they wanted
to continue to negotiate and that the government's actions were a pretext
for invading the zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to continue staying here as we have," Raul Reyes, the
FARC's spokesman, said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown stems from restrictions Pastrana imposed in October
after he accused the FARC of abusing the zone by using it as a haven for
kidnapping and military training.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC broke off talks at the time after Pastrana ordered Colombian
air force jets to begin patrolling the zone, sent more troops to the
region and restricted the entry of foreigners. The rebels accused the
government of unilaterally changing the conditions that guaranteed their
safety.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions came after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the
U.S., which led to a noticeable hardening of the Colombian government's
rhetoric against the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana left a slim chance for the guerrillas to rescue the
negotiations, saying that although the restrictions aren't negotiable,
the FARC could make concessions to restart the process.</TE>
<TE>   "The future is in your hands," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the government's chief negotiator, Camilo Gomez,
said the FARC had asked for time to leave the zone. That brought angry
denials from the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   "He lied to the country and the international community," Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   The roller-coaster peace process has often seemed at the point of
collapse, but Wednesday was the first time that either side had spoken of
vacating the zone 200 miles south of Bogota, the capital, which has been
key to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Colombia's civil war has continued during the peace talks,
their collapse would almost certainly signal the beginning of a new stage
of a conflict that costs 3,500 lives each year.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have spent the last three years strengthening their hands.
The FARC, increasingly involved in the country's lucrative drug trade,
has spread throughout the country and now has about 17,000 combatants.
The armed forces have received millions of dollars in U.S. aid and
military training as part of anti-narcotic efforts.</TE>
<TE>   With fears of open warfare sweeping Bogota, peace groups met to demand
last-minute intervention from a third party such as the United Nations, a
step the FARC has adamantly opposed since talks began.</TE>
<TE>Civil Groups Plan to Stage Demonstration</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Garcia Pena, chief peace negotiator under a former government,
said civil groups plan to hold an emergency demonstration in front of the
offices of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried," Garcia Pena said. "This is definitely much more
serious than anything else that has come before."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the government's decision were in short supply. Pastrana,
who is barred from running in a presidential election later this year,
met with the major candidates before making his address.</TE>
<TE>   All of the candidates acknowledged the FARC's intransigence, but most
said they hold out hope for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not resigned as a citizen, nor as a politician nor as a
candidate for the presidency, that the only alternative for Colombia's
future is war," said Horacio Serpa, the leading candidate in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Although Colombians have become increasingly fed up with the fruitless
negotiations, the reality of a complete breakdown seemed to bring a sharp
realization of the grim road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the five villages in the zone said they were frightened
at the possibility of a military conflict breaking out around them. There
were reports that both FARC officials and government workers in the zone
had begun packing up equipment to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer an uncertain peace process to an uncertain war," said Luis
Eduardo Garzon, a presidential candidate from one of Colombia's
left-leaning political parties.</TE>
<TE>Hope-Imbued Process Yielded Few Results</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana won election in 1998 largely on the promise that he would
begin peace talks to end the four-decade civil war.</TE>
<TE>   He immediately ceded the demilitarized zone to the rebels, removing
all traces of the police and military and creating an autonomous state.</TE>
<TE>   But the talks yielded few results. The war continued, with FARC rebels
kidnapping civilians and attacking small towns and isolated army
outposts.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations took a turn for the worse last summer, when the zone
became an object of controversy. In July, FARC rebels staged a massive
kidnapping at an apartment building in an upper-class neighborhood in a
nearby city, taking their victims back to the zone as they negotiated
ransoms.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in August, Colombian military officials arrested several members
of the Irish Republican Army as they left the zone after allegedly
providing bomb-making instruction to the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were part of a series of incidents that eroded what little
support the FARC had in Europe, which had been the prime international
backer of the peace process. During the summer, FARC guerrillas seized a
Colombian official from a U.N. vehicle as it was returning from a town
near the zone and also kidnapped three Germans.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has refused to participate since FARC rebels kidnapped and
killed three American activists in 1999.</TE>

<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>The cells are boxes of chain-link fence with concrete floors and
thick-planked wood roofs. The beds are mats on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   The jailers are gun-toting infantrymen, military police with
attack-trained German shepherds and artillerymen in Humvees.</LD>
<LD>   And the inmates are "the worst of the worst," said the prison's
commander--the toughest of the Al Qaeda and Taliban members currently
held by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   "Our job here is to take these terrorists out of the fight by locking
them up," Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert said Wednesday, two days
before prisoners are expected to begin arriving at this remote U.S. naval
outpost on the southeast corner of Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, the military has transformed this somnolent naval base,
established at the beginning of the last century, into a ferocious hub of
activity, with more than a dozen giant cargo planes landing each day,
disgorging military construction workers, police, jailers and scores of
others.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert himself arrived just five days ago from his command at Camp
Lejeune, N.C., to oversee the mammoth effort to detain Al Qaeda and
Taliban supporters far from where they can do harm.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, more than 2,000 detainees from Afghanistan will be
imprisoned here, guarded by an equal number of American troops.</TE>
<TE>   The task at Guantanamo is fraught with obstacles. Soldiers trained to
police and jail the occasional U.S. military man or woman who breaks the
law are being asked to guard inmates whose compatriots have proved
themselves willing to die to destroy their jailers and the country they
represent.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers must learn to work at a makeshift, open-air facility
unlike any they have ever seen. And they have to control their own anger
at prisoners suspected of supporting the Sept. 11 attacks on America as
they create a prison environment that is tough but beyond reproach.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intention of making it comfortable," Lehnert said of the
prison camp, dubbed Camp X-Ray, that has been erected in two weeks and of
more lasting facilities still to be built.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be humane," Lehnert added. "But I assure you that when you
see Camp X-Ray, you will not wish to be an occupant."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Pentagon permitted a small group of journalists to
see what the drive to create a secure jail for Taliban and Al Qaeda
detainees has wrought at Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   It is a place that seems suited to serve as a jail.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-five square miles of land, water and faded pink buildings,
Guantanamo Bay is cut off from the rest of Cuba by 17.4 miles of double
fence, land mines, mangrove swamps and salt flats, and from the rest of
the world by steep cliffs that crash into the ocean and bay on three
sides.</TE>
<TE>   Deep within those natural barriers, the Pentagon is constructing
barriers of its own.</TE>
<TE>   First to materialize is Camp X-Ray, an open-air prison in a valley
amid forbidding hills, with an American flag already flying high. Lehnert
said it is ready for about 100 prisoners. Eventually it will have space
for about 220 inmates in isolated, 6-foot-square cells. Its
perimeter--two chain-link fences looped with razor and concertina
wire--is already guarded day and night by U.S. infantry and artillery
troops, busy training for their mission as jailers.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners, garbed in jumpsuits, will use portable toilets. They will
sleep at night under halogen security lighting turned to full strength.
They might get rained on in winter storms, said Marine Col. Terry
Carrico, who is managing the prison camp.</TE>
<TE>   In 40 to 60 days, the Pentagon hopes to have a more permanent jail of
corrugated tin, Quonset-style.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military has embarked on rapid construction projects before,
but officials said they could recall nothing resembling this one. It
provided tent cities at Guantanamo for more than 40,000 Haitians and
Cubans in 1994, and old U.S. military barracks for 125,000 Cubans from
the Mariel boat lift in 1980. But those were for people seeking political
asylum in the United States, not for terrorists like those who rioted at
a prison in Afghanistan in late November, killing a CIA officer.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time that Guantanamo has housed prisoners. While
the Haitian and Cuban refugees were housed in tents on an airport runway,
a small number with criminal records or a record of violence were kept in
a small camp at what is now Camp X-Ray.</TE>
<TE>   Recent years have been much quieter at Guantanamo, which serves
primarily as a refueling station for the Navy and a place for its
ships--particularly those involved in narcotics and immigration
enforcement--to dock and resupply. Its sole airport runway had been shut
down several days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Now the skies are humming with flights 24 hours a day. More than 50
planes are landing each week, said the base commander, Navy Capt. Robert
Buehn.</TE>
<TE>   Until two weeks ago, the base housed only about 700 active-duty
personnel. For leisure dining, there is one McDonald's; for shopping, the
Navy outfitter; for entertainment, movies on a giant open-air screen.</TE>
<TE>   Since Dec. 24, 600 troops have poured in, with more arriving every
day.</TE>
<TE>   They come to an important place in the history of U.S.-Latin American
relations. Marines fighting in the Spanish-American War landed here in
1898. Five years later, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an agreement
to lease the base from Cuba for use as a coaling station, making
Guantanamo the oldest U.S. military installation abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Since Cuban President Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, his regime
has seen the base as an unwelcome symbol of American incursion. The
United States has rights to the base indefinitely and pays rent of about
$4,000 monthly to the Castro government--checks that have gone uncashed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Castro cut off the base's utilities and other supplies. But
instead of closing it, the Pentagon chose to make Guantanamo
self-sufficient. Today "Gitmo," as it is known to those who serve here,
treats its own water, generates its own electricity and imports
everything else.</TE>
<TE>   These days the base bristles with activity and mission. Dogs sniff
arriving visitors for bombs. Soldiers practice techniques to handcuff and
sedate prisoners. And young men like Marine Staff Sgt. Scott Bolman of
Portland, Ore., do their best to figure out their place in it all.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a little more difficult for us to keep the anger in the back of
our mind with these prisoners," Bolman said. "When you start to think
about these guys, you start to think about what actually has taken place
since Sept. 11. This is real life."</TE>

<HD>Wave of U.S. Immigration Likely to Survive Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Policy: Proposals for restrictions have failed to attract much
interest on Capitol Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics of the nation's often-embattled immigration system were
quick to condemn it after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The White House
swiftly shelved controversial proposals for an amnesty for illegal
immigrants from Mexico. And federal authorities made it easier to detain
multitudes of noncitizens.</LD>
<LD>   But the most significant development in the national immigration
debate is what hasn't happened: No lawmaker of influence has moved to
reverse the country's generous immigration policy, which for more than
three decades has facilitated the largest sustained wave of immigration
in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   Proposals to restrict a system that welcomed more than 9 million legal
immigrants during the 1990s were not even accorded a formal hearing on
Capitol Hill.</LD>
<TE>   Although Congress will continue to fine-tune the system once it
reconvenes Jan. 23, experts agree that major changes to the core system
of legal immigration are not on the political radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   "This reflects a sort of wise and grown-up attitude on the part of
Americans about what immigration is vis-a-vis what [the Sept. 11
terrorism] was," said former Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner, who served under President Clinton. "We've
got some serious fixing we need to do, but it doesn't mean that the whole
thing should be jettisoned."</TE>
<TE>   Those who argue that too much immigration is causing economic and
social fragmentation--and who viewed Sept. 11 as an unexpected
opportunity to plead their case--are disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got two political parties with their heads in the sand trying
to play this ethnic politics game," said Dan Stein, executive director of
the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors deep cuts.</TE>
<TE>Pro-Immigrant Groups Gain Savvy</TE>
<TE>   The restraint is the product of political and demographic currents
that have swept the nation since the mid-1990s, when the rhetorical
tactic of blaming immigration for social problems was perceived to have
run out of steam.</TE>
<TE>   California Gov. Pete Wilson became the first major U.S. political
figure in generations to capitalize on fear of immigrants during his
successful 1994 reelection campaign. But that tactic was repudiated in
the last half of the decade by the governor of Texas--George W. Bush, who
publicly courted Latinos and championed immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent routs of the Republican Party in presidential,
gubernatorial and legislative races in California and the deep alienation
of the fast-growing Latino electorate served to discredit Wilson's
strategy in GOP circles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as the numbers of new arrivals continued to swell in a
booming economy, pro-immigration forces regrouped with renewed focus and
political savvy. The immigrant lobby today is more than an inchoate
conglomeration of liberals, civil libertarians and ethnic
special-interest groups. Corporate America, which increasingly relies on
the brawn and brains of immigrant workers, is now firmly aboard.
Organized labor and all major religious groups are pillars of a loose
pro-immigrant coalition--as are many Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Republicans saw what happened in California with Pete
Wilson's effort to play politics with immigration," said Daniel T.
Griswold of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that supports
liberal immigration. "He won a short-term battle there but lost the war."</TE>
<TE>Crackdown Expected but Never Occurred</TE>
<TE>   As president, Bush had considerable latitude after Sept. 11 to put a
brake on immigration. Experts say he could have cited the emergency to
halt all new arrivals and seal the nation's borders. One viable scenario
was a reprise of the severe clampdown on immigration that followed World
War I.</TE>
<TE>   "If you sat in a room with a bunch of immigration junkies or experts
on the 12th of September, the default option at the end of the
conversation would have been: 'We're going back to the 1920s. We're going
to slam the door shut,' " said Demetrios Papademetriou, co-director of
the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research organization that
studies immigration.</TE>
<TE>   It never happened. Instead, the administration has painstakingly gone
out of its way to separate the issue of immigrants and immigration from
the 19 Middle Easterners who hijacked four U.S. airliners on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner James W. Ziglar has
repeatedly voiced the operative mantra: "These weren't immigrants," he
has said of the hijackers, all of whom arrived on legal visitor's visas.
"They were terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining that separation is politically tricky. While lawmakers
often laud the nation's immigrant heritage, polls consistently show that
the public is ambivalent at best about immigrations.</TE>
<TE>   Often overlooked amid these varying views is how institutionalized
immigration has become in American society. Today's polyglot influx is
rooted in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. That era's champions of
social equality could not overlook a system created in the 1920s that
effectively barred new settlers from much of the world beyond western
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Congress acted in 1965 to impose a more equitable process. Lawmakers
largely eliminated geographic biases in favor of family unification and
job skills.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms opened the door to immigration from Asia, Latin America
and the Caribbean, regions long shut out of the process. Immigration from
those areas created a natural multiplier effect: New arrivals promptly
petitioned on behalf of loved ones still abroad.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1980s, Mexico's chronic underdevelopment, and civil wars in
Central American sent masses of unauthorized immigrants north. The
growing convenience of international air travel made it easy for Asians
and others to enter the United States on short-term visas and disappear
into burgeoning new immigrant communities. Millions of illegal immigrants
eventually received amnesty or otherwise won lawful status.</TE>
<TE>Trade Center Bombing Led to New Curbs</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, more than 12 million new immigrants--legal and
illegal--settled in the United States, according to estimates based on
census data and INS numbers. By contrast, about 10 million arrived during
the first decade of the 20th century, the heyday of that famed era of
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   It was against this grain that advocates of curtailed immigration made
their case after Sept. 11. The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had
earlier contributed to a soured atmosphere that ultimately resulted in
increased deportations, tighter rules on political asylum and other
crackdowns targeting immigrants. That helped give rise to the last
serious effort to reduce immigration levels--and it failed.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo (R-Colo.), who supports an immigration
moratorium and heads an immigration restriction caucus, sees difficult
odds this time as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of hard when both major parties are against you--as is the
president," said Tancredo, whose caucus' membership more than doubled
after Sept. 11. "We're not going to have a hearing at all, as far as I
can tell."</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, the major pro-immigrant organizations have embraced
the White House strategy of publicly separating immigrants from
terrorists. While troubled by Bush administration detention moves, the
groups tempered their criticism and backed additional screening and other
security measures designed to deter terrorist entry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're breathing a sigh of relief, to be honest" said Angela Kelley of
the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigrant umbrella group based in
Washington. "So far, not all immigrants have been tarred with a tough
legislative brush."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is even proposing the restoration of food
stamp eligibility to more than 300,000 legal immigrants who lost access
as part of the 1996 federal welfare overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   And there is hope among immigration advocates that the issue of legal
status of millions of illegal immigrants from Mexico will eventually
reemerge at the negotiating table. Some see an opportunity to reconfigure
the nation's border enforcement apparatus to concentrate on security
threats--rather than on deterring economic migrants seeking their niche
in the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been obsessed with keeping out hard-working, peaceful Mexican
workers who want to build buildings and work in our factories and hotels
and restaurants," said Griswold of the Cato Institute. "We've used
resources that, in hindsight, should have been devoted to keeping out
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Since the September terrorist attacks, authorities have zeroed in on
tightening rules governing so-called non-immigrant visitors, who
outnumber actual immigrants by more than 20 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Changes include fortifying border controls, giving federal authorities
broad new powers to detain noncitizens and to eavesdrop on their
conversations with attorneys, and the creation of an additional layer of
State Department screening for visa applications from about two dozen
nations with large Muslim populations.</TE>
<TE>   Further restrictions, such as greater scrutiny of foreign students and
other visitors and even more enhanced visa screening, appear certain.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has launched a reorganization of the INS, separating
its sometimes-conflicting enforcement and service functions. But none of
this is likely to lower overall immigration levels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all border control or process issues, rather than the substance
of immigration policy," complained Mark Krikorian, executive director of
the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports cuts in immigration.
"The tension between high immigration and homeland security cannot be
resolved by organizational restructuring."</TE>
<TE>   The debate is a fluid one and, as Sept. 11 demonstrated, unexpected
events may jolt it in a new direction. A deepening recession could fuel a
further backlash against immigration, as past economic downturns have
done. Another serious terrorist strike could change everything.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is another attack--I'm talking a big attack--all bets are
off," said Papademetriou, of the Migration Policy Institute. "I think you
would likely see all this measuredness of our current response going out
the window.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we're going to be as deliberate on anything if
there's a next time."</TE>

<HD>Breakups Are Their Business</HD>
<DH>In Japan, professional 'breaker-uppers' employ James Bond-like
tactics to divide lovers, spouses and even corporate partners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>It's an industry that thrives because Japan is still a nation that
can't say no. For the right price, operatives will dump your girlfriend
for you, lose your husband, drive away that mistress or fire that
longtime employee.</LD>
<LD>   Wakaresaseya--literally "breaker-uppers"--are specialists in
destroying relationships. In a nation that eschews confrontation and
shuns public displays of passion, these terminators extricate clients
from close encounters of the emotional kind.</LD>
<LD>   While Western psychiatrists, investigators and attorneys abet those in
the throes of separation, wakaresaseya take a far more active role, and
the result isn't always pretty. The agents, who are unlicensed, do
whatever it takes, including entrapment, betrayal or worse, to get the
job done.</LD>
<TE>   "If this wasn't my business, I'd consider a lot of what we do
immoral," says Hiroshi Ito, a handsome 33-year-old wakaresaseya with
Tokyo-based Office Shadow.</TE>
<TE>   There are few statistics on the dodgy field, but Tokyo-based Daiko
Research Office estimates that a dozen firms like itself, mainly here and
in Osaka, pull in tens of millions of dollars a year handling hundreds of
cases. This compares with just two companies a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists and wakaresaseya firms cite several reasons for the
industry's recent success--and why the idea probably wouldn't fly
overseas. Women in Japan these days are stronger and increasingly likely
to initiate separations, yet law and culture still encourage them to make
it look as if it's the man's idea.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many people who once helped others break up, including
village dignitaries and matchmakers, are no longer around.
"Intermediaries are very important in Japanese culture, but many are
being eliminated as society changes," says Shizuo Machizawa, a
psychiatrist and professor at Tokyo's Rikkyo University. "So commercial
services are springing up to fill the gap."</TE>
<TE>   Some clients are so desperate for emotional closure that they arrive
at the first meeting with $5,000 in cash. Complex jobs can run to
$150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Each wakaresaseya company has several, even dozens, of operatives
skilled at playing roles, from sexy flight attendants and powerful
officials to wholesome housewives and movie moguls.</TE>
<TE>   The person a client hopes to banish--the "target," in industry
parlance--often is lulled into a trap through a seemingly chance meeting
in a bar, at a party, on a flight. A moment of weakness captured by a
camera hidden in a cigarette box or behind a lapel is enough to upend his
or her life. Though breaking up is hard to do, these firms boast 95%
success rates.</TE>
<TE>   The process generally starts with a client's call or e-mail. Most
firms prefer not to divide families (but will). And virtually all try to
weed out troublesome customers, including stalkers, those with a grudge,
the indecisive.</TE>
<TE>   "I purposely wait four or five days to see if they really want it,"
says Hiroyuki Yoshida, president of Office Shadow. "We need to see how
serious they are before we destroy people's normal lives and emotional
ties."</TE>
<TE>   After a down payment is received, the wakaresaseya launch an
investigation, beginning with the client: Why did your husband take a
mistress, what prompted your wife to sleep with her boss, why do you want
to dump your boyfriend? Further afield, interviews with neighbors and
colleagues, printed records and tailing fill out the details of the
target's preferences, lifestyle, favorite golf course or department
store, and commute.</TE>
<TE>   With the bead drawn, wakaresaseya devise a "scenario" to entrap the
target and ultimately convince or pressure him or her into ending the
relationship. Wakaresaseya deny breaking the law and insist that no one
in their profession has been arrested in the course of work.</TE>
<TE>Love Can Fade in Face of Scandal</TE>
<TE>   Stubborn targets can even be lured into fake business deals, saddled
with huge financial debts and visited by faux mafia-linked debt
collectors. Threats of a career-ending scandal also work wonders to
weaken tender ties, often before a sympathetic new "friend" guides the
target emotionally into accepting the divorce or breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is "after-care"--for an additional fee, of course--to
ensure that people stay apart. After driving away a mistress, operatives
might plant rumors that a neighbor finds the wife attractive to rekindle
a husband's interest in his spouse and keep him from straying again.
After-care may also include advising the client to stop complaining
incessantly, lose weight, even dress and act more like the girlfriend her
husband has just given up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a cancer operation," says Kiyoshi Hiwatashi, managing
director of Lady's Secret Service. "You remove the tumor but need to make
sure it doesn't grow back."</TE>
<TE>   Like a good movie script, the best scenarios have imagination,
believability and a healthy dose of human psychology. Many are used
repeatedly, making firms reluctant to reveal too much.</TE>
<TE>   Generally they either play off the target's everyday routine--an
arranged meeting of a "fellow music fan" at a favorite CD store, for
instance--or appeal so much to the target's vanity or ego that suspicion
is capped.</TE>
<TE>   Most firms say targets rarely see the fix coming or question why
schlumps like themselves are suddenly the darlings of the good-looking
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   The companies all agree on who makes the easiest target. "Men can
always be seduced if the woman operative is reasonably good-looking,"
says Hiwatashi. "That's an absolute. Men are basically simpletons."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's decade-long recession and the James Bond allure of the job
make recruiting operatives easy. Lady's Secret Service receives more than
20 resumes a day, some from doctors, nurses and lawyers bored with their
9-to-5 lives, others from celebrities looking for a profession that will
outlast their public appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Successful candidates are trained in legal boundaries, martial arts
and role-playing. Patience and thinking on your feet must come naturally.</TE>
<TE>   Ito became an Office Shadow operative several years ago after tiring
of his brokerage job. He nearly blew his first case after flinching when
a jealous husband failed to react as scripted, but he says he now can
handle anything. His specialties include picking up women and befriending
distraught men.</TE>
<TE>   Office Shadow broke up one marriage--the wife wanted out after meeting
an old college flame--by luring an otherwise upstanding accountant hubby
into contracting an embarrassing disease. The firm then threatened to
reveal his hospital records.</TE>
<TE>   Another case was resolved when operatives followed a husband's
mistress on her Hawaiian vacation, uncovered a shoplifting arrest and
used the U.S. police report to sour the husband's affections.</TE>
<TE>   One of the toughest cases for Daiko Research Office involved a husband
who refused to leave his mistress despite repeated efforts at
discrediting her. Finally, after two years, the firm lured the pair into
a promising business deal using dummy offices, business cards and
secretaries. It saddled them with $160,000 in debt and presented him with
a choice: Give her up or pay the debt in full.</TE>
<TE>   It was a deal the husband couldn't refuse. "Love is never forever for
Japanese men if it starts costing too much," says Yasuyuki Takase,
president of Daiko.</TE>
<TE>   In particularly stubborn cases, wakaresaseya seek out the softest
target. Although the husband might be in love, the young mistress might
be in it for the bucks, so dangling something both wealthy and attractive
frequently does the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "Mistresses aren't difficult," Takase adds. "Most Japanese women like
rich, tall, handsome guys, so it's easy to seduce them away."</TE>
<TE>   If the handsome stranger trick fails, mistresses can be swayed by a
"chance" meeting with an old flame. Alternatively, operatives may find
dirt on the mistress and threaten to take it to her parents.</TE>
<TE>   Women tend to be more wary than men of good-looking members of the
opposite sex. One solution: A female operative befriends the mistress,
figures out her ideal man and then introduces candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Mistresses also tend to succumb to vanity traps. Many young women are
secretly convinced that they're model material, so leading them down that
road and tripping them up is relatively easy. Even if the women are not
attractive, wakaresaseya highlight one feature--"Your teeth are perfect
for dental commercials"--and lure them away, then make them feel that the
career shift didn't work out because of their shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   Wives plotting surgical strikes against mistresses are a big part of
business, but a client can be the mistress herself, trying to get away
from a doting married man, often using his money for the mission.
Frequently, wakaresaseya say, the bill is paid with cash the man thinks
is going toward designer handbags.</TE>
<TE>   Wakaresaseya clearly inhabit a legal gray zone, as they hint at far
more complex cases involving secret photos taken at hot springs, drugged
targets, stolen documents and unwitting victims left on bullet trains to
awaken hours later across country, alone and humiliated.</TE>
<TE>Some Clients Enjoy Secret Agent Role</TE>
<TE>   Clients might even be enlisted to play supporting roles. Thus a wife
might introduce her husband to an alluring operative "friend" at a party
and leave early to let things develop. Some enjoy playing secret agent so
much that they later become full-time operatives.</TE>
<TE>   The higher or more socially respected the target is, the easier it is
to loosen their heartstrings with a threatened scandal. Wakaresaseya brag
about judicial impeachments they've engineered and political careers
they've derailed as they sought to break up relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Homosexual clients also offer a promising field. Infiltrating the
relatively tightknit community can be challenging, given homosexuality's
taboo status in Japan. But the stigma also makes pressuring someone
easier.</TE>
<TE>   Though most cases involve a love problem, separations of friends also
are common, including cases where a new friendship threatens to disrupt
older ties between two people.</TE>
<TE>   Wakaresaseya also have found fertile ground in Japan's changing
corporate world, with companies often as squeamish as individuals about
saying goodbye. Wakaresaseya comb the resumes and backgrounds of older,
higher-paid employees for any excuse to fire them. Alternately, they'll
start rumors designed to hound them out of their jobs, saving firms the
cost of severance payments.</TE>
<TE>   Higher up the corporate food chain, wakaresaseya break apart longtime
corporate marriages by digging up dirt about a partner, president or
chairman and going public--or threatening to. With so much hidden debt
these days, simply finding the actual amount owed is often damning
enough.</TE>
<TE>   The operatives also influence the factional infighting common in
Japanese companies, perhaps discrediting a president in the eyes of his
board of directors to help a rival ascend.</TE>
<TE>   Wakaresaseya say emotional immaturity and a growing desire to pass off
responsibility are fueling their booming business. They blame Japan's
education system and family structure, weaker morality in modern times,
and new Internet and cell phone technologies that make it easier to get
involved with relative strangers but no less difficult to sever ties.</TE>
<TE>   "While most people in foreign countries wouldn't think of hiring
someone to arrange a breakup, young Japanese these days seem to think
they can pay away their problems," says Daiko Research's Takase.
"Relationships are treated like something they're buying from a
convenience store."</TE>
<TE>   Doing this work can take its toll on the operatives. Wakaresaseya say
they find the car chases, lengthy stakeouts and long hours in smoky bars
draining. Even more taxing is the emotional cost of living a lie, acting
sympathetic to people you may detest and being a party to so much
deception and dirty dealing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll ever be able to marry," says operative Ito. "Human
ties seem so fragile to me now."</TE>
<TE>   Company president Yoshida, known as "Mr. Shadow" to his colleagues,
says he's very comfortable financially but has almost no friends, remains
constantly on the move and is increasingly suspicious of human nature.
"I've experienced the depths of hell," he says. "It's really too much.
You stop trusting people."</TE>

Rumsfeld now runs the Pentagon; and so does a stellar cast of retired
generals and Cabinet secretaries, including former Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.</LD>
<LD>   And even by Wall Street standards, the Carlyle Group has some serious
money: $12.5 billion in investments at last count. The Washington-based
private equity firm, which advises and invests for wealthy clients and
institutions, has shown returns of more than 34% through the last decade,
particularly through timely defense and aerospace investments.</LD>
<TE>   So when President Bush declared war on terrorism in September, few
were better poised than Carlyle to know how and when to make money.</TE>
<TE>   On a single day last month, Carlyle earned $237 million selling shares
in United Defense Industries, the Army's fifth-largest contractor. The
stock offering was well timed: Carlyle officials say they decided to take
the company public only after the Sept. 11 attacks. The stock sale cashed
in on increased congressional support for hefty defense spending,
including one of United Defense's cornerstone weapon programs.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle's windfall is a result of astute business decisions, excellent
connections, strategic lobbying, good timing and a bit of luck. It is
also a prime example of how defense contractors got well in a hurry after
the Sept. 11 attacks, in a year when the Bush administration already was
planning steep hikes in defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   For several years in the late 1990s, United Defense's Crusader
Advanced Field Artillery System--a massive high-tech cannon that could
fire faster and with more impact than any before it--was in trouble at
the Pentagon. The system clashed with the vision many military planners
and analysts have for a lighter, more mobile Army. And its high price
tag--originally $20 billion--endangered it in times of tight defense
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   But the suicide attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center
freed up tens of billions of dollars in new defense spending. United
Defense already had modified the Crusader, making it 20 tons lighter. And
the Army had cut its order by more than half to make it more palatable to
budget cutters.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 26, the Army signed a $665-million modified contract with
United Defense through April 2003 to complete the Crusader's development
phase. In October, the company listed the Crusader, and the attacks
themselves, as selling points for its stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Then Congress fully funded the system in the defense authorization
bill that passed the House and Senate on Dec. 13, the day before
Carlyle's stock sale. And President Bush is scheduled to open the funding
spigot today, when he signs a defense appropriation bill that includes
$487.3 million for the Crusader in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The ties that bind the president's family and close advisors to
Carlyle have helped draw the confidence of its investors--and the
criticism of outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time the president of the United States' father is on
the payroll of one of the largest U.S. defense contractors," said Charles
Lewis, director of the Center for Public Policy and one of Carlyle's most
ardent critics.</TE>
<TE>   "Between Baker and Carlucci, not to mention dear old dad, the
relationship of the president with this particular company is as tight
and close as, well, anyone can imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle officials bristle at such talk. They described their recent
stock sale as just plain good business that benefited a wide array of
investors, including pension funds like those of California's state
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle spokesman Chris Ullman said that neither the company nor its
managers, directors and advisors have ever personally lobbied for the
Crusader or other government contracts now in the hands of United Defense
and other Carlyle subsidiaries and investments.</TE>
<TE>   Of Carlucci, Carlyle's board chairman, and his friendship with the
current Defense secretary, Ullman said: "I assure you he doesn't lobby.
That's the last thing he'd do. You'd have to know Carlucci to know he'd
never do that, and you'd have to know Rumsfeld to know it wouldn't
matter."</TE>
<TE>   But even if Carlyle and Carlucci don't lobby, their subsidiaries and
majority-owned companies do. And documents on file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the Defense
Department and Congress show that they do so heavily, strategically and
persistently.</TE>
<TE>Midway Between White House, Congress</TE>
<TE>   By any standard, the Carlyle Group has the right address. Its suite of
offices are on Pennsylvania Avenue midway between the White House and
Congress--a 15-minute walk to each.</TE>
<TE>   It was founded as a small private-equity firm in 1987 by David M.
Rubenstein, a young lawyer who had worked as an aide in Jimmy Carter's
White House, and two investment specialists. They named the company after
their favorite hotel in New York and started out with a modest portfolio
of $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Carlucci retired as Ronald Reagan's Defense secretary and
joined Carlyle. Soon after, the company aggressively went after defense
and aerospace investments, a specialty for Carlucci and the other former
government officials who followed him into Carlyle.</TE>
<TE>   Their investment strategies paid off, not only in defense acquisitions
and sales but also in a wide array of corporations. Carlyle's portfolio
quickly grew into the billions of dollars as pension funds and wealthy
businessmen and families, including royal sheiks in the Persian Gulf,
invested with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   As its reputation grew, so did the group's star-studded management
roster. It added former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John M.
Shalikashvili; Arthur Levitt, the long-serving former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission; former British Prime Minister John
Major; former Secretary of State Baker; and former President Bush
(Carlyle officers say the elder Bush's principal role is as "a draw":
delivering speeches at Carlyle-sponsored events).</TE>
<TE>   Last February, the California Public Employees' Retirement System
announced it was investing $425 million in "a strategic partnership" with
Carlyle. Even the company owned by Osama bin Laden's estranged
billionaire family in Saudi Arabia was among Carlyle's clients--a mere
$2-million investment that Carlyle said it bought out after Sept. 11 "for
image reasons," Ullman said. He declined to say whether the Bin Ladens
made a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Ullman downplayed Carlyle's defense connections, saying that today
less than 10% of its $12.5-billion portfolio is in defense, an additional
15% percent in commercial aerospace, and the rest in real estate, health
care, telecommunications and consumer industries.</TE>
<TE>   Only 15 of Carlyle's 500 employees are former government officials,
Ullman said. Most of the rest are investment professionals working in 24
offices scattered across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle bought Arlington, Va.-based United Defense LP in October of
1997 for $850 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the company had contracts for the Army's main fleet of
armored infantry vehicles, an automated naval gun system and a Navy
missile-launching system. Among its potentially most lucrative contracts
was the one for the next generation of high-tech Army battlefield
artillery.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the company was losing money. The year after Carlyle bought it,
United Defense lost $122 million on $1.2 billion in revenue. But under
Carlyle's ownership, United Defense turned around; last year, it reported
a net profit of $18.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Critical to that turnaround was the future of the Crusader artillery
system.</TE>
<TE>   United Defense had started work on the Crusader in 1994. It is a
self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzer that fires ammunition the size of
scuba tanks farther, faster and more accurately than ever imagined, with
the killing power of 10 rounds per minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader reloads automatically from an armored sister vehicle, and
it uses millions of lines of computer code and battlefield intelligence
to pinpoint and strike enemy positions as far as 25 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The system was, and is, considered the most advanced and lethal
artillery on the globe.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the heaviest. At 110 tons, the Crusader was deemed far too
heavy for the rapidly deployable Army that will be needed to fight the
sudden and remote conflicts America will face, according to a
Pentagon-appointed National Defense Panel that sharply criticized the
Crusader in December 1997.</TE>
<TE>   That report fed into what is now the lead edge in post-Cold War
Pentagon planning: To transform the U.S. armed forces into a slim, trim
fighting force that can move halfway around the globe in a matter of
hours and fight in conditions like the Afghan campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And the Crusader, the panel concluded, was anything but mobile.</TE>
<TE>   "Crusader was the gleam in somebody's eye in the later years of the
Cold War," said Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington and a member of the
1997 Defense Panel.</TE>
<TE>   But Krepinevich, who has testified against the Crusader on Capitol
Hill in the years since that report, added: "For something so heavy and
hard to move as Crusader, it certainly has been a hard target to hit on
the Hill. They've done a remarkable job in keeping it alive."</TE>
<TE>   Here's how:</TE>
<TE>   About the time the Carlyle Group bought United Defense, the United
Defense LP Employees Political Action Committee registered with the
Federal Election Commission. Since then, that committee has contributed
more than $300,000 to several dozen legislators who have been key
supporters of the Crusader and other Pentagon weapon systems that United
Defense supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the legislators who received the money have other
interests in pushing United Defense's agenda: jobs and commerce in their
home states or districts.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Republican Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., for example, has been one of
the Crusader's staunchest supporters. Watts' district includes the
Crusader's Comanche County assembly and testing facility. Watts also has
received $7,000 in contributions from the United Defense PAC.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) has received $10,000 from the same PAC.
Pennsylvania is home to a United Defense plant in York. In October, he
praised the Senate's passage of an early version of the defense
authorization bill because it included $487 million for Crusader in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   And Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a GOP member of the House Appropriations
Committee, was among the Crusader's pioneering proponents, dating back to
the system's early development at the Picatinny Arsenal in
Frelinghuysen's New Jersey district. The company's PAC has contributed
$4,500 to his campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Such contributions are business as usual in the industry; larger
defense contractors lavish even greater sums on their congressional
supporters, FEC records show. Carlyle denies it played any role in
creating United Defense's PAC.</TE>
<TE>   United Defense spokesman Doug Coffey said the contributions are "not
anything that would be out of the norm." The PAC's creation, he said, was
timed not to the Crusader project but to the fact that United Defense
became an independent corporation allowed to make such contributions only
after Carlyle bought it.</TE>
<TE>   "The contributions are primarily made to congressional members in
areas where we have facilities," Coffey said. "And the total amount is
nothing very extraordinary in the defense industry."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making its case on Capitol Hill, United Defense sought
to answer Pentagon worries. The company redesigned the Crusader--and in
record time. Its engineers took 20 tons off the system's weight, making
it light enough to rapidly deploy two of them on a C-17 transport
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The Army also cut its order to 480 from more than 1,100 Crusader
systems, reducing the program's overall cost to a projected $11 billion.
And ever since, a succession of Army chiefs of staff have argued
passionately for the program as an essential, leading-edge tool for its
battlefield readiness in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Some independent analysts are impressed. John Pike, who runs the
defense watchdog group GlobalSecurity.com, said he believes the Army will
need an advanced artillery system, which he called "the king of battle,
the thing that kills half the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   But Krepinevich and others remain unconvinced. Given that future
conflicts more likely will resemble Afghanistan than the Gulf War, he
said: "over time, Crusader becomes less and less attractive. . . . Nobody
wants to fight the American military out in the open anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Krepinevich concluded that the system nonetheless has survived because
"there's a high level of support by United Defense, No. 1; No. 2, by the
[congressional] members whose constituents are affected by the health of
United Defense. Then, you've got the Army. This kind of artillery system
pacifies the traditional culture of the Army while it is transitioning to
a lighter, more modern force.</TE>
<TE>   "And there simply isn't the same kind of intensity on Capitol Hill to
cancel projects like Crusader, especially in times of bigger defense
budgets."</TE>
<TE>Carlyle Officials Seek to Sell United Defense</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle officials say their strategy is to keep companies for three to
five years and then sell them. Defense industry sources said Carlyle was
trying to market United Defense as early as a year ago but had no takers.
Carlyle officials confirm they were looking for an "exit strategy" from
their ownership of United Defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically didn't have options," said Stuart McCutchan, who edits
the Virginia-based Defense Mergers &amp; Acquisitions newsletter. "What has
happened in the last two or three months has given them an option. The
public becomes the buyer."</TE>
<TE>   And Carlyle's timing was impeccable.</TE>
<TE>   First came the Bush administration's proposed 2002 defense budget. The
document landed in Congress in June 2001, and it included an 11% hike in
defense spending, including full funding for the Crusader.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by the good news and the prospects for the company, Carlyle
took its first dividends from United Defense on Aug. 13: $289.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-nine days later, the two hijacked airliners slammed into the
World Trade Center towers, while another hit the Pentagon. President Bush
declared war on terrorism, defense industry stocks were suddenly hot and,
just five weeks later, Carlyle was ready to take United Defense
Industries public.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 22, United Defense filed its stock-offering prospectus with
the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have generated strong
Congressional support for increased defense spending," the prospectus
declared. "We believe that domestic and international defense spending
will grow over the next several years as a result of an increased focus
on national security by the U.S. government and its allies."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Carlyle took $92 million more in dividends out of
United Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Dec. 13, the Defense Authorization Bill passed both the House
and Senate, with full funding for the Crusader, just one day before
United Defense went public. United Defense's president and chief
executive, Thomas Rabaut, even got invited to ring the opening bell at
the New York Stock Exchange that day.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle Managing Director Allan Holt explained: "The decision to take
United Defense public was a function of the performance of the company,
the outlook for its programs in the defense budget and the receptiveness
of the market to defense equity offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an obligation to try to achieve the best returns for our
investors."</TE>
<TE>   And they did.</TE>
<TE>   By the closing bell, Carlyle, which still controls 54% of United
Defense, had sold more than 11 million of its shares in the company for a
total of $237 million. United Defense raised an additional $163 million
from the sale of about 9 million new shares.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the company's stock, which Carlyle and United Defense
opened at $19 a share Dec. 14, was trading for nearly $21.</TE>

<HD>Plane Crash Kills 7 Marines in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Afghans release three high Taliban officials in a day of
setbacks for Pentagon.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. refueling plane crashed into a mountain in Pakistan, killing
all seven Marines aboard Wednesday in a day of setbacks for the Pentagon
that included the release--despite U.S. protests--of three top Taliban
officials by their Afghan captors.</LD>
<LD>   As workers made their way toward the wreckage of the KC-130 tanker,
witnesses described flames rising from the crash site near Pakistan's
border with Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Defense officials said the incident is under investigation but
appeared to be the result of an accident rather than enemy fire.</LD>
<TE>   "It is a tough, dangerous business over there," Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said. "They're doing difficult things, and they're
doing them darned well, and it just breaks your heart."</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, the Pentagon identified the victims as Capt. Matthew
W. Bancroft, 29, of Redding, Calif., the command pilot; Capt. Daniel G.
McCollum, 29, of Richland, S.C., the co-pilot; Gunnery Sgt. Stephen L.
Bryson, 36, of Montgomery, Ala.; Staff Sgt. Scott N. Germosen, 37, of
Queens, N.Y.; Sgt. Nathan P. Hays, 21, of Lincoln, Wash.; Lance Cpl.
Bryan P. Bertrand, 23, of Coos Bay, Ore.; and Sgt. Jeannette L. Winters,
25, of DuPage County, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush offered his support for the Marines' loved ones. "Our
hearts and prayers go out to the families of the soldiers," he said. "But
I want to remind them that the cause that we are now engaged in is just
and noble. The cause is freedom. And this nation will not rest until
we've achieved our objectives."</TE>
<TE>   The tanker crash occurred as an Afghan warlord negotiated the
hand-over of seven Taliban leaders who had surrendered, then confiscated
their weapons and vehicles and sent them home, despite Washington's
repeated requests that ranking Taliban members be handed over to U.S.
control.</TE>
<TE>   The released Taliban members included three top officials: the
much-feared justice minister, Nooruddin Turabi; Defense Minister Mullah
Obaidulla; and the minister of mines and industry, Mullah Saadudin Sayed.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon would have liked to have added them to the 368
pro-Taliban soldiers in U.S. custody as of Wednesday: 306 in Kandahar; 38
at Bagram air base north of the capital, Kabul; 16 in the northern city
of Mazar-i-Sharif; and eight aboard the amphibious assault ship Bataan.
Nearly all are expected to be sent soon to the U.S. naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they could appear before military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, individuals of that stature in the Taliban leadership are
of great interest to the United States, and we would expect them to be
turned over," Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, had said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: "We
have said before that we believe that senior Taliban officials should be
taken into custody. We would expect that to be the case with these
individuals. And I'm sure we'll be looking into this matter further."</TE>
<TE>   The incident again revealed a difference in priorities between Afghans
and Americans. Senior Pentagon officials have privately complained that
their Afghan counterparts either have apparently cut surrender deals that
explicitly allow Taliban leaders to escape or have simply looked the
other way as the enemies, in some cases fellow ethnic tribesmen, flee.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, U.S. officials were told that Afghan warlords had negotiated
the surrender of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, only to find that
he was not among those who gave themselves up. A 14-year-old boy blamed
for the death of Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Ross Chapman last week also
escaped his Afghan captors.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly aware of U.S. consternation over the latest release, Afghan
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Samad said Wednesday night that the
interim government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai is investigating the
circumstances of the surrender. But he reiterated the interim
government's stand that not all members of the Taliban regime should be
subject to interrogation by other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Although many U.S. troops are now focused on detaining and
interrogating prisoners, fighter jets kept up their attacks on an
expansive underground cave and bunker complex in mountainous Zhawar Kili
al Badr in eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The air war continued amid growing evidence of insecurity and
instability in many parts of the country. Karzai issued a dramatic order
seemingly designed to reassure increasingly nervous residents of Kabul of
their safety and also assert his new government's authority. He ordered
all armed men--thousands of whom stand listlessly on street corners of
the capital, AK-47s slung over their shoulders--to leave the city and
return to their barracks on the outskirts of Kabul within 72 hours or
face arrest.</TE>
<TE>   In November, negotiations near Bonn, Germany, strongly recommended
such a move. But the interim government had resisted, fearing an uprising
and saying there weren't enough barracks to house all the armed
men--soldiers once loyal to a variety of warlords, and many now with
little oversight as they patrol the capital.</TE>
<TE>   British peacekeepers leading the International Security Assistance
Force in Kabul were seen throughout the city Wednesday. One unit
responded to a false alarm about possible unexploded ordnance near the
Kabul River, while another was spotted near the homes of several ranking
government officials, patrolling in tandem with Afghan troops.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the tanker crash, airborne accidents have killed more
Americans than enemy fire. Before Wednesday's incident, 10 Americans had
died in the Afghan conflict; two of the deaths were a result of enemy
action.</TE>
<TE>   The troops aboard the tanker were apparently from one of a few Marine
units stationed in the region. Those in the region include 2,000 members
of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Pendleton, who sailed
from San Diego on Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The KC-130 Hercules tankers used by the Marines can refuel jets and
helicopters in flight or on the ground. They are also used to drop cargo
and paratroopers and can land on short airstrips.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, a Viking sea patrol aircraft made a crash landing
on the carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the northern Arabian Sea after its
landing gear collapsed. No one was injured.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Launches a Criminal Probe of Enron</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A Justice Department task force will investigate potential
illegal acts by the firm and its officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is launching a
wide-ranging criminal investigation of Enron Corp., whose sudden collapse
shredded billions of investor dollars and cost thousands of jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Justice officials took the rare step of disclosing the existence of
the criminal investigation, saying they will create a task force at
department headquarters that will bring in federal prosecutors from
Houston, New York, San Francisco "and probably other places" to work with
senior administrators in Washington, one department official said.</LD>
<LD>   "We usually don't discuss investigations, but this is a case of
national significance," said the Justice Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   "It is like the Microsoft case in that regard--a national case," added
the official, referring to the high-profile civil antitrust probe of the
Redmond, Wash.-based software giant. "Because of the diversity of
[Enron's corporate] offices, we wanted to centralize the investigation in
order to coordinate efforts on all fronts."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation signals further trouble for Houston-based Enron,
once the world's largest energy trading firm. Enron, a darling of Wall
Street, saw its value plummet in just a few weeks last year, culminating
Dec. 2 in the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's collapse threw thousands of people out of work and cost
them--and investors--billions of dollars. Employees were blocked from
selling shares in their retirement accounts because Enron was in the
middle of switching plan administrators. But top company executives
previously had sold their company shares at hefty profits.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said they want to know whether there is
any criminal culpability on the part of corporate officers and others.
The points of inquiry will include whether the company knew about
problems but never disclosed them and whether key financial records were
altered, as well as other potentially illegal acts, the department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The head of accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor,
testified last month before a congressional panel that Andersen warned
Enron directors that the energy company might be guilty of "possible
illegal acts" for withholding key financial information from Andersen
auditors. Enron sharply disputed the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal insider trading by Enron executives and directors was alleged
in a lawsuit filed last month by a bank that manages union retirement
funds. Amalgamated Bank accused company executives of using inside
information to sell stock and reap $1.1 billion in profits.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department investigation could take years to conclude and
involve hundreds of subpoenas, depositions, interviews and a complete
scouring of the firm's financial records, authorities said Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>Course of Inquiry Garners Approval</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo said President Bush had been
briefed on the investigation Wednesday and supported it.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is concerned about Enron's bankruptcy and thinks it's
important and appropriate for relevant government agencies to investigate
as they see fit," Mamo said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron referred inquiries to its Washington lawyer, Robert S. Bennett,
whose clients have included former President Clinton. Bennett said he is
glad the Justice Department has consolidated what appeared to be separate
inquiries from various offices.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to fully comply with this investigation," Bennett said.
"It's important that the Washington scandal machine not take over, which
would have as a consequence that every move would be politicized and the
facts would be trivialized."</TE>
<TE>   The probe will be headed by the Justice Department's criminal division
with assistance from its civil fraud unit and investigators from the FBI,
other federal law enforcement agencies and perhaps the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Justice Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Enron is embroiled in several lawsuits and is the subject of
congressional investigations as well as probes by the SEC and the Labor
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former Justice Department officials characterized the
investigation as significant and somewhat unprecedented in that "main
Justice" task force probes are usually saved for national issues such as
the rash of church arson fires in recent years and the flurry of failures
of savings and loans in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual. In the recent past, I am hard pressed to come up with
another task force looking into a single entity or individual," said Eric
H. Holder Jr., deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. "It
is clearly an indication that the department is taking this very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   "One of things you can certainly draw from this is that some threshold
has been crossed and clearly there is some belief that there is a
predicate for a wide-ranging investigation," Holder said. "It is a
reflection of, and an indication of, the complexity and breadth of the
case."</TE>
<TE>   Another former senior Justice Department official familiar with such
task force investigations said that "running this out of 'main Justice'
suggests that it is something that is so large and so wide-ranging that
they know they are going to have a hard time getting their arms around
it."</TE>
<TE>Dramatic Rise, Fall of Power Firm</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Justice Department investigators have been involved in
preliminary inquiries into the Enron collapse, asking questions,
conducting interviews and deliberating over whether a full-scale
investigation was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials would not say when the decision was made
to launch the full-scale probe, or whether Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft was
involved in those deliberations. And they said such an investigation does
not necessarily indicate a belief that criminal wrongdoing was committed,
only that the issue merits a thorough review.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it is likely that a federal grand jury will be used
to issue subpoenas and, later, to hear testimony.</TE>
<TE>   One former Justice Department official said all actions of the
company's executives will come under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "What did senior officials know about the downfall of the company in
advance that led to them divest themselves when the rest of the company
was locked in?" asked the official. "What kind of cooking of the books
was done, if any? Did they mislead employees, investors and Wall Street
about how solid the company was financially?"</TE>
<TE>   Enron's fall was even more dramatic than its aggressive push to the
top of the energy industry. Its stock traded for $90 a share in late 2000
but on Wednesday sold for a mere 79 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   From its roots as a small natural gas pipeline operator, Enron grew to
become the world's largest energy-trading operation. Until a few months
ago, it was handling one of four wholesale deals for electricity, gas and
other energy products.</TE>
<TE>   Enron championed the deregulation of energy markets and tried to
influence the way California structured its energy markets and then
steered through its electricity crisis. Enron and its chairman, Kenneth
L. Lay, wielded enormous political influence, pushing to successfully
replace the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and aiding
in shaping the Bush administration's energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney or members of his energy task force met
with Enron executives six times last year, according to a White House
letter released Tuesday. Enron's financial problems were not discussed,
the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron began to crumble in mid-October when it revealed surprise losses
from bad investments in telecommunications and water ventures as well as
a $1.2-billion drop in shareholder equity associated with partnerships
run by company employees.</TE>
<TE>   Enron then admitted that, after accounting for losses in other
off-balance-sheet partnerships, it had overstated its financial strength
and that investors should no longer rely on more than four years of
income and other financial data.</TE>
<TE>   Investors fled Enron, and the company ran into a massive cash crunch
that led it to seek a rescue from its smaller rival and Houston neighbor
Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy later pulled the plug on its $9-billion merger with Enron,
saying the company had not revealed the depth of its financial problems.
Enron then filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, citing more than $31 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 11 allows a company to continue operating while it works out a
plan to pay its creditors. Enron is expected to auction its core
energy-trading business this week and has agreed to let Dynegy buy a
valuable natural gas pipeline.</TE>

<HD>Leader of Hells Angels Makes Bail, Is Freed</HD>
<DH>Courts: George Christie Jr., facing narcotics charges, leaves jail
after a judge allows him to use real estate belonging to friends to post
his $2-million bond.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly a year in custody, Hells Angels leader George Christie
Jr. walked out of Ventura County Jail on Wednesday morning when a judge
ruled he could use $2 million in property put up by supporters to post
bail.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, who will remain under house arrest until his trial on drug
and racketeering charges, left carrying a plastic bag with his personal
possessions. He was greeted by his girlfriend, Nikki Nicoletto.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great," Christie said. "I feel like a million dollars."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, $1 million was the bail amount set after the 54-year-old
biker's arrest last February on charges that he allegedly ran a narcotics
ring that peddled prescription drugs to high school students in Ojai and
Ventura. He is charged with fraud, tax evasion, firearms possession,
selling drugs to minors and the use of a street gang in a criminal
conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also obtained indictments against his ex-wife, their
25-year-old son and two dozen Hells Angels members and associates.
Several have already pleaded guilty to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   But Christie denies the allegations and his attorneys have fought for
his release for months so he could help prepare for trial. They argued
unsuccessfully for a bail reduction and took the issue before the
appellate court, but were rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Then they turned to his friends.</TE>
<TE>   Four men and one woman--all with ties to the Hells Angels--offered
equity in their homes and other real estate for use as bail.</TE>
<TE>   During a series of recent hearings, prosecutors raised concerns about
the source of money behind those properties. But Superior Court Judge
Barry Klopfer concluded all the real estate was obtained legitimately and
he allowed the defense to use it for bail.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, defense attorneys presented title reports and promissory
notes for 10 properties pledged toward Christie's $2-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   By law, Christie was required to put up twice the amount of bail
because he secured the bond with property instead of cash. The defense
was required to turn over documentation verifying the value of the
properties at Wednesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Satisfied with the documentation, Klopfer ordered Christie
released--with conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Christie must remain under house arrest in his Ventura residence.</TE>
<TE>   He is also being equipped with an electronic monitoring bracelet and
will only be allowed to leave home for court appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Additional bail conditions require that he surrender his passport,
submit to random police searches and have no contact with Hells Angels
members or associates.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Patrick Reardon said in court that his client was
prepared to comply, but he indicated that the defense may seek a future
hearing to modify those conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Reardon said Christie was "ecstatic" to finally
be released after 11 months behind bars and was eager to see his elderly
mother, Georgia, who is gravely ill.</TE>
<TE>   Christie and his lawyers will now turn their attention to the criminal
case and potential negotiations with the district attorney's office,
Reardon said.</TE>
<TE>   "George Christie doesn't sell drugs to schoolchildren, I can tell you
that," the attorney said. "Now he is out. Now he can help his defense
team address the charges against him."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are searching for two men suspected in a drive-by
shooting that left a Canoga Park high school student dead.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Urquidi, 17, died Tuesday afternoon at Northridge Hospital
Medical Center, an hour after he was shot in the chest while standing in
front of West Valley Leadership Academy Community Education Center, an
alternative school for at-risk teens and those on probation, Los Angeles
Police Det. Rick Swanston said.</LD>
<LD>   Swanston said the two men, believed to be between 18 and 20 years old,
were in a silver Ford F-150 pickup truck with a white, metal toolbox in
its bed.</LD>
<TE>   Before the shooting, the men were in a fight with two students near
the school, Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   Urquidi, a high school junior, had been in the program since it opened
a year ago, a county education office spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Police Official Apologizes for His Remarks</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: David Keith tells the City Council he regrets calling
officers 'equal opportunity' shooters in five deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the parents of a slain Oxnard man listened, a police spokesman
who had publicly described Oxnard officers as "equal opportunity"
shooters apologized for "poor judgment" and said he did not mean to
demean their son.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesman David Keith, speaking to the Oxnard City Council and a crowd
of 200 Tuesday evening, offered his "sincere apologies" to the council,
the Police Department and "most importantly, the family of [Robert]
Jones. No malice whatsoever was intended."</LD>
<LD>   In a neighborhood meeting last September, a month after police shot
the black artist, Keith noted the race of five police homicide victims
and of the officers involved, then said the shootings were "equal
opportunity."</LD>
<TE>   "I was trying to dispel any thought that these incidents were racially
motivated," Keith told the City Council. "I certainly regret making these
statements."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' mother and stepfather, Ida and Steve Perkins, declined to
comment on the apology.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still very much a fresh wound to the family," said attorney
Gabriella Navarro Busch, who represents them. "But I can say they were
very touched by the show of support by the community, and it really
warmed their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   The Perkinses flew in from Oregon, where they moved after Jones'
slaying, to join local community groups in a protest of Keith's comments
and his suggestions the 23-year-old may have been on drugs when he was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers for black and Latino groups told the council Tuesday
it should be more involved in the city's law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Greg Ramirez, who spoke for the local Mexican American Bar
Assn., said the council should take a forceful leadership role with the
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "When something is wrong, you've got to stand up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez accused police of distorting the truth about Jones' shooting
and attempting to blemish his reputation by making inaccurate statements
that he had a criminal record. Jones had been acquitted of resisting
arrest. A weapons possession charge was pending when he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to condemn a practice," Ramirez said, "essentially a
character assassination of the person who was shot, to justify the
shooting."</TE>
<TE>   He challenged the council to sanction Keith or stand guilty of
ratifying his conduct.</TE>
<TE>   John Hatcher, president of the local chapter of the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People, and David Rodriquez of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, also asked the council to act on Keith's
comments and the spate of police shootings in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Redirect the leadership of the Police Department or change it,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was shot Aug. 24 during a standoff in his north Oxnard home. His
mother had called police to take the distraught and severely depressed
young man to a hospital for treatment. Police said Jones was shot because
he was brandishing a 13-inch knife and had moved toward officers after
they entered his bedroom and opened a closet where he was hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said he wasn't pressured by his superiors to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said he considered the apology heartfelt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very unfortunate comment," Lopez said. "But we are all
human. He made a mistake and he acknowledged it."</TE>
<TE>   Keith did not apologize for comments he made at the same September
community meeting suggesting Jones may have been high on the drug PCP.
Toxicology tests found no illegal drugs in Jones' system.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he would reserve judgment on that issue until he reviews a
transcript of Keith's comments. The transcript was prepared for Ramirez,
who was initially the Perkinses' lawyer but has handed off the case
because of a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The transcript shows Keith had stated repeatedly that the department
did not know whether Jones was on PCP. But Keith also said Jones acted
like someone under the influence of drugs. He said Jones showed no
effects when twice doused with pepper spray and was not slowed much after
being shot twice with a beanbag shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, you think of PCP and things like that when someone doesn't
react to those kinds of things," Keith said, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said he does not believe police used pepper spray, since the
coroner's report makes no mention of finding the noxious substance on
Jones' skin or clothing.</TE>
<TE>   When the Police Department's investigation of the shooting is
completed, the results will be given to the district attorney's office.
The district attorney found the other four shootings in 2001 were
justified.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI are
also conducting inquiries into Jones' death.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Jones killing, Lopez vowed to better train his
department to avoid fatal confrontations with mentally ill people.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Oxnard officers finished a 40-hour training course in December.
Twenty to 25 of his department's 200 officers eventually will be trained,
Lopez said, ensuring that at least one officer will be on duty at all
times with expertise in defusing potentially deadly showdowns with
disturbed people.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 3 Years for Disability Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man who received thousands of dollars in disability pay
while working as a security guard and training to be a police officer was
sentenced Wednesday to three years in state prison, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Rene Pilon, 42, was convicted of 14 counts of workers'
compensation fraud stemming from events after his termination from a
Santa Barbara security company in February 1999.</LD>
<LD>   After being fired, Pilon filed a disability request with his former
employer, claiming he had been injured in January 1999 when he was hit on
the head with a coffee mug while responding to a disturbance call.</LD>
<TE>   In total, Pilon was paid $48,300 in disability benefits and medical
costs, said Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Leventhal.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy just invented this claim to get back at his employer,"
Leventhal said.</TE>
<TE>   During the time Pilon was receiving disability pay, he was working as
a full-time security guard in Los Angeles and attending a police academy
in Whittier, Leventhal said.</TE>
<TE>   State authorities discovered the bogus claim when Pilon filed for
disability benefits again after breaking his leg while trying to scale a
fence during training at the police academy.</TE>
<TE>   Pilon, who also was ordered to repay the money, claimed his injuries
were real and that he had seen at least seven doctors for head, neck and
back pain and had undergone physical therapy.</TE>

<HD>It's Swell Time to Call In Sick as First Big Waves of Year Hit
Coast</HD>
<DH>Weather: A Pacific Northwest storm produces 12-foot breakers, and
boarders bypass work to take advantage of them. Tide floods campgrounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ankle deep in Pacific Ocean foam, Ron Zachow tucked his surfboard
under his arm and wiped a thick froth of saltwater from his goatee.</LD>
<LD>   Zachow was one of the few hearty souls who battled choppy seas and
churning currents Wednesday in their quest to ride the first big waves of
2002 along the Ventura County coast.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like being a salmon swimming up river," the 37-year-old Zachow
said as he emerged from four hours of riding waves in the crashing surf
between Emma Wood State Beach and the Rincon. "It's the kind of day where
you're glad it's not your third day ever on a surfboard. I was nervous
and I've been surfing for 20 years."</LD>
<TE>   Sets as big as 12 feet were reported off several stretches of the
county coastline Wednesday but had tapered off by early evening,
according to the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   High tides flooded several campgrounds, and in some areas near Faria
Beach, homeowners hired bulldozers to push back muddy sand washed up by
the tide and the high waves.</TE>
<TE>   The high surf, which began pounding local beaches Tuesday, was stirred
up by a large winter storm off the Pacific Northwest coast.</TE>
<TE>   As the storm moves east, waves of 4 to 6 feet will continue to hit
shore break points at least through the weekend, said Bruce Rockwell of
the National Weather Service in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not been a day for amateurs," Rockwell said of the
surfing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The skies will remain mostly clear through Sunday with daytime highs
along the coast in the upper 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Inland Ventura County will experience a warming trend that could see
80 degree temperatures in some areas by the weekend, Rockwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with clear skies and a bright sun, few boaters ventured beyond
the rocky breakwater at Ventura Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   One who did was Dave Delano of Vessel Assist, who was trying out a new
fiberglass boat.</TE>
<TE>   "We got airborne going over the first wave," said Delano, who operates
a boat towing service from a dock near the entrance to the harbor. "It's
nasty out there."</TE>
<TE>   Zachow and others hungry for high surf took a different approach
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We follow the big waves," said Matt Rapf, who drove up the coast from
Malibu with Zachow to catch the big sets. "You have a lot of people
calling in sick today."</TE>
<TE>   As the two friends were finishing up for the day, Ventura freelance
writer Ted Reckas was about to paddle to breakers crashing near a reef
about half a mile from shore.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the year, wave riding along the Ventura Coast is just average,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the winter months, a dedicated surfer willing to paddle out to
a remote spot far from lifeguards or other people can bank on the some of
the best waves on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets strong and disorderly," Reckas said as he waded into the
surf. "It's complete chaos."</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't waiting around to take advantage of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the surf is big, but tomorrow it could be back to 2 feet."</TE>

<LD>Alarmed by gang shootings in the west San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine said Wednesday he has approached
Sheriff Lee Baca about providing deputies to augment the LAPD's policing
there.</LD>
<LD>   Zine, a former LAPD sergeant who has publicly feuded with Chief
Bernard Parks, said the force is badly depleted and Baca told him that
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has the resources to expand
into areas that need policing.</LD>
<LD>   But Baca downplayed any serious discussions with Zine about patrolling
Los Angeles Police Department territory, and Mayor James K. Hahn said he
does not support the proposal.</LD>
<TE>   "Rather than focusing efforts on that, I prefer to focus on
recruitment and retention of officers at the LAPD and addressing crime in
Los Angeles," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said the discussion took place at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's much ado about nothing," Baca said. "He said, 'If I
can't get my constituents served [by the LAPD], then I may have to
consider how contracting would work.' "</TE>
<TE>   Baca said he explained to Zine how the process works and that the
department has had similar contracts with other cities. But he added that
it is a lengthy process that requires careful study.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, "You can't do this without the will of the people
of the city and the mayor and the council."</TE>
<TE>   Baca said, "In the end, I said this is not very possible."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, who represents the West Valley, admitted the idea is "out of the
box" thinking and in the early stages of study, but if found to be
feasible, he envisions deputies complementing LAPD patrols in gang hot
spots.</TE>
<TE>   He cited an explosion of gang graffiti and violence in the West
Valley, including the shooting death Tuesday of a 16-year-old boy outside
an education center in Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not hiring police officers at the rate we need to, and we have
an exploding crime problem," Zine said. "I had two shootings in my
district in the last week, and one kid's dead. I can't sit by and let
that happen."</TE>
<TE>   A police spokesman said Parks had no direct comment on Zine's idea,
but it was clear that department officials felt they do not need help
from the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "Policing of the city of Los Angeles is the responsibility of the
LAPD," Lt. Horace Frank said. "Our No. 1 goal is public safety and we are
going to do everything at our disposal to meet that goal."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we are staffed fine," said LAPD Capt. Jim Cansler, commanding
officer for the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Zine is a former director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League,
which has embarked on a campaign of criticism aimed at preventing a
contract extension when Parks' term expires this year.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman recently sparked controversy by referring to Parks as
"Osama bin Parks" and was at odds with the chief as an officer in 1999
when a disciplinary board acquitted Zine of sexual harassment charges.</TE>
<TE>   Zine denied his proposal is meant as criticism of the chief or
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a crisis, a crime problem in the city," he said. "I'm just
asking, can we use the sheriff as an immediate solution to the lack of
patrol officers?"</TE>

<HD>History Was What Car Designer Made It</HD>
<DH>Automobiles: The vast memorabilia collection of late GM 'director
of styling' is acquired by Nethercutt Museum in Sylmar for $75,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even when shopping for a new car, most people dump the advertising
brochure as soon as the salesman turns his back. But the late David R.
Holls, a well-known car designer, was an avid collector of car-related
materials.</LD>
<LD>   Ten thousand of Holls' catalogs, owner's manuals, pamphlets,
brochures, clippings and other items have been acquired by the Nethercutt
Collection and Museum, along with more than 9,000 of his car-related
photos.</LD>
<LD>   The Sylmar complex is home to more than 200 antique and classic cars
and a large collection of mechanized musical instruments.</LD>
<TE>   "David Holls was director of styling for General Motors, and, before
he passed away, he amassed a wonderful, wonderful collection of
automotive sales and advertising literature and photographs," said Skip
Marketti, 62, the Nethercutt's archivist and curator.</TE>
<TE>   Holls died in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, on June
16, 2000, at age 69.</TE>
<TE>   Marketti, who occasionally served as a judge with Holls at car shows,
said Holls' widow, Patricia, had contacted the museum to say the
collection was available. The Nethercutt paid $75,000 for the written
material. And Patricia Holls donated the photographs--about 9,300 images,
Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   To show how useful such material can be, Marketti opened a 1940
brochure for high-end Buicks. Its illustrations included an artist's
notion of a typical Buick owner, draped in furs, opening a divider window
to speak to a chauffeur.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to such brochures, Marketti said, "When we restore a Buick from
this era, we know exactly what the upholstery pattern looked like, and
the door pockets and the wood grain."</TE>
<TE>   The David R. Holls Automotive Literature and Photo Collection will be
available to historians, writers, restorers and others, Marketti said.
The creation of Merle Norman Cosmetics co-founder J.B. Nethercutt, the
museum is open to the public without charge.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Adler, editor in chief of Car Collector magazine, said he knew
Holls for many years and often dipped into the designer's extensive
collection when researching books or articles.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave knew personally all of the great auto designers of the 20th
century," Adler said. Holls was friendly with such design giants as
Howard "Dutch" Darrin, whose 1930s Darrin Packards were favorites of
Clark Gable and other stars, and Gordon Buerhrig, creator of the
coffin-nosed Cords of 1936 and 1937, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holls collected material on both American and foreign cars, with an
emphasis on automobiles from the 1920s through the 1950s, Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you could name, he could pull out a binder and there, neatly
filed, was everything you wanted to know about the subject," Adler said.</TE>
<TE>   As a designer, Holls was perhaps best known for the 1959 Cadillac. The
design was wonderfully outrageous, Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   "It had the tallest tail fins ever used on a car," Marketti said. "It
was long and low and totally bedecked with chrome--it was over the top.
It was the ultimate styling statement of the '50s."</TE>
<TE>   Other Holls designs include the 1964 Buick Riviera, the 1967 Camaro
and the Oldsmobile Aurora--very different from each other but all great
looking in their own way, Marketti said. He speculated that Holls got his
"swoopy sense of style" from the great French coach builders of the
1920s, whom he admired.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Ema, who collects Duesenbergs and other classic cars in Orange,
said support material such as Holls' is invaluable to historians and to
people who collect and restore classic cars.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more of these things are being discarded by the
manufacturers," Ema said. "The things he saved may be the only stuff
that's left. We don't know."</TE>
<TE>   David Gooding, president and chief executive of Beverly Hills-based RM
Auctions, which specializes in antique and classic cars, said such
material can be used to authenticate cars for purchase and to assist
those preparing cars to show.</TE>
<TE>   "The best things are good photos," Gooding said. "Good photographs
don't lie."</TE>

<HD>Drive Launched to Save Jewish Center</HD>
<DH>Rally: Committee tells emergency gathering that $120,000 is needed
to keep Sherman Oaks facility open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to keep the Sherman Oaks Jewish community center open, 150
people who attended an emergency fund-raising rally Wednesday were urged
to help collect $120,000.</LD>
<LD>   The center's advisory board hopes raising the money will prompt the
Jewish Federation of Los Angeles to keep the Valley Cities Jewish
Community Center open for at least a year after the slated June closure.</LD>
<LD>   The umbrella group announced in December that it would close five of
its seven facilities, including the Sherman Oaks location.</LD>
<TE>'We Cannot Sit Back and Wait'</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot sit back and wait for some angel to do it for us," said
Michael Brezner, an advisory committee member at the center. "We're
trying to get people to think forward rather than pointing fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Those attending the meeting received donation envelopes.</TE>
<TE>   The centers have provided adult education and teen programs for area
families for more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley center in West Hills will remain open, as will the
Westside facility on Olympic Boulevard, where officials have promised an
$8-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Financial woes and a 30% drop in membership have cut available
funding, prompting the federation to use the other centers' deeds as
collateral for its $3-million loan to their program.</TE>
<TE>   The Sherman Oaks center's committee hopes to sign contracts to run the
after-school program and some educational programs and raise another
$120,000 throughout this year.</TE>
<TE>   The center, which has 80 children enrolled in its child education, is
licensed to handle 150. Committee members hope bumping up enrollment will
provide much of the needed funds.</TE>
<TE>Protest Against Jewish Federation</TE>
<TE>   A Wednesday morning protest drew a dozen people to the Wilshire
Boulevard headquarters of the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, an
umbrella group that supports the centers and 14 other Jewish agencies,
said David Novak, Jewish Community Centers spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Cuts Part of Davis' Budget for Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Despite spending increase, higher costs mean $487
million less for programs some educators call extras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is set to unveil a state budget today that slightly
increases school spending, but still requires $487 million in education
cuts to cover the rising cost of teaching public school students.</LD>
<LD>   Most areas of state government are not expected to fare even that
well.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace, a Democrat from El
Cajon, predicted that Davis would offer a combination of $4 billion to $5
billion in cuts and an equal amount in borrowing and new revenue,
including counting on more money from the federal government, to make up
a projected $12-billion budget shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Davis continued to say he opposes raising taxes as a way
to help close that gap, but he also left open the possibility that there
would be a tax increase as part of a final budget package.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't anticipate that taxes will be raised," he said. "I don't
believe the situation warrants new taxes."</TE>
<TE>   But when he was pressed on whether he was ruling out increasing taxes
this year, Davis said: "It doesn't make sense to get into these
rhetorical games."</TE>
<TE>   The school cuts will enable Davis, a Democrat, to cover the rising
cost of educating schoolchildren in the 2002-03 fiscal year--a key
priority for many members of the education community who use the
discretionary dollars to pay for teacher salaries, new students and
school maintenance, among other priorities.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Davis proposed</TE>
<TE>   cutting $1.2 billion from education as part of a larger package aimed
at narrowing the state's budget shortfall. The additional $487 million in
cuts outlined Wednesday would bring the total 18-month reduction to
nearly $1.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The new targets include a safety training program for school bus
drivers, independent studies programs, and portions of a teacher training
program for math and reading. Trimming or delaying spending on those
three proposals alone would free up about $190 million, the
administration says.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan Davis will unveil today earmarks $53.9 billion for
kindergarten through 12th-grade education, $200 million more than
approved this year, not counting the cuts proposed in November.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes $1.2 billion to cover the rising cost of holding
even--such as enrolling new students and giving employees cost-of-living
raises. That money is spent at the discretion of school officials, so
it's among their highest priorities in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Broken down by the amount spent on each student, the Davis budget
shows a slight increase: to $7,058 per student from $7,002 in the current
fiscal year, before the November cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we have kept the budget focused on our priority," said Kerry
Mazzoni, Davis' education secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is the governor's highest priority."</TE>
<TE>   Education officials gave Davis' school plan mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to see the cuts, but given the economic situation of
California we feel the governor had no other alternatives," said Wayne
Johnson of the California Teachers Assn. "The cuts are hurting programs
that a lot of our teachers like."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen McMahon, who oversees fiscal services in the Fountain Valley
School District, agreed that the cuts sting, but said this round is much
easier to take than that proposed last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "These programs are the extra things, rather than cutting at the heart
of what we do," he said. "We can all learn to live without extras. We had
to do it in the past, we can do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of Business
Officials, said the fact that education funding overall may actually rise
slightly is a good sign. "You come out of a situation like this whole.
It's a victory."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers, said
the Davis plan would not change the fundamental gap between teaching
salaries and entry-level wages in other professions.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that we're in a bad year, we need to say to
ourselves that we're in an underfunded system," Bergan said. "An increase
in [cost of living] is not enough. That assumes the base is adequate."</TE>
<TE>   The union plans to push for legislation that would cap the size of new
schools--both in square footage and in the number of students who attend
them--even though that would increase building costs.</TE>
<TE>   Other school advocates took issue with the Davis proposal to cut
programs for independent study--a form of home schooling with teacher
involvement--by 10%. The proposed reduction, according to administration
officials, is based on the assumption that it costs less to offer
independent study programs than their classroom-based counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Birdsall, a lobbyist for the California Consortium for
Independent Study, said that under state law the student-to-teacher ratio
is required to be the same for independent study programs as it is for
regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge problem," Birdsall said. "If you take away money,
you're taking away staff for those kids."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has proposed increasing funding for before- and after-school
programs by $75 million in 2002-03. The programs seek to keep kids out of
trouble by providing them with tutoring and recreational activities. The
increase will allow 79,000 more children to participate in the program,
for a total of 176,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for instructional materials will rise by about $20 million and
will be restructured to include a $250 million block grant and one-time
increases for language arts and library materials in addition to science
lab equipment for a total of $626 million.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials suggested Davis may make a proposal relating
to the state's $508 million annual contribution to the California State
Teachers' Retirement System.</TE>
<TE>   A group of state scientists filed suit in Sacramento Superior Court
this week seeking a reversal of an agreement reached between the Davis
administration and the California Public Employees' Regiment System; as
it stands, the agreement will allow the state to free up about $1 billion
by restructuring the state's contribution to the retirement fund.</TE>
<TE>   Davis appeared across from a construction site at UC Davis to release
some details of a proposal to sell $678 million in bonds to finance
construction primarily at state colleges and universities. If it's
approved by the Legislature, Davis said, his plan will speed the start of
several public works projects and create jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Legislature had approved the construction projects as
part of last year's budget.</TE>

<HD>Fired Nuclear Worker Held in Threats</HD>
<DH>Security: O.C. man, a former San Onofre employee, is accused of
saying he'd use his weapons cache to 'whack a bunch of people.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fired worker at the San Onofre nuclear power plant who has a
history of disputes with his bosses has been arrested for allegedly
threatening to draw on his cache of weapons to attack former co-workers
at the facility.</LD>
<LD>   When they arrested David L. Reza, 44, on Tuesday evening, Orange
County sheriff's deputies uncovered more than 250 weapons--including
antique rifles and empty hand grenades--as well as 5,000 rounds of
ammunition at his Laguna Niguel home and a storage locker he rented.
Authorities said they also found a small amount of cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   While Reza's girlfriend and others said he was a known collector who
would "talk your ear off about guns and his collection," sheriff's
officials said the weaponry included an illegal light anti-tank rocket
launcher and at least seven other illegal weapons.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation was sparked by an alleged threat made Friday by Reza
in a telephone conversation with a person investigators would identify
only as an employee of Southern California Edison, which operates the
plant.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was quoted as saying: "They have taken my job. They have taken my
life. I don't have anything to lose. I'm going to take my guns, go to San
Onofre and whack a bunch of people."</TE>
<TE>   The employee reported the conversation to Edison officials, who
alerted sheriff's deputies Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We considered it a realistic threat," Assistant Sheriff George
Jaramillo said. "He may be just an avid gun collector. It may be that he
was a despondent, unemployed gun collector. But that's not the point.
Right now is not the time to be making threats against anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Reza did not threaten the nuclear facility itself and it was never in
jeopardy, officials said. He was being held without bail Wednesday in the
Orange County Men's Central Jail on suspicion of making terrorist threats
and suspected possession of illegal narcotics, a concealed weapon and an
assault weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have a terrorist threat, you have to see if it could be
carried out," sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said. "With over 250
weapons and ammo and four inert hand grenades that he could easily arm,
he definitely had the ability to carry out the threat."</TE>
<TE>   Two Orange County sheriff's deputies were overcome by noxious yellow
vapor when they opened what they believed was an ammunition canister at
the storage garage in San Juan Capistrano. Instead, it held CS powder, an
ingredient in a compound similar to tear gas, Jaramillo said. The
deputies, who were not identified, were treated and released from Mission
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Friends described Reza as an affable, chatty man with a penchant for
firearms and a history of butting heads with his supervisors at San
Onofre, where he worked for 17 years--most recently as a boiler-condenser
mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   His girlfriend, Kristi Mattauch, denied that Reza threatened any
serious harm to anyone. She said his weapons collection consists mostly
of antiques, some dating to 1819, and that his interest began when as a
10-year-old he found an old BB gun behind the baseboards of his family's
home.</TE>
<TE>   None of Reza's weapons were illegal assault rifles, and the grenades
were inoperable, Mattauch said. "They are toys," she said. "I've seen
them. They're harmless."</TE>
<TE>   Reza's collections extended beyond guns, she said. The 10-foot by
20-foot storage unit also held a vintage cavalry uniform and a large
collection of Barbie dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was a fixture at San Juan Capistrano's Swallows Day Parade,
during which he would dress up in period costume and carry some of his
prized Colt sidearms worth as much as $25,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wrong," Mattauch said. "The cops were trying to tell me that
he's going to come back and kill me and my son. But they're wrong. He's
had a huge weight lifted off his shoulder since Edison fired him. . . .
This isn't a postal worker. He's a nice person. He's a happy-go-lucky
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Mattauch said the alleged threats consisted of an angry telephone
conversation with a boss over a disputed final paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't give him his check," she said. "He got mad at the guy"
and angrily asked for his check.</TE>
<TE>   Reza declined a Times request for an interview at the Orange County
Jail. Mattauch said she spoke to him by phone Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just shaking his head," she said. "He's bewildered. He was
saying, 'How come I'm guilty until proven innocent? I thought that you
were supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.' "</TE>
<TE>   Reza had been fired by Southern California Edison at least once before
but was reinstated through arbitration, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always had disagreements with his supervisors," said longtime
friend Cheryl Krupp of San Juan Capistrano, who rented a room to Reza for
about five years. "He was fired about four or five years ago and they
went through all this stuff with the union and they had to take him
back."</TE>
<TE>   Krupp said the disputes continued, but that Reza wasn't particularly
upset about them.</TE>
<TE>   "He just kept saying they eventually would pay him off and he'd be out
of their hair," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mattauch said Reza had been injured in more than one motor vehicle
accident in recent years that left him with nerve damage in his arms and
legs. He wanted to continue working, she said, but last year supervisors
began sending him home. Just before Christmas, company officials fired
him over absenteeism.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so excited," Mattauch said, adding that Reza thought the
dismissal would lead to another successful arbitration. "How can you fire
someone because you won't let them come to work?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Utility Workers Union of America Local 246, which
represents 650 workers at San Onofre, declined to discuss the specifics
of the disputes, other than to say that one of Reza's dismissals
progressed to arbitration, which Reza won. Local President Dan Davis said
the latest dismissal also was being contested.</TE>
<TE>   "We represent Mr. Reza as well as the remainder of the represented
employees at San Onofre, where our priority is their protection and
well-being," said vice president Bill Reid, adding that the union was
satisfied with how San Onofre officials handled the situation. "From the
sound of it, they were pretty effective."</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Southern California Edison, which operates San Onofre,
declined to comment in detail about Reza's work history. But they said
his security clearance was revoked when he was dismissed in 1995--and the
clearance wasn't reinstated when he returned to the job.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was a regular patron of the Swallows Inn bar and restaurant in
downtown San Juan Capistrano, and at one point worked there as a bouncer.
As word circulated Wednesday of the arrest, regulars said they had
trouble believing Reza--generally viewed as a man given to big talk but
small action--would make any serious threats.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that makes sense to me. He's not like that," said Jack
Holmes, adding that he has known Reza for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Krupp, Reza's former landlord and manager of the bar, said that when
Reza was renting a room from her, guns seemed to be his only possession.</TE>
<TE>   "His room was nothing but guns and a bed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Reza's former San Onofre co-workers were unfazed Wednesday
about the arrest. Security at the plant didn't seem unusually tight--the
guard shack at the plant's main entrance was vacant as employees arrived
for the day shift.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation doesn't concern me," said Brad Girard, a plant
supervisor. "That to me sounds like a collection of weapons. Unless he's
mad at me, that doesn't concern me at all."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jaime Songs, an engineer who has worked at the plant for 20
years, said employees are trained to prepare for disgruntled workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's an issue that can occur," Songs said. "Disgruntled
employees sometimes take irrational measures. But this place has a lot of
guards."</TE>

<HD>Officials Say Plant Was Never in Danger</HD>
<DH>Nuclear power: Reza's clearance to potentially dangerous areas was
revoked when he was fired in 1995.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station plant managers
had been trying to fire mechanic David L. Reza for several years, they
and industry regulators said Wednesday that he never posed an internal
threat to the power plant.</LD>
<LD>   They said that extensive security measures in place at all 103
reactors in 31 states, including the one in north San Diego County,
effectively prevent internal sabotage by employees and contractors.</LD>
<LD>   Reza's security clearance to potentially dangerous areas of the plant
was revoked in 1995, when he was fired for the first time, according to a
plant spokesman and a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Company officials would not elaborate on why he was fired in 1995.
Reza, 44, worked at the plant from 1984 in the maintenance division,
where he was responsible for maintaining and repairing equipment, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   He was rehired in 1998 but was out on disability leave until July of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   When Reza returned to the company, he worked in the plant's paint
shop, which is at a separate San Onofre facility, called "The Mesa." The
facility is about three miles from the nuclear site, on the other side of
the San Diego Freeway, and consists of warehouses and other buildings
where employees are trained, said Southern California Edison spokesman
Ray Golden. The utility company owns and manages the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Reza reapplied for "unescorted access" to the nuclear plant again but
was turned down. In late December, he was fired a second time.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Tuesday for allegedly threatening to shoot former
co-workers. Detectives said they found more than 250 weapons--including
antique rifles and empty hand grenades--as well as 5,000 rounds of
ammunition and a small amount of cocaine at his Laguna Niguel home and a
storage locker he rented.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Henderson, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Region 4 office, which covers California, said it would be possible for a
firearms enthusiast or gun collector to work at a nuclear power facility,
if all of the weapons are legal.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is important," Henderson said. "He was not granted access to
the protected area the second time he was hired."</TE>
<TE>   Henderson said he could not say why such access was denied. Lyn Harris
Hicks, a longtime critic of the San Onofre plant and a member of the
Coalition for Responsible Ethical Environmental Decisions, a San Clemente
environmental group, said Reza's case raises troubling questions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the type of person you want working at a nuclear power
plant," Hicks said. "This should bring about more careful hiring
practices."</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the industry group's Nuclear Energy
Institute in Washington, D.C., said every person who applies for a job at
any of the nation's nuclear power plants undergoes extensive criminal,
psychological and employment history checks.</TE>
<TE>   Even employees with clearance to sensitive areas of the plant must go
through metal detectors, turnstiles or other security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Reza originally had unescorted access to the nuclear parts of the San
Onofre plant, one of about 1,000 employees who have such access.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, plant security officials were alerted that Reza should
not be allowed into the plant for any reason. Golden said he did not know
if these instructions were given before or after the threat.</TE>
<TE>   "His badges had been removed. We had photos up of him with explicit
instructions to our security that he was not to be let in."</TE>
<TE>   Golden said that Reza never threatened the plant itself. "It is our
assessment that there never was a terrorist threat against San Onofre,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, already extensive security has been increased. Every
car trying to enter the plant is stopped, and security guards check the
identification cards for each employee. Visitors' cars are searched
before entering. About 80% of security guards at the facility have some
background in law enforcement or the military. "These are not
rent-a-cops," Golden said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials and regulators also stressed that anyone working at
a power plant is subject to potential immediate removal of security
clearances. As part of continuous, mandatory "behavior monitoring
observation," supervisors and co-workers are trained to look for odd
behavior, and to report it at once.</TE>
<TE>   Most common, said Henderson, are cases when a plant operator or other
employee arrives at work "with alcohol on their breath, and a co-worker
notices and reports it."</TE>
<TE>   All workers are subject to spot drug and alcohol tests. If someone
tests positive, security clearance is yanked "in an hour," Henderson
said. "He's taken off the shift and not permitted to come back in the
plant."</TE>
<TE>   Such workers are then entitled to "fitness for duty" hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "But they take immediate action to take them out of the plant. We
always err on the side of caution," Henderson said.</TE>

<HD>Vote on Tough Runoff Rules for South County Postponed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water regulators Wednesday postponed a vote on stringent new
runoff rules for south Orange County that some officials fear could cost
local cities $15 million a year and not improve water quality.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important for us to deliberate carefully on all the comments
that were made," said John Minan, chairman of the state's San Diego
Regional Water Quality Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   The board decided to postpone a decision after a nearly 10-hour public
hearing in Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   Board staff members said the matter will be brought up again after the
board considers issues raised during the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed restrictions are intended to decrease pollutants flowing
into local waterways and the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that urban
runoff--the car oil, pet waste and other contaminants washed off streets
and lawns and into storm drains, creeks and eventually the ocean--is the
county's No. 1 cause of coastal pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The strict measures are provisions of a permit required by the federal
Clean Water Act every five years. They would apply to 12 cities, Orange
County and the county's Flood Control District in South County.</TE>
<TE>   Key provisions would include:</TE>
<TE>   * Requiring most new developments and major redevelopment projects to
install devices that slow and cleanse the first runoff after a rainfall,
which is typically the dirtiest because it picks up contaminants that
have accumulated on city streets for weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibiting runoff from flowing out of storm drains and polluting
local waterways.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspecting construction, industrial, commercial and municipal sites
for contamination.</TE>
<TE>   * Educating people about the impact of urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they have to do a new plan is because their current plan
is so atrocious," said David Beckman, a senior attorney with the Natural
Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman was one of more than 50 environmentalists, government
officials, lawyers, builders and residents who testified at Wednesday's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   County and city officials say they are spending nearly $7 million this
fiscal year to comply with storm water regulations and expect new
requirements to add at least $15 million to that.</TE>
<TE>   Many fear the proposed regulations would accomplish little except
crack down on people hosing off driveways, washing cars and watering
lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from some newer cities, such as Aliso Viejo and Rancho Santa
Margarita, said they are worried about the financial impact of these
major unplanned expenses.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Beach Wins Ballot-Phrase Dispute</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge finds the description of the AES power plant OK but
orders other changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court has sided with Huntington Beach in its battle with
an energy company over the language used to describe the AES power plant
in a March ballot measure.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, if approved, would impose a 5% utility tax on the AES
plant. The ballot measure included the lines "The AES plant is ugly,
pollutes our air, and our ocean" and "The AES plant has been a blight on
Huntington Beach for over 40 years."</LD>
<LD>   AES officials went to court to strike the language, and an Orange
County Superior Court judge in December sided with the company.</LD>
<TE>   AES President Ed Blackford argued that the ballot measure "contains
pejorative and libelous attacks on AES and its power plant that undermine
the integrity of the electoral process."</TE>
<TE>   The city went before an appellate court, which on Tuesday sided with
the city and allowed the language to stay.</TE>
<TE>   The 4th District Court of Appeal however, did agree that other wording
in the ballot measure should be rewritten or removed.</TE>
<TE>   The city's ballot language stated that the measure would require AES
to pay "the same utility tax paid by all residents and businesses in
Huntington Beach."</TE>
<TE>   The phrase is misleading, the higher court said, "because the plant is
already paying the 'same' tax as everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, Mayor Debbie Cook said "it's a big victory for the
electoral process, for the little guy."</TE>

during the annual United Way campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "This year we shattered all prior years' records, which I believe was
partly a response to the tragic events of Sept. 11," said
Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom, who led the county's United Way
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign raised $104,102 more than last year, a 14% increase. A

<HD>What a Difference 37 Years Can Make</HD>
<DH>Community: As he retires, Huntington Beach's first Mexican American
police officer is recalled as 'member of our family.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Latino residents of the Oakview neighborhood, Huntington Beach
Police Lt. Luis Ochoa seemed to be everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   He met regularly with the residents. He got the soccer league on its
feet. He read his favorite children's literature during story time at the
library.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Huntington Beach's first Mexican American police officer is
retiring after 37 years. He leaves behind an Oakview that is no longer a
battleground for gangs nor a magnet for drug buyers from as far away as
Los Angeles, police and residents say.</LD>
<TE>   Oakview, which comprises about 12 city blocks of aging apartments
bordered by Beach Boulevard, Slater Avenue, Nichols Street and Warner
Avenue, still has its problems. But residents say they are more
confident, in part because of the lessons Ochoa taught them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a member of our family," said Martha Cervantes, who has
lived in Oakview for 16 years and who said she watched the neighborhood
become a place where families could live in safety.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, who was honored at a community luncheon Wednesday along with
retiring Lt. Clyde Stuart, was one of the few Latino role models in
Huntington Beach when he began his job, many city residents said. And
while there are other Latinos in the school district and other community
agencies these days, they are still few, say residents. The Police
Department has only 12 Spanish-speaking officers among the 230 in the
department.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a lot of satisfaction from working in a place like Oakview,"
said Ochoa, a 60-year-old father of two and grandfather of three. "People
really appreciate what we do. And I made sure to bring officers in that
neighborhood who would be comfortable in that neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   On streets where brigades of baby strollers outnumber cars at midday,
families are learning how to deal with local government and how to
improve relationships in their homes, said Lillian Chacon, a counselor at
the Oakview Family Resource Center, which helps the families of at-risk
students.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of dollars were pumped into the neighborhood for street
improvements, additional police and code enforcement campaigns, said
Police Lt. Chuck Thomas, who thanked Ochoa for some of them.</TE>
<TE>   When Ochoa became police area commander for north Huntington Beach in
1993, he said Oakview became a pet project, in part because he felt at
home. It reminded him of where he grew up in west Wilmington, near the
Los Angeles Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   He persuaded his department to open a substation at Beach Boulevard
and Slater Avenue in 1996. By 1998, crime had gone down, and the
substation had become a local haunt for a newly formed band of police
volunteers and, on Halloween, for 5,000 children who enjoyed a haunted
house set up there.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa also persuaded the city to open a day laborer center where
immigrants could seek work in construction and gardening instead of
standing on street corners. After nearly five years of planning, the
center opened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents remained suspicious of police and officials, who tried
to regulate code violations such as overcrowding, as well as trucks that
sell groceries to a community that relies heavily on public
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Then on May 5, a police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old who
pointed what turned out to be a toy gun. Rafael Torres, a member of newly
formed United Neighbors, said the anger that roiled in the community
resulted in increased activism and more contact with police.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa participated in a series of meetings conducted to cool tensions
after the shooting. They appear to have had mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   "They had those meetings and I remember [Ochoa], but I still have my
doubts. I still feel like the police are not always on our side," said
Oakview resident Luis Martinez, 31, who lives with his mother, sister and
son in a two-bedroom apartment. "What they did will take years to
overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some residents have mended fences. Speaking at the luncheon,
Rafael Torres addressed Ochoa: "How many children have been saved from
domestic violence? How many parents have learned from you, learned about
the law?"</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Zapata said he met Ochoa in the late 1980s, when, as a young
man recently arrived from Mexico, he was arrested for repeatedly throwing
stones at pigeons at a local beach. Ochoa was sent to translate the
conversation between Zapata and the arresting officer. The arrest turned
out to be the beginning of a long friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Zapata, now the president of the Huntington Beach Soccer League, has
since turned to Ochoa for help in getting drug dealers off the soccer
fields and for help in building a bathroom near the fields.</TE>
<TE>   "It really hurts that he's retiring. It is something he has to do,"
said Zapata. "He's made an impact that will help this neighborhood for
many years to come."</TE>

<HD>Flight Gives John Wayne International Connection</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Alaska Airlines will launch daily round trips to
Vancouver in April, the airport's first to a foreign country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Come April, Orange County will have an international
airport--barely--when Alaska Airlines debuts a flight from John Wayne
Airport to Vancouver, British Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   The nonstop route was announced Wednesday by Seattle-based Alaska,
which began service from Orange County in 1987. The new flight begins
April 28.</LD>
<LD>   "This service opens new opportunities in both directions for both
business and leisure travel," said Gregg Saretsky, Alaska's senior vice
president of marketing and planning.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement took airport employees by surprise. The facility has
never had a customs office or other accommodations for international
flights, including a secure area for unloading passengers who must be
processed into the United States. There are no plans to add customs areas
because of space constraints, airport officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But such facilities aren't necessary for the Alaska flight because of
an agreement between Canada and U.S. officials allowing passengers to
clear customs in Vancouver, which is 140 miles north of Seattle, Alaska
spokesman Jack Walsh said. No such agreement exists between the U.S. and
Mexico, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As long as it has a regularly scheduled flight crossing an
international border, an airport can call itself international, said Mike
Fergus, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Renton,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of exciting for us," airport spokeswoman Ann McCarley said.</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made whether to change the airport's signs to
include "international." The airport's FAA designation will remain SNA,
for Santa Ana, which is the airport's mailing address.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect to book a flight to London any time soon. Other
constraints at the airport include its single, 5,700-foot runway, which
is too short for jetliners headed to or from most foreign destinations.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by Alaska to add the flight comes amid a slump in air
travel since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The airline wanted to open a
market for Orange County that hadn't been served, Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian travelers are attracted to Orange County by Disneyland and
other tourist attractions, and Alaska Airlines is one of the largest
sellers of vacation packages to Disneyland, Walsh said. For Southland
residents, Vancouver is an appealing destination because its famed Inside
Passage is a gateway for Alaskan cruises.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Orange County's plan to build an international airport at
the closed El Toro Marine base hailed the Vancouver flight as evidence
that John Wayne Airport, between Newport Beach and Irvine, can
accommodate the needs of local airline travelers. Opponents of the
airport want a park built at El Toro instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Newport Beach has wanted an international airport for years; now they
have it," said Meg Waters, spokeswoman for the El Toro Reuse Planning
Authority, a coalition of South County cities fighting an airport at El
Toro. "We'll throw them a party at the park."</TE>
<TE>   Don't print the invitations just yet, said David Ellis of the pro-El
Toro Airport Working Group of Orange County. "An international airport
with one flight?" he said. "Tell that to the people waiting in line for
three hours for international flights at LAX."</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver flight will become the second new market opened to
Orange County in the last year. In May, Aloha Airlines began a daily
round-trip flight to Honolulu, followed in June by service from Orange
County to Maui. The flights were the first from Orange County to
destinations outside the continental U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska provides service from Orange County to Oakland, Portland and
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   In April it will offer a daily northbound flight departing Orange
County at 10 a.m. and arriving in Vancouver at 12:58 p.m. The return
flight will depart Vancouver at 1:38 p.m. and arrive in Orange County at
4:33 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The flight will be on a 120-seat Boeing 737-700, with 12 seats in
first class and 108 in coach.</TE>

<HD>MTA to Again Appeal Bus Service Agreement</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Board votes to seek review by the U.S. Supreme
Court. Experts say a hearing is unlikely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County's transit agency voted Wednesday to appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal agreement requiring a
massive expansion of bus service for poor and minority riders. Board
members for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority called the
agreement too costly and overly intrusive.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA board voted 8-4, with one abstention, to pursue a final appeal
after a string of bitter legal defeats stretching over several years.</LD>
<LD>   Board members cast their decision as an attempt to gain clarity on a
confusing and contradictory court order that could hamper other transit
efforts, including highway and light-rail improvements.</LD>
<TE>   But civil rights activists and bus rider representatives said the vote
is just the latest evidence of the giant agency's intransigence when it
comes to helping mostly low-income bus patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Legal observers predicted that the MTA has only a slim chance of
convincing the Supreme Court that there is an issue of legal merit in the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to try to get clarification on this matter. . . . The
way parts of this decree are set up is very unfair," said board chairman
John Fasana, who added that he believes the MTA has not received credit
for adhering to the order to improve bus service.</TE>
<TE>   Taking strong issue with that stance were members of the Bus Riders
Union, an advocacy group that was the lead plaintiff in the civil rights
case that led to the federal court agreement more than five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The board should be a little more honest," said Eric Mann, the Bus
Riders Union leader. They "are appealing the heart and soul of the
consent decree and leaving an empty shell. It's disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   According to the MTA's chief counsel, the appeal, which must be filed
by Monday, will revolve around several issues. First, the MTA will
contend that the contract is unfair and unclear. In addition, the agency
will argue that the federal judge and a special court master overstepped
their bounds in telling the MTA it must add more buses to a fleet of
roughly 2,100.</TE>
<TE>   MTA administrators worry that such specific directives could become
even more onerous as the lower court's timetable begins to dictate the
level of service that must be provided to hospitals, schools and job
centers. If too much money goes to those efforts, the order could
jeopardize the agency's big ticket rail and highway improvements, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   "The special master should have given more discretion to the MTA to
come up with their own remedy to the [overcrowding] violations that he
found," said the agency's chief counsel, Steve Carnevale.</TE>
<TE>   But several legal experts said the odds are extremely remote that the
high court will agree to accept the case as one of the few it reviews
each year. Additionally, the MTA's case revolves primarily around narrow
disputes over contract law, an issue the Supreme Court justices will not
likely view as weighty or novel.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the lawyers
representing the plaintiffs, called it "highly unlikely" that the court
will take the case. That view was echoed by several legal scholars not
connected to the case.</TE>
<TE>   The bid to the Supreme Court will be the MTA's fifth appeal of an
agreement that it negotiated and signed in 1996--a record that has
infuriated many civil rights advocates.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge, the court-appointed special master, a three-member
panel of the U.S 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and a broad panel of
federal appeals court judges have all ruled against the MTA and in favor
of the bus riders.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the advocates Wednesday was Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn.
Fulfilling a campaign promise, Hahn argued that the agency should stop
its appeals and concentrate on "working to provide better bus and better
transit service to the people of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed we are continuing to have this battle in court," a
frustrated Hahn said after the vote. He had been unable to sway any of
the members other than his three appointees, who all voted against an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did see the board unanimously approve a motion he wrote,
calling for MTA administrators to implement the court decree as best as
they can. The directive requires both sides to take disputes to special
master Donald Bliss for settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But that arrangement may prove problematic. MTA administrators say
they have little faith in Bliss, who has ordered them to buy hundreds of
buses in order to achieve the first portion of the decree--including a
series of benchmarks to lessen overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Snoble, the agency's new chief executive, said he is
particularly troubled by the strict "load factors" the bus line must
adhere to. One that looms this June 30 requires that the number of
passengers forced to stand at rush hours not exceed the number who are
seated by more than 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble argues that many bus lines nationally don't meet such a strict
standard and that the MTA needs flexibility and latitude to occasionally
break the load goals.</TE>
<TE>   But Bliss has consistently held that the load limits must be strictly
enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble said the huge bus agency deserves more credit for the progress
most observers agree it has made and acknowledgment that his
administration is aggressively addressing crowding issues since he
arrived in October.</TE>
<TE>   Bus Riders Union chief Mann, in contrast, said he's not about to
negotiate, particularly over decisions repeatedly affirmed in court.</TE>
<TE>   "They introduced the load factor idea in the first place, we didn't
come up with it," Mann said outside MTA headquarters downtown. "Now they
want to change? Come on. They want to throw the whole consent decree out
the window."</TE>

<HD>250 Weapons Seized; Nuclear Worker Held</HD>
<DH>Safety: Fired San Onofre employee allegedly threatened former
colleagues. Friends say he merely is a gun collector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former worker at the San Onofre nuclear power plant was found
with more than 250 weapons, including an illegal rocket launcher, when
arrested for allegedly threatening his ex-colleagues, apparently in anger
over being fired.</LD>
<LD>   While serving an arrest warrant for David L. Reza on Tuesday evening,
Orange County sheriff's deputies discovered the weapons--including
antique rifles and empty hand grenades--as well as 5,000 rounds of
ammunition at his Laguna Niguel home and a storage locker he rented.
Sheriff's officials said the weaponry included an illegal light anti-tank
rocket launcher and at least seven other illegal weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Two deputies were overcome by noxious yellow vapor when they opened
what they thought was an ammunition canister at the storage garage in San
Juan Capistrano. Instead, it held CS powder, an ingredient in a compound
similar to tear gas, Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo said. The
deputies, who were not identified, were treated and released from Mission
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they also found a small amount of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Reza's girlfriend and others said he was a known collector who would
"talk your ear off about guns and his collection."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was sparked by an alleged threat made Friday by
Reza, 44, in a telephone conversation with a person investigators would
identify only as an employee of Southern California Edison, which
operates the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was quoted as saying: "They have taken my job. They have taken my
life. I don't have anything to lose. I'm going to take my guns, go to San
Onofre and whack a bunch of people."</TE>
<TE>   The employee reported the conversation to Edison officials who alerted
the Sheriff's Department on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We considered it a realistic threat. . . . He may be just an avid gun
collector. It may be that he was a despondent, unemployed gun collector.
But that's not the point," said Jaramillo. "Right now is not the time to
be making threats against anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Reza did not threaten the nuclear facility itself and it was never in
jeopardy, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He was being held without bail Wednesday in the Orange County Men's
Central Jail on suspicion of making terrorist threats and suspected
possession of illegal narcotics, a concealed weapon and an assault
weapon--all potential felonies.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have a terrorist threat, you have to see if it could be
carried out," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino. "With
over 250 weapons and ammo and four inert hand grenades that he could
easily arm, he definitely had the ability to carry out the threat."</TE>
<TE>   Friends described Reza as an affable, chatty man with a penchant for
firearms and a history of butting heads with his supervisors at San
Onofre, where he worked for 17 years--most recently as a boiler-condenser
mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   His girlfriend, Kristi Mattauch, said Reza did not threatened any
serious harm to anyone. She said his weapons collection consists mostly
of antiques, some dating to 1819, and that his interest began when as a
10-year-old he found an old BB gun behind the baseboards of his family's
home.</TE>
<TE>   None of his weapons were illegal assault rifles, and the grenades were
inoperable, Mattauch said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are toys," she said. "I've seen them. They're harmless."</TE>
<TE>   Reza's collections extended beyond guns, she said. The 10-foot by
20-foot storage unit also held a vintage cavalry uniform and a large
collection of Barbie dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was a regular at San Juan Capistrano's Swallows Day Parade,
during which he would dress up in period costume and carry some of his
prized Colt sidearms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wrong," Mattauch said. "The cops were trying to tell me that
he's going to come back and kill me and my son. But they're wrong. He's
had a huge weight lifted off his shoulder since Edison fired him. . . .
He's a nice person. He's a happy-go-lucky guy."</TE>
<TE>   Mattauch said the alleged threats consisted of an angry telephone
conversation with a boss over a disputed final paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't give him his check. He got mad at the guy," she said,
adding that he angrily asked for his check.</TE>
<TE>   Mattauch said she spoke to him by phone Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just shaking his head," she said. "He's bewildered. He was
saying, 'How come I'm guilty until proven innocent? I thought that you
were supposed to be innocent until proven guilty."'</TE>
<TE>   Reza had been fired by Southern California Edison at least once before
but was reinstated through arbitration, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always had disagreements with his supervisors," said longtime
friend Cheryl Krupp of San Juan Capistrano, who rented a room to Reza for
about five years. "He was fired about four or five years ago and they
went through all this stuff with the union and they had to take him
back."</TE>
<TE>   Krupp said the disputes continued, but that Reza wasn't particularly
upset about them.</TE>
<TE>   "He just kept saying they eventually would pay him off and he'd be out
of their hair," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mattauch said Reza had been injured in more than one motor vehicle
accident in recent years that left him with nerve damage in his arms and
legs. He wanted to continue working, she said, but last year supervisors
began sending him home. Just before Christmas, company officials fired
him over absenteeism, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so excited," Mattauch said, adding that Reza thought the
dismissal would lead to another successful arbitration. "How can you fire
someone because you won't let them come to work?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Utility Workers Union of America Local 246, which
represents 650 workers at San Onofre, declined to discuss the specifics
of the disputes, other than to say that one of Reza's dismissals
progressed to arbitration, which Reza won. Local president Dan Davis said
the latest dismissal also was being contested.</TE>
<TE>   "We represent Mr. Reza as well as the remainder of the represented
employees at San Onofre, where our priority is their protection and
well-being," said vice president Bill Reid, adding that the union was
satisfied with how San Onofre officials handled the situation. "From the
sound of it, they were pretty effective."</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Southern California Edison, which operates San Onofre,
declined to comment in detail about Reza's work history. But they said
his security clearance was revoked when he was dismissed in 1995--and the
clearance wasn't reinstated when he returned to the job.</TE>
<TE>   Reza was a regular patron of the Swallows Inn bar and restaurant in
downtown San Juan Capistrano, and at one point worked there as a bouncer.
As word circulated Wednesday of the arrest, some regulars said they had
trouble believing Reza--generally viewed as a man given to big talk but
small action--would make any serious threats.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that make sense to me. He's not like that," said Jack Holmes,
adding that he has known Reza for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Krupp, Reza's former landlord and manager of the bar, said that when
Reza was renting a room from her, guns seemed to be his only possession.</TE>
<TE>   "His room was nothing but guns and a bed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Reza's former co-workers were unfazed Wednesday about the
arrest. Security at the plant didn't seem unusually tight--the guard
shack at the plant's main entrance was vacant as employees arrived for
the day shift.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation doesn't concern me," said Brad Girard, a plant
supervisor. "That to me sounds like a collection of weapons. Unless he's
mad at me, that doesn't concern me at all."</TE>

<HD>Cuts Part of Davis' Budget for Education</HD>
<DH>Schools: When he unveils his plan today, governor will ask that
$487 million be trimmed to allow for increased spending in some areas.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is set to unveil a state budget today that slightly
increases school spending, but still requires $487 million in education
cuts to cover the rising cost of teaching public school students.</LD>
<LD>   Most areas of state government are not expected to fare even that
well.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace, a Democrat from El
Cajon, predicted that Davis would offer a combination of $4 billion to $5
billion in cuts and an equal amount in borrowing and new revenue,
including counting on more money from the federal government, to make up
a projected $12-billion budget shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Davis continued to say he opposes raising taxes as a way
to help close that gap, but he also left open the possibility that there
would be a tax increase as part of a final budget package.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't anticipate that taxes will be raised," he said. "I don't
believe the situation warrants new taxes."</TE>
<TE>   But when he was pressed on whether he was ruling out increasing taxes
this year, Davis said: "It doesn't make sense to get into these
rhetorical games."</TE>
<TE>   The school cuts will enable Davis, a Democrat, to cover the rising
cost of educating schoolchildren in the 2002-03 fiscal year--a key
priority for many members of the education community who use the
discretionary dollars to pay for teacher salaries, new students and
school maintenance, among other priorities.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Davis proposed cutting $1.2 billion from education as
part of a larger package aimed at narrowing the state's budget shortfall.
The additional $487 million in cuts outlined Wednesday would bring the
total 18-month reduction to nearly $1.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The new targets include a safety training program for school bus
drivers, independent studies programs, and portions of a teacher training
program for math and reading. Trimming or delaying spending on those
three proposals alone would free up about $190 million, the
administration says.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan Davis will unveil today earmarks $53.9 billion for
kindergarten through 12th-grade education, $200 million more than
approved this year, not counting the cuts proposed in November.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes $1.2 billion to cover the rising cost of holding
even--such as enrolling new students and giving employees cost-of-living
raises. That money is spent at the discretion of school officials, so
it's among their highest priorities in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Broken down by the amount spent on each student, the Davis budget
shows a slight increase: to $7,058 per student from $7,002 in the current
fiscal year, before the November cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we have kept the budget focused on our priority," said Kerry
Mazzoni, Davis' education secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is the governor's highest priority."</TE>
<TE>   Education officials gave Davis' school plan mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate to see the cuts, but given the economic situation of
California we feel the governor had no other alternatives," said Wayne
Johnson of the California Teachers Assn. "The cuts are hurting programs
that a lot of our teachers like."</TE>
<TE>   "While numerous programs are on the chopping block, education funding
is going to rise ever so slightly," added Kevin Gordon, executive
director of the California Assn. of Business Officials. "You come out of
a situation like this whole, it's a victory."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers, said
the Davis plan would not change the fundamental gap between teaching
salaries and entry-level wages in other professions.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that we're in a bad year, we need to say to
ourselves that we're in an underfunded system," Bergan said. "An increase
in [cost of living] is not enough. That assumes the base is adequate."</TE>
<TE>   The union plans to push for legislation that would cap the size of new
schools--both in square footage and in the number of students who attend
them--even though that would increase building costs.</TE>
<TE>   Other school advocates took issue with the Davis proposal to cut
programs for independent study--a form of home schooling with teacher
involvement--by 10%. The proposed reduction, according to administration
officials, is based on the assumption that it costs less to offer
independent study programs than their classroom-based counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Birdsall, a lobbyist for the California Consortium for
Independent Study, said that under state law the student-to-teacher ratio
is required to be the same for independent study programs as it is for
regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge problem," Birdsall said. "If you take away money,
you're taking away staff for those kids."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has proposed increasing funding for before- and after-school
programs by $75 million in 2002-03. The programs seek to keep kids out of
trouble by providing them with tutoring and recreational activities. The
increase will allow 79,000 more children to participate in the program,
for a total of 176,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for instructional materials will rise by about $20 million and
will be restructured to include a $250 million block grant and one-time
increases for language arts and library materials in addition to science
lab equipment for a total of $626 million.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials suggested Davis may make a proposal relating
to the state's $508 million annual contribution to the California State
Teachers' Retirement System.</TE>
<TE>   A group of state scientists filed suit in Sacramento Superior Court
this week seeking a reversal of an agreement reached between the Davis
administration and the California Public Employees' Regiment System; as
it stands, the agreement will allow the state to free up about $1 billion
by restructuring the state's contribution to the retirement fund.</TE>
<TE>   Davis appeared across from a construction site at UC Davis to release
some details of a proposal to sell $678 million in bonds to finance
construction primarily at state colleges and universities. If it's
approved by the Legislature, Davis said, his plan will speed the start of
several public works projects and create jobs.</TE>

<HD>Report Confirms Secession Is Viable</HD>
<DH>Breakup: A county panel says the Valley could support itself, using
L.A. services. But the harbor area would face a bigger challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commission reviewing plans to split Los Angeles apart released
a final study Wednesday confirming the viability of San Fernando Valley
secession--a key step toward a citywide vote on the proposed breakup.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the commission concluded that it might also be
feasible for the harbor area to secede from Los Angeles despite
uncertainty over whether it could support itself as an independent city.</LD>
<LD>   The studies--along with another to be released in March on Hollywood
secession--could lead to a November referendum on whether to carve Los
Angeles into two, three or four smaller cities.</LD>
<TE>   "It's no longer a matter of if this can be done; it's how it can be
done," Valley secessionist Jeff Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission for Los Angeles County has been
struggling for two years to devise a concrete plan.</TE>
<TE>   For the Valley, the final report by LAFCO's consulting firm, Public
Financial Management, offers a road map. It's largely the same plan
proposed in a draft report in October.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Valley city, as yet unnamed, would remain tightly
entwined with Los Angeles for years.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles would provide water, power, police and fire protection,
road repairs, trash collection and every other basic service under
contract. A Valley city would pay Los Angeles nearly $1 billion a
year--just short of its entire budget. A new city would employ no more
than 36 people. It would take more than 8,000 Los Angeles employees to
provide services to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After a transition of up to three years, the Valley's mayor and city
council could opt to hire private vendors to replace Los Angeles. It
could also build up its own work force, perhaps shifting some Los Angeles
employees to its payroll. But how any of that might occur would be
unknown when secession went before voters, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists greeted the plan for a contract city with scorn
in October, but Wednesday they portrayed it as a step toward
independence.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll wean ourselves off city of L.A. services," said Charles Brink,
a leader of the Valley VOTE secession group.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Valley city would start off owning nothing but its
streets. It could acquire parks, libraries and other property from Los
Angeles only with the consent of the Los Angeles mayor and City Council.
Secession leaders said they would continue urging LAFCO to require an
asset split as part of the final ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that the Valley city would need to pay Los
Angeles $66 million a year as compensation for lost tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted in response to a petition by more than 200,000
Valley voters, could be audited soon by state Controller Kathleen
Connell. The Service Employees International Union will request an audit,
said Julie Butcher, general manager of a local that represents 8,500 city
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "There really needs to be someone else looking at this stuff," she
said. "This is too big of a deal to take lightly."</TE>
<TE>   By law, the controller would have 45 days to issue a report. LAFCO
Executive Officer Larry J. Calemine would have to include the audit in
his report to the commission, with recommendations on whether the issue
should be put to a popular vote. In late spring, the LAFCO board plans to
take a final vote on whether to put secession on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Valley VOTE and city officials will continue
negotiating terms of the measure. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the LAFCO commissioner overseeing preparation
of the measure, accused city officials of trying to "torpedo" the
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the city's threat to charge higher utility rates in areas
that secede--and a city report finding that Valley secession would cost
Los Angeles $284 million more than estimated by LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky stopped just short of threatening to delay the referendum
until 2004, when it could damage the reelection campaign of Mayor James
K. Hahn, a fellow Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "We can have this debate in November 2004, just four months before the
next mayor's election, if that's what everybody wants," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Mayor Matt Middlebrook called Yaroslavsky's remarks
"absurd," saying the city has "gone above and beyond anything that's been
asked of it."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they are not using the city of L.A. as an excuse not to do the
work necessary to get this on the ballot in November, because it would be
a disservice to everybody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the harbor area, the final report found that it would generate
enough tax revenue to be viable if it could cut the cost of services
provided now by Los Angeles. But it's uncertain whether a new harbor city
could make the cuts needed, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   It found that San Pedro and Wilmington generate $123.8 million in
annual revenue, which is $34 million less than it costs Los Angeles to
provide services to the area.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, without cuts, a new harbor area city would would face
budget deficits during its first three years, which would cause it to
flunk the financial viability test needed to qualify for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But harbor secessionists had urged LAFCO to base its study on a
small-town form of government less costly than that of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't talking about a Cadillac," said Andrew Mardesich of the
Harbor Study Foundation. "We're willing to work as a Volkswagen."</TE>
<TE>   The consultant found that even with cuts, a harbor city would spend
more per capita than Irvine, Pomona or Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Janice Hahn of San Pedro, a secession opponent, said
there are still too many questions to say whether a harbor city was
viable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really iffy," said Hahn, the mayor's sister. "It's based on a
lot of could be's, would be's, and should be's. It sounds like a huge
leap of faith."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, she and others predicted that LAFCO would use the report to
justify putting harbor cityhood on the ballot.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis performed an awkward rhetorical dance the other
night. He wrapped his annual State of the State address in repeated
references to Sept. 11, straining to make the case that California has
been in the thick of things on the terror front.</LD>
<LD>   "All four hijacked planes were bound for California," Davis told the
assembled lawmakers at the outset of his lengthy address. "More than 100
fellow Californians paid the ultimate price for our freedom."</LD>
<LD>   Dressed for patriotism in a red tie and royal blue shirt, with an
American flag pin shining from his lapel, the governor described how he'd
dispatched the National Guard to protect airports, bridges and dams. With
thinly veiled humility, he declared that "no state has done more than
California to protect its citizens and vital assets since the terrorist
attacks."</LD>
<TE>   Eventually the governor did get around to other topics--the now all
but forgotten (yet still unresolved) energy crisis, education reform, the
impending state budget deficit, those sorts of things. Still, the state
of the state, as Davis painted it Tuesday night, was that of a California
on wartime footing.</TE>
<TE>   And here--despite a powerful urge to lampoon a state politician trying
to promote himself to commander in chief--the point must be made: Davis
was not wrong. There is, obviously enough, a war going on, and California
is as much a part of it as any of the other 49 states. And while the
governor might have overreached a bit in his martial rhetoric, he
conversely would have been accused of gross disrespect had he not
mentioned the conflict at all, cutting instead straight to his thoughts
on drug discounts for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is one of balance--just how much "normalcy" is appropriate
for these abnormal times? And I suspect it will not be mastered by
Davis--or California as a whole, for that matter--for a long time. It's
by now a cliche to suggest the world changed on Sept. 11. So let me put
it this way: On that day, the United States, and California, discovered
it was part of a world that has been changing, and changing fast.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Coming Anarchy," a collection of Atlantic Monthly articles
published in 1994, Robert D. Kaplan described early and well how the old
world map of nation-states appears to be in the process of being
"replaced by a jagged-glass pattern of city-states, shanty-states,
nebulous and anarchic regionalisms."</TE>
<TE>   With these geopolitical shifts will come changes in the definition and
execution of war. As the influential military historian Martin van
Creveld predicted more than a decade ago: "Once the legal monopoly of
armed force, long claimed by the state, is wrested out of its hands,
existing distinctions between war and crime will break down. . . . Often,
crime will be disguised as war, whereas in other cases war itself will be
treated as if waging it is a crime."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, there had been numerous policy papers
published--and quickly shelved--that described with clarity what this new
world disorder might mean for America, the last superpower and the engine
of the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   "American influence will increasingly be both embraced and resented
abroad as U.S. cultural, economic and political power persists and
perhaps spreads," went a typical passage from one such report. "States,
terrorists and other disaffected groups will acquire weapons of mass
destruction and mass disruption, and some will use them. Americans will
likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers."</TE>
<TE>   The above was lifted from a study--much quoted after Sept. 11--by a
national commission on security that completed its work early last year.
Former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart served as co-chairman of the commission and,
not long ago, I asked him what he thought Sept. 11 would mean in terms of
how the country protects itself. He said the question was premature by
about a quarter-century.</TE>
<TE>   "If one believes the events of Sept. 11 stand alone," he said, "then
we can begin to think about what it means. Unfortunately, I think it is
just the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   A sobering thought, and one that suggests a few points Gov. Davis
might have added the other night while he was on the subject of terror.
He might have said that California is a crossroads point in a world that
is rapidly rearranging itself, and that the goods and people of this
world pass through its ports and across its borders daily, in numbers too
great to monitor.</TE>
<TE>   He might have said that, within the state, the list of possible
targets is as endless as the imagination, and that there never will be
enough National Guard troops to protect everything, all the time. And so,
going forward, there will be risks to weigh, hard choices to make.</TE>
<TE>   Is public money better spent fortifying buildings and infrastructure
against suicide bombers, or in retrofitting them for earthquakes? Who, in
the long run, provides more public protection for the dollar--a National
Guard soldier patrolling for terrorists on the Golden Gate, or one more
street cop on the prowl for gangbangers?</TE>
<TE>   Such are the questions that will face California governors and
policymakers for a long time to come. Such is the uncertain state of the
state in this, the new normalcy.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Panel Strikes Down No-Bail Law</HD>
<DH>Court: The mandatory detention of immigrant criminals facing
deportation is called unconstitutional. Thousands in the West could be
affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A law requiring that immigrants facing deportation hearings after
serving a criminal sentence must be held without bail is
unconstitutional, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the 3-0 decision, which could affect thousands of immigrants in
nine Western states, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a
federal law requiring mandatory detention violates due process rights for
immigrants who have previously established permanent resident status.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling marks the second time in a month that a federal appeals
court has struck down the mandatory detention law, the first ruling
coming from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. Similar
challenges to the law are pending in federal appeals courts in
Cincinnati, Denver, New York and Richmond.</LD>
<TE>   Since October 1998, the federal government has required that all
immigrants facing deportation because of crimes they committed must
remain in detention after they finish their sentences, regardless of how
long the deportation process lasts. That violates the due process clause
of the 5th Amendment, the 9th Circuit held Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In its decision, involving a Korean citizen living in Northern
California, the court made a pointed reference to the government's war on
terrorism, which has resulted in many immigrants being taken into
custody.</TE>
<TE>   "We must remember that our 'Nation's armor' includes our Constitution,
the central text of our civic faith," Judge William A. Fletcher wrote.
"It is the foundation of everything that makes our country's system of
laws worth defending. As a lawful permanent resident, [Hyung Joon] Kim is
entitled to the individualized determination and fair procedures
guaranteed by the due process clause of the 5th Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said it was not throwing out the statute for all
categories of immigrants, just for "permanent resident aliens."</TE>
<TE>   "No one contends that Kim is a terrorist. He was brought to the U.S.
from Korea when he was six years old and became a permanent resident
alien when he was eight. He committed rather ordinary crimes [burglary
and petty theft] in the state of California and those crimes are the
basis for the removal proceedings now pending against him," Fletcher
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "No responsible court will leave 'an unprotected spot in the Nation's
armor,' and our decision does not do so," Fletcher continued. "We do not
hold that a lawful permanent resident alien in removal proceedings has an
absolute right to bail. We hold only that such an alien has a right to an
individualized determination of a right to bail, tailored to his or her
particular circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   The decision was hailed by Judith Rabinowitz, an attorney for the
Immigrants Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, who
argued the case on Kim's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision reminds us that it is unconstitutional and
counterproductive to lock people up without a hearing," Rabinowitz said.
"It is so significant that in this post-9/11 climate a court is still
ready to say that there are checks and balances, that the Constitution
applies.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very reassuring to see that courts are not stepping back from
their role in this climate," Rabinowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Strassburger, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Washington, said the agency would have no comment because it
had not had time to review the decision. The INS could ask for a
rehearing before a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges or appeal to the
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling relied on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions issued
last June. In the first case, INS vs. St. Cyr, the high court ruled that
the federal government cannot deport resident immigrants who have been
convicted of certain crimes without a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, Zadvydas vs. Davis, the Supreme Court declared
that the federal government cannot indefinitely imprison immigrant
criminals who cannot be deported because their native lands--such as Cuba
or Cambodia--will not take them back.</TE>
<TE>   In the Northern California case, Kim was convicted in July 1996 in
state court of first-degree burglary.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen months later, he was convicted of petty theft and received a
three-year sentence. The day after he was released from state custody,
Kim was detained by the INS under the mandatory detention statute, on the
ground that his second conviction constituted an "aggravated felony,"
which made him deportable.</TE>
<TE>   After three months in INS custody, Kim filed a federal habeas corpus
writ, arguing that the no-bail law violated the Constitution's due
process clause. Three months later, in August 1999, U.S. District Judge
Susan Y. Illston in San Francisco ruled that mandatory detention was
unconstitutional and ordered the INS to hold a bail hearing to determine
whether Kim was a flight risk or a danger to the community.</TE>
<TE>   The INS then released Kim on a $5,000 bond without holding a bail
hearing but appealed Illston's ruling. A separate hearing to determine
whether Kim should be deported is scheduled for March before an
immigration judge.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said it was notable that the statute never permits
bail while a deportation proceeding is pending, even if an immigrant is
not a flight risk or poses no threat to the public. The court also noted
that a wide range of past conduct--including a number of nonviolent
offenses--triggered deportation proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the 9th Circuit stressed an anomaly: A separate federal
law permits bail for immigrants against whom a final deportation order
had been issued, once 90 days had elapsed since the order was issued.</TE>
<TE>   "If aliens subject to a final order of removal may be released on
bail, it makes little sense to deny bail to those who are in removal
proceedings but have not yet been ordered removed. The incentives to flee
are greater for an alien already ordered removed than for an alien still
in removal proceedings," wrote Fletcher, an appointee of President Bill
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   His opinion was joined by Judge Procter Hug Jr., an appointee of
President Jimmy Carter, and Judge John T. Noonan, an appointee of
President Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher wrote that the judges were troubled by the fact that outside
of this legal battle, "the government itself appears to have some doubt
about whether the no bail . . . detention is a desirable--let alone a
necessary--means of dealing with aliens subject to removal proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   His opinion noted that in testimony before Congress in September 1998,
just before the mandatory detention law took effect, then-INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the
agency was "exploring alternatives to detention for ensuring that aliens
for whom release from custody is appropriate appear for their scheduled
[deportation] hearings."</TE>
<TE>   Meissner also testified that "in some cases, no purpose is served by
maintaining the person in custody during the entire process."</TE>

<HD>Informants Help FBI Arrest 12 Suspected Members of Gang</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities hail 'a major disruption in the Wah Ching gang's
criminal activities' in the San Gabriel Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI's arrest of 12 suspected members of the notorious Wah Ching
gang resulted from a successful effort to develop informants within its
ranks, according to a court document.</LD>
<LD>   An FBI affidavit filed in Los Angeles federal court in connection with
Tuesday's arrests revealed that investigators were able to secretly
tape-record Wah Ching meetings and learn of their plans with the help of
two informants.</LD>
<LD>   One informant was described in the affidavit as a 15-year veteran of
the gang with a record of criminal convictions that includes burglary,
narcotics possession and receiving stolen goods.</LD>
<TE>   The other was identified as a five-year Wah Ching member. The
affidavit did not indicate whether he had any prior arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Both informants wore concealed tape-recording devices while working
for the FBI's Asian organized crime squad during a two-year investigation
targeting Wah Ching factions in the San Gabriel Valley. According to the
affidavit, one informant witnessed a gang murder. Both operatives
provided information enabling law enforcement officers to prevent other
violent acts.</TE>
<TE>   Penetrating tightly knit Asian crime groups has long been a challenge
for law enforcement in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald L. Iden, head of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said the arrests
have resulted in "a major disruption in the Wah Ching gang's criminal
activities and their ability to commit these crimes through the use of
violence and intimidation." Authorities said Wah Ching has been the
dominant Asian organized crime group in the San Gabriel Valley. Its
members have been known to engage in extortion, loan sharking,
prostitution, home robberies and credit card fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Charges filed in Los Angeles federal court against the 12 defendants
include murder in aid of racketeering, conspiracy to commit assault with
a dangerous weapon, carrying and possession of a firearm during a violent
crime, conspiracy to distribute marijuana and distribution of Ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   The murder allegation stemmed from the March drive-by shooting of
Jackson Ni, a Wah Ching member.</TE>
<TE>   Ni was mistakenly gunned down by a Wah Ching member who thought he
belonged to the rival Red Door gang, the affidavit said. At the time, the
Wah Ching gang was seeking to avenge an attack by members of the Red Door
and Four Seas gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said one informant drove the car from which the Wah
Ching assailant fired at Ni as he stood outside his home.</TE>
<TE>   In another episode, the affidavit described how a tip from one
informant enabled the FBI to thwart a Wah Ching plan to rob and shoot up
a brothel in Alhambra. The proprietor had balked at paying the gang
$3,000 a month and the gang was determined to teach him a lesson,
according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   With information provided by the informant, local police were able to
intercept a carload of gun-toting Wah Ching members.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested Tuesday were Kien Vay Luong, 35, of Rowland Heights;
Paul Cho Liu, 40, of El Monte; John Sun, 32, of Rosemead; Wai Yin Chu,
40, of Temple City; Michael Chang, 26, of San Gabriel; Hoang Minh Le, 21,
of Ontario; Minh Si Long, 20, of Pomona; Clarence Alani, 21, of Upland;
Tony Thai Chung, 21, of Fontana; Jose Angel Aguilar, 21, of Upland;
Stanley Po, 26, of Rosemead and a juvenile. Charges also were filed
against Andy Huynh, already in custody, and Ta Chun Shen, who is believed
to be overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers could not be reached Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Gold Line Tracks Are Barred at 21 Sites Till Study Is Done</HD>
<DH>Transit: PUC reverses interim decision about disputed crossings on
the L.A.-to-Pasadena light rail project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction of the light-rail line from downtown Los Angeles to
Pasadena suffered a setback Wednesday when the state Public Utilities
Commission refused to allow tracks to be laid across 21 intersections
before it can finish a review of potential safety issues.</LD>
<LD>   The panel voted 5 to 0 at a meeting in San Francisco not to allow the
construction authority to build at the disputed intersections on five
miles of right of way in Mt. Washington, Highland Park, South Pasadena
and Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Commission President Loretta Lynch said the panel may "decide those
crossings are safe" and pose no environmental risk, but the commission
"can't make that decision now."</LD>
<TE>   The intersections require additional review before a final decision
can be made.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch wrote a compromise motion that will allow construction to
continue at 40 other locations where tracks for the newly named Gold Line
will cross city streets. She said, "There's no benefit to anyone if the
commission acts hastily."</TE>
<TE>   Although Commissioner Richard P. Bilas voted for the compromise, he
said the decision burdens the project financially. It will force
construction to occur piecemeal, rather than in the sequence planned by
the authority. He predicted that this "difficulty will cause an
additional burden on taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Although critics of the project's design rejoiced at the PUC action,
construction authority officials sought to downplay the decision's impact
on the 13.7-mile, $732-million project.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't all that bad," said Rick Thorpe, executive director of the
construction authority and a veteran builder of light-rail lines in San
Diego and Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than focus on problems with the disputed intersections, Thorpe
stressed that the commission granted final approval to build tracks at
the 40 other crossings.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe said the PUC gave the green light to build from Union Station
through Chinatown and Lincoln Heights to near Avenue 45 in the Mt.
Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   The state agency, which regulates railroad crossings, also allowed
construction to proceed from Old Pasadena to the end of the line near
Sierra Madre Villa Avenue in East Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed intersections lie in the stretch between Avenue 45 and
the Del Mar station in Pasadena. Thorpe said the two ends of the line are
fine, with only construction in the middle section contested.</TE>
<TE>   If the issues surrounding the other intersections are not resolved by
early March, Thorpe said, the contractor could be delayed and costs could
rise well beyond the project's budget. At worst, he said, the authority
would have to find the money to build bridges over or tunnels under the
intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Cutts, co-chairwoman of a group opposing construction of the
rail route at grade through part of Pasadena, was thrilled by the
commission's decision.</TE>
<TE>   She argues that traffic will come to a halt at key intersections in
Pasadena unless the modern trolley trains are separated from vehicles.
Emergency vehicles also will have trouble reaching Huntington Memorial
Hospital, and pedestrians will face risks crossing the tracks, Cutts
contends.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC is examining the Pasadena rail line closely after giving
approval more than a decade ago to construction of a light-rail line from
Los Angeles to Long Beach. Fifty-nine people have been killed in
accidents along the heavily traveled Blue Line route, the worst rail
safety record in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Bilas, the commissioner assigned to rail safety issues, had issued an
interim order last year allowing the construction authority to proceed
with the disputed Gold Line crossings at its own risk. If approval was
not granted later, the rail builder could have been forced to tear out
track at disputed intersections.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a divided PUC voted to overturn Bilas' interim decision
on a 3-2 vote. Lynch said Bilas was wrong to allow construction to go
ahead without the full commission considering all of the safety and
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Carl Wood criticized the rail construction authority as
"sloppy" for proceeding with work before receiving a PUC go-ahead. "I
don't think it is a good idea for us to set a precedent of allowing
entities . . . to proceed with projects before receiving commission
approval," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch predicted that the light-rail project, renamed the Gold Line in
November, will be an excellent alternative for commuters. But she said
the commission must do its job to ensure safety.</TE>
<TE>   The safety and environmental review of the 21 disputed intersections
could be completed as early as May, PUC officials said.</TE>

<HD>The Man Who Couldn't Part With a Car Brochure</HD>

<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even when shopping for a new car, most people dump the advertising
brochure as soon as the salesman turns his back. But the late David R.
Holls, a well-known car designer, was an avid collector of car-related
materials.</LD>
<LD>   Ten thousand of Holls' catalogs, owner's manuals, pamphlets,
brochures, clippings and other items have been acquired by the Nethercutt
Collection and Museum, along with more than 9,000 of his car-related
photos.</LD>
<LD>   The Sylmar complex is home to more than 200 antique and classic cars
and a large collection of mechanized musical instruments.</LD>
<TE>   "David Holls was director of styling for General Motors and, before he
passed away, he amassed a wonderful, wonderful collection of automotive
sales and advertising literature and photographs," said Skip Marketti,
62, the Nethercutt's archivist and curator.</TE>
<TE>   Holls died in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, on June
16, 2000, at age 69.</TE>
<TE>   Marketti, who occasionally served as a judge with Holls at car shows,
said Holls' widow, Patricia, had contacted the museum to say the
collection was available. The Nethercutt paid $75,000 for the written
material. Patricia Holls donated the photographs--about 9,300 images,
Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   The David R. Holls Automotive Literature and Photo Collection will be
available to historians, writers, restorers and others, Marketti said.
The museum, created by Merle Norman Cosmetics co-founder J.B. Nethercutt,
is open to the public without charge.</TE>
<TE>   Holls collected material on American and foreign cars, with an
emphasis on automobiles from the 1920s through the '50s, Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you could name, he could pull out a binder and there, neatly
filed, was everything you wanted to know about the subject," said Dennis
Adler, editor in chief of Car Collector magazine.</TE>
<TE>   As a designer, Holls was perhaps best known for the 1959 Cadillac. The
design was wonderfully outrageous, Marketti said.</TE>
<TE>   "It had the tallest tail fins ever used on a car," Marketti said. "It
was long and low and totally bedecked with chrome. It was over the top.
It was the ultimate styling statement of the '50s."</TE>
<TE>   Other Holls designs include the 1964 Buick Riviera, the 1967 Chevrolet
Camaro and the Oldsmobile Aurora--very different cars but all great
looking in their own way, Marketti said. He speculated that Holls got his
"swoopy sense of style" from the great French coach builders of the
1920s, whom he admired.</TE>

<HD>City Helped by Real Estate Sales, but Still Facing Budget Shortfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A rebound in local real estate sales has brightened the financial
picture for Los Angeles city government, helping make up for losses in
other areas, according to a new report by the city's administrative
officer.</LD>
<LD>   But Los Angeles still faces a $22.3-million shortfall because of
dwindling tax revenue and increased security costs unless city officials
take steps to make cuts, City Administrative Officer William Fujioka
wrote in a report sent to city officials Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Like other governments, Los Angeles has been hurt by the economic
slowdown. Hotel tax receipts are down 11% from last year. In the fall,
city officials predicted that declining sales and empty hotels would
reduce the tax revenue that pays for city services included in Los
Angeles' $3-billion budget.</LD>
<TE>   Faced with those predictions, Mayor James K. Hahn in October
implemented a city hiring freeze and asked each department to come up
with a plan to reduce spending by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Those cost-cutting measures, according to Fujioka, are now expected to
save the city $49.4 million. The budget reduction proposals must be
approved by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the city has been helped by strong real estate sales in the
summer and fall. Officials had predicted a 5% decline in sales for the
fiscal year. Instead, real-estate-related tax receipts are up by almost
4%.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals from city departments for saving money include a wide
variety of ideas. Among them are proposals to defer building skate parks,
to pay for new police and fire equipment with bonds instead of cash, and
to not fill vacancies in the library systems while some branches are
closed for renovations.</TE>
<TE>   "In tough financial times, this is a road map to get us to the end of
the year in good financial shape," Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said.
"It's dependent on ensuring the departments and the City Council are
disciplined about savings."</TE>
<TE>   If the cuts are implemented, the mayor will consider lifting the ban
on city hiring, Middlebrook added.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla said the council will evaluate the
proposals in the next few weeks and consider each cut on a case-by-case
basis.</TE>
<TE>   "I am optimistic that given the diversity of our local economy and the
magnitude of the dollars we deal with at city level, we're in pretty good
shape to weather the storm," Padilla said. "I don't foresee any drastic
cuts . . . just a little tightening of the belts."</TE>

out to be a videotaped medley of his career, and a brief appearance at
the end of the evening as Jackson received the Artist of the Century
award.</TE>
<TE>   The pop icon got caught in a battle of awards shows last month when
Dick Clark, who produced the AMA show, filed a $10-million unfair
business practices lawsuit against Grammy President Michael Greene. The
suit alleged that Greene maintains a policy of prohibiting artists from
playing on the annual Grammy Awards telecast if they perform on the
competing AMA program.</TE>
<TE>   Country singer Garth Brooks, who won an Award of Merit, said backstage
that the feud between the awards shows would only hurt the performers and
their music.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'Back off. You're nothing without the artists.' "</TE>
<TE>   Singer Sheryl Crow echoed his complaint: "It would be really good next
year not to have that kind of feud."</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, Greene told Jackson that if he appeared on
Clark's show this year, he wouldn't be invited to the Grammys. On
Wednesday, a spokesman for the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences, which sponsors the Grammys, said the show had not been booked
yet. But a spokesman for Jackson's management company said Jackson was
scheduled to perform at the Feb. 27 awards show, which CBS will broadcast
live from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what song, but he's performing," the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's appearance struck industry observers as a compromise that
would allow him to do both shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's proceeding with caution," said Thomas O'Neil, author of a
series of books about awards shows.</TE>

<HD>Woman Shot to Death in Front of Her Home</HD>

<LD>A 23-year-old teacher's assistant was shot to death in front of her
home, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Latoya Jackson was standing with a group of friends and family outside
her parents' house in the 1600 block of West 127th Street in the
unincorporated Athens area of Los Angeles County late Monday when a man
walked up to the group and opened fire.</LD>
<LD>   The gunman fired one bullet at the group, fatally striking Jackson in
the upper body, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said no one in the group knew the shooter. He was last seen
running north on nearby Denker Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   At Jackson's home Tuesday, family and friends cried quietly, still in
shock.</TE>
<TE>   Clair Bennett, the victim's sister-in-law, said the evening started
off uneventfully. Jackson had come home from her job as a special
education assistant at nearby Washington Preparatory High School, where
she had worked about two years. She washed her hair and took her beloved
dog, Quincy, for a walk. She sat outside with the family for a while, but
then decided it was time to call it a night.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the conversation just kind of started up again, and she stayed
out here a little longer," Bennett said. That's when Bennett and the
others saw the man walk toward them and shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Jackson wanted to be a corrections officer and was
preparing to take a qualifying exam Monday."She was very independent and
wanted to better herself," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Silburn, a friend since childhood, recalled tearfully that
Jackson was "outgoing and always willing to help somebody. She was always
laughing and joking."</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers described her as a quiet young woman who had a way with
kids. "The kids loved her because she knew how to talk to them," said
Karen Hill, a teacher's assistant at the school. "They knew if they did
something wrong, she wasn't one of those teachers who would be loud and
embarrass them."</TE>

<HD>Parent Company Orders Billboard Work Halted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company that tried to build 25 giant billboards on land owned by
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority without getting city approval
was ordered Wednesday to abandon that effort.</LD>
<LD>   In a victory for Los Angeles, officials for Viacom told its
subsidiary, STI/Omni Outdoor, to dismantle construction already done on
the billboards. That work had begun just hours before a new law
prohibiting it took effect Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "Viacom was very troubled by the events that transpired in the last
week and a half," said Viacom spokesman Howard Sunkin.</LD>
<TE>   Ellen Berkowitz, STI/Omni's attorney, declined comment late Wednesday.
One of her assistants told a Superior Court judge last week that the
billboard company had acted in accordance with its MTA contract, which
gave the firm permission to put up 41 double-sided billboards and 10
kiosks on MTA property in Southern California in exchange for installing
toilets at MTA facilities.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials, however, said the agreement required the company to
obtain local permits before erecting any signs. A new law also requires
those permits.</TE>
<TE>   Acting at the request of the MTA and the city, the judge ordered
STI/Omni to stop construction until a hearing could be held on the matter
Jan. 25.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said Viacom assured him late Wednesday
that STI will "remove all these illegal signs and restore the property to
its original condition."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major victory in the battle for our neighborhoods,"
Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who serves on the MTA
board, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The action reflected a certain amount of arrogance on the part of
[STI/Omni]," he said. "I don't think it would be fair to paint the whole
billboard industry with a broad brush, but they have tried to flex their
financial and political muscle for decades in Los Angeles. The message is
that even for billboard companies, there is a limit to what government is
going to take."</TE>
<TE>   MTA and city officials discovered on New Year's Day that STI/Omni had
begun sign construction along Los Angeles-area freeways. In the days that
followed, city officials pressured parent Viacom to force STI to remove
the giant poles--or face the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the billboard industry understands that they have to abide by
the law," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. "They should be prepared to
distance themselves from any company that behaves as renegades."</TE>
<TE>   City Council members had said on Tuesday they would consider canceling
a separate $750-million deal with Viacom, which is set to install and
maintain street furniture and public toilets in Los Angeles over the next
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Viacom wants to save the deal with the city of Los Angeles
on the street furniture," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who serves on the
MTA board.</TE>
<TE>   " . . . The message is, you can't try to sidestep and go around local
jurisdiction."</TE>

News-Enterprise reported a complaint from a resident that someone had
rearranged the two reindeer on her front lawn. She found them in an
amorous position.</LD>
<LD>   Risque Only in L.A.! Yes, in still another ruse to improve my ratings,
this column is going tabloid today, as you can see from the above item,
as well as the artwork (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   I've got a scandalous story about Congress, spotted in a suburban
newspaper by Irene DeBlasio of Studio City. There's also an X-rated salad
(found by Michelle Pfister) and a bizarre sale (snapped by Dick Barnes).</LD>
<TE>   And, of course, I have the requisite tabloid story about a medical
operation performed on an extraterrestrial (from Clyde Flowers of Long
Beach). If anyone tells you it was actually a story about liens in the
L.A. Daily Journal, don't you believe it.</TE>
<TE>   Kinky Hollywood: In our continuing study of unnatural cinematic family
trees, Carol Covey points out that precocious Sean Connery (b. 1930)
played the father of Dustin Hoffman (b. 1937) in "Family Business" and
the pappy of Harrison Ford (b. 1942) in "Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of guys, Michael Schlesinger adds that "The Halliday Brand,"
a 1957 western, "starred a 52-year-old Joseph Cotten as the
not-too-convincing son of 54-year-old Ward Bond."</TE>
<TE>   In the sensitive mother-son area, Rick Mitchell notes that Ava Gardner
(b. 1922) was (incredibly) the daughter of Lorne Greene (b. 1915) in
"Earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   And Nancy Painter chimes in with Angela Lansbury (b. 1925) playing the
mom of Warren Beatty (b. 1937) in "All Fall Down."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Zeppo Marx (b. 1901) was the son of Groucho (b. 1890), his
real-life brother, in "Horse Feathers."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Groucho, at one point, declares: "You have the brain of a
4-year-old child--and I bet he was glad to get rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   The long claw of the law: I told you about the man who was arrested in
Redondo Beach after he allegedly stole "a lobster from a restaurant tank
[and] concealed it in his clothing. He was detained by employees before
being arrested."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, who suffered no injuries, should consider himself lucky
that he wasn't more greedy. An Ann Landers column recently carried a
story about a thief who grabbed two lobsters from a tank in Bristol,
England, "and shoved them in his trousers."</TE>
<TE>   He was fleeing on foot when the liberated creatures suddenly pinched
him in a very private place. The hangers-on had to be removed with
pliers. A doctor said the thief will never become a father. "Basically,"
the medical man explained, "it was a do-it-yourself vasectomy."</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   After an item appeared here about a reported theft of a Plymouth
"Viagra," some readers questioned my theory that the car must have been a
Voyager.</TE>
<TE>   OK, I agree that an Acura Vigor would seem a more likely candidate for
such a mistake. As would a Suzuki Vitara. But I checked and the stolen
car was indeed a Plymouth. So get off my case, will you? Gee, I don't
know why I'm so crabby today.</TE>

<HD>Schools Official Accused of Theft</HD>
<DH>Crime: San Marino district says the former maintenance director
used false invoices to steal $50,000. He faced charges in previous job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former San Marino schools administrator was charged Wednesday
with embezzling more than $50,000 through a series of false invoices for
district equipment and labor.</LD>
<LD>   John Hughes, former maintenance director for the San Marino Unified
School District, is charged with one felony count of misappropriation of
funds and one felony count of embezzlement with the special circumstance
that he took more than $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   He faces up to eight years in prison if convicted, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Kerry White.</LD>
<TE>   Hughes, 38, of South Pasadena, resigned Dec. 12 after an investigation
by school district officials into financial discrepancies was turned over
to police.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes did not return telephone calls to his home Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County prosecutors last fall charged Hughes with
misappropriation of funds from the San Bernardino City Unified School
District, where he worked until the San Marino district hired him in
October 1999. They alleged that he acquired a digital camera and
listening devices at district expense and used them to illegally listen
to conversations of employees.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 21, Hughes pleaded no contest to misdemeanor eavesdropping to
resolve that case, said Susan Mickey, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino
County district attorney's office. He was sentenced to three years'
probation, she said.</TE>
<TE>'Unfortunate This Happened'</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County prosecutors allege that Hughes, who oversaw all
maintenance work in the San Marino district, embezzled money from April
2000 to July 2001 by creating false invoices and bills.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we discovered the discrepancies, we acted to address the
problem and called in the police," said Jack Rose, San Marino schools
superintendent. "When you put someone in this kind of position, you don't
expect this kind of thing to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Rose said the district conducted an internal probe and discovered more
than $50,000 missing. "He billed for things that never existed," Rose
said.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Becky Ung said it "is unfortunate this
happened. This is money we could have used to educate our children."</TE>
<TE>   San Marino district officials said they had no reports of any problems
with Hughes when he was hired. They placed him on administrative leave in
November while the matter was investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said Wednesday that they will examine accounts
at the San Bernardino schools that Hughes had access to for potential
discrepancies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to keep Sherman Oaks' Jewish community center open, 150
people who attended an emergency fund-raising rally Wednesday were urged
to collect $120,000.</LD>
<LD>   The center's advisory board hopes that raising the money will prompt
the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles to keep the Valley Cities Jewish
Community Center open at least a year after the slated June closure. The
umbrella group announced in December that it would close five of seven
facilities, including the Sherman Oaks site.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot sit back and wait for some angel to do it for us," said
Michael Brezner, an advisory committee member at the center. Those
attending the meeting received donation envelopes.</LD>
<TE>   The centers, which have operated for more than 40 years, have provided
adult education and teenage programs for hundreds of families.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley center in West Hills will remain open, as will the
Westside facility on Olympic Boulevard, where officials have promised an
$8-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Financial woes and a 30% membership drop have cut available funding,
prompting the federation to use the other centers' deeds as collateral
for its $3-million loan to their program.</TE>
<TE>   The Sherman Oaks center's committee hopes to sign contracts to run the
after-school and some educational programs and raise another $120,000
throughout this year.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Errors Didn't Affect Compton Vote</HD>

<LD>A judge said Wednesday that Compton City Clerk Charles Davis
"failed in his duties" to properly supervise the June 5 mayoral election,
but ruled that resulting errors did not affect the election's outcome.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin issued her ruling after attorneys
representing former Mayor Omar Bradley and current Mayor Eric Perrodin
agreed that workers in 30 of Compton's voting precincts had filled out
certification documents incompletely.</LD>
<LD>   Chirlin said responsibility for "errors and irregularities . . . falls
squarely on the shoulders of the person responsible for supervising the
election."</LD>
<TE>   The errors and omissions included missing tallies of voters, failure
to note which voters had received absentee ballots and missing precinct
worker signatures.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't known, however, whether Wednesday's ruling will ultimately
affect the outcome of Bradley's lawsuit challenging the election, which
he lost by 261 votes.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling ended the fourth phase of the trial, which Chirlin is
hearing in seven phases, or "mini trials."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley Hertz, said the ruling is "more dirt added
to the mountain of evidence that the judge will have to consider when she
decides whether the election reflects the will of Compton's voters."</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Gridley, the attorney representing Compton, stressed
Chirlin's finding that the errors did not affect the election's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorneys, he said, "came into this trial claiming some kind
of wide-ranging conspiracy, but what they've come down to is documents
that aren't completely filled out."</TE>
<TE>   After the ruling, Chirlin began hearing arguments in the trial's fifth
phase, in which Bradley's attorneys will try to disqualify more than 500
absentee ballots because signatures on them and their envelopes didn't
match, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorneys say Chirlin should make a final ruling based on
the cumulative results of the trial's phases.</TE>
<TE>   Compton's attorneys say Bradley must show enough evidence to prevail
on a single phase.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin has put off that decision until all phases of the trial are
complete, according to attorneys for both sides.</TE>

<HD>Schools Chief Is Investigated</HD>
<DH>Money: His former employer wants Compton's new superintendent to
return $390,000 in incentives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton's new schools superintendent is being investigated by state
and local prosecutors in New Mexico for bonuses and benefits he received
as the top education official in the city of Las Cruces.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse Gonzales retired from the Las Cruces superintendency last year
to accept the job as Compton's first locally appointed superintendent
since 1993. State Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, citing
Gonzales' strong record in New Mexico, restored full authority to
Compton's school board after an eight-year state takeover, the longest in
California history.</LD>
<LD>   But in November, the civil division of the New Mexico attorney
general's office disclosed that it had opened an investigation into
whether $390,000 in various incentives for Gonzales were legally approved
by the Las Cruces school board. On Wednesday, Susan Riedel, chief deputy
district attorney in Las Cruces, said her office had launched a criminal
investigation into the matter. She declined to comment further.</LD>
<TE>   Central to the probes are $56,271 in retirement benefits and a $55,000
bonus given to Gonzales during his 12-year tenure as superintendent.
Also, he got, among other things, three life insurance policies for which
the district paid more than $200,000. He received them, board members and
an attorney for Gonzales say, as inducements to stay in Las Cruces.</TE>
<TE>   Board minutes show no record of the payments. Critics say they were
approved in secret.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Cruces board has recently acknowledged this error in
disclosure and demanded that Gonzales repay all the money it spent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he used the board," said Earl Nissen, a university teacher
who is leading an effort to recall board members who approved the
payments. "Dr. Gonzales is an opportunist."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales refuses to reimburse the district. In a nine-page letter
released through his lawyer, Gonzales notes that it was the board, not
he, who approved the benefits and inducements. As a result, before the
Compton post, he turned down better-paying jobs in Florida, Texas and
Colorado to stay in Las Cruces.</TE>
<TE>   Allies of Gonzales dismiss the investigations as a product of his
strained relations with the local teachers union. A Las Cruces school
board member who is the father of the union chief requested the state
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gonzales regrets the board's "technical noncompliance" with
open-meetings laws, "the actions of the board were the product of its
recognition of Dr. Gonzales' excellent performance," Gonzales' lawyer,
Leonard J. Piazza, said in a letter.</TE>
<TE>   But the episode has soured views of Gonzales in Las Cruces. He was an
area native who was credited with rising test scores, lower dropout rates
and new construction. The Las Cruces Sun-News, long friendly to him, said
in an editorial recently: "Gonzales has done a lot of harm to this
community, which so nourished him. He owes it not only to pay the money
back, he owes it to come clean."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday called for a review of
gang- and narcotics-related law enforcement efforts citywide after a
Boyle Heights community group made a plea for more drug stings in their
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Hollenbeck area station's community police advisory
board, a citizens' group, told the commission that they were concerned
about drug sales from homes in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Chief Julius I. Davis said part of the problem may be that
anti-terrorism efforts after Sept. 11 have required some police forces to
be shifted from regular duties.</LD>
