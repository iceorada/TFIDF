<LD>Alanis Morissette's "Under Rug Swept" entered the national album
sales chart at No. 1 on Wednesday, barely holding off a post-Grammy
charge by the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.</LD>
<LD>   Morissette's album sold 215,000 copies during its first week in
the stores, which gave it an approximately 6,000 sales edge over the
traditional country and bluegrass of "O Brother," which won an
armload of Grammys last week, including best album of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the Grammy exposure, the soundtrack's sales increased
from 58,000 two weeks ago to 209,000 last week. That surge pushed "O
Brother" from No. 15 on the sales chart to No. 2, the album's highest
position since its release in December 2000. The album's total sales
are now more than 4.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   Other Grammy winners who enjoyed dramatic sales increases last
week included Alicia Keys (who won five Grammys, including best new
artist), U2 (four Grammys, including best record for "Walk On"),
Nelly Furtado (female pop vocal) and Bob Dylan (contemporary folk
album).</TE>
<TE>   Keys' "Songs in A Minor" jumped from No. 20 to No. 4; U2's "All
That You Can't Leave Behind" moved from No. 28 to No. 10; Furtado's
"Whoa Nelly!" streaked from No. 63 to No.38; and Dylan's "Love and
Theft" soared from No. 175 to No. 72.</TE>
<TE>   Though R&amp;B singer India.Arie, who had seven nominations, didn't
win an award, the Grammy night exposure still spurred enough interest
for her album, "Acoustic Soul," to jump from No. 32 to No. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Morissette, new albums by Kylie Minogue and Cher also
entered the Top 10 this week. Minogue's "Fever" was No. 3, with sales
of 115,000, while Cher's "Living Proof" was No. 9, based on sales of
82,000.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the Top 10 were held by Linkin Park
(5), Alan Jackson (6), Jennifer Lopez (7) and Ludacris (8).</TE>
<TE>   Of all the albums in the Top 40, Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory"
continues to be the leader in total albums sold with 6.4 million
after 54 weeks on the chart. It is trailed by Enya's "A Day Without
Rain" (5.6 million, 67 weeks) and "Songs in A Minor" (4.7 million, 36
weeks).</TE>
<TE>   The nation's best-selling single is B2K's "Uh Huh," followed by
Mr. Cheeks' "Lights, Camera, Action!"</TE>

<LD>   Kathleen Hanna has ruffled a lot of feathers in her day, first as
the leader of the riot grrrl house band Bikini Kill, then with the

album "Feminist Sweepstakes" has returned her to the front lines.</LD>

<TE>   ''To Do Battle: Conflict, Struggle &amp; Symbol in Art,'' an
especially timely exhibition opening Friday at the Norton Simon
Museum, serves as a reminder that human conflict is as persistent a
theme in art as in history itself. Planned before Sept. 11, the
exhibition will explore, through an assortment of violent images, the
struggles of men versus women, good versus evil, man in combat with
animals and the horrors of war. The objects come from the collections
of the Simon, the Getty and the Grunwald Center for Graphic Arts at
UCLA.</TE>

<TE>   After the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard,
playwright and director Moises Kaufman ("Gross Indecency") and his

Kaufman's film, "The Laramie Project." The 56-member cast includes
Steve Buscemi, Janeane Garofalo, Laura Linney, Camryn Manheim and
Christina Ricci. This examination of homophobia in America debuted at

<TE>   Founded a quarter-century ago, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago has
grown from a jazz-oriented show-dance company to a prime exponent of
contemporary versatility. The company is able to dance just about
anything from the world of modern dance and make it clear, strong and
accessible. The current tour repertory features Ohad Naharin'sv
"Passomezzo" and "Minus 16" (both danced to an assortment of
recordings), Trey McIntyre's "Split" (music by Art Blakey ) and a
preview of artistic director Jim Vincent's "counter/part" (J. S.
Bach). And lest you think that dance is diversion with no practical
value, each Hubbard performance will leave the audience with the
recipe for company dancer Joey Pantaleon's all-natural guacamole.</TE>

<LD>   If you've ever sat in Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and wondered, "How
do they do that?," here's a chance to find out. The distinguished
young American violinist Pamela Frank will give a violin and chamber
music master class that's free and open to the public. The program,
sponsored by the Music Center, is designed to give music students and
non-musicians alike a look at how classical music comes alive.
Recovery from an illness has caused Frank to cancel two scheduled
performances with the L.A. Chamber Orchestra, but this appearance
will go on as planned.</LD>

<TE>   2pm Poetry</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one of the greatest compliments of a poet's career is to
be well read. Sharon Olds is one of America's best-selling active
poets. Critics are often divided on her work, which graphically deals
with the pleasures and pains of everyday life. Some see in her words
fine attention to detail, others dismiss it as lacking depth. And yet
there's no arguing with her success. She's won a Book Critics Circle
Award (for 1984's "The Dead and the Living"), a Walt Whitman Citation
of Merit and was the poet laureate of New York state from 1998 to
1999.</TE>

<TE>   Sometimes collision, not necessity, is the mother of invention.
The new exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, ''Central
European Avant-Gardes: Exchange and Transformation, 1910-1930,''
looks at cross-fertilization of influences among painters, sculptors
and designers in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the former
Yugoslavia and what is now the Czech Republic during the evolution of
modernism. As modernism was taking hold, the cities that fostered it
were growing into cosmopolitan centers, and the show looks at
exhibitions and performances that inspired cultural exchange.</TE>

<LD>   As America reasserts, and perhaps reassesses, its role in
maintaining peace around the globe, the exhibition "Peaceful
Warriors" at the Museum of Tolerance serves as a reminder that the
strongest leaders don't always carry guns. Artworks, photographs and
archival objects document the convictions of legendary nonviolent
heroes, including Sojourner Truth, Lech Walesa, Jane Addams and
Desmond Tutu. Original letters from Ghandi and speeches from the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. are also part of the display.</LD>
<LD>   "Peaceful Warriors," Museum of Tolerance, Simon Wiesenthal Plaza,
1399 S. Roxbury Drive, West L.A. Mondays to Thursdays, 11:30 a.m. to
4 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Ends
April 4. $9, children under 12 are free. (310) 553-8403.</LD>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Even if you can't tell Mozambique from Maracaibo, Manchuria or
Muskogee, the first local visit by the 25-member National Song and
Dance Company of Mozambique should turn you into a budding Africanist
with a display of warrior dances, celebration rituals and a cappella
singing that the New York Times called "exhilarating" on a previous
tour. "Age-old traditional dance and music were filtered through a
modern sensibility to produce an extraordinarily vital and subtle new
art," the Times explained. Based in the capital city of Maputo, the
company's repertory reflects an array of vivid cultures: Portuguese,
Arab and sub-Saharan African traditions all footloose in a young
nation that achieved its independence only in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   National Song and Dance Company of Mozambique, Campbell Hall, UC
Santa Barbara campus, Mesa Road, Santa Barbara, 8 p.m. $16-$28. (805)
893-3535. Also Friday, 8 p.m., in Marsee Auditorium, El Camino
College, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. $12 (children) to $26. (310)

<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Cirque du Soleil has pitched the blue-and-yellow big top in the
parking lot next to the Queen Mary for its circus fantasy, "Dralion,"
the first show from the French Canadian circus to play in Long Beach.
You won't see dancing bears or elephants--there are no live animals
in this theatrical spectacular--but the title character, "Dralion,"
should suffice: It's part dragon, part lion. But, as usual, the most
amazing animals are the humans, who balance, swing, jump and contort
in remarkable fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "Dralion," Queen Mary, 1126 Queen's Highway, Pier J, Long Beach,
today, 8 p.m. only. Regular schedule: Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m.;
Thursdays-Fridays, 5 and 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1
and 5 p.m. Ends March 31. $31.50-$65. (800) 678-5440.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The Blasters' recorded output was concentrated into a few short
years in the early '80s, but they remain a legendary force in Los
Angeles rock history and in the roots-rock movement. Dave Alvin has
since carved out a distinctive solo career, and his brother Phil has
soldiered on with a revamped Blasters, but when Rhino Records puts
out a two-CD retrospective, it's time to rally the troops. Dave and
Phil, along with pianist Gene Taylor and the rhythm section of Bill
Bateman and John Bazz, will play together for the first time since
1987 to mark this week's release of "Testament: The Complete Slash
Recordings."</TE>
<TE>   The Blasters, with the Kelly Bowlin Band and the James Theroux
Band, Galaxy Theatre, 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana, 8 p.m. $26.50.
(714) 957-0600. Also Friday at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd.,
West Hollywood, 9 p.m. $20. (323) 848-5100.</TE>

<HD>A Place to Chill Out</HD>
<DH>Between summers, the beach can be a refuge for
contemplation, a quiet escape to nature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN GASLIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's cold--cold for a day at the beach, cold for Southern California,
at least, something like 50, maybe 55--and Bobby Ruiz is still making
milkshakes, scooping vanilla ice cream into paper cups and setting
them aside for later. Outside the tiny Orange County coast snack shop
where Ruiz prepares chilly treats hours before anyone will eat them,
the horizon is a pale blur of white and gray, sky and Pacific. Up and
down this coast, volleyball nets sway empty, early risers cruise
boardwalks in knit hats and heavy jackets, acres of sand lie empty,
and it's cold, cold for a day at the beach. Despite the gray, the
fog, there is still a sign in front of the Shake Shack, the yellow
hut atop a cliff where Ruiz makes milkshakes, boasting the unspoken
slogan for this misunderstood, wintertime shore: "Open All Year."</LD>
<TE>   The coast of Southern California in this, the off-season, defies
its Jan and Dean mythology, and the rugged, clear-your-head oasis
that many leave Los Angeles to seek along the northern coast, away
from everything, can actually be found right here, in the
traditionally teeming skin bazaars of Manhattan and Huntington and
Malibu. During what passes as winter here, bikinis and Boogie boards
and shoulder-to-sunburned-shoulder crowds give way to a different
place altogether--some say a more inviting, more real place. The
water moves in strange directions and takes on deeper colors, the
waves sound louder, the sand appears often unspoiled, the wildlife
features a winter-only cast, and the few humans who seek out this
place come here not for the ocean, but something deeper.</TE>
<TE>   "The beach is the only place you can really go--other than the
movies, I guess--alone, to just think and meditate, and you see a lot
more of that in the winter," says David Cooke, a Laguna Beach oil
painter who has spent many hours simply staring at the ocean, winter
and summer, painting its textures, replicating the way the water
catches light, throws shadows. Lately, Cooke has moved away from
traditional outdoor plein-air art--the
paint-it-while-the-light-is-good views of, say, a Laguna sunset--to
focus on the people who come to the beach, capturing how they
congregate, how long they stay, what they do. For many, he says, the
almost artificial need to party, to have fun, eases in these
off-months, and those who come here do so to get away from
everything, rather than to find more of it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer, there's a lot of static and interference, there's
a lot more energy and distraction," Cooke says. "In the wintertime,
you see that there's hardly anyone out there, and those who are,
they're kind of quiet and solemn. And they're local people."</TE>
<TE>   This might well be the more vital of the seasons, when nature
steals the spotlight from culture and offers a clear view of both
wonders and wrongs, both the winter-only migratory animals and the
rainy-season runoff from a nearby civilization. Those who gravitate
toward this neighborhood, those who recognize this other face, have
found the beach for the rest of us. No longer an activity or a day
trip, it's home.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, a generically beachy stretch of Manhattan
Beach known as the Strand looks like an expensive, abandoned movie
set: Alfredo's All-Natural Smoothie Bar is shuttered, and three
people sitting in beach chairs almost literally have this place to
themselves. Within a mile of beachfront here, as the temperature
approaches 60 degrees or so, not exactly cold, not even for the
beach, only one woman sunbathes and three men play volleyball. They
all wear shirts. Up and down the coast, there are similar scenes on
vast sandy playgrounds left for the locals.</TE>
<TE>   On the Strand, Rick Fehnel is there with his dog Josephine, a cell
phone and a pile of newspapers. He's sitting on a bench looking at
the water, thinking about his work, his future, "where it's all
going." He lives right around the corner, he says, and this is pretty
typical chill-out time.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Annie Riveron sits on a blanket with her shoes kicked off,
eating a burrito, feeding bits of it to the half-dozen sea gulls
crowded nearby. "I like to come out here and set my goals," she says,
breaking from her silent strategy session for her business as a
personal finance consultant. She is distracted by a flurry of gulls
fighting over bits of burrito. "They're very competitive," she says,
lost in thought, "these birds."</TE>
<TE>   Thinking, it seems, is the volleyball of the off-season. Many of
those I encounter, in fog and sunshine, admit to having a lot--or, as
the case may be, nothing whatsoever--on their minds. Carol Moss, who
has lived on a beachfront stretch of Malibu for more than 30 years,
hosts a weekly meditation session at her house, inviting a half-dozen
people to sit near the ocean and do absolutely nothing, in absolute
quiet, for 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things you do in meditation is try to be aware of
things, and anything to do with the waves and the environment becomes
part of the mediation," she says. "It's very, very quiet."</TE>
<TE>   In the off-season, she says, the clear minds in these sitting
sessions can find a deeper sense of seclusion and peace, as her
neighborhood becomes a ghost town, as almost everyone else returns to
their "first" homes somewhere else and the students--she doesn't know
most of them, as they found her through word of mouth--sit behind her
house and just listen to the water. "It's funny," she says, "how you
can be silent with somebody and it can be a very intimate
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   For others, this season of quiet is a chance to actually get to
know your neighbors, to share your great big backyard--the baseball
yard, the barbecue yard. "There's definitely a huge difference: Less
lifeguards, less people, less helicopters--and you don't have planes
with banners selling beer and whatever's onstage at the magic club,"
says Rod Riegel, a very tan 20th Century Fox executive who, at nearly
noon on a Thursday, sits in a folding chair near his house on the
Strand, wearing shorts and a sweatshirt. "In the winter, it feels
like you're skipping school. This is the great undiscovered season,
and we'd like to keep it that way: secret."</TE>
<TE>   He sees the beach as an extension of his own house, and that molds
the dynamic of the entire neighborhood. Nobody has a traditional yard
here. This means, he says, that "the beach is the final point of
congregation, and people tend to think of this as their backyard."</TE>
<TE>   The off-season also makes it clear that this playground, the
beach, is also an ecosystem, a fragile breeding ground, a hunting
range and habitat on the edge of a massive metropolis. Never is it
more obvious than after a winter rainstorm, less frequent this year
than in most, how much complex chemical waste and simple
bag-and-bottle garbage washes from the city streets onto the beach.
"Most people aren't aware of the effect the city has on the beach,
but the people who are regulars, who go to the beach all year, see
how much trash there is," says Cassie Carter, a biologist and program
director for Heal the Bay, a watchdog and education group focused on
cleaning up the coast. "There's a sense, a feeling of helplessness,
though. It does feel overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   She talks about cans and cups thrown on city streets, and toxins
freed from asphalt crevices by the rain, and the tiny bits of
plastic, "microplastics," she calls them, that just build up in
animal stomachs, making them feel full, possibly killing them. She
also talks about how you might see, this time of year, the brown
pelicans in their breeding colors (note the red on their beaks) and
large osprey hawks, hunting for smelt and anchovy just offshore. The
border between city and nature, during this season of rain and fog,
becomes all too clear. Stand on the rocky shores of San Pedro, and
maybe you will catch a glimpse of gray whales turning the bend,
headed north from Baja, or porpoises and, more rarely, seals. And
maybe do your best to find a Western sandpiper, a whimbrel, a marbled
godwit or, at the very least, a ruddy turnstone--birds that spend the
spring and summer north of here, unseen by most beachgoers, says
bird-watcher and Santa Monica Bay Audubon Society member Chuck Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing them in the winter, too, you're not seeing them in their
breeding plumage, so they're not as brightly colored," says Bragg,
who joins a monthly society trip to the Malibu lagoon, off-season or
not. "The ruddy turnstones, for example, are off-brown in the winter,
not ruddy at all."</TE>
<TE>   Keep an eye out, too, he says, for the snowy plover, a delicate
white-and-gray fellow. Local bird-watchers report sightings of the
endangered bird, seen in these parts only in the winter, to a central
hotline keeping tabs on its movement.</TE>
<TE>   Stop for a minute, as Bragg does, and look at this place. Listen
to it. Anywhere's fine, but maybe stop here at Zuma Beach, north of
Malibu, where, late in the afternoon, the sand remains neatly combed
from the morning cleaning and a woman runs between the ocean and
hundreds of empty parking spaces. The waves here, now, in the winter,
are the center of attention, rather than the sun. Even if Los Angeles
seems to outsiders to have no seasons, even if we consider ourselves
immune from the effects of the Earth tilting 23 degrees away from the
sun, the ocean itself makes subtle changes.</TE>
<TE>   "The shadows and the light on the water are a lot richer during
more of the day," says painter Cooke. During winter, the sun travels
lower in the sky and so hits the water from a less direct angle,
creating a more stunning play of light on the ripples and waves, more
shadows and colors. "In the summer, it's just bright and washed out,
with no shadows. Right now, it's almost like sunset or sunrise all
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Rough water, driftwood and debris slide down snow-shedding
mountains, bringing mild drama to those coasts near streams, and the
ocean itself seems to move from the north instead of the south. The
swells now come from Alaska rather than South America, as in the
summer, and tend to be colder, though not necessarily bigger. So
surfers wear wetsuits, or thicker wetsuits, or two at a time, and a
few head to north-facing beaches that you simply can't surf in the
summer months, riding waves you can only ride this time of year in
Ventura, in Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   The tides, too, reverse themselves, riding high in the morning,
low in the afternoon, says Marine Safety Officer Tom Trager, one of
four off-season lifeguards at Laguna Beach, compared with 100 in the
summer. (In Los Angeles County the number of lifeguards more than
quadruples in the summer.) So a few afternoon tide-poolers get
stranded on Laguna's rocks when the water retreats unexpectedly. But
beyond rescuing them, Trager and the other lifeguards spend the
winter running cliff-rescue and fire drills, saving overzealous scuba
divers and, well, taking it easy. "Last weekend it was unexpectedly
warm, so the beach was almost packed," he says, "but almost nobody
was in the water."</TE>
<TE>   As the sun rises behind Huntington Beach, one of the most famous
and summery of all Southern California's shores, Betty Peterson curls
up on the sand, staring into the gray waves, her wetsuit on,
surfboard beside her. The water teems with bobbing bodies and their
fiberglass transports, and most of her team, the surf team from Long
Beach's Millikan High School, is already out there.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets really cold," she says, and sometimes, "it gets so cold
that your hands want to fall off." Still, she and the others come out
here four times a week, before school, even when it's so foggy that
they run into each other, that Peterson can't see the waves until
they're right on top of her. She stares at the waves for a few more
minutes, her arms wrapped around her knees, and then she picks up her
board and runs into the water.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through the dawn past Peterson is a woman in pink tights
and a purple knit hat, a scarf and running shoes and not much on her
mind at all. "I try not to think very much, try to be one with the
ocean. When you have too much on your mind or too much around you,
you're separated from this nature," Leia Cha says, walking as she
does every morning. She owns a boutique on Huntington Beach's Main
Street and so, for business reasons, would rather have the strip
overrun with tourists in bikinis. But she also lives here. She gets
along best with the beach in its off-season mood. "There's something
very mystical about it, and you get a lightness, you feel like
nothing bothers you," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She keeps walking, toward the pier, toward rows of empty
volleyball nets and unused parking spaces and shuttered bike rental
shops, and she stops, every few feet, to watch the waves roll onto
the shore.</TE>

<LD>Count snowy plovers: Watch seasonal birds at the Malibu Lagoon with
the Santa Monica Bay Audubon Society. Outings meet the fourth Sunday
of every month at 8:30 a.m. (for adults) and 10 a.m. (for families
with kids) in the lagoon parking lot. Information:
home.att.net/~cgbraggjr</LD>
<LD>   Pick up some trash: Or a lot of it, depending on the weather, by
joining one of Heal the Bay's six Beach Emergency Response Teams. The
volunteer squads rush to local beaches 12 hours after a rainstorm to
clear washed-out city trash. (800) HEAL-BAY, Ext. 145.</LD>
<LD>   Eat: At Neptune's Net, 42505 Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, you
can sit outside (actually, you don't have a choice) to fully enjoy
the glories of the beach in the off-season (or any season):
inexpensive seafood and a weekend Harley crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Get in the water: Or at least in a boat that's in the water.
Plenty of places rent kayaks (and jet skis and party boats)
year-round, including Marina Boat Rentals, 13763 Fiji Way, Marina del
Rey. (310) 574-2822.</TE>
<TE>   Clear your mind: Join Carol Moss' beachfront meditation circle,
every Thursday as close to the waves in Malibu as possible. (310)
456-3591.</TE>
<TE>   Run: Sand Challenge: Boot Camp on the Beach is a coached group
workout class on the sands of Long Beach that meets every Saturday
and Sunday morning and Wednesday evening. For info, see
www.justinrudd.com/sandchallenge.html</TE>
<TE>   Sleep indoors: Maybe in the nearly new, bright and breezy "lofts"
(not suites) at the Beach House, 1300 The Strand. Built in the
bull's-eye of Hermosa Beach's beachiest stretch, the place is
flip-flop distance from boardwalks, food, shops and vast deserts of
off-season sand.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep outdoors: And make a trip out of it, perhaps by hitching a
ferry to Catalina Island's Two Harbors port and hiking seven (fairly
easy) miles along the rocky coastline to one of six campsites at
Parson's Landing, all near very secluded beaches. Information: Two
Harbors Visitors Services at (310) 510-1550.</TE>

<LD>* The singer for the local nu-metal band My Ruin, whose latest album
is "A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish" on Spitfire Records.</LD>
<LD>   Puka Puka: There's a great place in Silver Lake that's barely ever
opened called the Tiki Ti. And it's these two older guys, and they
sort of do this whole production when they make drinks and the drinks
are amazing. They're all tropical. The place fits maybe 25 people.</LD>
<LD>   Electric Boogaloo: I love to go dancing every once in a while at
Cherry. It's really fun because they play great music, a lot of old
'70s rock and some '80s stuff. They go from one extreme to the next.
You can just go in there and do your thing and no one lurks on you.
There's a bunch of freaks and you feel right at home. I love to dance
anyway. I used to be a breakdancer back in the day, like 15 years
ago. I was really into dancing, and now, with the band, it's very
seldom that I can get out and do that.</LD>
<TE>   Brunch Spot: In our neighborhood, there's a restaurant called the
Crest. We have Sunday brunch there. It's over on Sunset around the
Sunset Junction area. It's not only the food that's good, but the
atmosphere. A couple of drag queen guys work there--out of
drag--during the day and they're awesome. A lot of the people in our
neighborhood eat there and it feels like your little home base. I
love to walk into a place where people know you and remember you.</TE>
<TE>   Mosh-Free Zone: I love the Troubadour because nobody is breathing
down your neck to get out of the way of moshers. I'm a little tired
of it. I went through that. We like to say, "Watch, don't mosh." We
love that about our shows. I think it's nice to be at a show where
people are listening and singing and kind of dancing in their space.
I really like to watch a band, and it sort of spoils it when the
whole floor is taken up by a bunch of thugs who want to beat everyone
up.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Pins: There's a shop right next to the Beauty Bar on
Cahuenga Boulevard that just opened. It's called Blest, and I think
it's one of the coolest new boutiques, because the girl that runs it
has a lot of freelance artist-designers come in and she also does her
own line. Basically, all the clothes in there are handmade, and I
have my line in there called Blasphemous Girl. It's a London-type
shop, very punk-inspired.</TE>

<HD>Gorillaz: This Band Is No Longer Just a Diversion</HD>
<DH>The cartoon musical group was just a lark for artist Jamie
Hewlett until sales of its first album took off. Then, attention had
to be paid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where do million-selling Gorillaz go next?</LD>
<LD>   Wherever they want, of course. But that's not a joke punch line.
It's the happy reality for artist-animator Jamie Hewlett, the man
behind the curtain of the biggest cartoon pop band since the Archies.</LD>
<LD>   Gorillaz was born three years ago as a side-project collaboration
of Hewlett, singer Damon Albarn and record producer Dan "The
Automator" Nakamura. Assisted by such guests as rapper Del tha Funky
Homosapien and octogenarian Cuban singer Ibrahim Ferrer, they gave
musical identity to four cartoon characters: the scruffy misfits
Murdoc, D-2, Noodle and Russell. The resulting album, released last
April on Virgin Records, is an invitingly loping mix of hip-hop and
reggae dub music and lyrical celebrations of a carefree life in a
dark, urban world.</LD>
<TE>   With the success of "Gorillaz"--impressive sales in the U.K.,
Europe and Japan and more than 1.3 million in the U.S.--the venture
took on a life of its own. Now it's well beyond being a mere
diversion, as evidenced by the brief North American concert tour that
comes to the Hollywood Palladium on Friday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Though the entire concept would seem to have a lot of built-in
limitations, Hewlett doesn't believe that he and his partners have
painted themselves into a corner, either career-wise or creatively.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [the success] has dictated a path for us," says the
33-year-old Englishman, who first came to fame a decade ago as the
creator of the edgy "Tank Girl" comic series. "We've set up these
characters who are becoming stars in their own right. We've done a
lot of stuff with this album, but the one problem has been
technology. We've been slightly ahead of the technology with our
ideas and haven't done all we want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, Hewlett says, the horizons are expanding. The
Gorillaz Web site (www.gorillaz.com) is an ongoing project
elaborating the group mythology and expanding in terms of interactive
capabilities to flesh out the characters.</TE>
<TE>   An album of outtakes and remixes, "G-Sides" has just been released
in the U.S., with a DVD collecting all the visual elements and a dub
album both in the works. Work on a full-length animated film and a
second album of new songs is set to begin later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge so far has been in presenting the act live.
A debut performance in London took place shortly before the album's
U.K. release, with sporadic shows in England, Europe and Japan
preceding the current tour. With Hewlett's animation projected on a
screen, the idea is to maintain the conceit that the animated urban
hoodlums are real-- without getting corny or pretending that the
audience is not aware of who's really making the music.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came up with this we got every base covered, but one
thing we weren't sure about was the live show," Hewlett says. "How do
you tour with an animated band? What we really wanted to do would
cost millions of pounds, and we'd last about two shows. We had to
find a way to do it as best as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "A certain amount is scripted, but we have to be spontaneous with
people coming in along the tour. It's been quite exciting. Strange
things have happened. But things behind the scenes we're not allowed
to talk about. Maybe someday we will and spoil what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   He does acknowledge that Albarn, former Specials leader Terry Hall
and rapper Jamal are regular performers. Among the guests so far has
been Detroit hip-hop team D12, which joined in for an encore in New
York last week. Nakamura is also on board, DJing as the opening act
and contributing to Gorillaz's performances as well.</TE>
<TE>   But to maintain the mystique, Albarn (from the English band Blur)
is not doing interviews in connection with the tour, and
journalists--if they don't find it too silly--can e-mail questions
that will be answered in the supposed words of the characters.</TE>
<TE>   "Damon is on stage, but you don't see him," says Hewlett. "It's
hard to explain. There's a giant screen and below it a see-through
screen we project images on, and you get to see silhouettes and
images. But Damon doesn't at any point come around and take a bow."</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett is happy to take his metaphorical bows for this
production, though. That wasn't the case in the early '90s when "Tank
Girl" went from hot-list franchise to Hollywood disaster in the form
of a 1995 bomb of a movie.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Tank Girl' movie happened when I was 23, so young enough to
get shafted," Hewlett says. "I was dazzled with stretch limos and
flying first-class. And [the movie] looked good to me on the set. But
it got royally screwed up by Hollywood. It could have been a great
film if they'd done what I said, but they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Hewlett now insists on creative control, and
Gorillaz has given him the leverage. He's developing a series for
British television titled "Phoo Action," about an odd pair of
superheroes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of an English version of the old 'Batman' series," he
says. "It's dark, with zombies--my usual thing. When we first
proposed it, I wanted to write and direct the whole series. People
said, 'Nah,' but now with the success of Gorillaz people take it more
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The new project raises the question of how long Hewlett will
continue with Gorillaz.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm into coming up with things and, if they're successful,
playing with them and then destroying them," he says. "I can't bear
to do things for years and years. I was going to kill Tank Girl, but
then we got the call from Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Gorillaz may prove the exception, though, at least for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really kill Gorillaz," he says. "There's a lot left to
go. Noodle--we've played her as a 10-year-old Japanese girl, but no
one knows her story. So we'll do this as long as we have things to
say, and then we'll stop. I don't see them having a 15-year career
and end up playing Shea Stadium. But it really is just about the
fun."</TE>

<LD>   "The Seagull"--In this Actors' Gang production, unlike some
"Seagulls" you may have survived, everything in Chekhov's lakeside
community of bohemian head cases has been made to matter. Director
Georges Bigot has pulled everyone in the ensemble, even the miscast
actors, into the same comically unstable universe.</LD>
<LD>   At its best, this "Seagull"--the first production of Tim Robbins'
renewed Actors' Gang artistic directorship--is the kind of Chekhov
you don't find very often: funny, sad, sad-funny and then, thwap
comes the arrow through the heart. But Bigot's expansively playful
approach has its drawbacks. This is a longish "Seagull," more than
three hours, and some of the anachronisms--the 1920s and '30s pop
tunes sung by Brian Powell's doctor, in particular--belong to a
lesser effort. It's a tonic despite the problems. The mournful irony
of Chekhov's worldview feels more necessary than ever.</LD>

<DH>Life changed for Americans of Iranian descent during the
1979 hostage crisis. A filmmaker and his actors channel their
feelings into 'Maryam.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ramin Serry was only 10 years old when he became a target. It was
Nov. 4, 1979, and 52 Americans were taken hostage in Iran. Although
Serry, born in Chicago, had always thought of himself as an
all-American kid, on that cool day in November he first realized he
was not like everyone else.</LD>
<LD>   Serry's parents were Iranian. And for the next 444 days of the
hostage crisis, Serry's life became a living torment.</LD>
<LD>   Out of shame and anger, he refused to talk about his experiences
and never showed any interest in his cultural roots. It took 23 years
for him to be able to tell his story. Now a 33-year-old director,
Serry decided to make a feature film about his experience. The
independently distributed "Maryam" opens Friday in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The film, which opened in New York in late February, is about a
young Iranian American girl and her family who become pariahs in
their middle-class suburb when the hostage crisis erupts. The
experience forces her to get in touch with her cultural roots and try
to forge an identity in a hostile world. The film, which stars two
relatively unknown actors--Mariam Perris, who is Maryam, and David
Ackert, who plays Maryam's cousin Ali--was also a voyage of
self-discovery for the two stars and Serry.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important event in my life was what happened during the
hostage crisis," said Serry, who lives in New York City. "No matter
where an Iranian was at that time, it had a profound effect on them."</TE>
<TE>   The film's subject is particularly relevant in the aftermath of
Sept. 11 and the backlash some Arab Americans felt in the wake of the
attack. Some assaults on people of Middle Eastern and Asian descent
are being investigated as hate crimes. Images in the film from 1979
of Americans waving the flag and chanting "USA" are reminiscent of
scenes immediately after the terrorist attack in September. The
timing was coincidental, since the film was completed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other independent filmmakers, Serry and his girlfriend
(also the film's producer), Shauna Lyon, raised the $1 million for
the film using their credit cards and relying on donations from
family and friends. Serry says both Ali and Maryam are reflections of
himself.</TE>
<TE>   The film was a cathartic experience for Serry, said Lyon, who has
been his girlfriend for 12 years. "It has helped him come to terms
not only with his own cultural identity but with a lot of different
types of people who make up the Iranian American community."</TE>
<TE>   Serry remembers when his father would shut himself in a bedroom
and listen to the BBC world report on the radio--the first harbinger
of difficult times to come.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember lying awake and hearing over the radio the toll of Big
Ben and the British announcer crackling over the airwaves," recalled
Serry. "I don't remember being able to make sense of it at the time.
But emotionally I felt very unsettled. It was only as a teenager or
in college that I was able to process and understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Serry put those emotions into a story after graduating from
Columbia University's film school in 1995. The film received positive
feedback at festivals, but "we were told by the distributors that
they didn't have faith the movie could be marketed," said Serry. "We
don't have big stars and it deals with politics."</TE>
<TE>   Like most determined first-time filmmakers, Serry and Lyon
persisted. Their big break came when critics Roger Ebert and Richard
Roeper gave it a thumbs-up review recently on their syndicated TV
show, said Serry. At that point, Serry and Lyon were able to convince
exhibitors to give them a chance.</TE>
<TE>   For Greg Laemmle, vice president of L.A.'s Laemmle Theatres,
booking the movie was a no-brainer. There are about 700,000 people of
Iranian descent in Los Angeles County, according to the Iranian
Muslim Assn. of North America, a nonprofit organization based in
Culver City. In an average year, the Laemmle Music Hall in Beverly
Hills shows a dozen Iranian films, Laemmle said, adding that his
company has been catering to the Iranian population for at least 15
years. "We are aware of the fact that there is a large Iranian
population in Los Angeles and, quality of this film aside--and it is
very good--we thought it would appeal to that audience," said
Laemmle.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Iranian filmgoers are now second generation, the
children of the people who lived through the revolution. Although
many were born in this country, they still feel an affinity for their
parents' native land, said Iraj Ghasemi, head of N.E.J. International
Pictures, an Iranian film distributor in the U.S. "About 10 years
ago, the average age of our audience was around 40, now I see many
20-, 30-somethings," he said. "The new movies that are coming out of
Iran are paying more attention to the new generations and the current
problems in Iran."</TE>
<TE>   The election of the more moderate Mohammad Khatami in 1996 also
benefited filmmakers, said Ghasemi. With increasing freedom there has
been a greater output of internationally acclaimed films that deal
with issues ranging from the oppression of women to the persecution
of Kurds on the Iran-Iraq border to the destitution of Afghan
refugees living in Iran. However, there are still incidents of
filmmakers being jailed for their work and the government banning
their films, said Ghasemi.</TE>
<TE>   "Maryam" also deals with the internal conflict within the Iranian
community between the more secular Iranians who fled the ayatollah
and the more conservative or traditional Muslims who abhorred the
shah and remain staunch supporters of a conservative Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Maryam's orphaned cousin from Iran, Ali, comes to the
U.S. to study medicine. But Ali is a supporter of the ayatollah and a
conservative Muslim who blames the death of his father on the shah's
notorious secret police. His more traditional beliefs--particularly
on the role of women and assimilating into American culture--create
conflict in Maryam's family. Ackert says his character, Ali, gives a
human face to people the media have labeled "Muslim extremists."</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, Ackert had negative feelings about Islam before
he was cast for the part. Ackert's father is American and his mother
Iranian. Both were Christians living in Iran when the revolution
happened. They fled Iran and settled in the suburbs outside
Washington, D.C. Ackert was born in the United States and, like
Serry, had only a vague connection to his mother's homeland. But in
his research for the role, he came to appreciate not only Iranian
culture but also Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of very negative opinions about what I thought was
Islam, and in fact I had a lot of shame about being Iranian," said
the 32-year-old actor. "I had to really embrace those things so I
wouldn't feel I was faking it for this role. I went to mosques, read
the Koran and immersed myself in the culture.... Saying that Islam is
all about terrorism is like writing off all of Western religion
because of the crusades."</TE>
<TE>   Ackert also had some scarring experiences as a result of the
hostage crisis. Ackert had just switched schools when the hostages
were taken. Being the new kid in his sixth-grade class, his teacher
introduced him as the "new Iranian student who could explain what was
going on."</TE>
<TE>   "I was marked for death from that point on," he recalled. "Dodge
ball became 'Peg David.'" Like Serry, Ackert was called every
expletive and insult and was beat up nearly every day. "I became
really terrified of school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he started playing hooky and telling his mom he was ill. He
would concoct pains and vomiting spells so serious that his mother
finally took him to the hospital. It was there, when he received
get-well cards from his classmates that he learned to forgive.</TE>
<TE>   "They said things like, 'Dear David, I'm sorry for punching you in
the face after slamming your finger in the locker' or 'Dear David,
I'm sorry for beating you up during dodge ball,' and in my
11-year-old mind I fell in love with my classmates.... I [also]
realized I could not run away from what I was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the story is "about trying to find the humanity in
each other," said Parris, who was born in Great Britain but whose
parents are Azerbaijani. "It's about establishing your individuality
and identity and having it be accepted."</TE>

<HD>Chile's 'Taxi para Tres' Is a Darkly Comic Journey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orlando Lubbert's dark, stinging Chilean comedy, "Taxi para Tres"
(Taxi for Three), continues the UCLA Film Archives' "Contemporary
Latin American Films" series Saturday in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges
Theater. Screening at 7:30 p.m., "Taxi" stars Alejandro Trejo as a
hard-pressed cabdriver whose life is upturned when he picks up a pair
of muggers, raspy-voiced, knife-wielding Chavelo (Daniel Munoz) and
his dimwitted novice accomplice, Coto (Fernando Gomez-Rovira), who
packs a hammer. Chavelo, a gleeful sociopath, gives Trejo's Ulises a
choice: "Steering wheel or trunk."</LD>
<LD>   Ulises decides he's better off behind the wheel of the cab he's
still paying for and thus observes these goons in action. But when
the two surprisingly manage to pull off a lucrative robbery, Chavelo
takes Ulises by surprise by insisting their driver get a cut. Ulises
refuses initially, but when Chavelo forces the money on him, the
cabby is seduced. If a modest sum of money can ease the burden of
supporting a sizable family....</LD>
<LD>   Lubbert pulls no punches, and the film packs a wallop at the
finish. "Taxi para Tres" clearly struck a nerve on home ground, where
it was a substantial hit and also took the top prize at the San
Sebastian Film Festival.</LD>
<TE>   Screening Sunday at 7 p.m. in the series is the West Coast
premiere of Lourdes Portillo's "Senorita Extraviada," which documents
with a devastating low-key persistence all the conditions that have
allowed it to be said of Ciudad Juarez that "there is no better place
in the world to kill a young woman."</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-'90s some 230 teenagers and young women have been
murdered, and no one ever seems to be brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons why Juarez has become so dangerous for young women are
several. The two key factors are that the city is the key point of
entry for drugs into the U.S. and that the implementation of the
NAFTA accords has accelerated greatly its industrialization. About
80% of the assembly factories are American owned, and they employ
185,000 workers, mainly young women--many of them from rural areas
all over Mexico, all of them willing to work long hours for $4 or $5
a day, to a large extent displacing the male work force. Thus, a
large population of poor, unsophisticated young women is at the mercy
of a city in which corruption of the police and local government is
painfully obvious and in which there are many out-of-work men.</TE>
<TE>   Ineptitude and machismo coalesce at every level of the
bureaucracy, and one activist is surely correct when she holds the
entire government of Mexico responsible for the dire fates of so many
young women. Chillingly, Portillo informs us that 50 women were
killed in the 18 months it took her to make her film, yet she leaves
us with a ray of hope as families of the victims have become
organized and increasingly vocal in their demand for justice. (310)

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the American Cinematheque's "Recent Spanish Cinema"
continues at the Egyptian. Screening Friday at 7:30 p.m. is Carlos
Molinero's "Salvajes" (Savages), a lurid, overheated yet potent and
entertaining melodrama calling attention to the plight of illegal
immigrants from North Africa in Valencia, the port of their arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Molinero is fortunate in having as his stars two of Spanish
cinema's biggest names, Marisa Paredes and Imanoel Arias. Paredes
plays Berta, a middle-aged but still chic and attractive nurse in a
neighborhood clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Berta has lovingly raised her two nephews and niece, orphaned 10
years earlier, but hasn't noticed how far they have strayed from
being the little angels that she took into her home. (The Nazi
posters and flags that cover the walls of the bedroom of her younger
nephew, Raul [Alberto Ferreiro], might have given her a clue.)</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, Raul has in fact become a skinhead intent on harassing and
beating up immigrants while his surly older brother, Guillermo (Roger
Casamajor), works with a ruthless smuggler of these same illegal
aliens.</TE>
<TE>   The smuggler Fausto (Jose Luis Alcobendas) in turn has captivated
their drug-abusing sister, Lucia (Maria Isasi). Berta, who likes to
go out on the town, encounters in a bar Arias' Eduardo, a tough,
middle-aged cop she treated earlier for his bad liver; they click in
an instant. However, an especially brutal beating of a black man will
find Eduardo knocking at Berta's front door.</TE>
<TE>   "Salvajes" is highly combustible, loaded with dizzying hand-held
shots, but it all works, thanks to the skill of Paredes and Arias.
They can sustain all the fireworks, both between Berta and Eduardo
and in relation to the wayward nephews.</TE>
<TE>   Among the various other films screening is Judith Colell's
"Nosotras" (tonight at 9:30), an acridly amusing and lively if
familiar account of all the troubles a wide variety of women have
with men, sometimes of their own making. The key strand among seven
interwoven stories involves a middle-aged housewife (Mercedes
Sampietro) married to a wealthy but astonishingly miserly man who
keeps her on such a tight budget she must do all the housework in
their large luxury home and make--and remake--her own clothes. Why
does she put up with the jerk? The reason is the shame she would feel
if those who know her found out how horrible her life really is.</TE>
<TE>   Other vignettes are typical, including one about a factory worker
who strives to buy a pair of expensive Nikes her spoiled son craves.
"Nosotras" is well-made but conventional. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sons of Hercules" muscles into Outfest's weekly Wednesday 7:30
p.m. screenings at the Village at the Ed Gould Plaza, 1125 N.
McCadden Place. It's composed of clips from more than 70 campy,
mainly Italian-made, primitively dubbed spear-and-sandal epics of the
'50s and '60s that starred scantily clad bodybuilders.</TE>
<TE>   Curators William Comstock and John Kirk have lined up some of the
best-known of the musclemen to appear in person: Mickey Hargitay,
Richard Harrison and Gordon Mitchell. (323) 960-2394.</TE>

<HD>Not What You'd Call a Big Band</HD>
<DH>The Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra enlists audiences to provide
the sound effects for silent films.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sporting a black suit and red beret, the conductor greets his
audience and then tosses a plastic whistle to a rather hip-looking
woman sitting on the second row. The members of the orchestra have
already taken their places on the floor and are beginning to tune
their instruments.</LD>
<LD>   The sounds of the toy piano and pixie harp, tropical birdcalls and
a homemade rain stick begin to fill the room. Contorting his 6-foot-1
frame behind a 2-foot-tall trap set, the bandleader signals for the
lights to dim; and "The Great Train Robbery" begins to quietly
flicker on the screen above his head.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Paulson and his Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra for Silent Films
promise moviegoers an out-of-the-ordinary cinematic experience during
a performance Sunday at the Knitting Factory. This pit crew on
pint-sized instruments creates live musical accompaniment for rarely
seen films. The Knitting Factory, known for showcasing the
experimental and avant-garde, should provide the perfect venue for
this blend of the novel and the orchestral.</LD>
<TE>   Paulson's brand of G-rated fun, a sort of modern-day morphing of
Captain Kangaroo and Spike Jones, is always lively and at times
wonderfully chaotic. Everyone has a part. Even the musically
challenged are handed bubble wrap and dime store kazoos to play
along. But all the noisy toys and audience participation cannot hide
the fact that this madcap ensemble is reinventing an art form first
mastered by the solo organist, who some 90 years ago provided the
only soundtrack for a moving picture.</TE>
<TE>   The Band Began as Part of an Outreach Program</TE>
<TE>   What began as part of a children's outreach program at UC San
Diego's Arts Libraries, where Paulson is outreach coordinator, has
developed a very adult, near-cult following, with midnight
performances on a number of Southern California college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Both founder and conductor of the Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra,
Paulson never considered himself an artistic risk-taker. But he's all
too familiar with the politely puzzled looks. He got them on his
other project too--the popular toy piano concert series.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I'm not taken very seriously by my peers," says
Paulson, who also plays oboe for the San Diego Chamber Orchestra.
"But I'll live, and I'll certainly have the last laugh." In truth,
he's on a secret mission--to introduce children and adults to all
types of music without their being aware of the lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Some 30 years ago, it was Saturday morning cartoons, not silent
films that intrigued Paulson. The bonks, splats, and clanks of a
favorite Looney Tunes episode were music to his young ears.</TE>
<TE>   So when he discovered a treasure trove of silent films lying
neglected in the UCSD library archives, he began experimenting with
the same kind of musical drama he had loved as a cartoon-addicted
kid.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he debuted the Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra for Silent
Films (also on occasion known as, Paulson unashamedly discloses, the
Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra for Cocktail Parties).</TE>
<TE>   Paulson Plans to Add Some Dramatic Films</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, he plans to introduce a dramatic film such as
"Carmen" or "The Phantom of the Opera" into the orchestra's lineup,
but he knows his audiences prefer the 10-minute comic shorts. "They
love to use all the over-the-top sound effects and just freak out a
bit," says Paulson.</TE>
<TE>   But laying out the soundtrack for even a very short film is more
involved than merely pulling toys from a toy chest.</TE>
<TE>   First, Paulson watches the film, some of which are almost 100
years old, to ensure its viewing quality. Next, he plays it in slow
motion, carefully scripting the characters' actions. Man kisses
woman. Woman hits man. Man falls down. Train approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he surveys his instruments, sound effects tools and
noisemakers, some 300 in all, choosing as many as 150.</TE>
<TE>   Man kisses woman. Balloon squeal. Woman hits man. Slapsticks. Man
falls down. Slide whistle. Train approaches. Air can.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he pulls his orchestra together based on the needs of the
film, the musicians' availability and, inevitably, on how much gas
money he has to offer those perpetually underpaid professionals. "One
of us has to be the heavy," Paulson admits, "the one responsible for
keeping the narrative flowing between film changes, page turns and
the unexpected--like when we become so engrossed in the movie we
forget our cue."</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's performance, the audience will be treated to the
premiere of Albie Hewlett's "What's the Hold Up?", a romantic comedy
about a man's frustrated attempt to pop the question.</TE>
<TE>   Charmed by one of the Teeny-Tiny Orchestra's early performances,
Hewlett shot his own silent 8-millimeter film, specifically for
Paulson to interpret.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very exciting to see my story line from another creative
perspective, explains the young filmmaker. "Sound completely
transforms the visual experience."</TE>
<TE>   As for Paulson, he knows that if a film flops or the audience
turnout is light, he has just the right toy or tool or odd piece of
plastic to imitate the sound of roaring applause. "Musicians," he
says, "really did lose a great gig when the talkies came along."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was working on a column the other day when I heard a funny sound
from the other room. A kind of  heeeeooneee. I checked and discovered
it was the dog whining. His head was thrown back and his gaze locked
on the ceiling in a pose of utter concentration. I knew in an instant
that the roofers were back.</LD>
<LD>   Barkley had detected their presence even though they hadn't begun
working yet. In a few minutes, the scraping would begin, accompanied
by a pounding so intense that the house would vibrate like a ship in
a storm, leading me to wonder how well it was built in the first
place.</LD>
<LD>   I was especially concerned about a section we added a few years
ago. The contractor was one of those good old boys whose response to
a structural deficiency was to "slap a little paint on it." Did he
slap a little paint on cracked beams intended to hold up the
building? God knows.</LD>
<TE>   The hammering began. As it did, things drifted down from the
ceiling through newly exposed openings in the roof. Little black
specks mingled with a thick gray dust, like snow falling in hell. It
seeped into corners and crevices, where it will no doubt remain
forever.</TE>
<TE>   The footfalls from above grew heavier. There was an army up there.
I worried that at any moment a worker would crash through the roof.
He would get quickly to his feet, shaken but conscious, and say
something to me in Spanish. I wouldn't know what he was saying
because I don't speak Spanish, but as a gunnery sergeant used to say,
"If he ain't bleeding, he ain't hurt."</TE>
<TE>   "YOU AIN'T BLEEDING," I'd shout as a way of getting him to
understand English, "SO GO BACK TO WORK." "That dust will kill you,"
says a friend who stops by. "It contains ..." He mentions a chemical
in the roofing material that is deadly to humans and columnists
alike. I forget what it's called. He's a woodcarver, but somehow he
knows about chemicals that kill.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," my wife, Cinelli, tells him. "If martinis haven't
killed him, no chemical will."</TE>
<TE>   Our roof has been leaking since 1972, so we hired someone to fix
it. The company re-roofed the add-on section of the house that had
been leaking even worse than the rest of the place, and it hasn't
leaked since.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't live here another day if you won't agree to the work,"
Cinelli said during the last big rain.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't see a problem. Because the place had been leaking for so
long, I knew exactly where to put the pans to catch the drips. I
moved with the efficiency of an astrophysicist at the first sprinkle.
A pan here, a pan there.</TE>
<TE>   When she complained of the incessant drip-drip-dripping noise in
the pans, I suggested that we retreat to the room in the house that
didn't leak and sit there until the rain stopped. It was an extension
of the slap-a-little-paint-on-it theory.</TE>
<TE>   It was at that point that she threatened to grab the dog and her
earrings and leave me to the leakage. "The house will fall apart,"
she said, growing angrier by the minute, "and the jungle will
overtake you and you'll rot!"</TE>
<TE>   She is terrific with imagery, but this was no time to admire her
ability to create word pictures. I know when she threatens to take
the dog and her earring collection that she means business. So we
called the roofers.</TE>
<TE>   I was told that they were roofers to the stars. I don't know which
stars, but if it was a superstar, I knew he wouldn't sit still for a
bad job, so they'd have to be good. He'd be right up there on the
roof, pointing out any flaws and maybe kicking a couple of the
workers over the side, just to make a point. Then he'd leave for his
villa in the south of France until the work was done.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a villa in the south of France, so I am forced to
endure the pounding and write at the same time. That's where I am
now. The hammering is so constant that at first I suspected they had
hired someone specifically to sit on the roof and just pound. But
when I checked it out, I realized that wasn't the case.</TE>
<TE>   These guys are thorough. They ripped off years, perhaps centuries,
of old roofing right down to the wood. Then they had to replace some
of the wood. At present, they are tacking down something in rolls,
and then they'll seal everything with torches.</TE>
<TE>   As I sit here listening to the pounding, I am beginning to feel a
little like Sarah Winchester. She was an heir to the Winchester Rifle
fortune who, in a fit of conscience, built a mansion in San Jose to
shelter the souls of people killed by the rifles. She kept building
because there were more souls floating around out there than she'd
anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Another story says she continued adding on because the pounding of
the hammers kept the devil away. She also believed that if she kept
building, she'd never die. She kept building but died anyhow. So much
for that theory.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have any souls to house, and I'm not worried about the
devil, so the sooner they finish the roof the better.</TE>
<TE>   I just checked out the dog again. Now he's lying on his back,
still staring at the ceiling. He's stopped whining and looks a little
crazy. Poor thing. I may have to slap a little paint on him.</TE>

<LD>It's a packed night in Hollywood and the neighborhood's newest club,
the Highlands, is crawling with industry folks. This is talent agent
Lisa Lindo's party. For the past eight years, she has hosted this
annual networking night for deal-hungry agents, producers,
financiers, film distribution and script development reps who
attended the Sundance Film Festival but didn't finish schmoozing.</LD>
<LD>   This year's fete was believed to be the largest yet, with more
than 1,500 gathering at the mammoth, multilevel club overlooking
Hollywood Boulevard. The music is loud and the club is dark on this
Monday night, but Lindo, in a knee-length suede coat and colorful
beads, turns heads wherever she goes. She ushers people in with: "Go
make friends."</LD>
<LD>   Lindo, 37, founded Acme Talent &amp; Literary nine years ago with her
then-husband Adam Lieblein because the two agents wanted to spend
more time together. They divorced soon after, but surprisingly, they
remain bus- iness partners.</LD>
<TE>   The networking parties started as small monthly dinners and
mushroomed into all-night parties as the guest list grew. Their
clients include actors, writers, producers and video-game creators,
including "October Sky" novelist Homer Hickam and actors Richard
Kline of "Inside Schwartz" and "Crossing Jordan's" Steve Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   With hundreds of people to greet, Lindo keeps moving. On the
patio, Susan O'Leary is talking about Fox Search- lab, the new
filmmaker mentoring program that she manages.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking to develop new directors," she says. "It's about as
philanthropic as a studio is going to get." An unusually large man in
an expensive suit appears: Imani Lee, a professional heavyweight
boxer. Lee shakes hands and brags about Lindo's boxing skills. Next
to drift by is Troy Romeo, aspiring director. No small talk
here--he's got a story pitch: Abused husband tries to hang himself,
but instead kills his neighbor. "I had 10 copies of my film [at
Sundance] and I was able to get it in three festivals," he says. Time
to move on. He gives out his last business card with a smile and a
solid handshake. "It's relationships," he says. "It's all about
relationships."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Desperation,</TE>
<TE>   a Script and Career</TE>
<TE>   About seven years ago, actor-screenwriter Milo Addica's income was
riding on a series of odd jobs, including one selling nail polish
over the phone. Addica knew he had reached bottom when his latest
rep's office was in a mini-mall. The man "had a little toupee and a
polyester suit and had started back in the 1940s," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for better roles, Addica and his actor friend Will Rokos
wrote "Monster's Ball." The story was a personal one for Addica, who
based the film on his own relationship with his father. The plot's
potent family dynamic features an executioner's son (Heath Ledger)
who refuses to follow in the career path of his father (Billy Bob
Thornton) and grandfather (Peter Boyle).</TE>
<TE>   It took several years to get the film made, but after its release
last fall, the writers earned best screenplay nominations from the
Writers Guild of America and the Independent Spirit Awards.</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, Addica, 39, was approached separately by
director Steven Soderbergh and Russell Crowe to write their next
projects. "It's pretty intense," he said Monday during a phone
interview from his home in Los Angeles. "I really have a lot of
responsibility to come up to the mark that people think I am capable
of. It's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh wanted a script starring Don Cheadle. So over lunch at
the Warner Bros. commissary, Soderbergh and Addica mapped out a plot
about a man who "takes a fall" for his friends, Addica said.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, Crowe called Addica from his ranch in
Australia with producer Brian Grazer and executive producer Todd
Hollowell on the line. Addica pitched his story over the phone. When
he finished, Crowe detailed his problems with the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I got off the phone thinking, 'Well, that's it. I'm not getting
that job,'" Addica said. True to Hollywood form, however, the men
have agreed to collaborate. When asked about the recent attention,
Addica answered humbly: "It's good because I'm starting to see that
I'm going to have a career. And I'm confident that people like my
voice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Screenplay Gets</TE>
<TE>   a Touch of Theater</TE>
<TE>   As the lights went down at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood
Monday evening, the audience settled in for a performance that was
not quite theater, not quite a movie. Googy Gress, one of 15 actors
sitting in a semicircle on the stage, began narrating a story that
follows a young World War II veteran and aspiring movie director
(read by Adam Goldberg) who, on his way to Hollywood, alters the
destiny of a small Midwestern town.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of props or staging, the effect, at least in the
imagination, was almost cinematic as the actors, including
Christopher McDonald and Hal Holbrook, read the script. That was the
intent. This reading was intended as a chance for the project's
producers to expose their movie script to potential buyers. "This is
the first time I've been to a reading like this," said actor Vince
Vieluf, one of the performers. "We were all sitting in the green room
before the reading, and we were kind of nervous." Vieluf, best known
for his film work, added with excitement, "It was this theater vibe."</TE>
<TE>   For writer Nate Goodman, it was an experience more common to
playwrights than to screenwriters. "I haven't heard the lines
before," he said--only "in my own head."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I decided [L.A.] was the most evil place on Earth," said "Ed"
co-star Julie Bowen in the March issue of Nylon magazine. When she
lived in Los Angeles, she said, "I only read the New York Times and
even had bagels sent to me from New York. I mean, I don't know what
they do with the old and ugly out there."</TE>

<LD>THE CONDEMNATION</LD>
<LD>   OF LITTLE B</LD>
<LD>   By Elaine Brown</LD>
<TE>   Beacon Press</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $28.50</TE>
<TE>   "The first difference which strikes us is that of color.... Is it
not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two
races? Are not the fine mixtures of red and white ... preferable to
that eternal monotony, which reigns in the countenances, that
immovable veil of black, which covers the emotions of the other
race?"</TE>
<TE>   A contemporary photo illustrates the jacket of the book that
quotes this 18th century argument. It offers just such a face--in
this case, that of a black boy. (You'd place him at somewhere between
12 and 15.) He wears an institutional tunic. His arms are held, or
pulled, low behind his body. The book's harsh, red-ink title, "The
Condemnation of Little B," obscures the lower part of his face. Only
his close-cut hair, small sculpted ears and eyes are visible. The
head is cocked toward one shoulder. The wide-open dark eyes are
undefended, as if contemplating an unsolved question. The eyes have a
share of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, my sympathetic reading of this black countenance is
just as subjective as was the distaste of Thomas Jefferson, cited
above. His rhetorical soul-searching concluded thus: "I advance it
... that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made
distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the white in the
endowments of both body and mind."  Can this be the same enlightened
philosopher-politician who (along with George Washington and the
Northern sons of liberty whose prosperity depended on the South's
plantation system) has always been held up as a kind of demigod by
our textbooks from grade school through college? Indeed, the very
same, recently Hollywood-romanticized for surrendering his heart to
light-skinned Sally Hemings. In fact, after Master's death, aging
slave Sally was auctioned off along with the president's mixed-blood
slave children to cover unpaid Jeffersonian debts. Some founding
father.</TE>
<TE>   "Little B" is the street name of the pensive boy on the book
jacket, Michael Lewis. Born in the Bluff, Atlanta's most neglected
and derelict inner-city neighborhood, he can hardly be said to have
been "raised" there.</TE>
<TE>   Father unknown, mother a crack addict, young Michael (a nominal
but forgotten ward of the state of Georgia) survived in the Bluff,
homeless and school-less from age 11 to 13. During that year, 1997,
this boy's luck changed. He experienced his first arrest and was
tried, convicted and sentenced as an adult for the murder of Darryl
Woods, "a working black man, a husband and a father." The state
finally put a roof over Michael's head: the Georgia State Prison in
Alto, which he entered as the youngest of 1,200 incarcerated felons.
He is there today--visited when possible by Elaine Brown, the author
of "The Condemnation of Little B," and his little sister Ta-ta. He's
18 years old now and still waiting for justice.</TE>
<TE>   For all the pathos of his story, "The Condemnation of Little B" is
not your run-of-the-genre, gritty biographical tear-jerker.
Multifaceted author Brown (a classically trained musician, writer,
lecturer and former chairwoman of the Black Panther Party) has set
herself a considerable challenge: to trace the historical and
political arc connecting bigotry in America from pre-Revolutionary
times to the present--in other words, to show how the legacy of
Jefferson has impoverished the chances of Little B, along with his
brothers in all the Bluffs of our abandoned inner cities. This is no
scattershot diatribe. Brown's approach is reasoned, statistically
documented and scrupulously footnoted. Yet her anger burns on every
page.</TE>
<TE>   The gist of the historical overview, sandwiched between thinner
slices of Michael's life, won't surprise readers of Howard Zinn's "A
People's History of the United States" (which is frequently
referenced in this volume). However, it's a corrective in fact and
focus, which is hard to find elsewhere in any form, let alone in one
up-to-date volume. Brown points up the echo-effects of slavery,
botched "Reconstruction," Jim Crow, the more recent rollback of equal
opportunity, poverty programs and affirmative action. She names names
with bitter relish.</TE>
<TE>   She is witheringly good at exposing the myths that allow power
groups, both black and white, to exploit and crush the weak with a
comparatively untroubled conscience--all more or less veiled versions
of racism, ranging from Jefferson's theories on why blacks can't
write poetry to today's trumpeted "new phenomenon" of young, black
male "Superpredators" sprouting in our midst.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Little B, society's boogeyman. Is it just
to try  to punish a child without parent or guardian, with only a
sixth-grade education, as an adult? Whatever his crime, should a
13-year-old be deemed a priori unsalvageable? Can we, the most
affluent society in history, afford only terror, no pity?</TE>
<TE>   The pity and terror of this specific matter, as Brown's anatomy of
a weak defense and horrendously flawed prosecution shows, is that
Michael's unprompted earliest words to her may well be true: "I
didn't kill that man. I didn't kill nobody, ma'am."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get that sun-dappled, south-of-France country look for your house,
there are two ways to go: One is to scour flea markets for rustic
floor tiles and beat-up wooden doors, stick a carved wooden rooster
in the kitchen and fill some half-glazed terra-cotta vases with
sunflowers. Or, you can follow Danielle Schatteman's method and
re-angle the roof, tear down a few interior walls to build thicker
ones and import doors, furniture and floor and roof tiles piece by
piece from Provence.</LD>
<LD>   Not that she'd recommend it for everyone. Nor would her husband,
hair coiffeur Cristophe, best known as the man who trimmed President
Clinton's hair aboard Air Force One on a stop in L.A. When Danielle
convinced her husband that the Beverly Hills home they'd purchased in
the fall of 2000 would require very little overhaul, he believed her,
even though they'd already been through several serious, lengthy
renovations on other homes.</LD>
<LD>   "Men," he says with a sigh, "are so stupid and so gullible."</LD>
<TE>   So goes the saga of the Schattemans and their 2,500-square-foot,
single-level, three-bedroom house, 13 months in the redoing at a cost
they won't reveal. The Belgian-born couple juggled full-time careers
during the ordeal--she is the owner of Decadence Home Decor in West
Hollywood; he owns Cristophe salons in Beverly Hills, Washington,
D.C., Newport Beach and St. Bart's. Both, however, say the journey
was worth it, despite the daily cacophony of workmen that began at 7
a.m., being confined for months to only a single bedroom and having
to move to the Beverly Hills Hotel for several weeks during major
construction.</TE>
<TE>   It was Danielle's idea early on to turn this home from a pleasant
but unremarkable 20-year-old ranch house to a Provencal home, by
bringing to America some of the serene, old-world style they'd fallen
in love with during their annual trips to the south of France. But
even Danielle, a veteran of many ugly-duckling-to-swan house
transformations, didn't dream the undertaking would be so extensive.</TE>
<TE>   Neither, of course, did Cristophe, who only fully realized his
wife was going for an authentic look "when I came back from a trip
one day and the roof was gone."</TE>
<TE>   As Danielle tells it, the remodel started innocently enough with
the green marble entryway. Then she decided the kitchen had to be
updated, and walls started coming down to make the den and kitchen
larger. When the walls were rebuilt, they were thicker and rounded,
mimicking Provence style.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot honestly do just one room in a house," Danielle
explains. "When you start with the kitchen, the rest of the house
looks so old, so bad compared to what you just did. You can't do it
halfway."</TE>
<TE>   Among the imported items are rough-hewn terra cotta floor tiles,
used in every room except the master bedroom, where Danielle opted
for pillowed limestone. Interior wood doors from France are
pleasantly "raggedy," as she calls them, touched up only with a bit
of stain and sealer. White French doors leading to the backyard were
also imported, as was a weathered stone mantelpiece.</TE>
<TE>   They removed the roof over the living room and dining room and
replaced it with one re-angled to a lower pitch for a more authentic
feel. Danielle wanted French terra cotta roof tiles, but because they
didn't meet building code standards, she placed them only near the
edge, where their patina could lend a timeworn look. Faux-finished
walls are carefully mottled to make them appear aged. "I just know,"
says Danielle, running her hand across the surface, "that someone is
going to want to buy this house and paint the walls white because
they think they're dirty."</TE>
<TE>   Imported furnishings and accessories include a long, narrow dining
room table that once graced a Belgian monastery, antique Belgian
sconces, reproduction Aubusson rugs, and an oversized French
sideboard circa late 19th century that hasn't been touched, with worn
spots revealing various layers of paint .</TE>
<TE>   "I know I must have a piece of land in France," says Cristophe,
"because if the roof comes from there, the doors come from there, the
floor, there must be a house somewhere that's been transported piece
by piece. It was an interesting adventure, I have to say."</TE>
<TE>   With the house nearly finished--a fountain for the walled-in
frontyard is in transit from France--the overall effect combines the
best of California and the south of France.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fitting mix, since the two regions share similar climates,
lifestyles and sensibilities, both blurring boundaries between living
inside and out. The house now also reflects something of the
Schattemans' gracious, relaxed nature, grounded in European
traditions but with a contemporary American flair.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Provencal authenticity, the interior design departs
from what constitutes classic regional style. It edges toward urban
sophistication rather than countrified ruggedness in its neutral
palette of vanillas, taupes and dark woods and touches of mauve and
sea foam. A mix of elements conveys an eclectic look that achieves
harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Complementing the French and Belgian antiques are modern,
streamlined pieces such as an informal white armless sofa and bold
geometric accent tables that speak to Danielle's love of uncluttered,
tchotchke-free style. "Except for books," she says, "I'm not a
collector. I don't like things that don't have a purpose." A third
bedroom contains a pool table.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation didn't always involve transatlantic shopping
sprees. The Schattemans were lucky enough to have hired a French
contractor who not only was able to translate the look Danielle was
after, but could locate the pieces needed to achieve it.</TE>
<TE>   "The people we were working with at first had never been to the
south of France," Danielle explains, "so it was more country, more
American farm looking. Then we hired a French contractor, so when I'd
try to explain something he'd say, 'Of course, that's the way it has
to be.'"</TE>
<TE>   She found the floor tiles she wanted at a local store, but her
contractor said he could bring them over from France for less. The
couple found a few doors in Provence while on vacation, but hunting
for more (there are 13 total in the house) proved to be something of
a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd get to a store," Danielle says, "and they'd say, 'C'est
midi!' It's lunchtime! I'd say, 'Can I just look around a little
bit?' And they'd say, 'No, you have to come back at 2.' That people
still live that way is impressive to me. I think I have two lunches a
year. But there, there's nothing you can do because everybody is
closed. They don't need to sell that bad that they're going to miss
their lunch."</TE>
<TE>   She left it to her contractor to find the doors too.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the extended renovation, Cristophe says without hesitation
that the house's ambience is reminiscent of Provence, where he once
lived: "We live very much inside and outside at the same time, just
like in the south of France. We always open up the doors, and we eat
a lot outside and we entertain as casually as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle has noticed one significant change, too, since the house
has been completed: They're home a lot more.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Cristophe: "It's a very comfortable, homey kind of house."</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean the couple will stay for a while? Don't bet on it.
"I always get the itch to move," Danielle says. "Once everything is
perfect I'm going to get bored. I think I like the turmoil. Anything
that's been redone by someone else I'll always want to redo. Finding
the perfect house is not easy."</TE>

<HD>Coping With Culprit in Compost  Gone Bad</HD>
<DH>The presence of a weed killer residue may be what's
plaguing your vegetable plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 10 years, Arthur Biggert has run a small organic farm in
Bainbridge Island, Wash. He spades compost into his vegetable plots
every year to improve the soil. This is a timeless cornerstone of
good garden management, essential for soil structure, water
retention, good drainage, microbial activity and nutrient uptake by
plants.</LD>
<LD>   In spite of all his care, last May, after planting out 60 tomato
seedlings, 40 of Biggert's crop failed to thrive. "It took them about
two weeks before they started any growth," he says. "And when they
did, many had cupped leaves and twisted stems. As time went on, in
June and July, I didn't have any blossoms, which is really unusual."</LD>
<LD>   No flowers meant no fruit, just withering, deformed vines. Biggert
investigated every possible cause, starting with transplant shock. He
finally had his compost tested.</LD>
<TE>   The humus-rich mix of rotted grass, straw and manure, the very
plant health food that he had so religiously spaded into his garden,
was the culprit. It had traces of a weedkiller called clopyralid, a
product marketed by Dow Agro- Sciences for the control of dandelions
and clover in lawns and thistle in fields and pastures.</TE>
<TE>   Biggert was not alone. At the same time, Washington State
University officials began publishing alarming studies showing that
clopyralid residues on straw and residential grass clippings had
found their way into most compost in the state. By June, clopyralid
had been found in compost in California.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Environmental Services Department discovered the
chemical in its compost processed from Southern California grass
clippings. By January, so did the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation.
Again the suspect source was grass clippings from treated lawns that
had been put in green bins by homeowners and sent for recycling into
compost. On Wednesday, the California Department of Pesticide
Regulation announced that the chemical is under review.</TE>
<TE>   Compost makers from across the West gathered in San Francisco this
week at a conference sponsored by the journal BioCycle to discuss how
to protect compost and how gardeners should protect their tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   There were some words of comfort for California gardeners from
veteran clopyralid investigator Dan Caldwell, director of Washington
State University compost operations at the Pullman campus.</TE>
<TE>   "California," he said, "is lucky." Clopyralid has been in use here
since 1997, 10 years less than in Washington. The contamination
levels here are far lower--on average five times less--than in
Washington state. So far, unlike Washington, there are no reports of
crop failure.</TE>
<TE>   But Californian compost companies are still worried. Unlike
Washington state, where the local Department of Agriculture tested
compost for the herbicide, here the job of testing has so far been
left to compost companies.</TE>
<TE>   At the conference, the California Compost Quality Council
announced that of 20 anonymous tests carried out by its members up
and down the state, another 13 had been positive. This, they said,
suggests contamination in California could run as high as two-thirds
of all our compost.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, San Diego's Environmental Services Department was in
Sacramento demanding a ban on clopyralid in landscaping, a measure
taken by Washington's Department of Agriculture last week.</TE>
<TE>   Clopyralid does break down and wash out with rain, but very
slowly. Biggert is not going to have many tomatoes this year. As
Caldwell warns, "Contamination is so pervasive, we will have to get
used to living with it for a while."</TE>
<TE>   This is a hard adjustment. For any gardener committed enough to
buy compost in the first place, the choice between growing summer
vegetables and using compost is a case of shooting or hanging. Summer
would not be summer without tomatoes. Forgoing compost, however, is
not an option for most serious gardeners. Yearly compost amendments
are crucial to a healthy garden.</TE>
<TE>   What should be done? There are no hard answers--yet. In addition
to the Washington emergency ban, the federal Environmental Protection
Agency has started collecting contamination reports, and the
California Department of Pesticide Regulation has only just clicked
into action.</TE>
<TE>   To spur it on, Assemblyman Fred Keely (D-Santa Cruz) is drafting a
bill to restrict  use of clopyralid in California. But as regulators
and politicians duke it out in Sacramento, Caldwell and fellow
veteran investigators offer the following advice:</TE>
<TE>   * Do not worry about your children or pets. Clopyralid is safe for
humans and mammals.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't worry about clopyralid residues on woody shrubs, grass and
trees. It does not damage these plant types and will break down
eventually. Applying any compost is fine here.</TE>
<TE>   * Clopyralid can only be applied by professional applicators.
Check with landscape maintenance teams at schools, parks, golf
courses and with your own residential mow-and-blow guys to make sure
they do not use the following products containing clopyralid:
Lontrel, Curtail, Transline, Stinger, Reclaim, Confront, Hornet,
Scorpion, Redeem, Millennium, Momentum, Chaser Ultra, Battleship,
Strike Three and TruPower.</TE>
<TE>   * If you do use products that contain clopyralid, ensure that
grass clippings are not put in green bins and sent for composting but
used to mulch shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   * Know vulnerable plant types: legume, nightshade and composite
families. These include peas, beans, tomatoes, potatoes, chili
peppers, petunias, asters, daisies, chrysanthemums and artichokes.</TE>
<TE>   * When spading in compost for vegetable beds for these plants, use
no more than an inch of compost, and dig it well into existing soil.</TE>
<TE>   * If you are worried, grow a test plant in a 4-inch pot using one
part compost to three parts garden soil. Deformities should appear
with the second true pair of leaves.</TE>
<TE>   * If you have stunted, sterile or grossly deformed tomatoes, to
compare  them to clopyralid damage, go to the Washington State
University Web site at css.wsu. edu/compost/.</TE>
<TE>   * Information is also available from the university on how to
treat badly contaminated gardens with activated charcoal.</TE>
<TE>   * If you want to test your garden soil, the cost is $150, and the
lab with the most experience and sophisticated protocol is Anatek of
Moscow, Idaho. For information: (800) 943-2839.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, don't give up on compost, but be cautious; ask questions.
There are lots of ways to kill a plant, and the most common way is
poor soil condition, not clopyralid. Maybe we should even take fresh
looks at clover and dandelions and ask ourselves if they're such bad
plants, after all.</TE>

<TE>   It may rain this month and snow may dust the mountains, but spring
has arrived. Everything seems to be in bloom, and the gardening
opportunities are nearly endless.</TE>
<TE>   You can plant just about anything, from seeds to citrus, and there
are plenty of chores to do, from weeding to fertilizing.</TE>
<TE>   Fertilize every plant in the garden to encourage spring growth and
flowering. If you can get around to this job only once a year, now is
the time.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest way is to scatter an all-purpose, granular fertilizer
on the ground and then water it in with a sprinkler, or hope for
rain.</TE>

<LD>Rub your hands together. The pressure and heat you create is called
friction. Friction is the measure of the force that two objects or
surfaces create when dragged against each other. Friction is created
when you pull a box across a floor or when your bicycle tires move
against the pavement.</LD>
<LD>   Today, without friction, our cars would not be able to stop.
Friction is created inside a car's wheels between the metal brake
pads and the metal brake discs. The pads and discs are squeezed
together under pressure. This pressure creates friction, which slows
the wheels and stops the car.</LD>
<LD>   The harder pressure is applied--like when you jam on the brakes on
a bicycle or spin the tires in a quick takeoff--the more friction
(and heat) is created. That's why some racing cars "smoke" their
tires when they take off quickly. They create huge amounts of
friction and heat when their large tires exert enormous pressure on
the racetrack surface.</LD>
<TE>   But friction is not always desirable. Auto engineers try to
eliminate friction in many areas to reduce wear and tear. The engine,
the door locks, even the windshield wipers will operate longer and
better if the amount of friction between parts is reduced. Car
designers even try to minimize the friction of the outside air
flowing over a car's body by creating sleeker, lower designs that
move more easily through the air.</TE>

Museum's new Cruisin' Classroom, delivered to school campuses in a
1934 Ford panel truck. Teachers are invited to contact the museum at

<DH>Michael Moore takes on 'Stupid White Men' with his usual
outrage--and humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS BEALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael Moore is ticked off about a lot of things. Racism, corporate
greed, mad cow disease, drilling for oil on Alaska's North Slope. You
name it, America's favorite left-wing gadfly can get worked up about
it.</LD>
<LD>   But what really sticks in Moore's craw, the thing that makes him
want to strangle someone, is how the last presidential election was
decided. "We live in a democracy. The majority rules. And Gore got
the most votes," says Moore, whose new book is "Stupid White Men ...
and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation" (Regan Books).</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe we've got a guy sitting in the White House who
did not win the White House," says Moore, who voted for Ralph Nader.
"And I will never get over that. I will never be silent about it."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, when has Michael Moore ever been silent about anything?
Ever since he exploded into the national consciousness with his
critically acclaimed 1989 documentary "Roger and Me" (in which he
tries to track down General Motors President Roger Smith to ask him
why he closed the plants in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich.), Moore
has been a one-man radical SWAT team, using humor and his shuffling,
bearish presence to lay into America's sacred cows.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he's also become a ubiquitous media figure. Moore
has written a bestselling book ("Downsize This"), written and
directed a feature film ("Canadian Bacon"), and written, produced and
directed two TV series, one Emmy-nominated ("The Awful Truth") the
other an Emmy winner ("TV Nation"). He's even acted in one feature
film ("Lucky Numbers").</TE>
<TE>   Love him or hate him, Moore has become very difficult to avoid. So
here he is, heavier and shaggier than ever, a 47-year-old Irish
Catholic from the depressed factory city of Flint, Mich., whose
public persona seems to be equal amounts humility and bombast. One
moment, Moore will brag about how "I am one of the few people on this
side of the [political] fence that does reach a mainstream audience."
The next moment he'll discuss why "Roger and Me" was a failure,
because the film was made to shine a light on Flint's many problems,
yet the city is worse off than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I know why I started out to make that film, and it wasn't to get
a deal with Warner Bros.," he says. "It was to save my hometown, and
just the opposite happened. To me, it feels like a failure."</TE>
<TE>   Moore says all this while seated on a couch in his
tchotchke-filled office on West 57th Street, home to his production
company, United TV. The large space, which has a view of the Hudson
River, is filled with toys, plaques, movie posters, framed newspaper
stories and pictures, including one taken when Moore sneaked into the
presidential screening room during a Clinton-era White House dinner
to which he was invited.</TE>
<TE>   When his magazine-style TV series "The Awful Truth" is in
production, Moore employs as many as 50 people. Currently, he's
working with a skeleton staff of four or five film editors while he
pieces together "Bowling for Columbine" (the title refers to the last
class Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold attended before they shot 13
classmates and themselves).</TE>
<TE>   The new documentary takes an idiosyncratic look at America's gun
culture--of which Moore, a longtime NRA member, is a surprising
participant (he won target-shooting medals as a kid).</TE>
<TE>   "Why are there 16,000 gun murders a year [here], and 150 in
Canada?" Moore asks. "And in part of this movie I'm going to show
that Canada has 7 million guns inside of 10 million households.
They're a clear example of how you can have guns laying around but
not kill each other. I wanted to explore why that was." His theory is
that Canada's social welfare system gives its citizens a comfortable
enough safety net that they don't get desperate enough to resort to
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, though, Moore is lying on his couch looking for all the
world like a very hairy beached whale while discussing "Stupid White
Men." The impetus for the book came from the 2000 election, which so
infuriated Moore's sense of democratic process he decided to attack
some other issues that were gnawing at him.</TE>
<TE>   The book is filled with Moore's by-now familiar style--alternately
snarly, outraged and very funny--and it takes on everything from the
sorry state of American education to (not surprisingly) the entire
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   But probably the funniest and most controversial chapter is called
"Kill Whitey," a satiric look at racism in which Moore wonders why
people are so afraid of minorities when it is white people who have
caused all the world's major problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Who gave us the black plague?" Moore writes. "A white guy. Who
invented the punch card ballot? A white man. The genocide of Native
Americans? White man. Slavery? Whitey."</TE>
<TE>   And so on. Moore can be merciless when he wants to be, and he
certainly does not hold back in an open letter to the president, in
which he questions George W. Bush's literacy level, his arrest record
as a young adult and his drinking. Referring to the election, he even
calls Bush the "Thief-in-Chief." It is this no-holds-barred tone, in
fact, that Moore says caused problems with his publisher
Harper-Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "Stupid White Men" was due to come out in September, but its
release was postponed because of the Sept. 11 attacks. Moore says,
"The book was held up because the publisher was afraid of offending
people who like George W. Bush, because the book is extremely harsh
on the president. They wanted me to change that, to tone it down. But
I didn't feel any differently about him on Sept. 12th than I had on
Sept. 10th."</TE>
<TE>   Moore says he also offered to add a chapter to the book, to
reflect the post-9/11 world, but that Harper-Collins "said you can
only add something if you change your criticisms of George W. Bush
and you share 50% of the reprinting costs, which would be about
$100,000." Moore refused.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Herling, a spokeswoman for Harper-Collins, declined to
respond to any of Moore's specific complaints, saying only that "in
light of the events of Sept. 11 the book was put on hold until we
could figure out the best way to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   After a period of time it was decided that the book should be
published now as it was originally written."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy certainly didn't hurt the book's sales. "Stupid
White Men" hit the No. 1 spot on Amazon.com's bestseller list only
days after its publication late last month and has been in the top
five ever since. Moore feels especially gratified by this for two
reasons: It means he is not simply preaching to the choir, and his
success is a big raspberry in the face of lefties who disdain popular
culture and mass appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very wide, broad audience that goes deep into the
mainstream of America," says Moore, "and I'm one of the few people on
the left that has that, and I feel very fortunate and privileged to
have it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Moore feels he gets more criticism from political allies
than those opposed to his positions. "There's that part of the left
that likes to be in the role of the victim, and always losing," he
says, while adding that "I have literally hundreds of letters that
open with 'I'm a Republican, and I love your show.' It's clear that
what they're saying is they understand I respect their opinion, even
if it disagrees with mine. Even those people know I say and do the
things I do because I love this country, and I love the people in it,
and I just want to see it be better."</TE>
<TE>   Say this for Michael Moore: You can take the boy out of Flint, but
you can't take Flint out of the boy. Moore is wealthy, famous,
honored. He is recognized in the street all the time, and lives on a
relatively tony block on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Yet he still
maintains a home in Michigan and hangs out there with the same
friends he had 20 years ago, when he was writing and editing an
alternative weekly. So maybe he plays on this Joe Workingman image a
little much--you can't say Moore doesn't know his roots.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand when you come from Flint, Mich., there is
no left," he says. "There is no left community, no cafe to go to and
order a latte and talk about this stuff. The politics I have come
from growing up in an Irish-Catholic working-class factory family.</TE>
<TE>   "And it makes sense to me that if you come out of that experience,
you have a healthy distrust of those in authority, and you've figured
out who's trying to get rich off the backs of those who do all the
work."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Moore will appear at 2 p.m. today at Cal State L.A. in the
Luckman Theater and at 7:30 tonight at Immanuel Presbyterian Church,
3300 Wilshire Blvd.</TE>

<DH>Two new books by a graphic designer offer a glimpse of
1940s and '50s America through its ads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two hefty new books by Los Angeles graphic designer-author Jim
Heimann have just been released by Taschen: the 768-page
"All-American Ads of the 40's" and the 928-page "All-American Ads of
the 50's," ($40 each). Leafing through the pair is like walking
through a massive design exhibition on the mores of those two
decades. The books are peeks into what Americans wanted as much as
what they were made to want, albeit from a narrow perspective--the
homes are mostly Moderne America, the people mainly white and
middle-class.</LD>
<LD>   "All-American Ads of the 40's" is divided into chapters according
to product category: automobiles, alcohol and tobacco, consumer
products, food and beverage, fashion and beauty, industry, World War
II, interiors, entertainment and travel. The arrangement creates a
kind of hodgepodge of similar images that could have been less
confusing had they been arranged in chronological order. For example,
World War II played a prominent part in ads at the beginning of the
'40s, with patriotism linked to buying everything from Baby Ruth
candy bars to Hickok belts, but after the war, consumers were
encouraged to spend to build the economy. And following that, there
was a push for space travel and technology.</LD>
<TE>   This evolution is brought out in Willy R. Wilkerson III's
introductory essay. He explains that after the Allies dropped the
nuclear bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, the Atomic Age began, and with it
America's love of cars. Only about 222,000 cars were built in 1943;
the number jumped to more than 2 million in 1946. Between 1946 and
1950, 21.4 million new cars were sold. This car frenzy was helped
along by ads, which fill 84 pages of this book.</TE>
<TE>   With the hindsight of history, some of the ads in the book are now
pretty shocking. Celebrities, many of whom later died of lung cancer,
are shown promoting smoking, as are doctors. Ads for interiors also
promote the new Melmac--lead-based paint.</TE>
<TE>   There are also some that seem quaint, such as Formica draperies,
or prescient, such as one for the solar house. Lots of new timesaving
appliances are featured as well as suggestions for trips to exotic
lands. Many of these products are still with us, from Armstrong tiles
to Campbell's soup to Revlon cosmetics, while others, like De Soto
automobiles, are long gone. Most of the ads are done as illustrations
and their designs are more cluttered and have more copy than
contemporary ones. Some even have poems or entire story lines. Our
current interest in being politically correct is nowhere to be seen
in either book.</TE>
<TE>   "All-American Ads of the 50's" follows the same format, with
atomic/defense taking the place of World War II. As Jim Heimann
states in his essay, the Atomic Age was in full swing, with space
helmets and rockets used to sell cereal and car designers adding
elongated tail fins to cars to express speed.</TE>
<TE>   Home ownership also grew exponentially in the 1950s: At the
beginning of the decade, 23.6 million Americans owned their own
homes. By 1960 the figure had grown to 32.8 million, most of the
growth being in new suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans wholeheartedly embraced a whole range of fads in the
1950s, buying unnecessary objects out of sheer compulsion. Coonskin
caps, chlorophyll-infused products, capri pants, bongos, shrunken
heads, Hula-Hoops, flying saucers and Tupperware were bought with
abandon," Heimann writes. In his research for the book, he was
surprised by the proliferation of pink products, from stoves to
Cadillacs to toilet paper.</TE>
<TE>   When televisions became widespread, things really heated up.
Heimann reports that from 1950 to 1955, the sale of TV sets went from
3.1 million to 32 million. Ads in the 1950s still mostly featured
illustrations with lots of text, but photography began to be used
more. The car ads--nearly 200 pages of them--are particularly
glamorous, with women in strapless dresses and fur coats and tux-clad
men lolling around new cars near resorts or restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Heimann is currently working on two more books on ads, from the
'30s and the '60s. Who would ever have imagined that ads could say so
much about our recent past?</TE>

<LD>When Sally Fox was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, she
loved hand-spinning and weaving. She would even spin the fur that was
shed by her family dog. "I got a spinning wheel for my 13th
birthday," she said. "A love of insects also led me to organic
gardening." In 1982, while working in Davis, Calif., Fox combined her
interest in spinning with her interest in organic farming. She
developed organically grown, naturally colored cottons for widespread
use. "The two loves of my childhood," said Fox, "came together when I
came across this cotton."</LD>
<LD>   The development of colored-cotton agriculture began around 2700 BC
in Indo-Pakistan, Egypt and Peru. At that time, cotton grew naturally
in several colors, including tan, gray and reddish-brown. The fibers
were shorter and weaker than those of white cotton. That became
important during the 18th century with the beginning of the
industrial revolution. The long-fibered white cotton spun well on
machines and colored cotton did not.</LD>
<LD>   "I was working for a plant breeder," said Fox, who by then had
earned a master's degree in entomology, the science that studies
insects, "and asked why we weren't breeding the colored cotton to the
longer white cotton to improve the spinning quality. He told me there
wasn't a market for colored cotton. I asked, 'Why don't we make one?'
He said, 'Why don't you make one?'" That set Fox on her path.</LD>
<TE>   On her own time, Fox used the coyote brown cottonseeds the breeder
gave her, (ancestor of the brown variety of cotton) to grow a dozen
plants in pots on her mother's porch. They were naturally
pest-resistant, which was important to Fox. She had witnessed the
misuse of pesticides when she served in the Peace Corps in Gambia in
West Africa. The naturally colored cotton of the plants she grew was
brown and green. In years that followed, she developed plants that
were stronger and of other colors. She then crossbred them with the
long-fiber white cotton used for machine spinning. She developed
Foxfibreompany--the first commercially spinnable, naturally colored
cotton. She later gained a patent for her cotton's flame-resistant
qualities. In 1989 she founded Natural Cotton Colours Inc. Today
Foxfibreompany can be found in products ranging from clothes to bedsheets.</TE>
<TE>   At age 45, Fox continues her research and is looking forward to
increased production of her cotton with the opening of a new mill
dedicated to the spinning of her cotton. "I felt called to work on
the cotton in a way that seems as though the work is my vocation,"
she said. "I feel that the cotton has so many really special
qualities. It is an honor to have been able to devote my life to its
development."</TE>

<HD>An Onstage Party With the Wu-Tang Clan</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the hard-core know how to have a good time. And that's the side
of the Wu-Tang Clan that appeared in the first of its two shows
Tuesday at the House of Blues. For barely an hour, the sound was
hard, the pace was fast.</LD>
<LD>   But it was mostly just a party.</LD>
<LD>   The concert marked a too-rare return of the Wu-Tang's full lineup
(though again minus the incarcerated Ol' Dirty Bastard), and the
eight MCs and their entourage entered to the noise of sirens, big
beats and other effects. All performed with a casual intensity, but
the musical richness of RZA's album productions was mostly lost in
the live setting, taking a backseat to the overlapping voices and the
stories being told.</LD>
<TE>   "We already in the hip-hop hall of fame," boasted Raekwon,
standing center-stage in a Montreal Expos cap. He added later, "When
we make this music, it's like a movie to us. We need you to listen."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after erupting from Staten Island, Wu-Tang has managed
to stay relevant even as other hip-hop veterans of their generation
have been forgotten. The group's fourth album, "Iron Flag," maintains
Wu's bold musical intensity, with unlikely soul and pop samples
buried deep in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Though RZA is not the group's most distinctive vocalist, he
quickly assumed control of Tuesday's show whenever he stepped behind
the mike. Together with Raekwon and the others, Wu dropped in
references to ODB and other missing colleagues, as the group chanted
quietly, "Tupac, Biggie, we want you to know, we  really love you
so."</TE>
<TE>   But the set quickly returned to a party atmosphere as Wu-Tang
performed the boasting new single "Pinky Ring," set against big,
brassy samples. And after pulling up dozens of young women onto the
stage, the group ended the show as it began: all about the good
times.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout a career spanning print, film, theater and architecture,
Ray Bradbury has remained a storyteller first and foremost. And at
the heart of his stories--despite their wide diversity of plots,
settings and characters--beats an unwavering elemental drumbeat
celebrating our uniquely human capacity for wonder.</LD>
<LD>   At 81, Bradbury's reverence for the limitless imagination of
childhood hasn't dimmed, and that signature theme unites the one-acts
paired in "Bradbury X 2" at Theatre West. Adapted by Bradbury from
two of his short stories from the 1960s, the pieces showcase
different facets of the author's complex personality. And while they
don't entirely shed their literary DNA in this translation to the
floorboards, handsome staging by Charles Rome Smith successfully
illuminates the ageless appeal of Bradbury's expansive spirit.</LD>
<LD>   "To the Chicago Abyss," the shorter, opening piece, is also the
more theatrically accomplished--an eerie sojourn with Bradbury in his
futurist nightmare mood. In a grim post-apocalyptic society of
carefully rationed material and spiritual sustenance, an
authoritarian government struggles to stamp out every trace of the
world that had gone before.</LD>
<TE>   One of the last holdouts is a homeless Old Man (feisty Alan
Oppenheimer), who kindles faint embers of freedom and joy through his
reminiscences about the simple, vanishing delights of coffee,
cigarettes and "swallowing a whole universe of stars and comets in a
Milky Way bar."</TE>
<TE>   The Old Man's ability to elicit sympathy from strangers threatens
the System, so he lives in the shadows as a fugitive from the
sinister government (shades of "Fahrenheit 451"), relying on the
kindness of quietly sympathetic rebels (David Evans Brandt, Kathie
Barnes).</TE>
<TE>   Although the Old Man's recitations of bygone pleasures sound at
times like a laundry list, Oppenheimer's intense, thoroughly
committed performance invests the role with urgency and pathos.</TE>
<TE>   The second piece, "Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's is a Friend
of Mine," pays affectionate homage to the retro Americana of
Bradbury's youth, reminiscent in tone of Bradbury's "Dandelion Wine."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the simple charms of small-town life, a young boy (Soren
Fulton, sharing the role with Jeremy Sumpter) discovers a universe of
mystery and magic in the arrival of a stranger (Steve Nevil)
purporting to be Charles Dickens. "Mr. Dickens" turns out to be an
aspiring writer for whom the works of 19th century novelists took on
more reality than his own. Despite a distracting dialogue tendency to
wax overly literary, a nicely modulated balance of whimsy and
nostalgia carries the piece--especially in the finale, which unites
Dickens with an equally eccentric poet named Emily (Barnes).</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury invests far more symbolic weight to the clear-sighted
innocence of childhood than a child actor can reasonably be expected
to bear, and the audience has to make up the difference with a
projection of empathy. That's not hard to extend, given the
good-natured appeal of the piece.</TE>
<TE>   The rich emotional content of his tales has always made Bradbury
an awkward fit within the science fiction genre in which he is often
pigeonholed. These are not deeply thought pieces, but they are deeply
felt in both their telling and staging.</TE>

<LD>America's sweetheart Drew Barrymore was among the scene queens who
turned out for Club Make-Up's birthday party at the El Rey Theatre on
Saturday. The glam rock club, now in its third year, was a blast from
the past, as members of the Runaways performed classics such as
"Cherry Bomb" and Dee Dee Ramone blazed through the Ramones hit "I
Wanna Be Sedated." I hear you, brotha.... Hollywood's Beauty Bar
celebrated its second birthday Feb. 26, Belly turned 1 on Feb. 14 and
the Gate was the site of a swanky 50th birthday party for owner Art
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   In Davis' house o' Goth' was Dennis Quaid, who, I'm told,
practices yoga. Ohm.... Attempted to have lunch at Les Deux Cafe in
Hollywood with my favorite D.C. band, Good Charlotte. But when singer
Josh Madden showed up with pet "Cash Dog," we had to amscray to
Hollywood Boulevard.... Come kick it tonight at Moomba in WeHo with
singer Joey Sehee, the self-proclaimed "White Sammy Davis Jr."
Wouldn't miss it, baby....</LD>
<LD>   Warning Will Robinson: The Viper's Dayle Gloria says Ima Robot is
the next big band.... Promoter Jason Lavitt's brewing up a night at
One Seven, the youth club at Hollywood &amp; Highland. Lavitt, the
reigning king of pop discos, should be a fab fit.... Holy moly!
Dragstrip 66 is on Saturday at Rudolpho's in Silver Lake, and the
theme is "Drag Queen Time Machine: Dress as a Decade." I guess I'll
be doing the time warp again.</LD>

<HD>A Hip Space Is Sandwiched In</HD>
<DH>Wrasslemania, with dueling turntablists, livens up Tuesdays
in Kibbitz Room at Canter's deli.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Canter's on Fairfax is as well-known for attracting gussied-up
hipsters, who swarm in after a night of Hollywood cavorting, as it is
for the seasoned contingent of neighborhood regulars who gobble matzo
ball soup and deli sandwiches.</LD>
<LD>   This collision of old school charm and new school cool is equally
evident at the 24-hour restaurant's adjoining bar, the Kibbitz Room.
And while most evenings the dimly lighted, dive-ish space hosts
fittingly low-key jazz and folk, Tuesday nights here burst with
youthful, upbeat sounds.</LD>
<LD>   In the early '90s the Kibbitz Room was home to a Tuesday night
jam, where everyone from the Black Crowes to the Wallflowers--whose
members helped organized the impromptu sessions--would take the mike.
The metal scene was waning, grunge had yet to break, and the
unfettered vibe and famous regulars made the Kibbitz Room L.A.'s
place to see and be seen.</LD>
<TE>   But the novelty wore off, the core group of musicians became busy
with record deals and touring, and the clubbers dispersed. The only
promoter to stick it out at Canter's was emcee-singer Morty Coyle of
the band the Imposters and cover group Men Without Sex. Coyle was
honing his own DJ skills and knew others around town were doing the
same. He transformed Tuesdays at the Kibbitz Room into a dance night
with competing turntablists. Wrasslemania was born.</TE>
<TE>   "There were five of us in the beginning, and the idea was that we
would tag-team or trade off, playing everything from rock to new wave
to funk," Coyle says. "One guy would play two songs, then the next,
then the next. It made for a very eclectic mix."</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, you still never know what you're gonna hear or
who you're gonna run into at this lively hangout. After squeezing by
the tiny, packed dance floor, Coyle and Zach Rosencrantz--the only
deck dynamos left from the original lineup--can be seen in a corner
at the turntables, going back and forth, beat matching and melding
together cuts that you'd never expect to hear in the same set.
Obscure '60s and '70s ditties melt away into raging metal anthems and
spanking new indie singles. They all wind their way back to familiar
'80s pop from Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go to dance clubs on the weekends, everybody's going
through the mating ritual or trying to make deals," says Eric
Thatcher, a Kibbitz bartender for eight years. "On Tuesdays it's not
as much about that as it about busting out and having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the trendy-looking, 20-something crowd may be filled with
actors, models, tourists and scenesters sporting dyed hair and
designer vintage wear, but there's never any pretense here. A great
song comes on and people flock to the floor. It may become nearly
impossible to get to the bar, but everybody's got a smile on their
face as they squeeze through. Inevitably, bodies spill into the
bigger, brighter adjoining room--the northern dining room of Canter's
Deli--to drink and socialize, but you won't see anybody ordering
pastrami on rye.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be you could get a bite to eat and then easily saunter
into the watering hole unnoticed. Some sneaky underagers took
advantage of the laid-back environment, and last year a couple of
fake-ID-toting kiddies got busted. Now a metal fence is erected every
Tuesday, separating the main restaurant from its adjacent room and
bar. IDs are meticulously examined and wristbands issued before
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, the changes haven't dampened the convivial atmosphere.
The club is still full and fashionable as ever. And why not? The
drinks are cheap, it's always free to get in, and because there's
matzo ball soup 40 feet away, it'll never adopt the pretensions of
other Hollywood hangs. "The emphasis here is on the relaxed, positive
vibe," Coyle says. "It's like a little bit of Silver Lake without
having to go all the way east."</TE>
<TE>   Wrasslemania, Tuesdays at Canter's Kibbitz Room, 419 Fairfax Ave.,
L.A. 10 p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older. Free. (323) 651-2030.</TE>

<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've reached the third floor of the Hollywood &amp; Highland center and
drunk in the two colossal statues of Babylonian elephants playing
patty-cake. OK, now turn right and look for the Johnny Rockets
hamburger counter, over toward the entrance to the Chinese 6
theaters. Then keep going--you'll run straight into Cafe Mozart of
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever you may have expected to find at Hollywood &amp; Highland,
Cafe Mozart is probably not it. This is a place with a civilized Old
World look; two of the walls are tile murals of 18th century Vienna,
and the third is hung with oil paintings. You don't even have to ask
who composed the classical music soundtrack here.</LD>
<LD>   You sit at one of the tiny tables and leaf through the menu, a
book of stiff pages affixed to a wooden rod that hangs from a sort of
European menu-hanger (if you find this sort of thing irresistible,
you can actually buy a hanger here: $45). It lists a few soups and
salads, a dozen or so sandwiches, a lot of Viennese pastries,
coffee-bar drinks and, surprisingly, more than 20 Euro-style ice
cream sundaes.</LD>
<TE>   The two soups are an egg noodle in rich chicken broth and a rather
salty minestrone. Among the salads there's a nice Caesar, easy on the
anchovy flavor and made with fresh croutons.</TE>
<TE>   Getting more serious, the sandwiches, which come with a creamy
potato salad spiked with pickle juice, are served on a round roll
like a non-puffy hamburger bun. They include only a few surprises
(salami and Jack with sun-dried tomatoes, ham and Jack with hummus
and basil), but they're made with good meats and cheeses, and you can
get them grilled in something like a Cuban sandwich press for no
extra charge. This makes for a novel tuna melt--in a flattened,
slightly crunchy bun, the filling brightened by little chunks of
tomato and pickle.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive sandwich, though, is the Austrian frankfurter:
two long franks that are like the ordinary kind, only more
so--meatier, juicier, more garlicky, a darker pink. These are major
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   You will have noticed the pastry case as you come in; people tend
to stand and gawk at it. In addition to relatively familiar choices
such as Black Forest cake, Sacher torte and Dobos torte (which
sometimes are a little dry), it generally contains Eszterhazy cake,
with its walnut-flavored filling, and Hungarian palatine cake (layer
of chocolate cake, layer of hazelnut mousse, layer of hard mocha
cream, topping of fresh fruit). The staggering Sissi cake (named for
an Austrian empress and pronounced "zissy") is in effect a brownie
topped with chocolate mousse and frosted with chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Cafe Mozart torte, an anthology of ground
nuts. It's chocolate cake covered with about an inch of hazelnut and
pistachio mousses, the whole thing encased in bright green marzipan.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Mozart takes the cafe part of its name seriously with 10
espressos, nine cappuccinos and half a dozen ice-cream coffee
confections, doctored with European flavoring syrups, whipped cream
and so forth. Since Starbucks, the espresso house has been developing
steadily in the direction of the old-time American soda fountain, and
Cafe Mozart takes this trend into high gear. There probably hasn't
been a restaurant around here serving so many sundaes in nearly 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   There are four variations on the banana split, including the
Austria, made with strawberry, chocolate chip and caramel-pecan ice
cream (the Gaisberg uses four kinds of ice cream). The Monarchia
sundae is the summit of complexity: caramel pecan and vanilla ice
creams, hazelnut and coconut syrups, thick caramel sauce, whipped
cream, walnuts, and a dusting of allspice and cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   So yes, it's called Cafe Mozart of Europe, but it's a dynamite
place to get a hot dog and a sundae. And then wash it all down with
Hungarian wine, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Mozart of Europe, Suite 321, Hollywood &amp; Highland, 6801
Highland Ave., Hollywood. (323) 957-9580. Open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to midnight, Friday and Saturday.

<TE>   What to get: Austrian chicken noodle soup, Caesar salad, Austrian
frankfurters, tuna melt, Amadeus sundae, Monarchia sundae, Sissi
cake, Cafe Mozart torte, Hungarian palatine cake.</TE>

<HD>Union Hoping for a Long Run in Santa Monica</HD>
<DH>The new restaurant with a sleek dining room takes over a
location where others failed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yet another newcomer debuts in the soigne Santa Monica space where
Bikini, then Abiquiu, then Rix all had shorter-than-hoped-for runs.
This freshly minted restaurant is called Union and it's owned by
Geoffrey's (of Malibu) proprietor Jeff Peterson.</LD>
<LD>   While the action at Rix seemed to focus on the bar and the
upstairs roof garden (much to the neighborhood's annoyance), Union is
concentrating on the sleek downstairs dining room. Commodious booths
and lights turned down low set the scene for cocktails and cooing.
And the food? It's classy supper club fare with a California
contemporary flourish. The chef is James Grey, who cooked at Les Deux
Cafes.</LD>
<LD>   To start, he proposes a lovely roasted corn chowder which tastes
of corn and Yukon gold potatoes and the occasional littleneck clam.
There's also "a simple salad of butter lettuce, tarragon and
shallots" which has every virtue. Or a bowl of Santa Barbara mussels
steamed with white wine, herbs and shallots swirled with cream.</LD>
<TE>   Could this be an unlikely trend? First G. Garvin's and now Union
are offering ribs as an appetizer. In Union's case, it's quite a
spread of very tender baby back ribs cloaked in subtly hot and smoky
sauce. I wouldn't mind a plate as a main course.</TE>
<TE>   Lighter appetites head straight to the pan-fried Idaho trout,
dusted in cornmeal and drizzled with a brown hazelnut butter. Crisp
and golden, it comes with a delicious succotash-inspired ragout of
romano beans, sweet corn and potatoes. Rack of lamb is set off with
lavender honey jus, a creamy parsnip puree and a serving of moist
potato-onion tart. Braised short ribs may be the most popular meat
dish going right now. These are butter tender and extremely rich.
Martini drinkers can, of course, find a classic T-bone and mashed
potatoes on the one-page menu.</TE>
<TE>   Union could get by with the usual desserts: creme brulee,
flourless chocolate cake and that ilk. But they've got a pastry chef,
Natasha MacAller, with ambition and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   With an oddly textured Scharffenberger chocolate pudding and an
ice cream sandwich made with pound cake instead of cookies is a
splendid brown butter plum tart made with green gage plums that made
everyone at my table sit up and pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows? Maybe Union will have a civilizing influence on the
place. If my first meal is anything to go by, Union is more than just
a pretty place for a cocktail. The food is good enough to merit a
visit on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Union Restaurant and Bar, 1413 5th St., Santa Monica, (310)
656-9688. Appetizers, $6 to $11; main courses, $14 to $24. Open
Tuesday through Saturday for dinner. Valet parking.</TE>

<DH>The play 'Bill's New Frock' uses humor in lessons about
discrimination and aims to open young people's minds about the
possibilities of theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In adapting the children's book "Bill's New Frock" for the theater,
necessity proved to be the (stage) mother of invention.</LD>
<LD>   When the show premiered in Scotland more than a decade ago, the
production's meager budget left director Doug Irvine with no choice
but to go minimal: four actors, three chairs, no props, no scenery.
Most of the budget went toward the pink frock of the title.</LD>
<LD>   After that, said Irvine, "all we had [left] was invention to tell
this story."</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, the bare-bones staging struck a chord with British
tykes, and the play became such a hit that Irvine still gets requests
to stage it, seven years after it last toured the U.K.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the production arrives in Southern California--beginning
March 30 as part of Center Theatre Group's P.L.A.Y. program that
includes public performances and tours through Southern California
schools--Irvine sees no need to mess with a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the beautiful, special thing about this type of theater
is that you have to use your imagination," Irvine said.</TE>
<TE>   The Anne Fine novel that inspired the play deals with themes of
gender discrimination and adolescent angst.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-year-old boy named Bill wakes up one morning to find he's a
girl, and his mom sends him off to school in a frilly pink dress. The
boys ban Bill from their playground games. Eventually, Bill learns a
lesson about discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The theme may seem universal, but it's far from certain whether
the play's British humor will resonate here. In the U.K., the comic
tradition of the male in drag is everywhere, from Benny Hill to Monty
Python to Dame Edna. Fine herself is also the author of the book
"Alias Madame Doubtfire," a cross-dressing caper that was made into
the movie "Mrs. Doubtfire" starring Robin Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has tinkered a bit to Americanize the new version. For
example, in the first version, when Bill shows up in his dress, his
male classmates ban him from the soccer field. In the U.S. staging,
Bill is instead banned from the gridiron.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the story is untouched. Back in 1991, Irvine and his
Scottish acting troupe, Visible Fictions, thought they saw a
"theatrical" style in Fine's book that would translate well to
theater, and so they adapted it for the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Plays should be a springboard for young audiences' imaginations,"
Irvine said. "Like when you read a book, you have to do a bit of work
with your imagination."</TE>
<TE>   The troupe was new and eager to establish itself in children's
theater, which members felt was more important than standard
repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   "Children don't know yet what the world is for them," Irvine said.
"They are trying to figure out what the world is all about, and we
have a responsibility to present them things that will shape their
minds and give them a taste of what the theater can be."</TE>
<TE>   It was that sense of fun that would eventually attract the
directors of P.L.A.Y., or Performing for Los Angeles Youth. Irvine
agreed to take a break from his troupe to bring a version of "Frock"
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The production stars Kimble Jemison, who says he's delighted to
wear the pink dress. It's quite a change for him; his resume is
dominated by movies and sitcoms in which he often played military men
or cops.</TE>
<TE>   "This has given me a chance to flip to the lighter side, to go out
there and have fun," said Jemison. "As an actor, I can take it to new
heights where I have never gone before."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he and Irvine said they're aiming for a colorful yet
gentle kind of satire, the kind offered in the British-made
clay-animated tales of Wallace and his dog, Gromit. They're hoping to
entertain without getting too outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow actor Paula Killen, who plays a slew of supporting roles in
the show, says "Frock" is one of the hardest and most rewarding
productions she's ever done--partly because of the minimalist set.</TE>
<TE>   "Every beat, every moment, is choreographed," Killen said. "So a
30-second bit will take us the whole morning to work on."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the show's cast and producers hope, the play will
sharpen kids' minds and tickle their funny bones so completely that
they won't think about the work or thought that went into the play.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure it is going to go by in a blink," Killen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill's New Frock" can be seen on Saturdays at the following

<HD>An Enchanting Duo at Rocco's</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The piano and the guitar share many characteristics that are
especially applicable to jazz. Each can be effective as a single-line
solo instrument, a harmonic instrument and a rhythm instrument. Given
that compatibility, it's a bit surprising that the duo is not more
frequently heard as a jazz chamber ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   The lovely performance by pianist Alan Pasqua and guitarist Larry
Koonse at Rocco's on Tuesday night was a convincing display of what
can happen when these two highly compatible instruments are brought
together by a pair of first-rate artists.</LD>
<LD>   Performing before an entranced audience, Pasqua and Koonse took a
relaxed but craftsmanlike approach. Quietly exchanging thoughts
between numbers about what to play next, they frequently started with
a solo by one or the other, gradually allowing the piece to coalesce
through fragments of melody and harmony. As the tunes unfolded, they
communicated by various means--body language, eye contact--to signal
each other through spontaneous shifts of rhythm and harmony.</LD>
<TE>   The music, for the most part, consisted of songs with attractive
harmonies--"All the Things You Are," "You Must Believe in Spring,"
"In Love in Vain," among others--offered with the panoply of
instrumental capabilities. At times, the rhythm was only implied,
with Pasqua and Koonse darting back and forth on the off-beats. At
other times, Pasqua played an accompaniment role by generating a
walking bass line in his left hand, with Koonse occasionally
returning the favor with brisk strumming.</TE>
<TE>   Moments of musical wit--a Baroque-like closing for "Whisper
Not"--enhanced the set.</TE>
<TE>   It was, by any measure, a superb performance, and one that
deserves repeating. In the hands of Pasqua and Koonse, the
combination of piano and guitar is a welcome addition to the lexicon
of jazz chamber ensembles.</TE>

<HD>Treats in 'Enchantment of Beauty and the Beast'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nine O'Clock Players, the 72-year-old, volunteer auxiliary of the
Assistance League of Southern California in Hollywood, used to put on
shows in the "worthy effort, but ... " category. The all-women
amateur theater group's jolly fairy tales for young students and
economically and physically challenged children were often staged
with more goodwill than skill.</LD>
<LD>   Times have changed. Today the company's fully staged,
professionally mounted shows boast a handful of talented pros who
bring polish and verve to the cast. They just need to stop clinging
to one unappealing "kiddie theater" staple--shrieking chases up and
down the aisles--and the less professional cast members need to stop
mistaking volume for expression.</LD>
<LD>   Not that there aren't treats aplenty in the company's current
production, "The Enchantment of Beauty and the Beast," directed by
Bonnie Hellman, despite the obligatory chase and a few uncommitted
performances. For starters, Vera Morris' adaptation of the classic
French tale has some original touches to raise interest, and the
title stars are exceptional.</LD>
<TE>   Tall, deep-voiced Jodi Gilbert, the company's always convincing
romantic lead, commands the stage as the Beast, movingly portraying
his arrogance, anguish and redemption. As Beauty, delicate Andrea
Ganzel, a Broadway and regional musical stage veteran, matches
Gilbert's credibility, and her beautiful, soaring singing voice
plucks the heartstrings.</TE>
<TE>   Versatile Judy Claverie, another accomplished singer who plays
narrator, sorceress, a talking clock and the mysterious "Rose
Legend," is another big plus.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Ridgeway's lavish, handsome fairy tale set in gold and
royal purple, complete with flickering wall sconces and an elevated
throne, should get star billing, too. Other highlights are Carol
Onofrio's sumptuous period costumes and Matthew O'Donnell's detailed
lighting design.</TE>
<TE>   Sound, by Linda Burke and Jeanie McCarthy, is less attractive. The
actors are over-miked, and raised voices and misguided shrieking--Pam
Schroer as a wolf and Jeanette Johnson as Beauty's hapless mom are
especially guilty--are painful. At the performance I saw, some
children covered their ears.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Francoeur's melodic music and lyrics, though, are a pleasant
surprise, only a bit reminiscent of you-know-who's blockbuster--a
hearty clock, a stylish French chair and an obliging painting
(cleverly done) welcome Beauty, and the words "be our guest" come up,
although the song is not otherwise like Disney's version. Musical
director David O, a stage and screen composer, deftly performs the
score live on piano and synthesizer.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the overall lovely look of the play are Julietta
Marcelli's graceful court dances and romantic waltzes, performed with
style.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enchantment of Beauty and the Beast," Walter Lantz Magic
Auditorium, Assistance League Playhouse, 1367 N. St. Andrews Place,
Hollywood. Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends March 24. $9. (323)
469-1970. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.</TE>

<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stop me if you've heard this one before: An out-of-towner moves to
L.A. and decides he's the only sane person around--until, just weeks
later, the city makes him as crazy as everyone else.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's an idea as old as the Hollywood Hills, but that hasn't
stopped the Action/Reaction Theater Company at Chandler Studio from
introducing yet another version of it in David Fonvielle's "Hollywood
Complex."</LD>
<LD>   A young writer who, like his protagonist, moved here from out of
state, Fonvielle characterizes L.A. as a land of soulless film
industry wannabes who salve their sorry lives with kinky group
showers and hot-chocolate enemas. (No, that last one doesn't make a
bit of sense, but that's the level of humor we're dealing with here.)</LD>
<TE>   Fonvielle plays the central role of Tom, a screenwriting hopeful
who has arranged to share a Hollywood apartment with a guy he's never
met. This turns out to be Jude (Jason Cramer), a low-level actor
whose constant companion, Clint (Christopher Brewster), is probably
homicidal. Jude maintains an open-door policy, which makes the
apartment a gathering place for the building's other kooks: Roger
(Steve Jarrard), a slimy, would-be producer; Elaine (Francy Cline), a
pathological liar who claims to be president of Paramount Pictures;
and Meg (Emily English), a fast-aging ingenue.</TE>
<TE>   Fonvielle musters a homely, hapless charm, while Cramer steals the
show as an amoral hipster whose ego outstrips his talent. English
provides solid support as a seeming sweetheart who may, in truth, be
the most depraved of the bunch.</TE>
<TE>   Director Michael Holmes tries to rev the action to farcical
levels, but he succeeds only near the end, in a scene meant to show
that Angelenos can't differentiate real life from an acting exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Complex," Chandler Studio, 12443 Chandler Blvd., North
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 4 p.m. Ends March 31.
$15. (818) 786-1045. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.</TE>

<LD>It's two classic sandwiches in one--grilled cheese and tuna.</LD>
<LD>   Broadway Deli: This version mixes albacore tuna with celery,
chives, tarragon, mayonnaise and chopped egg whites. It comes on
wheat, rye or sourdough, grilled until the cheese--Swiss, Jack or
cheddar--is running down the sides. You get French fries on the side.
(Tuna melt, $9.25.) Broadway Deli, 1457 Third St. Promenade, Santa
Monica (310) 451-0616.</LD>
<LD>   Victor's Restaurant: Here's a high-quality old-fashioned tuna
melt: line-caught albacore, chopped eggs, mayonnaise, celery and
onions. There's a wide selection of breads, but the rye and
pumpernickel are particularly good with either Swiss or Jack. The
choice of sides includes fried onion rings. (Tuna melt, $10.50.)
Victor's Restaurant, 1917 N. Bronson Drive, Hollywood, (323)
464-0275.</LD>
<TE>   Harbor House Cafe: Service is fast at these places. The sandwich
is albacore with a touch of celery, mayo and pickle relish, piled
high on rye or wheat with a couple of slices of cheddar, Jack, Swiss
or American cheese and grilled. Lettuce and tomato come on the side.
(Tuna melt, $7.65.) Harbor House Cafe, 34157 Pacific Coast Highway,
Dana Point, (949) 496-9270; 16341 PCH, Sunset Beach, (562) 592-5404.</TE>
<TE>   Say Cheese: This gourmet shop/ cafe tosses albacore with mayo,
celery and green onions, spreads it on rosemary bread with mustard,
mayo, alfalfa sprouts and lots of extra-sharp cheddar and grills the
whole thing until the cheese bubbles. It comes with baby greens in
balsamic vinaigrette. (Tuna melt, $8.50.) Say Cheese, 2800 Hyperion
Ave., Silver Lake, (323) 665-0545.</TE>
<TE>   Roll n' Rye Deli: These guys have been in the sandwich business

diced celery, heaped onto fresh rye bread and covered with American
cheese. When it's grilled, it oozes everywhere. (Tuna melt, $9.50.)
Roll n' Rye, 10990 W. Jefferson Blvd., Culver City, (310) 390-3497.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Mantilini: Spread between slices of corn rye is an
old-fashioned tuna salad made of albacore, celery, green onions,

<LD>   Condit's Wife Seeks</LD>
<LD>   Retraction From NBC</LD>
<TE>   Not a good stretch for the Condits. Shortly before Rep. Gary
Condit lost his congressional reelection bid Tuesday, a lawyer for
his wife, Carolyn, sent a letter to NBC demanding an on-air
retraction for a Feb. 6 episode of "Law &amp; Order," the New York Post
reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Missing," the episode in question, had some parallels with
Condit's well-publicized affair with the missing Chandra Levy--and
ended with an acknowledgement from the fictitious politico's wife
that she had killed the intern.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, attorney Brian Rishwain pointed out that the
program began with the statement "inspired, in part, by a true
incident" and charged that the show contained "several inaccuracies
that were built upon tabloid reports and other spurious rumors."
There would be no doubt in anyone's mind, he said, about on whom the
character of the wife was based.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that there's no basis for her claim and ... the show
is fictional," said a spokesman for USA Studios, which produces the
series.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Alters TV Version of James Bond Film</TE>
<TE>   ABC, the network that brought you the Victoria's Secret special
and partial nudity in "NYPD Blue," digitally altered several scenes
of last Saturday's telecast of the 1971 James Bond film "Diamonds Are
Forever."</TE>
<TE>   According to E! Online, the scenes were those depicting the
scantily clad character Plenty O'Toole. It said the Smoking Gun Web
site was the first to note that the color of actress Lana Wood's
sheer panties had been changed from tan to black--and that, in
addition to cutting some footage, a black bra had been added to her
torso.</TE>
<TE>   MGM, which owns the rights to the picture, declined to comment
officially, as did ABC. But a network source acknowledged that ABC
had asked the studio to fix the panties because they were
see-through, and said the studio had then added the bra.</TE>
<TE>   He said such edits were common, explaining that "a movie released
theatrically as PG is not the same as a television PG."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Watching Ellie," the new NBC sitcom starring ex-"Seinfeld"
co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus, drew an estimated 12 million viewers at
8:30 Tuesday night, a 28% drop-off from its debut a week ago. In
finishing second in its time slot to CBS' "JAG," "Ellie" did build
slightly on its lead-in, a rerun of "Frasier," and handily beat a
well-promoted episode of the ABC sitcom "Spin City" with guest star
Martin Sheen.... Phyllis Diller, 84, has announced that she's
retiring her stand-up act after 45 years in the business. She'll make
her final Los Angeles appearance at Cal State Northridge on April 13
and 14.... Bob Hope, 98, donated $1 million to the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences to help build an archive of comedy
performances.... The starting date for previews of "Talking Heads" at
the Tiffany Theatre has been changed. They will begin Sunday....
Roseanne has filed for divorce from her third husband, former
bodyguard Ben Thomas, whom she wed on Valentine's Day 1995. The
comedian cited "irreconcilable differences" and is seeking custody of
their 6-year-old son.... Leeza Gibbons, Chris Connelly and Ananda
Lewis were named Wednesday to co-host the official Academy Awards
arrival show on ABC on March 24.... Columbia Pictures has picked up
the rights to the 70-year-old "The Lone Ranger," a one-time radio
show that made it big on the small screen. A movie version will be
produced by Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher of "Gladiator" fame.</TE>

<HD>'Bernini of Cranbrook'</HD>
<DH>Carl Milles' sculptures steer clear of the extremes that so
deeply influenced him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Located in the small town of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and inspired by
the arts and crafts teachings of William Morris, the Cranbrook
Academy of Arts was often called the American Bauhaus. From 1931 to
1951, Carl Milles (1875-1955) served as resident sculptor and head of
the sculpture department. He was known as "the Bernini of Cranbrook."</LD>
<LD>   Although it's hard to imagine more unlikely bedfellows than
Bernini and the Bauhaus, it's easy to see how these incompatible
influences shaped Milles' bronze sculptures, 41 of which are
displayed at Pomona's Millard Sheets Gallery alongside 17 sketches by
the Swedish artist who became an American citizen in 1945.</LD>
<LD>   From the 17th century Italian Baroque sculptor Giovanni Lorenzo
Bernini, Milles borrowed a love of energized line, spiraling motion
and athletic bodies adrift on swirling currents of air. From the 20th
century Bauhaus, he drew a desire for simplicity, severity and
equilibrium.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Milles didn't have the talent to synthesize these
styles. In his figurative sculptures, the button-down rationalism of
Bauhaus utilitarianism cancels out the operatic extravagance of
Baroque emotionalism, resulting in pieces at once pedestrian and
illustrative.</TE>
<TE>   To their credit, Milles' sculptures combine the crowd-pleasing
accessibility of the popular arts with the heartwarming earnestness
of a hobbyist and the democratic conviction that art is for everyone.
Unpretentious to the core, they are animated by a sense of Midwestern
blandness--of craftsmanship that steers clear of extremes to get the
job done in a respectable fashion.</TE>
<TE>   His earliest works are small bronzes that date from the first
decade of the 20th century and show the influence of Rodin, in whose
Paris atelier Milles worked. "The Female Beggar," "The Milk-Carrier"
and "Women in the Wind" translate the existential gravitas of the
master's monumental figures into tabletop scenes whose compact
dimensions give them the presence of a student's studies.</TE>
<TE>   Made at the same time, Milles' "American Buffalo" bears comparison
to similarly scaled bronzes by Remington and Russell. In contrast,
his "Playing Elephants" goes well beyond the American illustrators'
capacity to make mass and movement complement one another.</TE>
<TE>   In the teens, Milles increased the size of his sculptures. He
eliminated the aggressive gesturalism of their craggy surfaces in
favor of smoothly modeled contours. The rich inner lives once implied
by his figures also disappeared, having been replaced by a cross
between stylish classicism and cartoon superficiality. These
streamlined forms recall Art Nouveau and anticipate Art Deco.</TE>
<TE>   "Girl With an Apple" (1912-13) and "Dancing Maenad" (1913) are
transitional works. Their cautious realism quickly gives way to the
goofy exuberance of "Sunshine" (1917-18), in which a double-tailed
mermaid, hair flying, hurtles through the surf on a plump dolphin's
back.</TE>
<TE>   The 1920s mark the apogee of Milles' artistry, with works like
"The Flying Horse," "Europa and the Bull," "Hunting Dogs" and "Diana"
building upon the confident simplicity of "Sunshine." As a group,
these lumpy yet lively sculptures appear to be the missing link
between Socialist Realism and Fernando Botero. Embracing neither the
formulaic polemics of the former nor the bloated silliness of the
latter, they still look good today because they do not take
themselves too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Milles' sculptures from the 1920s onward were designed to
decorate large public fountains, like those that still stand in front
of defunct branches of California Federal Savings and Loan. Because
many of the works exhibited are small versions of single figures in
multipart arrangements, the survey would benefit from the addition of
photographs that depict the fountains and their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   A few of Milles' drawings sketch the outlines of several
ensembles, but most focus on solitary details or narrate the dreams
in which his images came to him.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930, '40s and '50s, Milles added religious stories to a
repertoire that included Swedish and Greek myths, fanciful animals
and contemporary genre scenes such as swimmers and ice skaters.
Alongside "The Blinding of Paul," "Jonah and the Whale" and "The Hand
of God," angels appear frequently, playing musical instruments,
standing tiptoe on a stem, visiting a praying girl and wrestling with
Jacob.</TE>
<TE>   Formally, Milles' sculptures got looser, more expressive and
interior-oriented. Reverting to the look of his earliest works, they
lost the tautness of his best pieces.</TE>
<TE>   An exception to this slackening is "Wild Boar" (1940), in which he
transforms the animal's blunt muscularity into an abstract pattern of
refreshingly simple beauty. As an artist, Milles is at his best when
he appears to be untroubled by the idea that his sculptures are
ornamental--nothing more and nothing less than decorative
embellishments that enhance everyday surroundings by making life a
little more pleasant.</TE>

<HD>Soul Food With a Senegalese Twist at Bistro 4040</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ANGELA PETTERA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>African-American-Californian Restaurant: A West African-born man who
loves to cook soul food opened a place called Bistro 4040 about three
months ago in Baldwin Hills. He's chef Alle Thiam (pronounced Ali
Tom). You might recognize him from Morton's in West Hollywood, where
he worked as executive chef from 1995-98, or Kass Bah in West
Hollywood, where he played sous chef to his pal Gerry Garvin.</LD>
<LD>   Thiam, from Senegal, has been working most recently as a personal
chef and caterer, but he's always wanted his own place, which he
lovingly refers to as "my little joint on King Boulevard." The little
joint has 13 tables inside, seating about 30. Every night it's open,
the restaurant features dishes "From the Land of America" and dishes
"From the Land of Africa."</LD>
<TE>   Some African specialties might be (depending on the night) chaabu
jin, a Senegalese seafood stew ($9.95); chew yap, a tomato-based
oxtail stew ($8.95); or yassa ginaar, marinated chicken grilled in
lemon mustard sauce ($8.95). The appetizer-sized pastels (Senegalese
fried fish patties) with spicy tomato chutney are available every day
($3.95). American offerings include "Big Mama" fried chicken ($7.95);
blackened turkey meatloaf ($7.95); Caesar salad ($3.95); and
sweet-potato creme brulee ($3). Even though it's just a little
place, Thiam likes to run specials every night and has a small
private room for parties. Bistro 4040 is open Tuesdays through
Saturdays for lunch and dinner and for brunch on Sundays from 9:30
a.m. to 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   * Bistro 4040, 4040 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., at Hillcrest,
Baldwin Hills, (323) 290-0988.</TE>
<TE>   More American: While we're on the subject of American food,
Robin's Woodfire BBQ &amp; Grill in Pasadena lets you chow down as much
as humanly possible almost every night. On Monday, Tuesday and
Thursday nights the all-you-can-eat deals revolve around barbecue.
The dishes (like barbecued chicken, ribs and hot links) run $13.95.
On Wednesdays and Fridays, it's fish and chips at $8.95. On Sundays,
there's a "garbage can" combo for $16.95 served in a miniature
version of said can.</TE>
<TE>   * Robin's Woodfire BBQ &amp; Grill, 395 N. Rosemead Blvd., Pasadena,
(626) 351-8885.</TE>
<TE>   Big Gamble: If you don't mind terrible odds, try this free
gambling opportunity. Le Meridien hotel is giving away a trip to Le
Meridien Nirwana resort in Bali to the person who correctly predicts
all the Oscar winners. If more than one person guesses all 24
categories correctly (yeah, right), the winner will be chosen by
drawing. If no one guesses correctly, the highest-scoring ballot gets
the trip. Second prize is dinner for two in Le Festival restaurant at
Le Meridien in L.A. Third prize is Petrossian caviar service in Cafe
Noir, also at the hotel. Ballots are available in Cafe Noir until
March 24 at noon. You can enter as often as once a day.</TE>
<TE>   * Le Meridien, 465 S. La Cienega Blvd., L.A.; (310) 247-0400.</TE>
<TE>   Big Fish: All of the Pinot restaurants in the Patina Group are
overdosing on seafood from March 18-24 at dinnertime. Cafe Pinot in
downtown L.A., Pinot Bistro in Studio City, Pinot Hollywood, Pinot
Provence in Costa Mesa and Pinot Blanc in Napa Valley each will offer
four cold seafood appetizers, four warm seafood appetizers and eight
seafood entrees. Alaska Seafood is sponsoring the event.</TE>
<TE>   Each restaurant has its own spin on the ingredients being used,
but expect to see oysters on the half-shell ($9), stone crab claws or
cakes ($9), day boat scallops ($9), skate wing ($8), sturgeon ($21 to
$23), sea bream ($17.50) and loup de mer ($23).</TE>
<TE>   * Cafe Pinot, 700 W. 5th St., L.A.; (213) 239-6500. Pinot Bistro,
12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; (818) 990-0500. Pinot Hollywood,

Blvd., Costa Mesa; (714) 444-5900. Pinot Blanc, 641 Main St., St.
Helena, Napa Valley; (707) 963-6191.</TE>
<TE>   Wine, Then Food, Then More Food: Mako restaurant and the Wine
House are putting on a wine tasting featuring Melville Vineyards &amp;
Winery in Santa Barbara County, March 12, 6-8 p.m. Some of the
estate's Chardonnays, Pinot Noirs and Syrahs will be tasted with

Mako's prices).</TE>
<TE>   * Mako, 225 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 288-8338.</TE>
<TE>   Slowing It Down: The Slow Food movement is having a leisurely

eggplant), then ziti with sausage and Pernod. As for the main course,
that's leg of lamb. The tab for this slow evening (begins at 7 p.m.)
is $65.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remind me again: Is "Friends" a sitcom or a soap opera?</LD>
<LD>   It's become nearly impossible to tell this season, as the show
plays out the story of the heretofore philandering Joey falling
hopelessly in love with the pregnant Rachel.</LD>
<LD>   Every week of late has explored a new chapter of Joey's trauma.
First came his grappling with the feelings: Was it love or wasn't it?
It was. Should he tell anyone? Well, of course--what are friends for?
But what about telling his good buddy Ross, Rachel's former paramour
and the father of the baby she's carrying? And then, dare he bare his
soul to Rachel?</LD>
<TE>   Last week, he did. She thought he was kidding. Then she realized
he wasn't. She let him know the feeling wasn't mutual. He was
crestfallen. They hugged.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight (8 p.m. NBC): Can they go back to just being pals?</TE>
<TE>   The sappiness-to-laughter ratio seems increasingly out of balance
to this longtime viewer, but that's obviously a minority opinion.
"Friends" is the top-rated series on television this season,
averaging 24.9 million viewers a week--up a remarkable 20% from last
year's figure. Fans are writing letters to The Times saying Matt
LeBlanc and Jennifer Aniston deserve Emmys for their tenderhearted
performances. No wonder NBC just agreed to pay more than $150 million
for a ninth season.</TE>
<TE>   One must conclude that the show's title describes not only the
relationship of the characters but also the audience's feeling for
them. After years of watching their comedic struggles with jobs,
family and the opposite sex, viewers are now pulling for Joey and
Rachel--and Ross and Phoebe, too--to find the same happiness that
Chandler and Monica have.</TE>
<TE>   But any soap opera fan could have told you that.</TE>

<HD>Salute to a Real Trouper</HD>
<DH>Universal releases a set of DVDs to pay tribute to the long
career of comedian Bob Hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Hope will be celebrating his 99th birthday in May. And after
watching Universal Home Video's new "Bob Hope: The DVD Tribute
Collection" ($20 each) all one can say is thanks for the funny
memories.</LD>
<LD>   Because the majority of Hope's films in the '60s and early '70s
were pretty dreadful, one forgets just how gifted he was as a film
star. He was not a master farceur, but he could sing and dance. In
fact, on Broadway he introduced such songs as "It's De-Lovely" and "I
Can't Get Started"; in films, he unveiled the Oscar winners "Thanks
for the Memory" and "Buttons and Bows" and the Oscar-nominated
"Silver Bells." The DVD collection includes the first four "Road"
pictures he made with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour: 1940's "The
Road to Singapore," 1941's "The Road to Zanzibar," 1942's "The Road
to Morocco" and 1946's "The Road to Utopia."</LD>
<LD>   Included on the "Singapore" DVD are a photo gallery, production
notes, the original theatrical trailer, a sing-along for the fun tune
"Sweet Potato Piper" and the short but interesting documentary "Bob
Hope and the Road to Success," which examines Hope's early film
career and how he and Crosby were teamed up for "Singapore."
Interestingly enough, Hope had third billing in the film. In the
subsequent films, Lamour had third billing.</LD>
<TE>   The "Zanzibar" DVD includes the documentary, production notes,
trailer and excerpts from the radio show "Command Performance 1944"
that was filmed for the troops during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD of "Morocco"--which is the best of the "Road"
pictures--includes the documentary, the "Command Performance 1945"
trailer, photo gallery, production notes and "The Road to Morocco"
sing-along.</TE>
<TE>   "Utopia" features the documentary, photo gallery, production notes
and trailer and the entertaining 1945 World War II shot, "Hollywood
Victory Caravan," which features Hope, Crosby, Barbara Stanwyck,
Humphrey Bogart and Alan Ladd stumping for victory war bonds.</TE>
<TE>   An interesting note about "Utopia": It was filmed in 1944, but by
the time it was released in 1946, co-star Robert Benchley had died.</TE>
<TE>   Also included in the collection is the dandy 1948 western comedy
"The Paleface," in which Hope plays a cowardly dentist who teams up
with Jane Russell's Calamity Jane. The Technicolor delight includes a
photo gallery, production notes, trailer, a "Buttons &amp; Bows"
sing-along and "Entertaining the Troops," a documentary chronicling
the comic's USO shows during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Equally funny is 1940's "The Ghost Breakers," which finds Hope
playing a nervous radio broadcaster on the lam from the mob and
Paulette Goddard as a young woman who has inherited a haunted house
in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The film is a deft mixture of thrills and laughs served up by
director George Marshall. The DVD includes the "Entertaining the
Troops," a photo gallery, production notes, trailer and "Command
Performance 1944."</TE>
<TE>   There are also two DVD double features in the collection: "The Big
Broadcast of 1938," which marked Hope's feature debut and the film in
which he introduced "Thanks for the Memory," and "College Swing," a
bouncy 1938 musical that also stars George Burns, Gracie Allen and
Betty Grable; "My Favorite Blonde," an amusing comedy from 1942 with
Madeleine Carroll, is paired with the 1943 all-star World War II
revue "Star Spangled Rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg enters Stanley Kubrick territory with his dark,
disturbing fairy tale "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence." The late
Kubrick initiated the project first for himself and then asked his
good friend Spielberg to direct it.</TE>
<TE>   Haley Joel Osment gives another emotionally naked performance as a
robot boy who was designed for love; Jude Law nearly steals the film
as "Gigolo Joe," a robot designed to make love to human women.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, Spielberg forgoes supplying audio commentary for the
two-disc DVD (DreamWorks, $23). But there are enough goodies included
on the digital edition to make up for the absence of the audio track.</TE>
<TE>   The first disc includes a nice wide-screen transfer of the film
and a comprehensive documentary on how "A.I." was brought to the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc is filled with extras--a veritable "Everything You
Wanted to Know About A.I," including terrific interviews with
Spielberg, Osment and Law, behind-the-scenes featurettes on the
design, lighting and costumes for the film; a look at the production
design from original concept drawings to the building of the sets; an
examination of the development and creation of the robots used in the
film, including a visit to the Stan Winston Studios; an interview
with the special effects supervisor; interviews with two effects
supervisors at Industrial Light &amp; Magic and how they blended live
action with animation; an examination of the sound design; an
interview with composer John Williams, as well as storyboard
sequences, production drawings, a photo gallery and trailer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though Spielberg has avoided audio commentaries, Rod Lurie, the
director of "The Last Castle" (DreamWorks, $20) relishes talking
about his work--even if the film isn't very good. And despite a
stellar cast--including Robert Redford, James Gandolfini and Mark
Ruffalo--the drama about a heroic general (Redford) serving time in a
military prison bombed with most critics and languished at the box
office.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a passable HBO-produced featurette
and several deleted scenes with commentary by Lurie. The former film
critic offers some interesting tidbits in his commentary, including
the fact that Gandolfini played chess between scenes whereas Redford
read the dictionary and then quizzed Lurie on the definitions of
certain words. Lurie also doesn't shy away from pointing out mistakes
he made in the staging of several scenes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The enchanting, Oscar-nominated adventure-drama "Himalaya" makes
its video ($50) and DVD ($30) debut this week on Kino. Directed by
French filmmaker Eric Valli, "Himalaya" was shot over seven months in
the Dolpo region of Nepal and chronicles a power struggle for the
leadership of a tiny mountain village between an old chief and a
young man as they make their annual trek carrying salt across the
Himalayas. The majority of the cast--all of whom give marvelous
performances--is made up of actual villagers.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a wide-screen version of the film, the trailer, a
making of documentary and commentary from Valli, whose imperfect
English is sometimes difficult to understand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong martial arts superstar Jet Li goes the sci-fi route in
"The One" (Columbia TriStar, $27), a somewhat muddled
action-adventure that finds Li in a dual role of an honest police
officer and a universe-traveling assassin.</TE>
<TE>   The passable DVD includes both the wide- and full-screen versions
of the film, several featurettes including "Jet Li Is the One,"
talent files, trailers and OK commentary from director James Wong and
writer Glen Morgan. One interesting note: "The One" was originally
set to star The Rock. But when the wrestler was cast in "The Scorpion
King," Li stepped into the role.</TE>

<CX>   Bob Hope--In a review of Bob Hope movie DVDs in Thursday's Calendar
Weekend, the word "only" was left out of a sentence. The sentence should
have read: "He was not only a master farceur, but he could sing and
dance."</CX>

<HD>Storyopolis Offers Script Workshops for Children</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Storyopolis, the children's book store and art gallery, is
complementing its programs for preschoolers with a new writing
workshop series for ages 6 and up.</LD>
<LD>   The "Storyopolis Super-Sized Saturday" series launches this
weekend with a "Jr. Scriptwriting Workshop" led by Los Angeles-based
author, playwright and actor Doug Cooney, whose first novel "The
Beloved Dearly," based on his comic play about an enterprising kid's
pet funeral business, was just published by Simon &amp; Schuster Books
for Young Readers.</LD>
<LD>   Cooney's many works for adults and children have been presented by
the Kennedy Center, the Cleveland Playhouse, the Edinburgh Fringe
Festival and other respected theater entities; a recent project is
his adaptation of Dr. Seuss' "5,000 Fingers of Dr. T" for Sony Family
Entertainment's upcoming animated feature.</LD>
<TE>   During the workshop, Cooney will read excerpts of his book; the
scenes will then be performed by the Storyopolis Theatre Troupe.
Afterward, Cooney will help workshop participants turn their creative
efforts into a script format.</TE>
<TE>   "As workshops go, it's really substantial," Cooney said. "What I
hope to do is get the kids writing scenes that will show them those
essential elements of drama--conflict, tension and character--but
with a spirit of fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I think children are natural-born storytellers. I've been doing
this since the first grade. It's kind of like setting up a really
good joke and giving people parts to play and letting everybody
participate in the punch line."</TE>
<TE>   Cooney, a finalist as a solo performance artist for the
CalArts/Alpert Foundation's 1998 Award for Excellence in the Theater,
and recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the
MacArthur Foundation and A.S.K. Theatre Projects, has written and
performed adult works, but writing for children is "invigorating for
me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a playwright, you work in seclusion," Cooney said. "These
opportunities to get out and work with kids, to be exposed to that
kind of life and energy, are great. I always find that I easily get
as much from it as I'm giving."</TE>
<TE>   Other workshops in the new series include a "Jr. Mystery Writers
Workshop" with author Bruce Hale ("Chet Gecko, Private Eye" series)
on April 6 and an animation workshop with DreamWorks animators and
author Kathleen Duey, inspired by DreamWorks Pictures' new film (and
Duey's novelization) "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Storyopolis Super-Sized Saturday: Jr. Scriptwriting Workshop With
Doug Cooney," Storyopolis, 116 N. Robertson, Plaza A, L.A., Saturday
at 4 p.m. Ages 6 and up. $6. (310) 358-2512.</TE>

<HD>Traditional Fare Served With Traditional Flair</HD>
<DH>Review*Antonello Ristorante's extensive menu and old-style
elegance prove traditional doesn't mean boring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If any restaurant deserves to be called an Orange County institution,
23-year-old Antonello Ristorante does. It hasn't exactly done back
flips to change with the times, but that's what I like about it.</LD>
<LD>   I don't mean to suggest that it's a frumpy place of checkered
tablecloths with Chianti bottles for candleholders. In fact, it's
quite elegant, in a comfortable, old-fashioned way. With its
Romanesque arches, high ceilings, chandeliers, white tablecloths and
fresh-cut flowers, it's the kind of charming place that pulls up just
short of kitsch, sort of like an Italian Five Crowns.</LD>
<LD>   I wouldn't quite call the food retro, because there are some
contemporary flourishes, but for the most part, the menu is quite
traditional. It's also the traditional, obliging Italian restaurant
that will gladly do it your way: Divide your party's selection of
appetizers onto all the plates so that everybody gets to taste
everything. Not a problem.</LD>
<TE>   That's how I had three appetizers one night. The scampi oreganati
were deliciously sauteed with garlic, capers, basil and oregano, but
what really made them stand out was the fact that they were excellent
plump shrimp, done justice by being cooked medium rare. Wild
mushrooms (funghi trifolati), sauteed with garlic and white wine,
were meaty in texture and robust in flavor, with nutty and smoky
overtones.</TE>
<TE>   I also had a special appetizer of ravioli a la vodka, made with
fresh pasta, a firm and moist ricotta filling and a tomato cream
sauce with just the right note of astringency.</TE>
<TE>   Another night I sampled calamaretti in bianco, calamari in a white
wine sauce spiked with basil and parsley. Nothing flashy about it,
but the ringlets of squid were tender and the sauce demanded to be
sopped up with bread.</TE>
<TE>   In the salads, as with everything else, the ingredients are top
shelf. The kitchen could unleash a few more anchovies in the Caesar,
but the romaine lettuce is so fresh and crisp that drops of water
spurt into your mouth with each bite. An ordinary-sounding pear and
Gorgonzola salad comes in a spectacular, palate-cleansing raspberry
vinaigrette with a sprinkling of walnuts. (The dressing on the more
basic capricciosa salad is almost as good; I'm pretty sure I taste
Champagne vinegar.)</TE>
<TE>   I also liked the warm spinach salad (spinaci caldi) prepared at
your table: It's spinach laced with chunks of bacon, doused in a
brandy dressing, then flambeed for a sweet, savory result.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, there's a wide range of pastas.</TE>
<TE>   One practical-minded friend solved the problem of what to choose
by ordering ravioletti di Mama Pina, figuring anything named after a
restaurant owner's mother (it is her recipe, according to the menu)
has to be a safe bet. It was a good call. The miniature ravioli are
packed with veal and slathered in flavorful Bolognese sauce that
shows hours of slow cooking.</TE>
<TE>   On to the entrees.</TE>
<TE>   Antonello obviously knows how to treat seafood, and the salmon
with lobster sauce (salmone con salsa d'aragosta) is remarkable. The
salmon is tender, moist and flaky, and the sauce, made from lobster
stock, cream and shallots, is rich, savory and poised delicately
between sweetness and acidity. Served on a creamy bed of pureed
potatoes (moistened with olive oil instead of butter), it's a real
delight.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think as much of the sea bass (branzino) in a white wine
broth. The fish itself is good, but there are far too many capers in
the sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Fetto di pollo al boschetto is basically chicken Marsala made with
boneless chicken breast; unfortunately, the chicken breast comes out
dry, as this cut nearly always is. But the Marsala sauce, bobbing
with an assortment of mushrooms, is velvety and superb, retaining the
full flavor of the wine.</TE>
<TE>   The saltimbocca alla Romana is a variation on the theme of veal
scaloppini topped with Parma prosciutto and sauced with a hearty
white wine demi-glaze. This one uses a fine piece of veal, firm and
juicy. The prosciutto is on the salty side, but otherwise this is a
fine rendition.</TE>
<TE>   The wine list deserves some mention. It ranges far and wide, in
both selection and price, from decent wines at reasonable prices to
some real eye-poppers for serious (and well-heeled) connoisseurs.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the over-capered sea bass, there's very
little on this menu that isn't first-rate.</TE>
<TE>   So your evening is an agony of hard choices, and they don't stop
when the dessert cart comes around.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, I've concluded, the best of the desserts is
the berry tart, but that tiramisu is very tempting--supremely light,
with just the right amount of tart mascarpone cheese. Tiramisu just
doesn't come much better.</TE>
<TE>   Antonello is expensive. Appetizers run $8.25-$13.50, pastas
$14.50-$25.75 and entrees $22.50-$34.95. Full bar; reservations are a
good idea on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Antonello Ristorante, South Coast Plaza Village, 1611 Sunflower
Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 751-7153. Open 5:45 to 10 p.m.

<HD>Defeating Al Qaeda Takes Ingenuity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie, a syndicated columnist and political
cartoonist, was an Israeli combat major who trained and jumped with
the U.S. 101st Airborne, the paratroopers of the French Foreign
Legion, the British paratroopers and the Israeli special skydivers
unit.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of our best young men--Special Forces, Rangers, paratroopers of
the 101st Airborne--are risking their lives this very moment in the
mountains of Afghanistan, and several of them already have paid the
highest price possible. The problem is with the price--the
casualties.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda has some built-in advantages: They hold the higher
elevation, they know their little caves, their attack routes and
escape channels. They are used to the terrain and the weather, and
their needs are few. Their weaponry is neither new nor old and can
suffice their tactical needs. Most of them are Arabs, and as the old
Arab saying goes, "When you push a cat into the corner, it becomes a
tiger."</LD>
<LD>   We are better trained and our equipment is unmatched.
Nevertheless, if I were commanding a battalion, moving uphill in
those rugged mountains and chilly weather, trying to wipe out many
little outposts and caves that house fanatics who are engaged in a
psychological fervor of suicidal martyrdom, I would be concerned. I
would feel that I was walking in the footsteps of the Soviet units
that were the previous evicted tenants of those mountains. If there
is one thing I would not do, it is to follow their tragic path.</LD>
<TE>   But Special Forces are no strangers to special thinking.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least three things that we should do that Al Qaeda
can't:</TE>
<TE>   * We should operate in these mountains only at night. We are well
equipped for night fighting, which they know nothing about and
certainly are not outfitted for. Every shot fired in the dark by an
Al Qaeda fighter will extradite his position, which is not
necessarily the case during daytime. At night, he can't see us, but
we can see him.</TE>
<TE>   * We should command the mountain peaks from the top down. Don't
crawl up from the valley or expose big helicopters to fire; instead
drop in those tough small military skydiver units that can land on a
dime on a mountain peak. They can take position and start sniping
their way in the right direction: from top to bottom.</TE>
<TE>   * We should use gas. Not nerve gas or mustard gas but sleeping
gas. There's no reason why we can't use C-130 planes to cropdust them
with sleeping gas. Explosions of sleeping gas will neutralize the
enemy for several hours while our young men put their gas masks on
and get their handcuffs ready to arrest the snoring foe. The clouds
of sleeping sedatives would infiltrate every trench hole, bunker and
cave.</TE>
<TE>   The days of fixing bayonets are over. The days of fixing new
thinking have arrived. We are almost guaranteed technological
superiority against any feasible enemy, and we should use it fully to
our advantage, and to the benefit of the American mothers and fathers
who send their sons into battle.</TE>

<HD>In Which Truth Can You Trust?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So what are we supposed to believe? How do we trust what the experts
tell us? Not long ago, the analysts and accountants insisted that
Enron was a good company. Until recently, the American economy was
thought to be in a recession and our teenagers were alleged to be
drinking a quarter of the nation's alcohol. It was once said that
annual mammograms were a good idea, then that they were a bad idea,
then that they were a good idea again.</LD>
<LD>   What's the matter with us? Why are we always getting gulled?</LD>
<LD>   The standard answer is that the American people are gullible, if
not out-and-out dumb.</LD>
<TE>   In 1988, math professor John Allen Paulos wrote "Innumeracy:
Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences," in which he criticized
"a lack of numerical perspective, an exaggerated appreciation for
meaningless coincidence, a credulous acceptance of pseudosciences, an
inability to recognize social trade-offs."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, astronomer Carl Sagan wrote "The Demon-Haunted World:
Science as a Candle in the Dark," in which he lamented that "a kind
of Gresham's Law prevails in popular culture by which bad science
drives out good."</TE>
<TE>   At least three books with "dumbing"--the dumbing down of our kids,
of our curriculum, of America itself--are in print.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, columnist Michael Kinsley denounced Americans for
their "social hypochondria," mocking our imaginary fears that this or
that social ill will "destroy the country or the world unless it is
eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase H.L. Mencken, no pundit ever went wrong
underestimating the intelligence of the American people.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe the truth is just the opposite. Maybe we're getting
better at detecting hoaxes and lies.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth recalling that the "Piltdown Man" hoax--the claim that
a skull found in 1912 was that of a million-year-old humanoid--was
accepted as fact for four decades, until better tests proved that it
was a composite of modern human and ape bones.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the half-life of hoaxes has shrunk; in 1983, a German
forger sold Adolf Hitler's "lost" diaries to leading media around the
world, and the fakery was revealed within weeks. As for the teen
drinking "epidemic," a statistical error made by the National Center
on Addiction and Substance Abuse was discovered almost immediately.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, many people still believe in literal biblical
creationism, or in the so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion (a
hoax alleging a Jewish plot to take over the world) or in the
"chariots of the gods" thesis (that space aliens built the Pyramids),
but the rising level of fact-based sophistication makes it hard to
embrace those views and be taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   So says Howard Fienberg, a senior analyst at the Statistic
Assessment Service, a Washington-based think tank devoted to
junk-data busting. At the risk of putting himself out of a job, he
cites the Internet as a huge new resource that gives people the
capacity to "check things, whereas in the past they would have had to
accept things on faith."</TE>
<TE>   Then why does it seem as if we are more clueless?</TE>
<TE>   "Our ways of measuring are always evolving," Fienberg observes,
and in the course of that evolution, new measurements eclipse and
sometimes discredit old measurements.</TE>
<TE>   Thus maybe the real dilemma of our time is not what we don't know
or even what we do know but that we don't care. That is, if we live
our lives guided by a sense of irony, chaos and complexity, it's
unlikely that we will take much on faith. And so we don't seem to
worry much anymore whether something is true or false; the
presumption is that everything is "spin" and that we're all in on it.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Clinton's chiseling on the meaning of "is" may have been a
lie, but it didn't hurt him in the opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   Last year "Jihad!"--a book about fighting in Afghanistan, written
by one Tom Carew--became an international best-seller. And what
happened when it was revealed that the author had faked his service
with an elite British military unit?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing. The book is still selling.</TE>
<TE>   In ancient times, the curse of Cassandra was that she alone knew
the truth and yet nobody believed her. Today, everyone "knows" that
the search for truth is an endless existential wrestling match. Thus
the modern condition: We might know correct from incorrect, maybe
even right from wrong. But not for long.</TE>

<LD>With the surgical precision of a hired assassin, Gov. Gray Davis
crept into the Republican gubernatorial primary and performed a
gangland-style execution on the candidacy he believed to be his most
potent political threat.</LD>
<LD>   But now that Dick Riordan is sleeping with the political fishes,
did Gov. Soprano ensure his own reelection? Or did he leave himself
open to a retaliatory hit that could take him out in November?</LD>
<LD>   For a clue, look to the state's budgetary woes.</LD>
<TE>   During the primary, Davis spent $10 million on attack ads against
Riordan, contributing significantly to the former L.A. mayor's defeat
in Tuesday's GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   But while California's political community focused on the problems
faced by the front-running Riordan, challenger Bill Simon quietly
established himself as a disciplined candidate who may be in a better
position to give Davis a serious run in November.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Davis won't try to head Simon off. He's already painting
Simon as an ideological extremist, citing Simon's position as a
pro-life candidate as proof that he's outside of the state's voting
mainstream. But so eager is Davis to repeat his 1998 campaign, when
he rode the abortion issue into the governor's office, that he
appears not to have noticed the shift in the state's political
landscape over the past four years.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, California was experiencing an economic boom, the state
was running record budget surpluses and violent crime had fallen
dramatically over the previous eight years. Now, however, the state
faces a serious recession, a continuing energy crisis and the largest
budget deficit in California history. Because of the extent to which
these issues combine to dominate news coverage of state government,
it will be much more difficult for Davis to convince voters that
abortion is the single issue that should decide their vote.</TE>
<TE>   Setting the agenda will be Simon's greatest challenge and the key
to his election. If this election ends up being about abortion and
gay rights, Davis will be reelected. But if Simon can focus the
debate on California's economic recession, energy crisis and record
budget shortfalls, then he'll become the state's next governor.</TE>
<TE>   This won't be easy. Davis is an experienced and determined
campaigner whose strength is his ability to keep on message. Last
year, at the height of the state's energy crisis, the governor even
had to be persuaded to include some references to the prospect of
rolling blackouts in his State of the State address when all he
wanted to talk about was education.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and the election, Davis must somehow get past the huge
obstacle that the state's budget deficit presents him. One needs only
to look back 10 years, when former Gov. Pete Wilson saw his public
approval ratings fall to subterranean levels over the months-long
delay in adoption of the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson had two years before he faced reelection, during which
California's economy and his own political prospects rebounded. Davis
will have a month or two between the solution of this year's budget
crisis and the final stretch to the November election. If the budget
is balanced with a tax increase, that won't be much time for the
voters to forget--or forgive.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Simon's task will be to continually remind voters that
the state's economic health--not abortion--is the issue on which they
should base their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Davis has succeeded by making the race
about his opponent's shortcomings: Al Checchi's money, Dan Lungren's
extremism, Dianne Feinstein's finances. So his natural instinct will
be to frame this campaign around Simon's position on a single issue
on which Davis thinks Simon is vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Davis would like nothing better than not to have to face voter
anger over California's triple-threat crises: the state economy,
energy and the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for Simon is to resist this effort. He must convince
both pro-life and pro-choice Californians that Davis' obsession with
abortion--over which the California governor, in any case, has no
real control--suggests that Davis is trying to distract voters from a
discussion of his failures in office.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur was communications director for former Gov. Pete Wilson
and for the presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. John McCain. Last
summer, he served as an advisor to Riordan's gubernatorial
exploratory committee.</TE>

<HD>Boom. Take That. Monica Reclaims Her Image</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Monica Lewinsky is living proof of anything, it's that suffering
is good for the soul.</LD>
<LD>   The barest glimpse of her in HBO's new documentary, "Monica in
Black and White," is sufficient to reveal the startling effects of
her remarkable transformation.</LD>
<LD>   With the restrictions in her immunity agreement with independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr now expired, Lewinsky is free to discuss
openly her experiences in the Clinton White House; her relationship
with Linda Tripp, the former Pentagon assistant who secretly
tape-recorded her conversations; and her interactions with the FBI,
among many other details of her drag through the Washington mud pits.</LD>
<TE>   The film was shot over three days last spring, when Lewinsky
fielded ostensibly unscripted, uncensored questions from students in
the auditorium of New York City's Cooper Union University. The result
is a surprisingly intimate exercise in the oral tradition, one that
attempts to recover more than carrion and scandal from a political
fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   There are few factual revelations here, no shouting matches or
testy standoffs, though a few rather untoward questions do lend a
sense of authenticity to what must have otherwise been a fairly
controlled atmosphere. Still, even in tears, Lewinsky is more poised
than we have yet seen her.</TE>
<TE>   One audience member, for example, asks Lewinsky what it's like to
be known as the queen of oral sex. Her response is more reflective
and strong-minded than anything the old Lewinsky would have ventured:
"It's hurtful and it's insulting."</TE>
<TE>   Boom. Take that.</TE>
<TE>   A wide-eyed intern may have fallen down the rabbit hole four years
ago, but she has emerged as somebody else. The reconstructed Monica
is here, and Alice doesn't live there anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The girl in her is gone. The plastic smile, the kittenish coif,
the unspoiled face, the eagerness, the empty brass--all are gone. In
a tawdry parody of Camelot's dark side, Lewinsky was playing a brunet
Marilyn Monroe to Clinton's JFK. Now, she's just Norma Jean--weary
and deflated, yet somehow nuanced and obviously more complex and more
intelligent than anyone gave her credit for being.</TE>
<TE>   As you listen to this newly mature, reflective, even at times
witty young woman talk about her life, and as you process her
attempts to explain what was long ago explained away by the Clinton
defamation machine and the "vast right-wing conspiracy" (which made
her its pawn), you realize that history has devoured this nominal
vixen.</TE>
<TE>   Her story is not her own and probably never will be. She has told
it--or attempted to, despite the gag orders, distortions and
intimidation--through biographer Andrew Morton, television
interviewer Barbara Walters and Vanity Fair magazine, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing this film, one has the sense that she will spend the
rest of her life telling it, retelling it, reliving it and atoning
for it. She will reveal herself anew each day, and the vultures will
tear out her liver. That is her curse and the thing that makes
Lewinsky a truly tragic figure.</TE>
<TE>   That's also what makes this latest attempt at self-consciousness
such a laudable theatrical endeavor. It doesn't always succeed, but
this is life as a work of art--or at least a tentative first step on
the way.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, some of the grit, the substantial person, is coming
through to tackle the way jaundiced posterity will remember her.
Although Lewinsky was paid by HBO, it still must have taken guts to
stand up to scrutiny on camera and reclaim her image from the circus.</TE>
<TE>   She deserves some credit for doing so and for once, a little
respect.</TE>

<LD>Re "7 U.S. Troops Are Killed in Assault on Enemy Fighters," March 5:
When the war in Afghanistan began we learned there were 30,000 to
50,000 enemy fighters. We captured perhaps 500 and then won the war
there, but several thousand enemies seem to have been lost. Now
there's a battle against large numbers of a well-armed, dug-in enemy.
Not unexpectedly, we have lost some American fighters, which is never
good.</LD>
<LD>   When the war began, reporters would frequently ask: How many of
the enemy did we kill? The answer: We do not provide body counts.
Now, the news is that in the fierce battle near Gardez, some 100 or
more of the enemy were killed. It was wise of the U.S. government to
avoid the body count paradigm, which became a big lie in a previous
war. So one wonders why we have resorted to that phenomenon again.</LD>
<LD>   This is not an easy war, and the American people know less about
what is going on than in any previous combat situation that put
Americans at risk. And now we have the return of the body count,
perhaps because we have let tens of thousands of the enemy get away
and probably return to fight again, while the inevitable loss of
American lives commences. Body counts are just another demonstration
that this is a secret war being conducted by a very secretive
administration.</LD>

<TE>   I read with anger and sadness of the loss of more men in
Afghanistan. I read with greater anger that the head of the U.S.
Central Command, Army Gen. Tommy Franks, gives orders to these same
men to go out and risk their lives for our country as Franks sits in
the safety of his cushy quarters in Tampa, Fla. I wish I knew what
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf thinks of this; he went with his troops to
the Persian Gulf.</TE>

at least once a month on business and have always enjoyed the city.
But after running your marathon Sunday--surrounded by 23,000 of the
friendliest, most cheerful people I've ever met--after running
through all of your different neighborhoods, after being cheered on
by thousands of people who lined your sidewalks and, finally, after
following a marathon "pacer" named Viola for 18 miles and running one
of the best times of my life, this born-and-raised, die-hard New York

<LD>Re "Simon Trounces Riordan, Storms to GOP Nomination," March 6: I am
sure Gov. Gray Davis was celebrating along with Bill Simon over
Simon's win. With his extremist views that only a minority of
Californians can identify with, Simon just gave Davis a second term.
While Richard Riordan reached out to many people of all colors,
religions and party affiliations, Simon reaches out to the
anti-abortion extremists who have hijacked the Republican Party.
People can call me a "Jeffords Republican" or a "Riordan Republican,"
but come November, I will be a Republican voting for Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Marlena Robins</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again the Republican Party has shot itself in the foot by
nominating Simon over Riordan. Is it any wonder that the Legislature
has been in the hands of the Democrats? Is there a chance that the
party in this state has any idea how to win an election? There seems
to be no place for a moderate in the California Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   This is one moderate Republican who can no longer support the
party. I will not vote for Davis for governor; he has already shown
that he isn't qualified to run this state. But I cannot, in good
conscience, vote for Simon, another candidate out of touch with the
electorate. I can only hope that eventually the party will wake up
and realize that no conservative can win statewide office in
California, or even a majority of the local Assembly seats.</TE>

<TE>   Davis and his political machine successfully brought down Riordan
with one of the most loathsome examples of dirty politics this state

all about--and in a time when our blood is being spilled on foreign
soil to protect the freedoms that so many of you apparently take for
granted. How many of you who were flying the Stars and Stripes on
your cars just months ago couldn't take 10 minutes out of your day to
exercise your right to vote?</TE>

promised to add "Libertarian" to its sign. There, the hole-punch
chain had to be unscrewed and reattached because it was too short to
reach the ballot. When I finally was able to punch in my selections,
I overheard this from outside: "I'm the voting overseer here, but I
really don't know what I'm doing." God bless America!</TE>

<TE>   I went to my redistricted voting precinct at the Winnetka

what happened to our vote. I asked the person in charge to call
someone and he said, "There's no one to call."</TE>

bureaucratic bungling. It's not the chads.</TE>

<TE>   When I voted Tuesday, the people at the polls said they did not
expect a good turnout. In this affluent, upper-middle-class area, a
good turnout is 40% of the registered voters. Less than half. I would
just like to point out that taking part in the democratic process is
not a right, it is a responsibility. If you do not vote, that flag on
your car is an insult to those who do.</TE>

<LD>"For Bush, Environment Is Local" (March 3) says that in the Bush
administration "the federal government plays the role of facilitator
rather than dictator." This story was an advocacy piece for an
ignorant retreat to the glory days of the 1950s business environment,
when U.S. rivers were sumps for sewage effluent and industrial waste
and urban residents died from breathing polluted air. If local
entities would protect any public resource that generates income,
there would be no need for federal environmental laws. History proves
they don't, won't or can't take care of lands that line their
pockets. Polluted water and air cross state boundaries, and so only
on the federal level can we deal with protecting our water and air.</LD>
<LD>   National parks, forests and other federal lands belong to all of
us, not to local businesses, and are managed and protected by us
through our elected Congress. Petroleum and minerals are
irreplaceable national resources that shouldn't be squandered for
short-term profits.</LD>
<LD>   It is difficult and expensive to clean up our act, but is it too
hard? The Bush administration seems to think so. I think there are
other people with the will and ability to care for our beautiful
land, and at my next opportunity I'll vote for people who look like
they can.</LD>

<LD>Paul Dean's March 4 commentary, "Speed, the Sirens' Song," is
correct: 98% of today's drivers are incapable of handling a car at
high speed. Yet we are constantly bombarded with TV commercials of
cars being driven up winding mountain roads at blistering speed,
autos braking to a stop by doing a 360-degree turn on a gravel road
and other such foolishness. No longer do we see the warning:
"Professional driver; don't attempt this yourself."</LD>
<LD>   Every young mind believes this is acceptable and normal procedure.
Sex sells movies, speed sells cars.</LD>

<TE>   Dean's commentary was great, but he left out the scariest speeders
of all--the ones who can't check the mirrors when changing lanes
because they'd drop their cell phones. Cell-phone drivers are four
times as likely to have an accident as non-phoners, the same
percentage that applies to drunk drivers.</TE>

<LD>So Ayn Rand disciple Leonard Peikoff and his fellow Randians are
hopping mad because the evil government has taken two manuscript
pages from him that were missing from his gift to the Library of
Congress ("Donor of Ayn Rand Manuscript, U.S. Are Not on the Same
Page," March 5). I don't see why. According to your article, Peikoff,
of his own free will, signed a contract that gave the government the
papers and then sent a letter in which he falsely stated he had sent
"the complete materials." The government then, without regard for
gratitude, compassion or decency, mechanically enforced the contract.</LD>
<LD>   I should think followers of Ayn Rand would be pleased, since such
behavior is entirely consistent with her philosophy of objectivism.</LD>

<LD>Superman will be weakened and suffer irreparably if a hair company is
allowed to keep marketing a green hair gel called Kryptonite, the
superhero's creator claims.</LD>
<LD>   DC Comics hit Wella, maker of the new hair product, with a lawsuit
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, N.Y., to try to stop the company
from using the name to market the hair product.</LD>
<LD>   The comics company asked for unspecified damages as it alleged
that the gel's name infringes on the name created to describe an
element from Superman's home planet, Krypton, that weakens the hero.</LD>
<TE>   A Wella spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the
lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Panel Pushes Conditions for EchoStar Merger</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. should be forced to offer uniform
prices, new services and all local TV channels to buy the parent of
rival satellite broadcaster DirecTV, U.S. senators said.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators reviewing the proposed $33.6-billion merger of EchoStar
and Hughes Electronics Corp. should make the conditions legally
binding or name a special overseer of a combined firm, Sen. Herbert
Kohl (D-Wis.) said at a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar, owner of the Dish satellite network, says buying larger
rival Hughes from General Motors Corp. will create a strong
competitor to cable companies. The companies have promised to charge
one national price, provide all local TV stations and sell high-speed
Internet access to more communities.</LD>
<TE>   Under questioning by senators, DirecTV Chief Executive Eddy W.
Hartenstein and EchoStar CEO Charles W. Ergen said the firms would be
willing to sign an agreement to provide the prices and services,
including high-definition television and interactive TV, without
charging for new equipment.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar shares rose 60 cents to $27.41 on Nasdaq. GM climbed
$1.31 to $59.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Presley Estate May Sue to Block Use of Name</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The estate of Elvis Presley may sue to block a $517-million
Elvis-themed resort, saying the developer has no right to attach
Elvis' name to the project eight miles from the Graceland mansion in
Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   The developer, EPR Enterprises, said last week that it won the
approval of local planners to build on the 157-acre ranch once owned
by the singer in nearby Walls, Miss. Plans include 150 cottages that
duplicate where Elvis and Priscilla Presley stayed after their
wedding.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at Presley's estate, though, are worried that there's
not enough Elvis to go around. A drop in tourism brought on by the
slowing economy has led to fewer visitors to Graceland, Elvis' former
home, forcing the estate to fire 15% of its staff.</LD>
<TE>   Norcross, Ga.-based EPR Enterprises has options on the ranch and
645 acres of surrounding land and believes ownership would entitle it
to use the Elvis name, said Vice President J.D. Stacy.</TE>
<TE>   EPR wants to build 650 condominiums, two hotels, two 18-hole golf
courses, a convention center, a museum, three wedding chapels and an
indoor amusement park.</TE>

<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s Internet and wireless group said it had signed a
deal to develop news and entertainment for a wireless software
platform being rolled out by the nation's largest wireless telephone
network.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, Walt Disney Interactive Group will create
ESPN-branded sports services for a new applications platform being
developed by Qualcomm Inc. for use in wireless telephones. The
platform is being incorporated into the Verizon Wireless national
network, which is jointly owned by Verizon Communications and
Britain's Vodafone Group.</LD>
<LD>   Disney Interactive supplies free information from ESPN.com and
ABCNews.com to Verizon Wireless users, spokeswoman Kim Kerscher said.
But the development of new platform applications would allow Disney
Interactive to offer fee-based applications, provided the company
reaches an agreement with Verizon Wireless, she said.</LD>

items were selling at full price and inventories were lower than a
year ago.</LD>
<TE>   It now expects first-quarter earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents a
share, up from a previous forecast of 48 cents to 52 cents. Analysts
were expecting 48 cents.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The maker of Wonder Bread has agreed to settle federal charges that
it made unsupported advertising claims that calcium in its products
could make children's minds work better and improve their memories.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Interstate Bakeries Corp., of Kansas City,
Mo., and its advertising agency, Minneapolis-based Campbell Mithun,
are barred from making health claims without scientific proof, the
Federal Trade Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   The television ads aired in the second half of 2000 with a
fictional spokesman, Professor Wonder, who said that Wonder Bread is
a good source of calcium, the FTC said.</LD>
<TE>   However, Interstate Bakeries and Campbell did not have "adequate
scientific evidence to support their calcium claims," said Mary
Engle, a director with the FTC's advertising practices division.
Interstate Bakeries shares closed down 4 cents at $24.60 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co.'s $22.3-billion acquisition of Compaq Computer
Corp. was cleared by the Federal Trade Commission.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission did not find reason to believe that the proposed
transaction would impair competition in any relevant market," the FTC
said.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining hurdle is a March 19 shareholder vote. Dissident
director Walter Hewlett is leading a proxy battle against the
purchase, arguing that it dilutes the company's shares.</LD>
<TE>   The news came after the close of trading. Shares of
Hewlett-Packard fell 42 cents to $20.18, and Compaq shares rose 40
cents to $10.98, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after President Bush announced tariffs aimed at rescuing the
ailing steel industry, National Steel Corp. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, the latest steelmaker to fall prey to
depressed prices, high pension costs and tough competition from
imports.</LD>
<LD>   National Steel, which is 53%-owned by Japan's NKK Corp., said it
had an agreement in principle for as much as $450 million of
debtor-in-possession financing with its existing senior bank group,
subject to court approval.</LD>
<LD>   The Mishawaka, Ind.-based company said it would be able to pay
vendors for all goods and services provided after the filing date.
Trading in National Steel shares was halted Wednesday. They closed at
$1.03 on Tuesday on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>The books are closed on the worst advertising year in recent memory,
and the numbers for 2001 are not pretty--total advertising spending
plummeted 9.8% to $94.3 billion, research firm CMR said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the sectors hardest hit, according to CMR: national
newspapers, down 23% to $2.94billion; national spot radio, down 20.5%
to $2.17 billion; and spot television, down 18.2% to $14.87 billion.
The sole bright spot was cable television, which eked out a 1%
increase in 2001.</LD>

<LD>* DuPont Co. was told by a West Virginia jury to pay $7million to the
families of two victims of asbestos-related illnesses. The verdicts,
delivered Friday in state court in Charleston, told the company to
pay $6.4million and $600,000 in separate cases stemming from injuries
related to DuPont's facility in Belle, W. Va. DuPont said it
responded promptly to the asbestos problem and would appeal the
judgments.</LD>
<LD>   * Kmart Corp. won a federal bankruptcy judge's permission to draw
on a $2-billion bank loan, the biggest ever to a company reorganizing
under Chapter 11, to help pay its more than 250,000 workers and
hundreds of suppliers while reorganizing.</LD>
<LD>   * US Airways Group Inc. hired David N. Siegel from Cendant Corp.'s
Avis rental car unit as president and chief executive. Current CEO
Stephen Wolf will remain as chairman, US Airways said.</LD>
<TE>   * Canon Inc. said it will shutter an inkjet printer plant in
Tijuana, Mexico, that employs 417 people and a support office in
Costa Mesa, that employs 33 people. The Japanese company blamed
increasing global competition to manufacture highly functional inkjet
printers, as well as declining product prices. It plans to
consolidate production in Thailand and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   * Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, a leading buyout firm, said longtime
partner Charles Tate, 57, will retire in June but will remain on the
board of some of the firm's companies.</TE>

<LD>The five major record companies must submit proof today that they own
copyrights to the 213 songs they claim were pirated over the Napster
Inc. song-sharing network, a federal judge has ordered.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's order addresses one of
Napster's last-gasp defenses against the record companies'
copyright-infringement lawsuit. Attorneys for the Redwood City,
Calif.-based company argue that the labels may not own the digital
rights to the songs recorded by their artists, and that they may have
improperly claimed that the songs were "works for hire."</LD>
<LD>   The latter issue is important because it determines how long a
label reaps all the financial benefits from a song. The label
controls the copyright for 95 years if it's a work for hire, but if
not, an artist can reclaim the rights after 35 years.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers for the record companies say Napster's arguments are
far-fetched at best. But the issues raised by the company are
sensitive ones, given the labels' current tussles with artists over
online distribution and the rights to master recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Boorstyn, a lawyer in San Francisco whom Patel appointed as a
special master in the case, will review the copyright records and
advise whether the labels held the copyright to each work. If Patel
finds that the copyright to any of the songs does not belong to the
labels, that portion of the case will be dismissed, although the
actual copyright holder could sue Napster. No deadline was set for
Boorstyn to submit his report to Patel.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Schwartz, general counsel for Napster, said the
proceeding is significant "because it will reveal whether the record
labels actually own the digital rights to the works they're suing
Napster over." He added, "This process could be an important step
forward for artists who believe they should control the digital
distribution of their music."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Oppenheim, an attorney for the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, said digital-distribution rights aren't at issue in the
Napster case. The songs traded over the service were ripped from CDs,
not distributed by the labels as MP3 files and copied by Napster
users, Oppenheim said.</TE>
<TE>   The artists' contracts will clearly show that they assigned their
copyrights to their labels, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Patel probably will not decide the work-for-hire issue unless an
artist's contract is missing standard assignment of rights
provisions.</TE>

<HD>Platinum May Bid for Global Crossing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-based Platinum Equity is considering making an offer for
troubled Global Crossing Ltd., a move that could set up a bidding
battle between two brothers and their turnaround firms.</LD>
<LD>   Platinum Equity, run by Tom Gores, acknowledged Wednesday that it
has begun reviewing Global Crossing's financials and could submit an
offer before a Bankruptcy Court hearing in New York next week.</LD>
<LD>   In January, Platinum was negotiating to buy Global Marine, Global
Crossing's fiber-laying and maintenance subsidiary. That deal didn't
materialize before Global Crossing filed Jan. 28 for Bankruptcy Court
protection.</LD>
<TE>   Platinum now is weighing the merits of the entire company. The
privately owned buyout firm signed an expanded confidentiality
agreement Monday to get a closer look at Global Crossing's
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 99% sure we'll submit a bid," said Gores, founder and chief
executive of Platinum. "We will make a bid for the entire company."</TE>
<TE>   Gores said the Platinum bid probably will include more than $750
million in cash, though he declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, sources said Los Angeles-based Gores Technology
Group, headed by Tom Gores' older brother, Alec, is readying a bid
for Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Neither company has disclosed terms of the planned offers, but the
two have unwittingly bid against each other before.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, both turnaround firms made offers for Learning Co.,
Mattel Inc.'s troubled software company.</TE>
<TE>   Alec Gores won the company, and claimed to make it profitable 75
days later.</TE>
<TE>   If both firms follow through with planned bids, it would bring to
four the number of known offers for Bermuda-based Global Crossing,
which has executive offices in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has proposed a deal with two Asian firms,
Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies, which have offered $750
million in cash for about 79% ownership in a restructured Global
Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors have panned the offer as insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   A separate bid by shareholders has been neither embraced nor
rejected by creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Platinum, founded in 1995, has purchased 36 technology firms and
subsequently sold six of them. The company's most recent acquisition
came in January, when it bought a piece of Alcatel's business
services operation for about $1.3 billion. The group bought by
Platinum has 6,500 employees and serves 400,000 business customers in
17 European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Gores, 37, made his debut on the Forbes 400 list of richest
Americans this year, with his estimated $1.5-billion net worth
ranking him No. 293.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Surge on Further Signs of Economic Health</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Rally starts among blue chips, then spreads to
tech issues. One research firm sees a bull market underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rallied again Wednesday as new reports pointed to an economic
rebound.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury bond market also smelled recovery: Long-term yields
continued to rise to their highest levels in more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   After mild profit-taking Tuesday, buyers flocked to blue-chip
shares early in Wednesday's session, and the rally spread to the
Nasdaq market by afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials closed with a gain of 140.88 points, or 1.4%,
to 10,574.29. That recouped nearly all of Tuesday's 153-point loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite rose 24.11 points, or 1.3%, to 1,890.40. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500, up 16.63 points, or 1.5%, ended at a two-month
high of 1,162.77.</TE>
<TE>   "The recession is pretty much behind us, so the market is seeking
out companies with good prospects for the next year or two," said
Howard Kornblue, managing director of value funds for ING Funds.</TE>
<TE>   The market staged strong advances Friday and Monday on the heels
of surprisingly robust economic data. On Wednesday a new government
report showed that factory orders surged 1.6% in January.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Federal Reserve issued a regional economic report that
painted a brighter picture. That report, released at 2 p.m. EST,
helped stoke the market in the final two hours of trading.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dow up 4.6% since Feb. 28 and Nasdaq up 9.2%, the market
has broken out of the funk that kept prices depressed in January and
February. Many investors had been sellers, or sidelined, on fears
that the Enron Corp. debacle would be followed by widespread
corporate accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But mounting signs of economic recovery now are demanding
investors' focus, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, winners topped losers by 23 to 9 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 22 to 13 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   A new bull market for stocks has begun, according to a report from
Ned Davis Research Inc., a Venice, Fla., research firm. The Dow has
gained nearly 29% in the more than 155 days from its Sept. 21 low,
meeting the firm's criteria for a bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the index's advance during that stretch is the
fourth-weakest of the 33 bull markets on record, Ned Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "If substantial improvement does occur in expected and actual
[corporate] earnings, the market's upside potential will rise
accordingly," strategist Tim Hayes said in the report. "For now, the
odds favor a shallow bull market."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the outlook for corporate earnings is the major issue
hanging over the market. Many analysts question how strong the
recovery in earnings will be this year and in 2003. Because many
stocks already are high-priced relative to estimated 2002 earnings
per share, investors may need to believe that those estimates are too
low in order to justify bidding stocks substantially higher, some
say.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't appear to us that the market's overly cheap" based on
current earnings estimates, said Chris Conkey, chief investment
officer for equities at Evergreen Investment Management Co.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, investors pushed up long-term Treasury yields
to the highest levels in more than a month, as expectations of an
economic revival raise fears of higher inflation and greater demand
for credit.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year Treasury note ended at 5.05%, up from 5% on Tuesday
and the highest since Jan. 28. The 30-year T-bond yield rose to 5.55%
from 5.50% and is the highest since Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Robert McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, said
Wednesday there would be pressure on the Fed to raise short-term
rates before statistics showed quickening inflation. The Fed cut
short rates to 40-year lows last year.</TE>
<TE>   In commodity trading, near-term crude oil futures slipped 2 cents
to $23.15 a barrel after rising sharply in recent sessions, on
expectations that supplies will remain limited this year.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Industrial shares were strong, including Alcoa, up $1.01 to
$39.44; Phelps Dodge, up $2.34 to $40.86; and Deere, up 94 cents to
$48.97.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank stocks gained on optimism that a stronger economy will mean
more lending and lower credit losses. Bank of America rose $1.65 to
$66.70, J.P. Morgan Chase jumped $1.54 to $34.05, and Northern Trust
was up $1.50 to $59.15.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq financial stocks index hit a record high.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotech stocks soared after ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers
struck a new marketing deal for ImClone's experimental anti-cancer
drug. ImClone surged $4.81 to $28.63; Bristol rose $1.79 to $50.22.</TE>
<TE>   Among other biotech issues, Amgen gained $1.65 to $60.59 and
Cephalon leaped $3.34 to $63.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Battered wireless telecom stocks rebounded after Sprint PCS said
it would meet this year's profit and subscriber forecasts. Sprint
jumped $1.92 to $11.47, Nextel Communications rose 80 cents to $6.28,
and AT&amp;T Wireless was up 74 cents to $9.27.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks attracted buyers on expectations that travel
would pick up with the economy. Delta rose $1.26 to $36.91 and Alaska
Air surged $1.75 to $33.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Electricity generator Calpine rebounded $1.72 to $10.87 as
investors bet the company will soon line up needed new credit.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Says Amex Invites Merger Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The American Stock Exchange, through its investment bankers, has
asked the New York Stock Exchange to examine the third-largest U.S.
stock market and consider a combination with it, the NYSE said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We did receive a call from the bankers for the Amex asking us to
take a look," said Robert Zito, head of marketing and communications
for the NYSE. "We will, once we receive the materials."</LD>
<LD>   The Amex, which trades options, stocks and exchange-traded funds,
or ETFs, now is owned by the Nasdaq Stock Market's parent, the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. But the NASD, which is spinning
off the Nasdaq market as a separate entity, also is seeking to divest
the Amex.</LD>
<TE>   The Amex's interest in a merger with the NYSE was reported
Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   The Amex could offer the NYSE a way to expand in the growing ETF
business. ETFs are securities that represent a basket of stocks,
often those in an index, and trading volume in them has soared over
the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Amex's importance as a market of individual
company stocks has faded over the last decade as Nasdaq has eclipsed
it as the home of up-and-coming young companies.</TE>
<TE>   NASD Chairman Robert Glauber said last week that investment
bankers were still drawing up sale materials on the Amex. The NASD
wanted to conclude any divestiture by year-end, though there was no
guarantee that would happen, Glauber said.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal said no agreement between the NYSE and the
Amex was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Boosts Outlook,</TE>
<TE>   Triggering Stock Surge</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Corp. said Wednesday that its wireless business would add
more subscribers in the first quarter than analysts were expecting,
pushing the unit's downtrodden stock up 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 3 U.S. long-distance phone company said its Sprint PCS
unit would add 700,000 to 750,000 net subscribers, compared with Wall
Street expectations of 550,000 to 700,000. And Sprint said the unit
would yield cash flow approaching $600 million before customer
service center closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast came less than a week after Sprint said it lined up a
$1-billion bank loan in an effort to allay fears of a cash crunch--a
concern recently afflicting several telecom companies in the wake of
Global Crossing's failure.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Sprint PCS tracking stock closed at $11.47, up
$1.92, or 20%, on the New York Stock Exchange. Other depressed
wireless shares also rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also were encouraged that Sprint reaffirmed expectations
of 3 million subscriber additions and cash flow of $3 billion for
full-year 2002. It also reiterated its expectation of average revenue
per unit, a key measurement of performance, to be $60 a month.</TE>

<TE>   Veridian Files for Initial</TE>
<TE>   Public Stock Offering</TE>
<TE>   Veridian Corp., which develops intelligence-gathering networks and
programs for law enforcement and U.S. government agencies, including
the Defense Department, filed Wednesday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an initial public stock offering that could
raise up to $175 million.</TE>
<TE>   Defense-related stocks have rallied sharply since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which focused attention on intelligence-gathering
needs and defense strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Veridian said it had a net loss of $21.4 million in 2001 on
revenue of $690 million. The Arlington, Va.-based firm plans to list
its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VNX, but
it didn't name a date for the IPO.</TE>

<TE>   Mattel Inc.'s ratings outlook was revised to "stable" from

flow. Mattel shares (MAT) rose 20 cents to $19.20 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Factory Orders Rise for Second Month in January</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing orders rose in January for a second straight
month, another sign the economy is starting to recover from
recession.</LD>
<LD>   Orders increased 1.6% to $325.8billion, reflecting more demand for
autos and computers, after rising 0.7% in December, the Commerce
Department said. The last time factory orders rose in consecutive
months was February and March 2001, just as the economy was slipping
into recession.</LD>
<LD>   A recovery "may indeed have begun," said Anthony Santomero,
president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank and a voting
member of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. "Recent
statistics on economic activity are heartening, in fact, surprisingly
strong."</LD>
<TE>   "Compared to past recoveries, this one may turn out to be somewhat
milder, at least in its early stages," Santomero said.</TE>
<TE>   The view was underscored by the Fed's latest regional economic
survey, or "beige book," which said the economy was showing signs of
recovering.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers in most of the 12 Fed districts reported "modest
improvements" in sales compared with the end of last year, the Fed
said in its report. Manufacturing remained "generally weak," though
higher demand and reductions in inventories had led to an increase in
production by auto makers and high-tech companies. And service
industries were "mostly sluggish or flat," the Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding transportation equipment, factory orders rose 1.2% in
January after a 0.5% increase. More orders are being placed with
manufacturers after demand increased in the fourth quarter at the
fastest pace in 31/2 years. That helps explain why companies such as
Ford Motor Co. and Whirlpool Corp. are boosting production and
raising earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's report showed January's increase in orders was led by
a 2% gain in bookings for durable goods, which account for about half
of all factory orders. Orders for paper, food, petroleum and other
nondurable goods rose 1.1% in January after rising 0.5% in December.
The January increase was the biggest since May of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for transportation equipment rose 4.1% after increasing
1.8% the previous month. The rise was led by a 0.8% increase in
orders for vehicles and parts. Ford, the No. 2 auto maker, said it
plans to increase car and truck production by 4.4% in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Computers and electronic products orders increased 1.9% in January
after a 3.6% jump in December. Orders for computers and
semiconductors rose in January.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a
barometer of firms' plans to invest in new equipment, rose in January
for the third time in four months. Those orders, which increased 1.5%
in January, rose in the last three months at an 8.5% annual rate.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, factory inventories fell 0.6% in January, the 12th
straight decline, a sign manufacturers may boost production.</TE>

<HD>Clash Over Accounting Oversight</HD>
<DH>Reform: Head of board reviewing auditor independence says
SEC is letting big firms weaken panel's authority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The head of an accounting industry oversight panel complained
Wednesday that federal regulators are letting Big Five accounting
firms weaken the panel's auditor-independence review.</LD>
<LD>   Charles A. Bowsher, chairman of the Public Oversight Board, said
in an interview that his board was "not getting the leadership we
needed" from the Securities and Exchange Commission in fighting what
he regards as stalling tactics by the industry. The POB represents
the public in accounting matters.</LD>
<LD>   An SEC spokeswoman denied the charge and said the agency is moving
as quickly as it can with needed reforms.</LD>
<TE>   Bowsher detailed his complaints in a 16-page letter to John M.
Morrissey, the SEC's deputy chief accountant, and Robert J. Kueppers,
a Deloitte &amp; Touche partner who chairs an American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants committee involved in the issue. Bowsher
made the letter public Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The letter is the latest volley in an ongoing clash between
Bowsher, former head of the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, and SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt over how to reform
the accounting industry in the wake of the Enron Corp. implosion.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member oversight board voted unanimously in January to
disband by the end of March, citing the SEC's failure to consult the
board before Pitt issued recommendations for reforming the oversight
system. Although it is disbanding, the POB has presented a plan to
the commission for the completion of its auditor-independence review.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher has warned that the new oversight system could be
dominated by the Big Five: Andersen, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp;
Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, for his part, believes the POB's structure is faulty because
it receives all its funding from the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the main industry trade group. Still, he tried
unsuccessfully to talk the board out of disbanding.</TE>
<TE>   The POB review dates to January 2000, when the SEC announced that
its yearlong investigation of PricewaterhouseCoopers had disclosed
more than 8,000 violations of SEC auditor-independence rules, such as
partners having direct investments in firms they audit.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC asked Bowsher's panel to follow up with a sweeping review
of the Big Five's compliance with independence requirements. The
review would evaluate the firms' policies and systems for reducing
conflicts of interest between auditors and the public companies whose
financial reports they certify.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has drawn added scrutiny because of the Enron scandal.
Critics have accused Enron's auditor, Andersen, of lax supervision of
the energy trader's practices.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the POB began its review, it was halted when the
AICPA cut off money for the review.</TE>
<TE>   Then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt called the action "a significant
setback to self-regulation and independent oversight."</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, the commission accepted some industry-proposed
modifications but also called on the accounting firms to cooperate
with the oversight board's review. The funding was restored, but the
industry has failed to provide requested documents and otherwise
delayed the probe over issues that Bowsher regards as specious, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, Big Five firms asked the POB to suspend its
review while they responded to other independence queries from the
SEC. They also raised concerns about confidentiality, leading to
prolonged negotiations that Bowsher considered a delay tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher said he was further alarmed by a Feb. 20 letter in which
the SEC's Morrissey asked the Big Five firms to propose an
alternative approach for completing the review, in light of the POB's
decision to disband at the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   He also complained that the commission favors an industry proposal
to keep certain aspects of the review confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the delays, the oversight board has produced a detailed
plan for completing the review, and Bowsher urged the SEC to adopt
this plan rather than an industry-approved alternative. He also
recommended that the commission appoint an independent entity to
carry out the work.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate his comments, but this [review process] is moving
full speed ahead," SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Bowsher's complaints about industry foot-dragging "are between the
POB and the firms," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree that the reviews should go forward," Kueppers said in a
statement Wednesday night responding to Bowsher's letter. "Now that
the POB has reached their decision to disband, we are working
diligently to finalize an approach that makes sense and is in the
public interest."</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Horton, an accounting professor at the University of
Rhode Island who has followed the recent controversy, said, "I'm very
concerned that the SEC seems to be bowing down to the Big Five at
every turn."</TE>

<HD>Forever 21 Files Defamation Suit Against Groups</HD>
<DH>Retail: Owners say they were unfairly targeted, two days
after a judge rejects labor claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hip clothing retailer Forever 21 filed a defamation lawsuit against
several anti-sweatshop groups Wednesday, claiming they unfairly
targeted the label in a "vicious" public campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The suit came two days after U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real
dismissed a claim for back pay and damages filed on behalf of 19
workers, who said they sewed Forever 21 clothing at various Los
Angeles factories. The retailer argued in its motion for dismissal
that it had no control over wages and conditions because the workers
were employed by subcontractors. Attorneys for the workers said they
would appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Based largely on the workers' claims, made public last September,
several advocacy groups in Los Angeles took on Forever 21 as a symbol
of problems in the garment industry. The workers said they routinely
were paid less than the minimum wage and denied overtime premiums,
and had to work in filthy factories infested with rats and
cockroaches.</LD>
<TE>   Although not addressing the complaints, Forever 21 owners Do Won
and Jin Sook Chang said they did not employ the workers. They said
they buy clothing through vendors and contractors, and were removed
from the workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that Forever 21 was in no position to have any impact
on their working conditions," said attorney Robin D. Dal Soglio of
Latham &amp; Watkins. "Its owners are truly decent, good people, very
philanthropic, involved in their church ... To have them be
associated with sweatshop conditions is just so upsetting." Dal
Soglio said the owners are seeking a public apology and an injunction
to stop further activity.</TE>
<TE>   Groups named in the defamation suit include the Garment Worker
Center and the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.
Both have organized pickets outside Forever 21 stores and the owners'
Beverly Hills home, and maintained Web sites outlining worker
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Kimi Lee, director of the worker center, said Forever 21 was
targeted because of a high number of complaints associated with the
label. "We got so many workers from different factories in a short
period of time. In four to five months, about 20 workers came to us
from six different factories," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the use of contractors and subcontractors is common in
the garment industry, and that brand-name manufacturers and retailers
are taking steps to monitor working conditions in factories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Retailers such as Forever 21 "exert substantial control over the
economic relationships and employment conditions in the garment
industry," Lee said. "They could have ensured that the factories
where their labels were being sewed into clothing were in compliance
with labor laws."</TE>
<TE>   A Forever 21 vendor, also named in the original complaint, settled
with the workers, providing some back wages and agreeing to undergo
training in labor laws.</TE>
<TE>   The public campaign severely impacted Forever 21's image and hurt
sales during the crucial holiday season, Dal Soglio said. She said
the dismissal shows Forever 21's owners were right. "We've now been
vindicated," Dal Soglio said. "It's time to clear our name."</TE>

<HD>GenCorp Restates Fiscal Statements After Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GenCorp Inc. said Wednesday that it restated financial results for
the last three fiscal years after the maker of car sealants and
aerospace supplies and chemicals completed a review of accounting at
its auto parts plant.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Farukh Farooqi said the restatement is
fairly minor and ended uncertainty about the accounting review, which
had been holding back the company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   GenCorp shares surged $2.65, or 24%, to $13.60 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Net income for the first three quarters of fiscal 2001 was reduced
$3 million, decreasing earnings to 52 cents a share from 59 cents,
the Sacramento-based company said. Revenue was unchanged in all
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Income from continuing operations was reduced 5.4% to $52 million,
or $1.23 share, for fiscal 2000 and was reduced 2.2% to $45 million,
or $1.07, for 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions correct errors in accounting for customer-owned
tooling, inventory and the recognition of liabilities at a plant
operated by its GDX Automotive unit.</TE>
<TE>   The unit had reported a $2-million profit for the first nine
months of fiscal 2001, which included a $2-million loss in the third
quarter ended in August, GenCorp said</TE>
<TE>   GenCorp had restructuring costs of about $40 million in 2001 to
cut 1,300 jobs and close three plants at GDX Automotive.</TE>
<TE>   The company also cut about 113 employees, or 40%, of its Aerojet
Fine Chemicals unit in the fourth quarter. About 9,000 of the
company's 12,000 employees work in the GDX unit.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 jumped to $106
million, or $2.47 a share, from $7 million, or 14 cents, a year ago,
as sales rose 32% to $367 million.</TE>

<HD>Gymboree Posts Profit for Fiscal 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children's apparel retailer Gymboree Corp. on Wednesday reported a
fiscal fourth-quarter profit, reversing a year-earlier loss. The
company also forecast first-quarter earnings at the top end of Wall
Street's view, with rejuggled product lines and store efficiencies
expected to boost sales.</LD>
<LD>   Gymboree shares rose 36 cents, or 8%, to $12.21 on Nasdaq as
investors welcomed signs that the company's business is turning
around.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Friedman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the stock had
fallen so low it was now attractive to buy.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe the shares can move back to the mid-teens on continued
strong earnings growth and the potential that a new concept could see
store expansion accelerate longer term," Friedman said in a research
note. He raised his rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral."</TE>
<TE>   The Burlingame, Calif.-based company, which operates 580 stores,
posted net income of $10.5 million, or 35 cents a share. Its
year-earlier net loss was $1.2 million, or 4 cents, which included a
charge from its sold-off Zutopia division. The results were a penny
better than the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sales were $150.4 million in the 13-week quarter, down 2% from
last year's 14-week quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Gymboree projected first-quarter earnings of 7 cents to 9 cents,
compared with First Call estimates of 5 cents to 10 cents, and a mean
at 7 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Gymboree also said it plans to launch 10 stores based on a new
concept in the third quarter, on a test basis. The stores, dubbed
Janie &amp; Jack, will offer high-end apparel and gifts for infants.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California utility regulators Wednesday adopted an incentive program
to encourage local phone service giant SBC Pacific Bell to serve its
new competitors' customers as well as its own--moving PacBell a step
closer to selling long-distance service.</LD>
<LD>   Under the program approved by the Public Utilities Commission,
PacBell must provide service to its competitors on par with the
service it provides its own retail customers. Otherwise, it faces as
much as $15 million in monthly fines.</LD>
<LD>   Competitors could use the incentive payment to help pay for
leasing infrastructure and customer information from PacBell, which
is owned by SBC Communications Inc. Leftover money would be shared
with customers.</LD>

<HD>PG&amp;E Defends Including Windfall in Its Earnings Guidance
for 2002</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NIGEL HUNT</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp., parent of California's largest utility, Wednesday
defended its decision to include gains from the gap between power
costs and higher retail rates for the first time in forecasting
earnings, and declined to specify how much of that windfall was built
into its guidance.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E Chief Executive Robert Glynn said the inclusion of that
so-called headroom in the company's 2002 earnings guidance was
necessary due to "regulatory uncertainty" surrounding its Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric Co unit, which remains in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E on Tuesday projected 2002 earnings of $3 a share, but in a
reversal of past practice included the difference between fixed
retail rates earned by its utility unit and its costs of operations.
A large surplus during the last few months has allowed it to recover
previously written-off costs.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco-based PG&amp;E Corp. did not forecast a parallel loss in
2001 when market conditions were reversed and wholesale prices were
above retail rates, opting instead to treat the difference as a
one-time charge.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company's 2002 earnings guidance appeared to indicate
flat earnings versus $3.02 a share in 2001, Wall Street analysts, who
have mostly stripped out the price differential, were forecasting a
substantial drop in 2002 earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Headroom is included as a proxy for regulatory uncertainty,"
Glynn told a Morgan Stanley energy conference. Glynn, during the
question-and-answer session, repeatedly declined to specify how much
"headroom" was included in the company's guidance while saying he was
not seeking to "obfuscate" the company's outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Scott Pearl of Credit Suisse First Boston said Wednesday
in a research report that company guidance includes as much as 60
cents a share of headroom. He projected the company's 2002 earnings
at $2.40 a share, excluding headroom.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst James Dobson of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown on Wednesday cut
his estimate for 2002 to $2.50 a share from $2.95, also excluding
headroom.</TE>
<TE>   Dobson said although the company's earnings guidance implied about
50 cents a share in headroom earnings in 2002, it would probably be
much larger than that, noting "reported earnings in 2002 are likely
to significantly exceed $3 a share."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E shares fell 36 cents to $22.61 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Radio Exec's Claims of Payola Draw Fire</HD>
<DH>Music: Critics say the pay-for-play allegations ignore a
new spin on the industry practice by the official's own company.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top executive of Radio One Inc., the nation's largest broadcaster
of black music, is roiling the industry with allegations of
corruption in the music promotion business while generating
criticisms of her own company's conduct.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Operating Officer Mary Catherine Sneed said the music
business is rife with payoffs to radio stations to guarantee airplay
of songs. She alleged that some money is illegally being kicked back
to record label executives.</LD>
<LD>   "The way it works now at urban radio is that [middlemen] give cash
under the table to the program director at the station and then kick
back money to the vice president of promotion at the record label,"
Sneed said. "It's not legal. We can't operate like that. Radio One
intends to clean up this mess."</LD>
<TE>   Her comments are the first from a ranking radio executive alleging
widespread payola in the urban, or black, radio world. But her
proposed solution is drawing fire.</TE>
<TE>   She is being accused by critics of setting up a system that
requires record labels to pay someone else--a newly created company
that Sneed has hired as the gatekeeper for songs played on Radio
One's two dozen stations, including KKBT-FM (100.3) "The Beat" in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Rival radio chains Clear Channel Communications Inc. and Cumulus
Media Group have been criticized for similar arrangements that allow
the companies to tap into millions of dollars of record-label
promotional funds.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies deny any knowledge of illegal payments to
stations or kickbacks to their employees.</TE>
<TE>   "These are false, trumped-up charges," said Hilary Rosen, chief
executive of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, which
represents the nation's five largest music corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio One is trying to use its leverage to get additional money
from the record companies to put to their bottom line. We intend to
... ask the FCC to write new rules because we think the tactics being
used by Radio One and other broadcast groups are outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Already, some in government are primed for action.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how it is accomplished, payola is illegal," said Rep.
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who is pushing for House Judiciary
Committee hearings on improper station practices. "When radio
stations, so-called independent promoters, or their employees demand
money from record companies and recording artists for airplay, the
payments are illegal unless disclosed, no matter how the transactions
are structured."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills) said he is adding Radio
One to the list of radio conglomerates, including Clear Channel, that
he wants investigated by the FCC and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that it's not about what songs listeners want to
hear any more. It's about who is willing to pay us [the radio
conglomerates] and help our bottom line," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits radio stations from accepting money for
playing songs without disclosing that information to listeners.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three years, the Justice Department has reviewed
complaints about cash payments at urban radio stations as part of a
lengthy probe into corruption in the radio business.</TE>
<TE>   That probe resulted in payola-related tax convictions against
several label and radio executives in the Latin-music field, but none
were brought in the urban-music field.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Robinson, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who
ran the federal payola probe, refused to comment on charges raised
this week by Sneed or on whether the government intended to
investigate Radio One.</TE>
<TE>   "Our office has successfully prosecuted charges involving secret
cash payments made to Latin-music program directors in the past, and
we continue to be interested in investigating any such illegal
payments in other music markets as well," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Sneed, a lawyer who has been with Radio One for nearly a decade,
said she has no specific proof of illegalities at her own company,
although she acknowledged that such practices are endemic to urban
radio stations across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks there is no paper trail to prove this stuff, but
there is," Sneed said.</TE>
<TE>   In the urban-music world, Sneed and other industry sources said,
record labels have long attempted to insulate themselves from
allegations of payola by hiring independent contractors, called
quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   To further protect themselves, record labels require the
quarterbacks to sign declarations vowing that their operations do not
violate payola laws.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike independent consultants who provide annual promotion
budgets to pop and rock stations, several urban-music quarterbacks
are believed to make direct cash payments to radio programmers to
play specific songs, say Sneed and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   Some quarterbacks kick back a slice of that money to the
lower-level record-label employees who hire them, Sneed and others
allege.</TE>
<TE>   None of that money--ranging from $60,000 to $200,000--goes into
the station's corporate coffers, a situation Sneed is trying to
change.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 7, Radio One notified record labels that it signed a pact
with Ventura Media Group, granting the newly launched New Jersey firm
the exclusive right to pitch songs to program directors at its top 25
urban stations.</TE>
<TE>   Under the arrangement, Ventura pays a fixed annual fee to each
Radio One station. Ventura gets its money by charging labels an
estimated $2,500 every time a programmer adds a song to a station
playlist.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent my whole life staying away from independent promoters,
but at this point what we are doing is like standard operating
procedure approved by the FCC," Sneed said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had our attorneys and FCC attorneys look the contracts
over. For us, this is just another revenue stream. We're a big public
company and we owe it to our stockholders," she said. "We'd be crazy
not to try to tap into this. Everybody's doing it: Cumulus, Clear
Channel, all the big groups."</TE>
<TE>   The arrangements being pioneered by Radio One and other giant
broadcast chains reflect a fundamental shift of control in the music
business. In the past, powerful record companies were accused of
bribing deejays operating at small, independent radio stations to
influence what songs were played.</TE>
<TE>   Industry mergers have moved the balance of power to radio groups,
which today have the clout to launch a song simultaneously in scores
of markets across the country--or consign it to oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Music executives privately allege that Radio One has threatened to
withhold airplay from labels that do not pay Ventura Media Group, its
new agent. Statistics compiled by Broadcast Data Systems indicate
that playlists at several Radio One stations appear to have been
frozen after the broadcaster issued its decree on Feb. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Sneed denied that Radio One had refused to add songs to playlists
but acknowledged that the company had "backed off playing some new
music" because of the reorganization of an in-house research
department. Sneed's explanation of why some songs were not being
aired was first reported in Friday's edition of R&amp;B Airplay Monitor
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been having a terrible time trying to get the record labels
to accept the fact that we're finally going to change all this at
urban radio," Sneed told The Times. "Somebody at some label is going
to get cut out of some secret transaction when Radio One starts doing
things the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Sneed, scheduled to meet today with several New York label
executives, rejected suggestions that Ventura Media Group was a front
to funnel record-label payments to her broadcast chain.</TE>
<TE>   Sneed said Radio One had no hidden connection to Ventura and
insisted that the broadcaster plays no role in dictating what Ventura
charges labels. She said the broadcaster had picked the company
because its founder, former record-label promoter Jodi Williams,
seemed ethical and made a good pitch--even though she has no
independent promotion experience.</TE>
<TE>   Williams declined repeated requests to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sneed, Radio One would rather ride out the
controversy surrounding its new venture than cave in to the
alternative: "An illegal quarterbacking system" that she says has
plagued urban radio for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarterback system is certainly not one that the FCC has
sanctioned," Sneed said. "It's full of hidden payments. And there are
other things involved too. The basic old payola stuff: sex, drugs,
etc. But primarily what we're talking about here is cash under the
table."</TE>

<HD>Airports' Growth May Spark Booms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of the battle to build an international airport at El Toro is
likely to spur greater booms in Ontario, the nearby Inland Empire,
San Diego and perhaps neighboring Tijuana as well.</LD>
<LD>   That's where public officials and businesspeople were looking
Wednesday to find future alternative airport space to accommodate
Southern California's growing population and global businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Their mission is critical. Failure to develop alternative airport
capacity will severely imperil the region's economic growth, which is
heavily dependent on international trade and travel.</LD>
<TE>   Such failure will allow other cities, such as Phoenix and Las
Vegas, and other ports, such as Seattle and Oakland, to take away
international traffic and business.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be forced to deal with expanded passenger and cargo traffic
in inadequate facilities and have the worst of both worlds," says
Peggy Ducey, chief executive of the Southern California Regional
Airport Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Airports bring in and ship out the computer parts, medical
instruments and other high-value goods that are the hallmark of this
region's economy," says economist Steven Erie of UC San Diego.
Today's airport facilities add more than $120billion in annual
business to the $250billion in economic activity generated by trade
through the seaports of Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But it is hard to overstate the economic multiplier effect of
airports because they play such a central role in business travel,
tourism, mail delivery and speeding of cargo.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it was good news for Ontario International Airport, the
Inland Empire, San Diego and Tijuana that planners focused on their
potential to fill part of the gaping need left by the end of El
Toro's proposed airport.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro was to have handled up to 30million passengers and
1.7million tons of cargo annually two decades from now, providing a
partner for Los Angeles International in Southern California's future
development.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro's portion was to be a key part of the area's total growth
to 186million passengers and 9.5million tons of cargo in 2025, from
today's totals of 96million passengers and 3million tons of freight.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Regional Airport Authority, organized last year to
implement a plan for the region's airports in 2025, is counting on
other proposed sites.</TE>
<TE>   The need for additional capacity has grown acute because LAX's
long-term growth is now effectively capped at 78million passengers,
up from 61.6million last year--a total depressed by the recession and
the aftermath of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Future restrictions on commuter flights to LAX from Orange and San
Diego counties are probable so that larger aircraft and more
international flights can be accommodated.</TE>
<TE>   That means that Ontario Airport will expand greatly with traffic
from Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, Ontario will add a third runway in the next
decade as it grows to handle 30million annual passengers and
2.2million tons of cargo--up from 6.7million passengers and 462,000
tons of freight last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ground transportation will be improved to serve an expanded
Ontario Airport, notes Ducey of the Regional Airport Authority, which
was set up last year by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice) and Los Angeles
County Supervisor Don Knabe.</TE>
<TE>   An off-site terminal at Anaheim that would handle passenger and
luggage check-in and security inspections before a bus trip to
Ontario is being planned. A new post-Sept. 11 master plan for LAX
will feature a similar terminal east of the airport for check-in and
security.</TE>
<TE>   The end of El Toro will mean a shift of development to the
"western areas of the Inland Empire, near Ontario Airport," says John
Husing, an economist with expertise on that region. "This will bring
companies and executives to the area," Husing says, noting that
expensive houses are already being constructed to accommodate home
buyers driven to the Inland Empire by housing shortages in Orange and
Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Freight companies, including Airborne Freight, Federal Express and
Evergreen, are now looking at former Air Force bases turned into
airports in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   The companies had been waiting to see how the vote on El Toro
turned out.</TE>
<TE>   The region's southern areas--San Diego and southern Orange
County--will need a new airport now that El Toro is canceled. San
Diego's 2.8 million population will rise to 4 million in the next two
decades and the area has growing needs for shipping cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego now uses LAX for 45% of its annual cargo," says
economist Erie.</TE>
<TE>   A new San Diego County regional airport authority is looking at
proposals for an expansion of Lindbergh Field, near downtown San
Diego, and for a joint use airport at Miramar Marine Corps Air
Station. Also the authority is considering Rodriguez Field in
Tijuana, Mexico, which could be expanded, with a check-in terminal on
the U.S. side of the border.</TE>
<TE>   It will take work and a sense of urgency throughout the region,
but the end of El Toro could spell the beginning of serious economic
development for other parts of Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Settlement Defended as Sufficient</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN  and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department joined hands with former courtroom foe
Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday in an effort to convince a federal judge
that their proposed antitrust settlement is in the public interest
and appropriate for the misdeeds found last year by a federal appeals
court.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that the decree addresses all of the concerns
addressed by the Court of Appeals," Justice Department attorney
Philip Beck said during a daylong hearing held in U.S. District
Court. "In some aspects, it has gone well beyond that."</LD>
<LD>   Beck and attorneys for the software giant also maintained that the
government didn't have the authority to end Microsoft's monopoly, a
position that has been challenged by nine states that refused to sign
the deal.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said she disagreed as
well, a potentially serious setback to Microsoft's attempt to derail
a separate case brought by those nine states. She said that when the
appeals court rejected a breakup as too strong a remedy, it wasn't
rejecting other alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court found that Microsoft illegally acted to protect
its monopoly in a dozen ways, trying to kill off potential threats,
including Netscape's Web browser and the Java programming language.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement requires standard pricing for Windows,
forbids Microsoft from discriminating against computer companies that
include other firms' software and mandates more disclosure from
Microsoft about how Windows works with other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Taken as a whole, those terms "go beyond those that we would
likely have obtained had we litigated," Beck said. "It would have
been an uphill battle that likely would have been resolved against
us."</TE>
<TE>   Several trade groups, however, said the proposal fell short of
what would be required to keep Microsoft from engaging in predatory
behavior by extending its monopoly on desktop computer operating
systems into new markets.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Flexner, a lawyer representing SBC Communications Inc.,
said the settlement needed tougher remedies to prevent Microsoft from
smothering more "baby threats in the crib."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement "lets Microsoft run wild," agreed former appellate
Judge Robert Bork, who represents a coalition of Microsoft's
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorney John Warden described such criticism as
"whining" and he said the trade groups who were questioning it wanted
"a grab bag of personal advantages for Microsoft competitors."</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly didn't indicate when she would rule on the proposed
settlement's fairness--the primary purpose of Wednesday's so-called
Tunney Act hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of work ahead of me before I make this decision,"
she said from the bench. In addition to Wednesday's testimony,
Kollar-Kotelly has about 30,000 comments from the public to sift
through, most of them opposed to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Kollar-Kotelly  approves the pact, she still must hear at
least five weeks of arguments, beginning Monday, on the nine states'
request for harsher remedies.</TE>
<TE>   The remedies, backed by California, Iowa and other states, would
require Microsoft to release the source code for its Internet
Explorer Web browser and produce a "modular" version of Windows so
computer makers can strip out Microsoft's browser, video player or
other pieces if they choose to.</TE>
<TE>   The judge raised several concerns through the hearing, but gave
little indication where she stood on the overall fairness of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly asked whether Microsoft had disclosed all of its
lobbying contacts with the government, as required by federal law.
She expressed interest in finding out more details after learning
that Microsoft attorney Charles "Rick" Rule--who formerly worked in
the Justice Department's antitrust division--may have been a
registered lobbyist when the settlement was being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   Warden said, "There was no discussion with a member of the
legislative branch about any term of the consent decree. Were there
discussions about whether we were trying to settle the case? Almost
certainly."</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly also questioned whether the government had adopted
too narrow a definition of "middleware" in the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Middleware, including browsers, media players and
instant-messaging software, sits between the operating system and
smaller programs.</TE>
<TE>   Such middleware plays an important role in the settlement deal
because if properly protected, it could serve as a threat to
Microsoft's operating system monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   The court of appeals already had issued its own definition of
middleware.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know whether you are taking a different approach, and
if so, I want to know why," Kollar-Kotelly said.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Call for Investor Safeguards</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Proposal would toughen accountability of
corporate officers and set up accounting board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Reacting to the Enron Corp. collapse, President Bush will call today
for measures to protect shareholders by requiring corporate officers
to personally vouch for the accuracy of financial reports and to
establish an independent regulatory board to uphold accounting
standards.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals represent the first specific steps being taken by
the president to boost confidence among investors and toughen
protections against corporate shenanigans.</LD>
<LD>   As such, the proposed safeguards play like a veritable highlight
reel of alleged misdeeds surrounding the disintegration of Enron,
which late last year quickly went from being the world's largest
energy trader to the nation's largest bankruptcy case.</LD>
<TE>   Seeking to demonstrate a sensitivity to concerns about potential
threats that the Enron case has demonstrated--particularly to
retirement holdings--Bush had been promising such measures since he
delivered his State of the Union address Jan. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recommendations can be implemented by the Securities
and Exchange Commission under its existing authority, according to
the White House, although several measures would require legislative
action.</TE>
<TE>   Under the White House plan, investors "should have quarterly
access to the information needed to judge a firm's financial
performance, condition and risks," as well as prompt access to
"critical information." The information should be provided "in plain
English."</TE>
<TE>   Though Enron reported its earnings every quarter and many of the
off-the-books partnerships that contributed to its bankruptcy were
disclosed to investors, the Houston company was known for the murky
nature of its financial reports, and many financial analysts have
admitted that they really didn't understand how the company made its
money.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an internal Enron investigation determined that $1
billion, or more than 70%, of recent profit was illusory, created by
inappropriate accounting for partnership transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposals, disclosed by a White House official, include a
provision that chief executives should "personally vouch" for the
accuracy and timeliness of corporate information, including financial
statements. CEOs should be barred from profiting from erroneous
financial statements and should lose the right to serve in corporate
leadership jobs if they abuse their power.</TE>
<TE>   Both of Enron's recent chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and
Jeffrey K. Skilling, have said they were unaware of any wrongdoing at
their company.</TE>
<TE>   Also under the Bush plan, corporate officers would be required to
disclose significant purchases or sales of company stock within two
business days.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives now can wait as long as 40 days before
publicly reporting open-market transactions and as long as a year
before reporting sales to their own employer.</TE>
<TE>   That appears to be a direct reaction to disclosures that Lay was
selling stock back to Enron as late as October--after he had been
warned about accounting improprieties at the company and while he was
still urging employees to buy Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its 10-point plan, the White House will declare that
"investors should have complete confidence in the independence and
integrity of companies' auditors," who should be held to "the highest
ethical standards" by an independent regulatory board under SEC
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors should not perform other services for a client if the
service "compromises the independence of the audit," the Bush plan
states. Companies should be forced to provide more detail about the
fees paid to auditing firms, according to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   After Enron's meltdown, questions arose about the role of its
auditor, Andersen, which also served as a consultant for the firm in
setting up many of its controversial off-balance-sheet partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms often earn more from consulting for a company
than they do for auditing books, which raises concerns about
conflicts of interest. Some of the nation's largest accounting firms
have said they are willing to give up some lucrative consulting work
to restore confidence in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   To help investors better assess changing corporate conditions,
Bush also calls on the SEC to expand the list of significant events
that a company must immediately report to its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to announce the plan at a presentation of the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award, which honors performance excellence
by American corporations and was named for the late Commerce
Department secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The president has been under political pressure to act as new
details of the Enron case came to light. Bush has long-standing
political connections with Lay, who has contributed more financial
support to Bush's political career than anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Wednesday, Enron asked a federal bankruptcy
judge for an eight-month extension of a deadline for filing a
reorganization plan, saying it needed more time to try to salvage its
business, pay creditors and come out of Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   Companies trying to restructure their debts under that chapter of
the bankruptcy law have the sole right to advance a recovery plan in
the first 120 days after filing. Though courts often extend this
exclusive period in large and complex cases, creditors can fight the
request and seek to advance competing reorganization plans. An
extension would mean Enron's creditors may have to wait longer to be
paid the roughly $49 billion they're owed.</TE>

<HD>Among Fidelity Funds, Two Lesser-Knowns Stand Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fidelity Investments may be best known for its $77-billion Magellan
stock fund, but two lesser-known funds have emerged as the Boston
financial giant's new stars over the last year.</LD>
<LD>   The company's $16-billion Dividend Growth fund, managed by Charles
Mangum, and the $13-billion Low-Priced Stock fund, managed by Joel
Tillinghast, are attracting investors in droves.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Dividend Growth and Low-Priced Stock accounted for
three-fourths of the total net cash inflows into Fidelity's stock and
bond funds, according to consulting firm Financial Research Corp. The
funds also were among the year's top-10 biggest sellers industrywide.</LD>
<TE>   That trend continued in January, when Low-Priced Stock had the
third-largest net cash inflow of all stock and bond funds, and
Dividend Growth was in fourth place. Net cash flow measures gross
purchases minus redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   In part, Low-Priced Stock and Dividend Growth have been helped by
the market's shift toward "value" stocks during the last two years.
But the funds' track records had been stellar even before that,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Mangum and Tillinghast are very different, but they exemplify
what's best about Fidelity," said James Lowell, editor of Fidelity
Investor, a Potomac, Md., newsletter that analyzes the investment
giant. "The 'Fidelity way' produces great minds that don't think
alike--independent stock pickers."</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity needs "hit" stock funds to keep its own bottom line
healthy: On Wednesday the privately held fund giant said its 2001 net
income fell 39% from 2000 as revenue and assets under management
declined because of Wall Street's bear market.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity, officially known as FMR Corp., said net profit last year
was $1.32 billion, down from $2.17 billion in 2000. Revenue declined
about 12%, to $9.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Strong inflows to funds such as Low-Priced Stock and Dividend
Growth can boost Fidelity because the firm earns higher management
fees on stock funds than on income funds.</TE>
<TE>   Mangum, who took over the blue-chip Dividend Growth fund in
January 1997, has generated an annualized total return of 14.4% in
the last five years, compared with 9.3% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.9%, Dividend Growth eased
3.7%. So far this year, the fund is up 1.9%, beating the S&amp;P's 1.6%
gain.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Magellan, also a blue-chip fund, lost 11.7% last year and
is off 0.2% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Dividend Growth's Mangum is known for making concentrated and
often "contrarian" bets. Typically, the fund keeps 35% to 40% of
assets in its top 10 holdings, which at year's end included such
names as drug wholesaler Cardinal Health, General Electric, Citigroup
and Philip Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Tillinghast, who launched Low-Priced Stock in 1989 and has gained
an annualized 16.2% over the last 10 years, compared with 12.6% for
the S&amp;P 500, casts a wide net: The fund often holds between 750 and
800 stocks, mostly small-capitalization issues. Its largest holdings
at year's end included Outback Steakhouse, Ross Stores and insurer
PMI Group.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's "low-priced" concept "may seem gimmicky on the surface,
but it instills a philosophy that forces the manager to buy low,"
Lowell said.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Low-Priced Stock focused on shares priced below $15
(when bought), but now the upper range is $35, enabling Tillinghast
and his research team to widen their universe but remain primarily a
small-stock fund even as cash inflows have surged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where Fidelity's research depth comes into play," said
Jack Bowers, editor of Fidelity Monitor in Rocklin, Calif., another
newsletter that covers the fund family. "Tillinghast is an excellent
stock picker, but you need a whole team to follow that many
companies."</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity has closed Low-Priced Stock to new investors three times
in the past, and with assets swelling, Fidelity might shut the door
again soon, Lowell said. The fund is up 4.7% this year after soaring
26.7% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Low-Priced Stock is seen as a "niche" fund holding that
can help round out a portfolio, more Fidelity investors are viewing
Dividend Growth as an ideal core holding, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Dividend Growth, which normally invests at least 65% of assets in
stocks that Fidelity expects to post rising cash dividends, is a
favorite of Fidelity Monitor and Fidelity Investor, as well as Eric
Kobren's Fidelity Insight newsletter based in Wellesley, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mangum can make bold bets, the cushion offered by
dividend yields on stocks such as mortgage giant Fannie Mae (its
annualized dividend yield now is 1.7%) and ExxonMobil (its yield now
is 2.2%) helps temper risk.</TE>
<TE>   Mangum also is free to include stocks that pay no dividends. For
example, at year's end he listed radio station owner Clear Channel
Communications as his second-largest holding.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bowers: "Mangum has done what so many Fidelity managers have
tried to do and failed: hold a mix of stocks from the S&amp;P 500
universe and soundly beat his peers with very little [volatility]."</TE>
<TE>   Still, in momentum-driven markets, where growth at any price takes
precedence over Mangum's growth-at-a-reasonable-price philosophy,
Dividend Growth can be a serious laggard. In 1999, for example,
Dividend Growth gained 8.8% and badly trailed the S&amp;P 500 index
because Mangum didn't chase steeply valued tech stocks, Lowell said.
But Mangum's "steady hand" has led to the fund's longer-term success,
Lowell said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Magellan, which is closed to new investors, manager Robert
Stansky gets solid marks from analysts for guiding a gargantuan fund
through a rough market in recent years. But given the fund's size,
Fidelity watchers say there may be only so much Stansky can do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not your father's Magellan. It's not even your older
brother's Magellan anymore," Lowell said. "This used to be an
aggressive-growth fund but now it's a large-cap 'blend' fund whose
charge is to outperform the market by inches, not miles."</TE>

<HD>Lakers' Big Hopes Rest in Shaq's Big Toe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Forget the pondering about what's going on inside Kobe Bryant's head.
The two-game suspension Bryant served for that after-buzzer punch
thrown at Reggie Miller provided a solid answer to the most important
question about the Lakers: How will Shaquille O'Neal's right big toe
hold up?</LD>
<LD>   They asked O'Neal to carry them to two victories and he did. He
came through with 36 points and 14 rebounds against the Houston
Rockets on Sunday, then posted 40 and 12 against the New Jersey Nets
on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's still killing me," O'Neal said. "But I suck it up. I've got
heart."</LD>
<TE>   Heart and a cart. The walk from the locker room to his car is so
laborious that he climbed aboard an electric cart to save him the
final 100 steps or so. His teammates are so concerned about his feet
that they made him stop a playful wrestling session with a ball boy
before Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   But on the court, he still showed them he has enough to get them
where they expect to go. Enough for Phil Jackson, when asked if he
felt confident that O'Neal could sustain a full playoff run, to say:
"Mmm-hmm."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of the unknown, they move on with that quiet
endorsement from the coach and the usual outspoken confidence of
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I have a bum toe, I still can get 30, 40 whenever I
want to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The toe must support more than O'Neal's hefty weight. The Lakers'
hopes for a third consecutive championship ride on it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is the one element on the Lakers that no team can answer.
Break down the playoff matchups any way you want, but the analysis
always gets back to: What is Team X going to do about Shaq?</TE>
<TE>   This season, for the first time, O'Neal has presented just as big
a quandary for the Lakers. The soreness and arthritis in the toe kept
them from knowing when he could play and just how much he could give
them when he was in the lineup. It hurts on top and on the side.</TE>
<TE>   He always looks like his usual dominant self when he first comes
back from a sit-down, be it his two stays on the injured list or his
three-game suspension for swinging at Brad Miller. He scored 24
points in 28 minutes when he returned against Phoenix on Jan. 4. He
had 40 and 11 rebounds against Denver on Jan. 22. In his most recent
comeback he had 25 points and 17 rebounds against Boston on Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   But he also shows a trend toward slumping after extended stretches
of action. He'll struggle just to get the ball to the rim and can't
do anything on defense. It throws the whole team off its game. He
shot 11 for 25 against Memphis right before his first stint on the
injured list. Six games into his return, he was five for 14 the night
he went after Brad Miller. Playing in the second game of a
back-to-back, at the end of a five-game trip, O'Neal missed 11 of 19
shots in a loss at Minnesota last week.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs don't have back-to-backs, or four games in five
nights.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday in a back-to-back situation, he had 28 points and 12
rebounds in a loss at Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even worried because playoffs are going to be spread
out," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll play in the game, get [messed] up, take the next day of
practice off, then get back. I'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   For now, he takes anti-inflammatory pills. He went for an
acupuncture session before the Boston game, and he said he will make
more use of the magic needles (his "secret weapon") during the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   When the Michael Jordan comeback rumors heated up during last
year's playoffs, O'Neal noted (prophetically) that "39 ain't 29." It
turns out that 29 ain't 24, either.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, on the eve of his 30th birthday, O'Neal said: "I
can't do the same things I used to do when I was younger. I don't
bounce back from injuries like when I was 24. I used to get beat up,
go out to the club and hang out all night. But now I can't do that.
Michael said once you get older, you have to work even harder to keep
up with the young guys. Hopefully, I can maintain it."</TE>
<TE>   He also is making the Jordan-like adjustment and is playing
smarter as he gets older. He understands the game better. He
recognizes the double-teams faster and spins away from them. He has a
more intuitive feel for where his teammates could and should be.</TE>
<TE>   He became the Lakers' point guard during those two games. Although
he didn't bring the ball up court, he touched it on almost every
possession and directed traffic. He had seven assists Sunday, and
four more Tuesday. The Lakers outscored New Jersey by 13 points when
he was on the floor, but looked shaky whenever he came out in the
second half. They are 35-12 with O'Neal in the starting lineup, 7-6
without him.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is serious about securing home-court advantage. It showed
when he sent O'Neal back into the game early in the fourth quarter
against Houston on Sunday, at a point where earlier in the season he
might have let the reserves see how long they could carry the lead.
The time for testing is over. It's time for winning. As Jackson wrote
on the board after the game: "First team to 50 W's." Meaning the race
is on.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers got by without Kobe, because they got a little bit more
than they expected from O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were unsure about how much energy he'd be able to put
into the games," Derek Fisher said. "I think he was dominating the
games in different ways. It's not necessarily overwhelming energy and
outrunning people and out-jumping people. But I think he's playing a
very smart game and really taking his time when he catches it in the
post. He's not really forcing a lot of shots. Every shot that he's
taking is close to the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Before he left toward Wednesday's game in Utah--and toward age
30--he said he felt old. He looked it as he limped toward his cart.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't look like the team that dominated the playoffs
last year, either. But O'Neal looks as if he can give it a full go in
the playoffs. Which means the Lakers still look like the team to
beat.</TE>

<HD>Wooten Seeks Staying Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEORIA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The road to the major leagues was long and winding for Shawn Wooten,
who endured eight years in the minors and three knee operations
before surfacing with the Angels. His first full season in the majors
was a rough one too, with his father dying of lung cancer in August
and wrist surgery ending his season one month early.</LD>
<LD>   A pleasant season would be a pleasant surprise for Wooten, but he
takes nothing for granted, even after hitting .312 as a rookie last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Wooten will share first base with Scott Spiezio this season. If
Wooten proves his rookie season was no fluke, he could be the first
baseman or designated hitter for years. He can catch and play third
base too, but if he struggles to hit, he won't be long for the
majors.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be a guy who comes off the bench stealing
bases," said Wooten, listed at 5 feet 10 and 225 pounds. "I
understand why I'm on this team, and it has to do with my bat."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten homered in Wednesday's 5-3 Cactus League victory over the
Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The home run came off Freddy Garcia, who had hit him with a pitch
and bruised his left hand on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad had the best season of his career in 2000, as the
Angels' leadoff hitter. Manager Mike Scioscia still had a hunch his
lineup might be better with Erstad hitting second, behind David
Eckstein, but he wanted statistical support before he made a
decision.</TE>
<TE>   So, at Scioscia's request, team publicists Larry Babcock and Marty
Sewell ran the numbers from last season: With Erstad leading off and
Eckstein batting second, the Angels scored 3.88 runs per game. With
Eckstein leading off and Erstad batting second, the Angels scored
4.63 runs per game.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Erstad became the first player in major league history to
drive in 100 runs from the leadoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia believes the No. 2 spot will maximize Erstad's ability to
both drive in runs--Eckstein had a .355 on-base percentage last
season--and score runs, batting ahead of Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson
and Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer hit .202 against left-handers last season, but
Scioscia said Fullmer would start the season as the designated hitter
against righties and lefties alike. "We have options if it doesn't
work out," Scioscia said. Fullmer's career averages: .294 off
right-handers, .223 against left-handers ....Jarrod Washburn has used
a fastball, change, curve and slider but struggled with the latter
two pitches, so he is working extensively on the slider this spring.
And the curve? "It's more than six feet under," he said
....Center-field prospect Nathan Haynes, hitting .400 (six for 15)
this spring, sprained his left thumb while running the bases
Wednesday. If Erstad leaves as a free agent after the season, Haynes
is the leading candidate to replace him.</TE>

<LD>The Times placed in the top 10 in daily and Sunday sports sections
and also made the semifinals in two writing categories in the annual
Associated Press Sports Editors contest. Results were announced
Wednesday following the judging in St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The other papers making the top 10 category in both daily and

<HD>DuPuy Will Replace Beeston</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball's slow-oving labor talks recessed Wednesday night as
management prepared to announce a major administrative shakeup.</LD>
<LD>   Bob DuPuy, the longtime lawyer for Commissioner Bud Selig and a
new member of the owners' negotiating team, will replace Paul Beeston
as baseball's president and chief operating officer, the sport's No.
2 position.</LD>
<LD>   In another move to be announced today, Tampa Bay Devil Ray Chief
Operating Officer John McHale will become Major League Baseball's
executive vice president and chief administrative officer, a post
held by DuPuy since September 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Jonathan Mariner, a former executive vice president of the Florida
Marlins, will become senior vice president and chief financial
officer, replacing Jeff White, who had held the post for more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Both the moves and the timing were confirmed by a high-ranking
baseball official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida Marlin catcher Charles Johnson has a sprained left thumb,
and the team doesn't know if he'll be ready for the opener on April
2.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was hurt Monday when his left hand hit Montreal Expo first
baseman Joe Vitiello while passing the base after hitting a grounder
to third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox received permission to talk with Cleveland
bench coach Grady Little in their effort to hire a manager by the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean he's the leading candidate to succeed Joe
Kerrigan, who was fired Tuesday, interim General Manager Mike Port
said.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland bench coach Ken Macha has been mentioned as a possibility,
interim Manager Mike Cubbage said he wants a chance, and Port said
individuals are being considered who do not need permission to talk
with the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Beattie is returning to the Expos. Beattie, who resigned as
the team's general manager and vice president in October, was hired
as a special assistant to General Manager and Vice President Omar
Minaya.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Oriole catcher Brook Fordyce, who nearly died when an
artery ruptured near his stomach, learned he does not have cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Fordyce was at his Florida home Jan. 23 when he became nauseous
and staggered to a bathroom after the artery between his esophagus
and stomach ruptured.</TE>
<TE>   He lost five pints of blood, spitting it up for nearly three hours
before passing out, hitting his head on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   The sound woke his wife, Jaci, who called for an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors still haven't determined what caused the incident, but the
result of the biopsy brought Fordyce a measure of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's been easy to get over it. For my wife, it was
difficult," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fordyce might have died if he hadn't received medical attention
that night, but he's convinced that it was an isolated incident that
won't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twin third baseman Corey Koskie will return to Minnesota today to
have his sprained wrist examined by a hand specialist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Parrish, who was vying for a spot in the Orioles' bullpen,
probably will sit out the season after tearing a knee ligament in an
exhibition game.</TE>

<LD>   No. 4 Pacific (19-9) vs. No. 5 Cal State Northridge (12-15), noon,
KCSN-FM (88.9)--Pacific has won five consecutive games and is looking
to repeat last year's tournament run. The Tigers advanced to the
final before losing to Utah State. Pacific is averaging 7.8
three-point baskets a game, tops in the conference. Northridge
counters with a league-leading 10.4 steals per game. The Matadors
need a big performance from senior point guard Markus Carr, who
averages 16 points and 5.4 assists a game. Carr struggled because of
a toe injury during a stretch late in the season, but has regained
his form. The teams split their regular-season meetings. Pacific
lost, 70-59, at Northridge on Jan. 5, and defeated the Matadors,
74-58, on Jan. 31 at home.</LD>

<TE>   No. 1 Utah State (21-6) vs. No. 8 Idaho (9-18), 2:30 p.m.--Utah
State is trying to win its third consecutive Big West tournament
title. The Aggies lost their final two games at Northridge and
Pacific, but they have a seven-game winning streak against Idaho.
Utah State is led by guard Tony Brown (15.1 points) and forward
Desmond Penigar (17.1). Rodney Hilaire averages 5.4 rebounds for
Idaho.</TE>

<TE>   No. 7 Long Beach State (13-16) vs. No. 2 UC Irvine (20-9), 6,
KDOC-TV, KUCI-FM (88.9), KRLA (870)--The teams are meeting seven days
after the 49ers handed the Anteaters their worst loss of the season,
86-70. Despite losing center Rudy Williams for the season with torn
ligaments in his right hand, Long Beach has won a season-high five in
a row and has been a loose group since Coach Wayne Morgan announced
he would resign at season's end. Irvine has been led all season by
All-American candidate Jerry Green, but the Anteaters need better
inside play from center Adam Parada. Parada had only six points and
was outplayed by Long Beach forward Travis Reed in the 49ers' victory
Feb. 28.</TE>

<TE>   No. 3 UC Santa Barbara (17-10) vs. No. 6 Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
(15-11), KDOC-TV, 8:30 p.m.--Santa Barbara has won five of its last
seven games and swept two games against Cal Poly this season. Mark
Hull is averaging 15 points, Branduinn Fullove 14.4 for the Gauchos.
Adama Ndiaye averages seven rebounds. Cal Poly is led by frontcourt
players Varnie Dennis (14 points, 5.6 rebounds) and Brandon Beeson
(12 points, 6.5 rebounds).</TE>

<HD>Riverside Beats Irvine Again</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UC Irvine women's basketball team threw a scare into UC Riverside
for the second time this season, but the Highlanders again prevailed,
63-53, in a first-round Big West Conference tournament game Wednesday
at the Anaheim Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   Second-seeded Riverside saw the No. 7 Anteaters cut a 14-point
deficit to three points before pulling away again.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little nervous [about losing the lead]," said Riverside's
Julie Shaw, who had 15 points and nine rebounds. "We did it in 30
seconds [in the last game], so we knew it was possible. We just kept
on urging the team that there was time on the clock and we needed to
keep playing."</LD>
<TE>   When the teams played Feb. 1, Riverside lost a six-point lead with
32 second left before Shaw scored at the buzzer in a 71-69 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside (16-12), in its first season in the Big West after
competing as a Division II independent last season and in the
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. before that, took its biggest
lead at 29-15 on a pair of free throws by Crystal Harris with 2:14 to
play in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   With Cindy Oparah, the conference's top scorer (15.5), leading the
way, Irvine (8-20) outrebounded the Highlanders, 36-33, and nearly
rebounded from a game-long deficit. Oparah finished with 13 points
and 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   She completed a three-point play that pulled the Anteaters within
50-47 with 6:52 to play. Irvine also got within 54-51 with 2:44 to go
after consecutive jumpers by Oparah and Christina Callaway.</TE>
<TE>   The Highlanders will face Pacific in the semifinals Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw was one of three players in double figures for Riverside.
Crystal Harris led all scorers with 18 points, and Amy Houchens had
15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara 73, Cal State Fullerton 62--Lindsay Taylor, a
6-foot-8 sophomore center, scored 21 points and had seven rebounds
for the top-seeded Gauchos (23-5) against the eighth-seeded Titans
(4-24).</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the 19th in a row for Santa Barbara and the 400th
in Coach Mark French's career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pacific 72, Idaho 45--Gillian d'Hondt had 15 points and six
rebounds for the No. 3-seeded Tigers (18-10), who earned their fifth
consecutive victory and second in five days over the sixth-seeded
Vandals (11-17).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach 77, Cal Poly SLO 72--Ekuah Ramsey had 24 points for the
49ers (16-12), who advanced to a semifinal game with Santa Barbara by
beating the Mustangs (11-17).</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Fairfax played without 6-foot-8 forward Evans Burns, its
tallest player and leading scorer, but it didn't seem to matter to
the Lions, who bounced host Carlsbad, 65-49, in a Southern California
Regional Division I first-round boys' basketball game Wednesday night
in front of 2,000 at Carlsbad High.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA-bound Burns, who averaged 23 points this season, cut a
finger on his right hand Tuesday night on a drinking glass, opening
two cuts that required 14 stitches.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman Jamal Boykin came off the bench to score a team-high 13
points for Fairfax. Kevin Bell and Thomas Woods each had 11 and
Jahsha Bluntt finished with 10.</LD>
<TE>   "We had confidence in our other players because we've played nine
deep all year," Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions trailed, 20-15, at the end of the first quarter and were
behind by one with four minutes to play in the first half. A 13-2 run
during a three-minute span turned the Lions' deficit into a 38-28
lead. They opened the third quarter with an 11-3 run.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax (30-4) may have Burns back for Saturday's semifinal game
against Long Beach Poly. "He's day-to-day," said Kitani.</TE>

<TE>   Westchester 89, Thousand Oaks 52--Hassan Adams scored 21 points
and the Comets (29-2) won a Division I first-round game at
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Everage and Trevor Ariza each added 12 points for
Westchester, which led, 73-31, after three quarters. The Comets will
play Clovis West, a 69-58 winner over Rialto Eisenhower, in the
second round. Kevin Rex had 14 points for Thousand Oaks (27-5).</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 89, Escondido 70--Harrison Schaen led five
Mater Dei players in double figures with 17 points and the Monarchs
(28-4) won the Division III game at Ocean View High. Schaen also had
a game-high 13 rebounds for top-seeded Mater Dei, which won its 21st
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Escondido (21-8) built a five-point lead in a frenetic first
quarter and trailed, 32-30, in the second quarter following a
three-pointer from Justin Bell, but Mater Dei answered back with an
18-5 run to close the half and never looked back.</TE>

<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery 89, San Diego Kearney 49--The Knights

his 26 points in the fourth quarter, hitting 11 of 14 free throws in
the quarter. John Haywood scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth to
lead Bishop Amat (25-7).</TE>

<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 66, Gardena Serra 64--Freshman Ed
White made a 15-foot baseline jumper as the buzzer sounded to give
the Wolverines (27-5) a Division IV victory at Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   Serra (26-5), which trailed by 12 points at halftime, outscored
the Wolverines, 20-2, to start the third quarter and take a 44-38
lead. Harvard-Westlake scored the final 11 points of the quarter to
retake the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Jeter, who scored 20 points for Serra, missed on a
three-point attempt with six seconds left. The Wolverines got the
rebound and raced upcourt, getting the ball to White, who had 10
points, for the game-winner. Bryce Taylor led Harvard-Westlake with
20 points.</TE>

Layden didn't come back from China with 7-6 Yao Ming, but he did
return from his scouting trip with the recipe for Peking Lame Duck.</LD>
<LD>   "Most guys with 11-27 records, whose team has failed to respond to
their coaching, and whose strategies have contributed to a nearly a

going to accuse somebody of negative recruiting, have the decency to
do so behind his back like every other coach in America."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turns out great: Greg Hansen of the Arizona Daily Star, on Wildcat
forward Luke Walton's 100 turnovers this season: "Ironically,
turnover statistics in Pac-10 basketball have come to identify the
league's greatest players. The top four career turnovers were all NBA
first-round draft picks: Stanford's Brevin Knight (403); Oregon
State's Gary Payton (397); Arizona's Damon Stoudamire (378) and Sean
Elliott (375)."</TE>

<TE>   Improving? Mark Kreidler in the Sacramento Bee: "Rick Ankiel, the
St. Louis pitcher of renowned wildness, gave up two walks, six hits
and five runs in his first exhibition appearance, after which Cards
GM Walt Jocketty said, 'I look at it as a good first outing for him.'
Ankiel also nearly hit a media member with a warmup pitch, which
sources indicate would have elevated his rating to 'effective.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tired issue: Even before former Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson
unleashed a diatribe that cost him his job, Michael Rosenberg of the
Detroit Free Press said: "Let's institute a new policy, effective

world--except for people who say they don't get enough respect."</TE>

protecting Vice President Dick Cheney in Carlsbad went into full

<HD>It's Official, Clippers Are Left Unhappy</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Referee's call wipes out basket by Brand in
closing minutes of 92-86 loss to Bucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Down by three points and with time slipping away, the Clippers went
where they often go in such critical situations. Power forward Elton
Brand then went where he often goes with the game on the line.</LD>
<LD>   Brand wheeled around earthbound counterpart Anthony Mason, brushed
past another Milwaukee Buck and deposited the basketball into the
hoop. A referee's whistle sounded and the Clipper reserves erupted in
cheers. A free throw from Brand and the score would be tied with 1
minute 7 seconds still to be played.</LD>
<LD>   Brand never got to the line. His layup did not count. He was
called for an offensive foul. The Clippers did not tie the Bucks.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, they ended up losing Wednesday to Milwaukee, 92-86,
before a crowd of 16,985 at the Bradley Center.</TE>
<TE>   In a nanosecond, the Clippers' three-game winning streak and any
momentum they generated with it was history. They were frustrated and
angry by game's end, the first stop on a four-game trip through the
Snow Belt.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is going to sting," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry was livid on the sideline but later
made no comments that could result in a fine from the league office
for criticizing its referees. Before the game, he had predicted
Orlando Magic Coach Doc Rivers would be fined $12,500 for his
outburst after Tuesday's game against the Indiana Pacers. Rivers was
fined $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything to say about the officiating," he said.
"I'm not giving the league any of my money."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, the Clippers continuously drove to the basket. The
Clippers believed they drew obvious fouls against the Bucks, but the
calls went against them and they dropped four games behind the
eighth-place Seattle SuperSonics in the battle for a Western
Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the Clippers suffered breakdowns that cost them. After
all, they remain very much a work in progress, particularly with
Keyon Dooling, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made only 19 of 28 free throws (67.9%) and failed for
long stretches to solve Milwaukee's defensive pressure on the post.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, for instance, scored only 11 points and took 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Down the stretch, though, the Clippers (ninth overall in the West
with a 30-31 record) went to the basket and were not rewarded with
free throws. In the quiet of their locker room, they wondered why.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing for something," point guard Jeff McInnis said,
referring to their status as a playoff contender. "Tremaine Fowlkes
got pushed out of bounds [in the fourth quarter] and they said he
slipped? Those are plays you've got to see. We're playing hard and
taking the ball to the hole. We're not getting the calls."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis, who led the Clippers with 16 points, stopped short of
saying they don't yet have the respect of the league's referees,
particularly on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We play hard every night," he said. "Even on our home court we
have to go through this."</TE>
<TE>   Of the pivotal call against him, Brand said an official told him
that he had pushed off against a Milwaukee player. He wondered how
that could be when he had both hands on the ball as he dropped in his
layup.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to take a look at the [videotape] and tell me if it
was a push off," he said. "Ray Allen [of the Bucks] made the same
move in the first half and it was a foul against us. It was a big
play. We put ourselves in a position to win the game.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't want to make excuses."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played with the requisite desperation, passion and
energy from start to finish, according to Gentry. They led, 22-17,
after the first quarter and by 46-41 by halftime. They finally lost
their lead early in the third quarter, but they withstood Milwaukee's
13-2 run and seized the lead back, 61-60, after Darius Miles made a
short jumper.</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Doug Overton, the newest Clipper guard, didn't look like a man who
had been out of the NBA for most of this season. Signed Monday to a
10-day contract, he scored eight points on three-for-six shooting and
was on the floor in the final frantic minutes of the Clippers' loss
Wednesday to the Milwaukee Bucks.</LD>
<LD>   Overton played with the New Jersey Nets in 2000-01, then spent
time this season with Kansas City of the new American Basketball
Assn. and with FC Barcelona in Spain.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt comfortable," he said of his Clipper debut.</LD>
<TE>   Learning the Clippers' offense was no big deal, mainly because
this is his 10th NBA season and most teams run the same plays. Only
the designated names or hand signals are different.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been with so many teams, the plays are embedded in my head,"
he said. "Most of the plays are the same. You get with it pretty
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Up close, the Clippers appeared as advertised to Overton, who said
he had been following the team from afar this season. They are young,
athletic and talented, according to Overton, 32.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tapped into the fountain of youth, I'm telling you," he
said. "They play with a lot of energy and you feed off that. I feel
young."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson scored 22 points and moved past Sidney Moncrief
into second place on the Milwaukee Bucks' all-time scoring list with
11,596 points. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the franchise record with
14,211 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry bellowed for a timeout midway through the first
quarter, but the Clippers racing toward the basket and away from
their coach didn't hear him. Point guard Jeff McInnis pulled up and
swished a jump shot from the right wing and Gentry quickly changed
his tune.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, or do that," he said within earshot of laughing courtside
fans and observers. "That's good, too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injured Clippers Keyon Dooling, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom did
not make the trip, remaining in L.A. to rehabilitate their injuries.
It's possible all three will be out for the rest of the regular
season.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIERA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It's still too early to determine whether the surgically repaired
elbows of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby will be 100% when the season
opens, and whether Kazuhisa Ishii will be good enough to be a
top-of-the-rotation type starter, but the Dodgers were very
encouraged by what they saw Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ashby made his first exhibition start, giving up two runs and four
hits in two innings of the Dodgers' 4-2 loss to the Florida Marlins,
but he felt good about his stuff and showed no ill effects from his
30-pitch outing.</LD>
<LD>   Brown threw 37 pitches, 30 for strikes, in a two-inning simulated
game, his fastball reaching 93 mph, and Ishii threw 41 pitches in a
two-inning simulated game, giving up one hit and freezing Dodger
right fielder Shawn Green with a nasty breaking ball.</LD>
<TE>   "He has a really good slider," Brown said of Ishii. "He has great
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who hadn't pitched in a game since last April 12, wasn't as
crisp--he gave up two hits and a run in each of his two innings--but
it was more important to Manager Jim Tracy that Ashby threw "with no
inhibition whatsoever. All he was thinking about was going after
hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who had surgery to repair the flexor tendon in his elbow
last June, feels he's transitioning from a rehabilitation mode to a
preparation mode. Instead of wondering how his arm will respond to
more work, he's focusing on mechanics and location.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time I go out there my stuff is better," Ashby said. "My
location wasn't good, and I fell behind guys, but it's been a long
road, and I couldn't be happier with the way my arm felt."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who had the same surgery as Ashby, gave up two hits and was
pleased with the movement of his split-fingered fastball and cut
fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Barring any setback, he will start an exhibition game Saturday or
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing is I was able to throw an inning, sit [for a
half-inning], get back up and throw, and I had no problem getting
loose," Brown said. "It's one more hurdle to clear."</TE>
<TE>   Some pitchers who have had flexor-tendon surgery have had problems
regaining late movement on their fastball, "but to me, the biggest
issue is velocity," said Brown, who tops out at 96-97 mph. "If that
comes back, I'll feel good about my movement."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy liked the freedom with which Brown threw. "I didn't see any
type of restriction; he's finishing his pitches," Tracy said. "The
crispness of his breaking balls was vintage Kevin Brown."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's fastball reached 91 mph, and he had some control problems,
throwing one pitch to the backstop and hitting Mark Grudzielanek on
the hip with a breaking ball, but he fared well in his first test
against major league hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're looking for at this point is a few good pitches,"
pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "I saw a few good ones and a few
great ones [from Brown and Ishii]. I'm 100% satisfied with both."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii will make his first exhibition start Friday or Saturday. He
described his pitches Wednesday as "average, at best. I feel I can do
a little better. "I want to use my curve to strike hitters out. I
felt good, but with a little more work I should be OK."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A second precautionary MRI test on Grudzielanek, this one focusing
on the right hip and lower back area, revealed no abnormalities
Wednesday. Grudzielanek had an MRI test on his sore right hamstring
last week, and that was also normal. The second baseman said he was
feeling "a lot better" Wednesday, but he still hasn't played in an
exhibition game. "I'm getting antsy, absolutely," Grudzielanek said.
... Left-hander Terry Mulholland, using a curveball that he has
refined with the help of Dodger Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, gave up
one hit in three scoreless innings Wednesday. Right-hander Mike
Trombley gave up two runs and four hits.</TE>

<HD>Ducks' Shields Rejoins Workforce</HD>
<DH>Hockey: In a rare appearance, goalie stops 21 of 22 shots
in Anaheim's 4-1 victory over Atlanta.</DH>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Steve Shields wasn't showcasing himself for a possible trade. He just
wanted some work.</LD>
<LD>   Shields stopped 21 of 22 shots and Paul Kariya scored two goals as
the Mighty Ducks beat the Atlanta Thrashers, 4-1, Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Shields, who played for only the second time since Jan. 21, could
be on the move by the March 19 trading deadline. But he says
interested teams wouldn't put too much stock in one game.</LD>
<TE>   Especially when he faced only one shot in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   "That's definitely the worst," Shields said. "You want to get in
the game and get some action. I haven't played a whole lot lately and
I just wanted to get some work."</TE>
<TE>   He made the most of what little the Thrashers had to offer,
turning away everything until Dany Heatley scored on a scramble in
the crease with 6:48 left to spoil Shields' bid for his first shutout
in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's 4-0, you don't mind so much," Shields said. "If it had
been 1-1, I would have been more upset."</TE>
<TE>   Shields said he wasn't thinking about a shutout or impressing any
contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "That's out of my control," he said. "If that happens and I end up
on a team going to the playoffs, then that's the way it is. But I
definitely want to stay here and help this team get back to where it
needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Carney gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead in the first period,
scoring his fourth of the season unassisted on a slap shot from the
blue line.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unfortunate to play as well as we did and have only one
goal to show for it," said Duck Coach Bryan Murray. "Fortunately, we
scored early in the second and got a little bit of a cushion."</TE>
<TE>   It could have been much worse for the Thrashers, who were outshot,
15-1, in the first period. Atlanta's only shot was a weak back-hander
from Per Svartvadet with 1:54 left that drew a derisive cheer from
the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a record, however. The Thrashers went shotless in the
first period Nov. 3 against the Kings at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   It took Atlanta nearly five minutes to get its first shot of the
second period, and by then it was 3-0. Kariya scored his 25th and
Patric Kjellberg scored his seventh 56 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were over these kinds of games," said Atlanta Coach
Curt Fraser. "There are no excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two or three guys that looked like they were working
hard. The rest of the guys looked whipped."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya made it 4-0 in the third period with his team-high 26th
goal. It came on a wicked one-timer right off a faceoff win by Steve
Rucchin.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing seemed to work for us," Atlanta goalie Milan Hnilicka
said. "They created some good chances, but that's what I'm there for.
It's my job to stop them."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have won eight of their past 12 games, but are 16 points
out of a playoff spot with the second-worst record in the West at
22-33-6-3.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrashers' league-worst record dropped to 16-37-7-4.</TE>

<LD>The Mighty Ducks rank 24th out of 30 NHL teams in prospects,
according to the Hockey News.</LD>
<LD>   Barring need due to injuries or trades, forwards Jonas Ronnqvist
and Maxim Balmochnykh and defenseman Antti-Jussi Niemi, all players
touted as "prospects" within the Duck organization, are unlikely to
get plane tickets to Anaheim for the final 18 games.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks' two prominent prospects are center Stanislov Chistov
and goalie Ilja Bryzgalov.</LD>
<TE>   Chistov, who turns 19 in April, is stuck in Russia, embroiled in a
squabble with his club team. He also has to do a two-year military
stint, unless the Ducks can secure an early release. Bryzgalov is
living up to his promise at minor-league Cincinnati, but the Ducks
already have a talented young goalie in 24-year old Jean-Sebastien
Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   Draft picks used in trades to acquire current NHL players are not
figured into the Hockey News rankings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Timo Parssinen will get another look, but only because the
Ducks shipped Marty McInnis to Boston on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a chance for Parssinen," General Manager Pierre Gauthier
said. "He has been more consistent lately. Young guys sometimes play
better NHL than in the [American Hockey League]. We would like to
give Timo a good shot."</TE>
<TE>   The thought that young players do better in the NHL than a minor
league aside, Parssinen has had one shot already.</TE>
<TE>   He was a fourth-round pick last June and Duck officials hoped he
would be able to make the jump from Europe to the NHL immediately.
Parssinen started the season with the Ducks after an impressive
training camp, but he was sent to Cincinnati after having only one
assist in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Parssinen had 14 goals and 38 points in 49 games with Cincinnati.</TE>

<LD>San Clemente's girls' basketball team went into its first-round
Southern California Regional with a 19-game winning streak and only
three losses this season, but that didn't mean anything to Oceanside
El Camino High.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to become the first San Diego Section team to win a
Division I state title since Point Loma in 1987, El Camino outplayed,
outworked and outhustled fourth-seeded San Clemente to win, 51-43, at
El Camino.</LD>
<LD>   That's the way it has been for underdog El Camino (21-9), the
fourth-seeded team in its section playoffs and only the third San
Diego team to win a first-round Division I regional since 1995.</LD>
<TE>   San Clemente (27-4) got 15 points but only four rebounds from 6-3
sophomore Lindsey Pluimer and 11 points from senior Kim Buffum.</TE>
<TE>   El Camino made 13 of 24 from the free-throw line, and San Clemente
made three of three. The Tritons made 18 of 40 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente, which trailed at halftime, 31-17, still had a chance
in the fourth quarter as Buffum made back-to-back three-point baskets
to pull to within 45-39 with 3:45 remaining. But El Camino's Ashley
Hicks clamped down on Buffum, who didn't get another shot attempt,
and El Camino made six of nine free throws.</TE>
<TE>   El Camino will play top-seeded Lynwood, a 55-33 winner over
Chatsworth, in a regional semifinal on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne 65, Newhall Hart 32--Camile Lenoir scored 14
points and Amber Pruitt added 11 as second-seeded Harbor City
Narbonne built a 30-6 lead midway through the second quarter en route
to its 16th consecutive victory in a first-round game of the Division
I playoffs at Narbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Hart (25-7) missed its first 10 shots and trailed, 17-0, before
Ashlee Treibilcock's layup with 21 seconds left for the Indians' only
points of the first quarter. Brandi Kimble led Hart with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos (26-3), who have not lost a playoff game since 1997,
will host third-seeded Long Beach Poly, a 75-60 winner over Clovis
West, in a semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ventura 69, West Bakersfield 62--Jenni Dooley scored 15 or her 18
points in the fourth quarter, including three consecutive
three-pointers, to help the top-seeded Cougars (29-2) outlast West
Bakersfield in a Division II first-round game at Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   West Bakersfield guard Nikki Blue, who will play at UCLA, scored
15 of her 38 points in the fourth quarter to help the Vikings (23-7)
open a 47-42 lead with seven minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley tied the score at 50 with 4:37 to play when she hit her
first three-pointer of the game to open a 17-4 run. Katy O'Brien, who
led Ventura with 28 points, hit two three-pointers during the run,
which gave Ventura a 64-54 lead with 1:29 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Meggie Wagner added 11 points for Ventura, which will play Redondo
Union in a regional semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   John Klima</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Union 69, Spring Valley Mt. Miguel 26--The Sea Hawks used
their superior height and quickness to score 24 baskets on layups or
shots within five feet of the basket in the Division II game at
Redondo Union.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Sea Hawks (24-7) raced to a 25-8 lead at the end
of the first quarter and a 42-11 advantage at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Krisztina Fuleki had 13 points for Redondo and Kayla Henry had
seven points for Mt. Miguel (22-9).</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood Artesia 79, Porterville Granite Hills 58--Brittney Thomas
scored 18 of her 31 points in the first quarter, including four of
her seven three-point baskets, for the top-seeded Pioneers in a
Division III game at home.</TE>
<TE>   Artesia (25-5) led, 28-19, after the first quarter and 50-31 at
halftime. The Pioneers, who closed the half with a 12-0 run, will
play the San Diego University City-Bakersfield North winner in a
regional semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Allison Johnston had 24 points--eight three-point baskets--for
Granite Hills (26-7). Each team made 12 three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Herbert</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery 64, Apple Valley 36--Noelle Quinn
scored a game-high 25 points and the Knights (25-5) began their
pursuit of a third consecutive state Division III title with the easy
victory at home.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery advances to a regional semifinal against
Pasadena Muir, which defeated Santee Santana, 101-76.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights got a boost from guard Veronica Torres. With point
guard Nykia Peace saddled with three fouls in the first half, Torres
made two three-pointers in the second quarter and finished with 12
points.</TE>
<TE>   Katie McElree led Apple Valley (24-6) with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 61, Montebello Cantwell-Sacred Heart

<HD>PGA Is Not Treating Tour as Major Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It won't take long to find out whether the Major Champions Tour will
make it, but there are indications that the PGA Tour isn't too
worried about it. So far, the only reaction from the tour is a
one-page statement that basically said the players who made their
reputations on the PGA Tour should stand by it.</LD>
<LD>   Other than that, there's been nothing going on officially at the
tour headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., where insiders say the
reason they're being quiet is because they're waiting for the
proposed tour to fall flat.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, the PGA Tour doesn't expect the new tour to get
enough players to sign up and relinquish their playing privileges on
the established tour.</LD>
<TE>   There are 35 players who in 2003 would be eligible for the tour,
designed for players between 37 and 55 who have won at least one
major. Sources say that as many as two dozen must commit to the tour
by a deadline before the U.S. Open to satisfy possible television
partner Fox. If there aren't enough players convinced, the proposed
tour is going to go down as the biggest project about nothing since
... since, well, the 1994 World Tour that never made it off the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Major Champions Tour has some major ingredients,
specifically the backing of star players Fred Couples, Greg Norman
and Nick Faldo, among others. It also benefits from the expertise of
Terry Jastrow, a 28-year veteran producer of golf telecasts at ABC
and one of the most influential and genial power brokers in the
business. If anybody can make this thing work, it's Jastrow.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, after a generally positive first impression from the
media, other voices have been heard lately.</TE>
<TE>   From Eddie Sefko of the Houston Chronicle: "These players made
their careers on the PGA Tour. Abandoning it at age 42 seems to show
a tremendous lack of loyalty and, perhaps, competitive fire."</TE>
<TE>   And from Doug Ferguson of the Associated Press: "The Majors Tour
... would feature a bunch of major championship winners who would
rather play meaningless golf for free money than work on their games
and try to compete against Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and the best
players in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson offered suggestions to the players, such as "get a real
job," and "practice harder." Both Fuzzy Zoeller, who would be
eligible to play, and Peter Jacobson, who wouldn't, have weighed in
with their opinions that the proposed tour isn't going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Another viewpoint is that there's nothing wrong with great players
who have been around for more than 20 years trying to come up with an
idea that works for them at this stage in their competitive careers.
Hey, it's their lives. Besides, unless we're missing something here,
it's the players who made the PGA Tour, not the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   The Monty File</TE>
<TE>   Here's the latest on Colin Montgomerie: He says he won't play in
the U.S. in 2003 because of the heckling he gets; then he says he'll
fulfill his U.S. tournament commitments this year; then he says he's
reconsidering his self-imposed ban in 2003 because of all the
positive feedback he's getting; then he pulls out of next week's
tournament at Bay Hill, where he had already committed to play.</TE>
<TE>   What's up with Colin? Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   Charles in Charge?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Charles Barkley accuses Augusta National of "blatant
racism" for the course changes that he says are designed to keep
Woods from winning the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Sure, and the 18th green was expanded slightly to blow
out Steve Elkington, who is allergic to grass and has to take
medication daily.</TE>
<TE>   (Never mind that every hole at Augusta has been altered at least
once since the course opened in 1934, forget that the huge bunker at
the left side of the 18th fairway was put there after Jack Nicklaus
won in 1966, ignore the fact that that the recent changes were
announced before Woods won last year, and never mind the notion that
the changes probably improve his chances of winning more than anyone
in the field.)</TE>
<TE>   No Rules, Just Right</TE>
<TE>   News item: The Buy.com Tour begins this week in Australia, the
first time it has opened somewhere besides the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Thus creating a new scoring stat, a Down Under par.</TE>
<TE>   The Pepper Mill</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA season is barely a week old, but it won't start for at
least the next two months for Dottie Pepper, who had shoulder surgery
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Pepper, 36, a 17-time winner, won't be able to play in the Kraft
Nabisco Championship in three weeks at Mission Hills. Pepper won the
tournament, the LPGA's first major of the year, in 1992 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Hang Up</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour has just adopted a new rule that prohibits players
from using their cell phones on the practice range or the putting
green. Also included in the cell phone ban are "caddies, managers,
equipment representatives, staff and all others." That sort of means
everyone, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Scoreboard</TE>
<TE>   Remember all the way back to a year ago, when so much was being
made about the winning scores in PGA Tour events dropping like rocks?
Well, forget it. In nine tournaments so far (not counting the
Accenture Match Play Championship), six have had higher winning
scores. The only exceptions are at Tucson and the Nissan Open. Sergio
Garcia's winning score at the Mercedes Championships was the same as
Jim Furyk's last year.</TE>
<TE>   Money News</TE>
<TE>   As part of a new four-year extension as title sponsor of the
Mercedes Championships, Mercedes-Benz kicked in an extra $600,000 to
bring the total purse in 2003 to $5million, with $1 million going to
the winner. Office Depot made a $100,000 increase to its purse to
$1million for the Office Depot Championship Hosted by Amy Alcott,
which will be played April 5-7 at El Caballero in Tarzana. The event
benefits the City of Hope. The LPGA has 25 events with purses of at
least $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Picture This</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA is always on track for more exposure, as long as it's
good, but we're not sure where this fits in: Playboy.com has a
feature called "10 under par?" with pictures of nine LPGA stars and
asks voters to log on and "Tell us what luscious live lynx should
doff her kitschy golf togs for Playboy."</TE>
<TE>   The players are Jill McGill, Beth Bauer, Michelle McGann, Kris
Tschetter, Catrin Nilsmark, Kelli Kuehne, Elizabeth Bowman, Carin
Koch, Grace Park and the ever-popular "none of the above."</TE>
<TE>   New Kid</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Lietzke isn't only new on the Senior PGA Tour, he also has a
new endorsement deal. Lietzke has joined Tom Watson in endorsing
Adams Golf clubs. Lietzke had 13 Adams clubs in his bag, including
the GT driver, when he won the Audi Senior Classic two weeks ago in
Mexico City.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Believes in Green</HD>
<DH>Big West: Two-time conference player of the year tries to
lead Anteaters to first NCAA berth, but it's not the most important
thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Green isn't the first talented basketball player to say how
much faith he has in himself and he won't be the last.</LD>
<LD>   But to the talented senior guard and bedrock of a revived UC
Irvine program, having faith is a claim he doesn't take lightly.</LD>
<LD>   Faith is the belief that by the end of this weekend, some how,
some way, he can lead the Anteaters to a Big West Conference
tournament championship and their first NCAA berth.</LD>
<TE>   Faith is what powers the confidence that he can take the ball in
his hands for a last-second shot--and make it.</TE>
<TE>   Faith is what he leans on as he dreams of the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, though, faith is what binds the Green family,
a close-knit unit drawing strength from a Pomona church founded in
the 1960s by Green's late grandfather, Alcide.</TE>
<TE>   At Great I Am Pentecostal Church, Jerry's uncle, Carroll, is the
pastor. His father, Gerald Sr., takes care of the business
operations. His mother, Linda, is the church secretary. His
grandmother, Myrtle, is an assistant pastor.</TE>
<TE>   And most Sundays Jerry is there for the sermon, as he has been for
all of his 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to believe in something," he said. "I believe in Jesus
Christ. I live by His word."</TE>
<TE>   It is Green's ability to shoot a basketball that has brought the
Anteater program into the limelight, helping Irvine win at least 20
games in consecutive seasons for the first time in school history.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3 point guard became the sixth player to be named Big
West player of the year in consecutive seasons and the first since
Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas in 1990 and 1991. He leads Irvine
in 10 offensive categories, notably scoring, assists and steals. He
also leads the Big West in scoring and became the Anteaters' all-time
leading scorer on Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton Coach Donny Daniels, who scouted Green in high
school while he was an assistant at Utah under Rick Majerus, said the
former one-dimensional slasher has worked hard to become an
outstanding college player.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the right player for the right program in the right
situation at the right time," Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   As a close game nears its climactic point, Green is often at his
best. He won back-to-back games last season against Long Beach State
and Boise State with last-second shots. On Jan. 10, the lanky guard
drained a 12-footer at the buzzer to defeat Utah State in front of a
national television audience. On Valentine's Day, he beat Cal State
Northridge with a free-throw-line jumper with 15 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been some unhappy endings. Green could have given
Irvine one of its greatest victories Dec. 15 against UCLA, but his
floating shot at the buzzer bounced away.</TE>
<TE>   The thrilling finishes have made him a big man on campus and a
favorite among the students who chant "Jer-ry, Jer-ry" at Irvine's
home games. Green has a link on the athletic department Web site
devoted solely to his exploits."You just expect Jerry to do something
amazing," sophomore center Adam Parada said.</TE>
<TE>   Those shots are much like the ones he used to take against
imaginary opponents on the basketball rim set up outside his home.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, he'd be out there practicing all by himself," said
Derek Pugh, Green's coach at Pomona High and now an assistant at Mt.
San Antonio College. . "The kid has always been prepared because he
used to practice so much."</TE>
<TE>   In Green's first year at Irvine, he started all 26 games and
averaged 12.8 points. But the 2000-2001 season was his breakout year.
He was an honorable mention All-American after leading Irvine to a
school-record 25 victories and its first conference regular-season
title.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he looked to capitalize on that success by declaring
for the NBA draft, in part to increase his national profile since he
was largely an unknown commodity outside the Big West.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted him to be exposed," Gerald Green said of his son.</TE>
<TE>   Green went to the pre-draft camp in Chicago but struggled against
top-level competition. Questions were soon raised. Could he play
point guard on the next level? Could he shoot from outside? Was he
strong enough?</TE>
<TE>   Draft day arrived. Fifty-seven names later and not one of them
his, Green began reconsidering his options.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Coach Pat Douglass, who calls Green his first major
recruit, could hear the disappointment when he spoke with Green by
telephone. Then he heard something that would make any coach smile.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me the next day and told me he was coming back,"
Douglass said. "Then he said he was going to go shoot some baskets."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to return--Green never hired an NBA agent, allowing
him to retain his college eligibility--benefited both him and the
Anteaters. He has improved his scoring average for the fourth
consecutive year. He is also averaging a career-high four assists and
has bettered his field-goal shooting percentage from 45.3% last year
to 48.2%</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of the same questions figure to await him after the
season ends. A Western Conference scout said his chance of being
drafted is slim, but it will depend on his performance at the
NBA-sponsored Portsmouth (Va.) Invitational camp in April.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gotten better at what he's good at," the scout said. "He can
create a shot for himself, he's got decent quickness and he can use
his body real well. The main issue is whether he's going to be able
to run a team.... At this point, I don't see him getting drafted, but
it only takes one team to like him."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Blake, the NBA's director of scouting, praised Green's
ability to play both guard positions. But Green will be in a draft
pool of smallish combo guards, including Duke's Jason Williams
(assuming he leaves school), Maryland's Juan Dixon, Cincinnati's
Steve Logan and St. Joseph's Marvin O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows whether he'll be drafted or not," Blake said. "The
draft is an inexact science. But we're going to showcase him."</TE>
<TE>   Douglass didn't give Green much advice on the draft last spring
and doesn't talk much about it now. But he did stress not focusing on
the negatives that scouts or other "experts" bring up.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've tried to tell him about playing on the next level is to
not worry about the critics and what you don't have," he said. "There
are some clubs out there who need someone who can come off a screen
and score or get to the basket and score. That's what Jerry can do."</TE>
<TE>   At Irvine, Green is a sort of celebrity on a campus known more for
its academics. Back in Pomona, he is a role model for youngsters.
When he goes home, he often brings T-shirts, a cap or shoes for them.
They try to get their neighborhood hero on an outdoor court and
impress him with their moves.</TE>
<TE>   "When they score on Jerry, it's a big deal," Gerald Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh, who grew up in the same neighborhood, said Green is the same
person at 22 that he was at 8. Quiet. Easygoing. Respectful.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's the kind of kid who you were going to root for even
if he had played for the rival school," he said. "He's made a
positive impression on these kids."</TE>
<TE>   As his stellar college career comes to an end, Green would like to
leave one last impression. Then he is prepared for the future and
whatever that may hold.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a career in the NBA. It could be as a guidance
counselor. It could one day be taking the reins of the family's
church.</TE>
<TE>   He has faith in a higher power.</TE>
<TE>   "When something doesn't go right, I always think that God has a
better plan for me," he said. "Maybe that's why I didn't get drafted.
Maybe he is preparing me for that."</TE>

<LD>Although the supporting card isn't particularly inspiring, the main
event at Santa Anita is much better than average for a Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven fillies and mares are scheduled to run about 61/2 furlongs
on the turf in the $75,000-added Winter Solstice Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Paga, who has won two of three since coming to this country, is
the 5-2 favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line. She is proven down the
hillside, having won the Monrovia Handicap on the final day of 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Ed Allred and R.D. Hubbard and trained by Richard
Mandella, the 5-year-old mare won four of six in Argentina before
coming to the U.S. In her American debut, she won the Osunitas
Handicap at Del Mar, then was third in the Violet Handicap at the
Meadowlands before her victory in the Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders in the Winter Solstice, named for a
stakes-winning mare from some 25 years ago, who, in fact, won the
Monrovia in 1976 and '77, include Penny Marie, Twin Set, Gabriellina
Giof and Queen Of Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   Shortening up and dropping in class after missing by a neck in the
Buena Vista Handicap on Feb. 18, Queen Of Wilshire is the 4-1 second
choice. Owned by Ernest Auerbach and trained by Darrell Vienna, she
is a capable sprinter and drew the outside post.</TE>
<TE>   A lightly raced Sky Classic mare, Penny Marie will be making her
first start since finishing third in the Mamzelle at Churchill Downs
last May 3.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Hess Jr., she has won two of four starts on the
Santa Anita turf course.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Trainer Bobby Frankel will send out another
import in today's third, a nine-furlong race on the turf. Staging
Post will make his U.S. debut and Frankel will also be represented by
Blue Steller.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Corona Kool. The classy quarter horse mare won the
$200,000 Los Alamitos Championship last weekend and she has won a
Grade I race in four consecutive years for trainer Donna McArthur.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: La Canoa Ranchaa. The Florida-bred gelding is winless
in eight and will be a big price again in today's 10th at Gulfstream
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Rockin Robannier and Bold
Mind in the fourth, singling Divine Spirit in the fifth and using
Roberto's Show, The Buggy Whip and Deal 'Em Jack in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/144. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.60/$853.60. Total money bet: $874.</TE>

<HD>Murray Will Join Team in Nashville</HD>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Coach Andy Murray, saying he was no longer comfortable being away
from the team, flew into Tennessee late Tuesday night and said he
would rejoin the Kings for tonight's game against the Nashville
Predators.</LD>
<LD>   "You have a bit of a guilty feeling not being there at this time
of the year, when everything is so crucial," Murray said. "As every
player does, you want to help out in some way, and I haven't been
much help this last little while."</LD>
<LD>   Murray, who turned 51 Sunday, had been recuperating at home in
Faribault, Minn., since Feb. 15, when he suffered a concussion, a
broken and separated left shoulder, four broken ribs and numerous
cuts and scrapes in a single-vehicle accident outside Sparta, Wis.,
during the NHL's Olympic break.</LD>
<TE>   His return has been delayed by symptoms of post-concussion
syndrome, among them severe headaches, dizziness and vomiting, but
Murray said that he had made tremendous progress since the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "You're still a little lightheaded and all that kind of stuff," he
said, "but all the major symptoms are all gone and I feel fine."</TE>
<TE>   His major complaint now, he said, is soreness on his left side.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's nothing," he said. "We've got guys who wear flak
jackets and play. Nobody's going to be hitting me, I hope. I know
it's there, but it's nothing that can stop me from doing my job. It's
a little uncomfortable, but that's all."</TE>
<TE>   After talking to his doctor Wednesday, Murray said he had no
apprehension about returning today, even though the doctor and the
coach's wife, Ruth, had hoped that he would wait until after the team
returned home Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Only last weekend, doctors had told the coach that it could be
several more weeks before he felt well enough to rejoin the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed quite a bit for me the last 48 hours," Murray
said. "I'm feeling a lot better."</TE>

<HD>Stars Flip the Switch on Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Dallas' 3-2 overtime win lifts it past L.A. in
tight playoff race. Murray returns tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>When he reintroduces himself to the Kings this morning at a team
meeting in Nashville, Coach Andy Murray will address a grumpy group.</LD>
<LD>   While Murray flew into Tennessee on Wednesday night from
Faribault, Minn., where he had been recuperating from injuries
suffered last month in an auto accident, the Kings' first winless
streak since late December reached three games when they lost in
overtime to the Dallas Stars, 3-2, at American Airlines Center.</LD>
<LD>   In what was probably their last game under interim Coach Dave
Tippett, the Kings gave up a precious point when Brenden Morrow
rifled a shot from the left faceoff circle past goaltender Felix
Potvin 3 minutes 53 seconds into overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Later, Murray said from Nashville that, barring a relapse of the
symptoms of post-concussion syndrome that kept him from rejoining the
team sooner, he will be behind the bench tonight when the Kings play
the Nashville Predators.</TE>
<TE>   He'll rejoin a team trying to break out of a victory drought that
would be a lot easier to take if the Kings had escaped with a tie
after twice overcoming one-goal deficits against the streaking Stars,
whose winning streak reached four games.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, after pulling even for the second time on a power-play
goal by Ziggy Palffy with 2:49 to play in regulation, the Kings
enabled the Stars to extend a more impressive streak: Since Nov. 11,
2000, the Stars have won a league-record 49 consecutive games when
leading after two periods.</TE>
<TE>   The latest victory, the Stars' third in four one-goal decisions
against the Kings this season, resulted in the Stars and Kings
changing places in the tightly packed Western Conference playoff
race, the Stars moving up to sixth place and the Kings dropping to
seventh. Each team has 71 points, but the Stars have one more
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing because we tied them up late in the third on
the road like that," Potvin said. "We should have played probably
tighter in the overtime and made sure they didn't have any
[opportunities], but they came pretty good at us."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow scored his 11th goal with an assist from defenseman Darryl
Sydor, who not only left him the puck but also provided a screen by
skating through the slot in front of Potvin just as Morrow was
unleashing his shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It went behind the crowd," Potvin said of the winning wrist shot.
"I got a piece of it, but it just went under my arm."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Stars had taken a 1-0 lead on a goal by Jere Lehtinen
at 12:48 of the first period, only to have the Kings pull even on a
power-play goal by Adam Deadmarsh with 7:28 to play in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after Richard Matvichuk scored a power-play goal for the
Stars less than three minutes later, Palffy tied the score again
after Scott Pellerin of the Stars was sent to the penalty box for
hooking.</TE>
<TE>   "Our power play has been one of the things that has kind of kept
us around," Tippett said of the King unit that has converted a
league-high 27.1% of its power-play opportunities on the road. "It's
one of the elements of our game that's been real good, so it was good
to see us use it when we needed it."</TE>
<TE>   Not so good was what happened after Palffy's tying goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in here for a win, not for a tie or a loss in overtime,"
said Tippett, who guided the Kings to a 2-1-1-1 record in Murray's
absence. "Every point is a desperate point. That's why giving that
extra one to them tonight is so disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   It was especially frustrating because a tie might have slowed the
Stars' momentum. The Stars have won five consecutive division titles,
but their disappointing start this season cost Ken Hitchcock his job.
The coach was replaced Jan. 25 by former King assistant Rick Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere, they've lost a little bit of their identity this
year," Tippett said before the game. "But by no means can they be
underestimated. I think they're starting to get it back and they'll
be a team to be reckoned with."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Stars' winning streak is their longest in four months.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, though, have more than the Stars to worry about. They
are only two points ahead of the Phoenix Coyotes and Edmonton Oilers
in the Western Conference playoff race, and only four ahead of the
Vancouver Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   "No time to pout now," said Ian Laperriere, icing his knees before
packing for a late-night flight to Nashville and today's reunion with
Murray.</TE>

<HD>Utah Blows Out His Candles</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>There was a hush in the Laker locker room Wednesday night after the
team's 92-84 loss to the Utah Jazz, business as usual for the losing
team. Surrounded by tape recorders and cameras, Shaquille O'Neal
spoke in a low voice as he analyzed the defeat.</LD>
<LD>   That was in contrast to the locker room scene before the game when
O'Neal was all smiles as he celebrated his 30th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   He came in holding balloons, announced that his father, Phil
Harrison, had presented him with a new red Ferrari and reflected on
the milestone he had reached.</LD>
<TE>   "I've done a lot by 30," O'Neal said. "I've experienced a lot of
things. I'm happy to be alive. I've got a lot of nice friends."</TE>
<TE>   Now in his 10th season, O'Neal was asked how long he would go on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not allowed to say," he told reporters, "but I don't see
myself going past 35."</TE>
<TE>   Is that his final answer?</TE>
<TE>   "Unless they give me 200 [million] for two years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was holding a dripping wet Reggie Miller action figure.
Someone had given it to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to put it in water," O'Neal explained, "to cool it off."</TE>
<TE>   He then presented it to Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks like it's got scratches on its face," an amused Bryant
said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was informed he wasn't the only player on the court
Wednesday night celebrating a birthday. Utah reserve center Greg
Ostertag turned 29.</TE>
<TE>   "He can win a championship after I'm gone," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson announced several weeks ago that there
would be no more days off until he felt the Lakers "were in focus."
Either they would play or they would practice.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson scrubbed that edict Saturday after the Bryant-Miller clash
to avoid inquiring questions by reporters.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday night's poor performance, Jackson canceled
Thursday's practice. Guess he figures Wednesday's season-high 24
turnovers got his team focused.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Get Picked On</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. gets sloppy, and Malone and Stockton
make key plays in Utah's 92-84 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>NBA dynasties rise and fall and rise again.</LD>
<LD>   Magic is gone and Kobe comes along. Kareem retires and now Shaq
inspires. Showtime is replaced by the reign of the raging Bulls.
Michael Jordan retires and returns.</LD>
<LD>   And through it all, from era to era, they go on for the Utah Jazz,
Karl Malone and John Stockton, seemingly never aging, never fading,
never failing to successfully run that unstoppable pick-and-roll.</LD>
<TE>   They were at it again Wednesday night at the Delta Center against
the Lakers, coming up with the key plays to clinch a 92-84 victory to
the delight of a sellout crowd of 19,911.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the Lakers' sloppiest games this season. They
committed a season-high 24 turnovers leading to 32 Jazz points.</TE>
<TE>   Utah was successful on 32 of 36 free throws, the 32 a season high
for a Laker opponent.</TE>
<TE>   After going seven for 10 from the field in the first half en route
to 23 points, Laker guard Kobe Bryant, with Jazz forward Andrei
Kirilenko all over him, was 0 for 9 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with all that, the Lakers were right there at the end,
trailing by only four points, 84-80, with 21/2 minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped 38-year-old Malone to make a rare three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped 39-year-old Stockton to feed Kirilenko on a play that
resulted in a foul and Utah's 88th point.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped 17-year veteran Malone to get his team's 89th point on
a free throw.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, with the refrigerator door still cracked open, the
Lakers trailing by five with 20 seconds to play, up stepped 18-year
veteran Stockton to feed Scott Padgett for the three-pointer that
sealed the game, improved the Jazz to 34-26 and dropped the Lakers
(42-18) out of a tie for the best record in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Malone led Utah with 23 points and eight rebounds. He made only
five of 13 shots, but he made up for it at the free-throw line by
connecting on 12 of 13. Stockton was right behind him with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   The longest running act in basketball history is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Laker Coach Phil Jackson conceded he'd seen this
act many times before. But he wasn't talking about Malone and
Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   "The officials got caught up in the B.S. that the Jazz do in the
third quarter," he said, "and just sent them to the line all the
time.... I've been watching this for 15 years.... They create fouls.
I don't get upset. I just laugh and let it go. That's just what it
is.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a no-win situation. We'd play defense and they'd turn it
into a foul, and at the other end of the court, we weren't handling
the ball very well."</TE>
<TE>   When the remarks about the officiating were relayed to Malone
after the game, emotion flowed into his usually passive face.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, of course," he said. "We never beat anybody. There's
always an excuse, but whatever ... whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant returned after sitting out two games for punching the
Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller and, at first, it appeared he was
returning in peak form, despite the fact he had to adjust to the
altitude and despite the fact he and his teammates had arrived in
Salt Lake City late Tuesday night after the Laker game at Staples
Center against the New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was even in his buzzer-beater mode, connecting from 40 feet
as the half ended to push his club into a 47-44 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who had five turnovers, later revealed that he again
jammed his left thumb in the first half, an injury that he had
initially suffered last week. But he refused to use that as an excuse
for his frustrating second half.</TE>
<TE>   "The tempo of the game changed," said Bryant, whose 26 points were
second only to Shaquille O'Neal's 28. "I obviously had some good
looks that weren't falling."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was only Utah's second against 12 losses against the
top five teams in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Malone was also asked about those 12 losses after the game.</TE>
<TE>   His terse reply: "Next question."</TE>
<TE>   Any sign of burnout on the horizon?</TE>
<TE>   "After 17 years," he said, "winning is still fun no matter who you
play."</TE>
<TE>   Some day the fun will end. Malone and Stockton can't play forever,
can they?</TE>

<HD>Suns, Crowd Give Kidd Rude Reception</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd's shooting was as icy as his reception from a large share
of the crowd in his first game at Phoenix as a member of the New
Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd was only four for 18 from the field and the Suns rallied to
hand the Nets their fourth consecutive road loss, 89-87, Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Van Horn, a 79% free-throw shooter, had a chance to tie the
score but missed the first of two free throws with 0.4 seconds to go.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it was good," Van Horn said. "I was kind of shocked
that it didn't go in."</TE>
<TE>   He had to purposely miss the second, but failed to hit the rim to
end any hope of a tip to tie it.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury, the player the Suns got in the trade that sent
Kidd to New Jersey, scored 20.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be an ongoing thing," Marbury said. "This is a
rivalry now."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, booed loudly each time he touched the ball, had 10 points,
10 rebounds and eight assists. He made a three-point basket on his
first shot, but was two for 15 after the first quarter and one for 10
in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted him to shoot," Marbury said, "because I know that's not
how he plays."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd shrugged off the rude reception. The boos stemmed from Kidd's
comments critical of Sun owner Jerry Colangelo and former coach Scott
Skiles. Kidd was pressed on the subject of Colangelo and his son,
team President Bryan Colangelo.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't work for the Colangelos," he said. "If I did, I'd
probably want to quit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 85, Minnesota 78--Scottie Pippen scored eight points in a
span of 37 seconds late in the game at Portland, Ore., and the Trail
Blazers extended their winning streak to 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers shot only 37%, but Pippen compensated by making
a 22-foot jump shot, a three-point shot and two free throws for a
79-73 lead with 1:29 left.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace had 28 points and 15 rebounds for the Trail
Blazers, who are 12-1 since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 85, Cleveland 76--Allen Iverson broke the 40-point
barrier for the third time in four games, scoring 46 for the 76ers at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The defending Eastern Conference champions have won four of their
last five games and have defeated the Cavaliers 12 consecutive times.</TE>
<TE>   It was the eighth time this season that Iverson scored 40 points
or more. He was 15 for 30 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   *Miami 92, Chicago 87--Rod Strickland scored a season-high 23
points and the Heat held off the Bulls at Chicago for its sixth
victory in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose led Chicago with 23 points, and Travis Best tied his
season-high with 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat led, 63-47, late in the third quarter after a 20-3 run
but let the Bulls back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 130, Orlando 110--Paul Pierce scored 22 points and Antoine
Walker had 16 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists at Boston, and
the Celtics had their highest point total this season.</TE>
<TE>   Nine Celtics scored in double figures, helping Boston top its
previous best by 20 points and move 21/2 games in front of Orlando in
the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Celtics also took the edge
in a potential tiebreaker with a 3-1 head-to-head record.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Coach Doc Rivers was fined $7,500 by the league for
failing to quickly leave the court after an ejection during Orlando's
111-98 loss Tuesday and for criticizing game officials.</TE>

<LD>United States national gymnastics champion Sean Townsend and two

<LD>   Townsend, Brett McClure and Jason Gatson failed the unannounced,
out-of-competition test in January, the International Gymnastics
Federation said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "In the event of subsequent offenses, these gymnasts could be
subject to a suspension of up to two years. Gymnasts, be warned," the

<LD>Here's something not seen much these days in the tight-checking NHL:
a wide-open game.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday night's game between the Detroit Red Wings and the
Toronto Maple Leafs featured plenty of skating and scoring chances.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit took advantage of the extra room, with Sergei Fedorov
scoring twice and the Red Wings getting three power-play goals in a
6-2 victory at Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Wings, who won their seventh in a row, have the league's
best record at 45-11-6-2 (98 points). Toronto has 76 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Clubs enjoy space and time and they had a lot of it," Toronto
Coach Pat Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said he was especially disappointed with the effort of his
top line of Mats Sundin, Jonas Hoglund and Mikael Renberg.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-0, Toronto got a power-play goal and a short-handed
goal in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   But Fedorov's second goal of the game, his 23rd this season, made
it 5-2 only 38 seconds into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Sundin's short-handed goal cut the deficit to 4-2 with 2:10 left
in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   He was able to poke a shot into an empty net while lying on the
ice after stripping Igor Larionov of the puck and chipping it through
the legs of Dominik Hasek, who was charging out of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Tampa Bay 2--Ethan Moreau's short-handed goal 2:56
into the third period lifted the Oilers at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Andreychuk gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead with a power-play
goal at 17:30 of the first period. He also had an assist for his
300th career multi-point game.</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk has 242 career power-play goals and trails career
leader Phil Esposito by seven.</TE>
<TE>   He has 12 goals this season and 584 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Calgary 2--Sergei Gonchar scored with 2:04 remaining
in regulation for the Capitals at Washington, tying a career high
with his 21st goal.</TE>
<TE>   Jarome Iginla scored a league-leading 40th goal.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Boston 3--Joe Juneau scored goals 35 seconds apart for
the Canadiens only 53 seconds into the game at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Juneau also set up a goal and has six points in his last two
games.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Columbus 1--Steven Reinprecht had a goal and two
assists, and backup goalie David Aebischer stopped 32 shots for the
Avalanche at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Aebischer had his shutout streak of 148 minutes 2 seconds ended in
the first period.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lang, the second-leading scorer on the injury-wracked
Pittsburgh Penguins, is out indefinitely because of a broken bone in
a hand. Lang was hurt in Pittsburgh's 6-5 overtime victory over
Florida on Tuesday. Lang has 18 goals and 32 assists....Former NHL
player Bryan Fogarty died of heart problems at Myrtle Beach, S.C. He
was 32. Fogarty last played in the NHL with Montreal in 1994-95.</TE>

<HD>Questions Abound but RPI Gives No Answers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is Mike Griffin. You've reached the RPI basketball office.
Sorry to miss your call, but I'm away from my desk."</LD>
<LD>   Yes, well, people are going to have a lot of questions about the
RPI between now and Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Griffin, however, is not your man.</LD>
<TE>   He's the coach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.,
a Division I hockey powerhouse and a Division III basketball program
that made the NCAA Division III tournament's Sweet 16 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes alumni say they think it's kind of neat that RPI is
mentioned in the paper so much as basketball season winds down,"
Griffin said.</TE>
<TE>   RPI, the school, has nothing to do with RPI, the Ratings
Percentage Index.</TE>
<TE>   But Griffin is familiar with using statistical formulas to try to
gauge postseason merit in his work on the Division III tournament's
Eastern regional selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at different percentages, record within the region, home
and away," he said. "Yet when it comes down to it, you still have the
ability to use subjectivity."</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA selection committee insists RPI is only a starting point
too.</TE>
<TE>   The RPI is not perfect, but at least it is not sacrosanct--unlike
college football's bowl championship series standings.</TE>
<TE>   "People put words to those initials that are not so
complimentary," RPI's Griffin said of the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad that's not us. They rarely get that right."</TE>
<TE>   The generally accepted wisdom is that an RPI in the 40s or better
gets you an at-large bid, and an RPI in the 50s means your leg will
be shaking as you watch the selection show--and maybe the tournament
too--on TV.</TE>
<TE>   An RPI in the 60s means you're Not In Tournament without an
automatic bid, with rare exception.</TE>
<TE>   That's why 25-5 Butler's one-point loss to 9-21 Wisconsin Green
Bay in the Horizon League quarterfinals was so devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Butler beat Indiana on a "neutral" court in the Hoosier Classic in
Indianapolis and beat upset-king Ball State, but Butler's RPI is 75.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest-ranked team to get an at-large bid was No. 74 New
Mexico in 1999--when the New Mexico athletic director and Mountain
West commissioner were both on the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA selection committee emphasizes that the RPI is only a
starting point. Members receive a "Nitty-Gritty" report of the top
105 RPI teams that includes such information as road record, record
in the last 10 games and how teams did against teams in the top 25,
top 50, beyond the top 100 and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't depend on RPI," said Lee Fowler, chairman of the
selection committee and athletic director at North Carolina State.
"There are a lot of other things we depend on besides RPI.</TE>
<TE>   "[And] our RPI is different than what the public sees."</TE>
<TE>   (Among the attempts to duplicate the confidential formula
available online is Jerry Palm's CollegeRPI.com.)</TE>
<TE>   "When we get to the last four or five, there's more studying done
on those teams than the others that get in.... We have all the
information we possibly could have in front of us--who they played,
where they played, when they played. It's all discussed," Fowler
said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is getting into that discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Teams in the 50s such as Pepperdine (22-8) and Southern Illinois
(26-7)--an upset victim in the Missouri Valley final--will get a
thorough look. Pepperdine in particular should meet the standard
easily.</TE>
<TE>   But the way the committee could prove it means what it says about
understanding teams have to play the teams in their conference would
be to bring Butler--and teams like it--into the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to prove they don't assume the dregs of the Big East are
better just because they play in the Big East, which is what the RPI
assumes.</TE>
<TE>   (Georgetown, with a record of 0-6 against the teams in the top 25
entering the Big East tournament, had an RPI of 54.)</TE>
<TE>   Scheduling can be difficult, but when teams play nonconference
road games against major competition, that needs to be rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   One former chairman of the selection committee, Big Ten
Commissioner Jim Delany, has his own favorite measure of a team's
worthiness, major or mid-major.</TE>
<TE>   It's road record against top 50 teams.</TE>
<TE>   Let's call it our version of the RPI: Road Prowess Indicator.</TE>
<TE>   "The best teams win games against the top 50 on the road. It's not
easy to do," Delany said. "That is the best test, the hardest test."</TE>
<TE>   It's a fair test too, because it diminishes the influence of all
those home-road splits in the major conferences.</TE>
<TE>   It's one reason Pepperdine shouldn't have to sweat despite an RPI
in the low 50s.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves played one of the five toughest nonconference schedules
in the country and won some of those games too, beating UCLA at
Pauley Pavilion and USC at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   When the committee weighs Pepperdine against its companions in the
RPI's 50s such as Southern Illinois, the Waves' victories will look
better than the Salukis' best against Indiana at home.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Salukis aren't a deserving team.</TE>
<TE>   They're just in the group with a bunch of others, pulling for
certain teams ranked higher in the RPI--such as Xavier, Kent State
and Pennsylvania--to win their conference's automatic bids and not
take another of those precious final at-large spots.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, anyone who owns an RPI sweatshirt might want to
consider not wearing it Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden Bulletin: There Might Be a Race</TE>
<TE>   Duke's Jason Williams once was the runaway favorite to win the
Wooden Award as national player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But with images of Williams' six missed free throws against
Florida State, six turnovers against Maryland and late missed free
throw and eight turnovers against Virginia in voters' minds, Drew
Gooden of No. 1 Kansas seems to be gaining ground.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic development in the list of 20 finalists is the surge
by five players who made the ballot after not being included on the
midseason top 30 list--and deservedly so, in every case.</TE>
<TE>   They are Frederick Jones of Oregon, Kirk Hinrich of Kansas, Hollis
Price of Oklahoma, Erwin Dudley of Alabama and Luke Walton of
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Other finalists in addition to Williams, Gooden and the five new
nominees are Lonny Baxter and Juan Dixon of Maryland, Caron Butler of
Connecticut, Dan Dickau of Gonzaga, Mike Dunleavy of Duke, Jason
Gardner of Arizona, Udonis Haslem of Florida, Casey Jacobsen of
Stanford, Jared Jeffries of Indiana, Steve Logan of Cincinnati,
Tayshaun Prince of Kentucky, David West of Xavier and Frank Williams
of Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   USC's Sam Clancy would have been included but did not meet the
minimum academic standard.</TE>
<TE>   Balloting by a panel of 1,000 voters that includes sportswriters
and sportscasters continues through March 25, the day after the Final
Four is determined.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is still the favorite, but if Duke is upset before the
Final Four and Kansas isn't, there might be another upset in the
works.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas Saga</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas is responding to queries by Nolan Richardson's lawyer
about the reason for Richardson's termination by citing his statement
that "they can pay me off and I'll be on my way."</TE>
<TE>   If everyone who had a take-this-job-and-shove-it moment said so in
a public forum as Richardson unwisely did, unemployment would be
rampant.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas would like the issue to be about the negative impact of
such comments on the program, but it's far too late for that.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the tangled motivations of both sides, it is now
about race.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's other controversial comments made it so, putting
Arkansas in an interesting position.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring should be colorblind, but can't be this time.</TE>
<TE>   Best solution: Give former Richardson assistant Mike Anderson, who
is African American, a very long look.</TE>
<TE>   A worthy outside candidate would be Western Kentucky Coach Dennis
Felton.</TE>

<TE>   HOW THEY MATCH UP</TE>
<TE>   USC likes to set the tone by unleashing different, but similarly
effective, versions of its full-court press. Stanford, meanwhile, is
content to bring the ball up slowly and allow Jacobsen to create. But
with Stanford's lack of a seasoned point guard, the Trojans have run
wild over the Cardinal, pulling off a regular-season sweep by a
combined 27 points while forcing 43 turnovers and getting 27 steals.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Stanford and USC expect
the Trojans to press, at least until the Cardinal start solving the
defense by getting easy baskets. How will Stanford handle the press?</TE>
<TE>   Oregon</TE>
<TE>   (22-7, 14-4)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Washington</TE>
<TE>   (11-17, 5-13)</TE>
<TE>   1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   THE SEASON</TE>
<TE>   Oregon and Washington have split two games, with the Huskies
winning, 97-92, in Seattle and the Ducks winning, 90-84, in Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   STARTING LINEUPS</TE>

Conroy, 6-1, 1.6 apg.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES</TE>
<TE>   Oregon: G Anthony Lever, 6-3, 52.9% 3pt; C Brian Helquist, 6-9,
54.3%; G James Davis, 5-10, 43.0% 3pt.</TE>
<TE>   Washington: Jeffrey Day, 6-9, 30 blocks; G Curtis Allen, 6-0, 12.1
ppg; G Errol Knight, 6-7, 7.0 ppg.</TE>
<TE>   HOW THEY MATCH UP</TE>
<TE>   Not too many people blinked when moribund Washington beat
nationally ranked Oregon in Seattle. The same people shrugged when
the Ducks had to make free throws to hold off the Huskies in Eugene
to preserve their unbeaten home record. Business as usual in the
bottlenecked Pac-10. But while Oregon has a three-headed scoring
monster of Jones, Ridnour and Jackson, Washington is essentially a
one-man team in Wrenn, a Connecticut transfer who is the conference's
newcomer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, which had ridden its 16-0 record at rabid McArthur Court
to lofty national status, made believers of many when it swept USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles last week and the Ducks' confidence is at an
all-time high as Pac-10 regular-season champions. But they can't let
Wrenn run wild; he averaged 29.5 points against them this season. The
Huskies know they can beat the Ducks at home and give them a game on
the road. If the Ducks are looking past Washington, they'll be
looking for early flights back to Eugene.</TE>

<TE>   HOW THEY MATCH UP</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric posted double-doubles in both earlier meetings and seems
to hold a psychological advantage over the younger Sampson, who
totaled 13 points and nine rebounds in the two games. Tamir was held
scoreless as a starter in UCLA's victory, but he came off the bench
to lead Cal with 18 points at Haas Pavilion. Wethers consistently
penetrated the lane in Cal's victory, scoring 15 points on
five-for-seven shooting.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's zone defense in the first meeting forced the Bears to take
25 three-point shots. They made only five and shot 37% from the
field. The Bruins went to a man-to-man in the second game and were
shredded inside. Holding Cal to under 50% shooting is essential. UCLA
needs another big game by Gadzuric, hot shooting from either Kapono
or Knight and balanced scoring from the supporting cast.</TE>

<TE>   HOW THEY MATCH UP</TE>
<TE>   Although the talent is about equal, Arizona is more cohesive and
far more likely to make a run in the tournament. Gardner and Walton
are the most savvy players on either team and can be counted upon to
deliver in the clutch. Prewitt's ability to score from the perimeter
gives Arizona State an edge at center over the uneven Frye and Smith
is the most athletic player on either team. Millage and Stoudamire
are both dangerous shooters. Storey and Crandall are coming off
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State must stay close early and hold off the inevitable
Wildcat streak, which most likely will be triggered by Gardner and
Stoudamire hitting from long range and by Walton making expert passes
in transition. Arizona State has good depth and Coach Rob Evans can
keep his players fresh with frequent substitutions.</TE>

<HD>Clancy Gets Pac-10 Scoop</HD>
<DH>College basketball: USC standout forward learns before
announcement that he's the conference's player of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Clancy was just sitting down for dinner at the Pacific 10
Conference honors banquet Wednesday night when his cell phone rang.
The USC senior forward's sister, Samantha, was calling, letting him
in on a secret that wasn't supposed to be revealed for another 30
minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Surfing the Internet, she came across the Pac-10's Web site and
saw the posting that her brother had already been named the league's
player of the year in a vote of the league's coaches.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good to win an individual award because it shows that
people are taking notice," Clancy said. "It means that the coaches
have respect for me around the league, that I'm playing well and
killing their teams."</LD>
<TE>   Clancy, who, was never honored this season as the Pac-10 player of
the week, averaged 21.1 points (tied for third) and 9.8 rebounds
(second) in league play. The 6-foot-7, 240-pounder also had 33 steals
(tied for third) and blocked 24 shots (seventh).</TE>
<TE>   But his consistency stood out most. He has 17 double-doubles, 11
in a row during league play.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy is the third Trojan to be named Pac-10 player of the year,
joining Wayne Carlander, who won it in 1985, and Harold Miner, who
was honored in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan seniors David Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville were named
honorable mention all-league while guard Errick Craven, the Trojans'
second-leading scorer, was named to the Pac-10 all-freshman team
after averaging 12.9 points and leading the league in steals with 51.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Salim Stoudamire was freshman of the year and Oregon's
Ernie Kent was coach of the year. UCLA forward Jason Kapono was
all-league and Bruin center Dan Gadzuric was honorable mention, with
guard Cedric Bozeman getting freshman honorable mention.</TE>

<LD>Other coaches work in March Madness.</LD>
<LD>   He is March Madness.</LD>
<LD>   Other coaches talk about the Big Dance.</LD>
<TE>   He does the Big Dance.</TE>
<TE>   A fresh breeze fills the air, failure clutters the ground, and
here comes Steve Lavin, industrial broom in hand, ready to sweep
another inconsistent season under an increasingly lumpy rug.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Spring Clean.</TE>
<TE>   "The postseason comes and Coach turns into a mini-Gene Keady,"
said UCLA senior Rico Hines. "He gets up in your face. He gets a
little spittle on his mouth. He gets after it."</TE>
<TE>   With his team. With the referees. And, more than anything else,
with his critics.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted him fired.</TE>
<TE>   He took them to the Elite Eight.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted him canned.</TE>
<TE>   He led them over mighty Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted him blackballed from collegiate basketball.</TE>
<TE>   He gave them the perfect game against Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Five seasons, five firing squads, enough March reprieves that
we've run out of cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for Lavin to show up at Staples Center tonight
begging for a couple more.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome--if you can bear to watch--another uncertain UCLA team
faced with two imperative postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the Bruins' Pacific 10 Conference tournament opener
against California.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the Bruins' NCAA tournament opener against some team
undoubtedly loaded for bear.</TE>
<TE>   An embattled coach of an underachieving team backed into the same
dark corner we've seen in each of the last five springs, with one
exception.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there may be only one way out.</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer a question of whether Lavin can again summon up
enough magic in the next seven days to make much of the last four
months disappear.</TE>
<TE>   This time, it's a mandate.</TE>
<TE>   This time, with UCLA on the verge of hiring a new athletic
director who might want to hire his own guy, Lavin's job may depend
on it.</TE>
<TE>   Hold your cheering. We're not talking immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin could lose both first-round games and, still, the only way
he leaves this summer is by resigning.</TE>
<TE>   If the guy didn't quit last year when Pete Dalis was talking to
Rick Pitino while the Bruins were losing by 29 points at Cal, he's
not quitting now, and why should he?</TE>
<TE>   What happens in the next 10 days is about next season, when Lavin
will be missing at least three stars and needing all the friends he
can get.</TE>
<TE>   In those next 10 days, a new boss will be watching. Somewhere, the
new boss will be looking for a reason to keep a guy who has not been
embraced by the school, a guy who faces constant public criticism, a
guy he didn't hire.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing certain is, the new boss will be watching a guy who
is doing it alone.</TE>
<TE>   That's the biggest difference between this year's Lavin and the
kid six years ago who wept in the locker room after the Elite Eight
loss to Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Lavin had all sorts of shoulders to cry on.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he has considerably less.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin no longer has the point guard who has helped coach the team
in so many big games.</TE>
<TE>   No more Cameron Dollar against Iowa State, no more Baron Davis
against Michigan, no more Earl Watson against Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "My point guard is my central nervous system," Lavin acknowledged
this week. "And this year, injuries and inexperience have hurt us
there."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin also does not have the veteran assistant coach employed by
many successful young head coaches, an old hand to help ease youthful
jitters.</TE>
<TE>   For his entire UCLA career, Lavin has needed such a guy, yet he
always said that he was too loyal to fire any of his young proteges
to make room.</TE>
<TE>   Well, last summer, openings were created when Steve Spencer and
Michael Holton left the staff. Still, no veteran was hired. Lavin is
paying for it now.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has added up to one more thing Lavin is missing.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing that has always saved him.</TE>
<TE>   His feel.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the hugging, hands-on coach doesn't have a
sense of his team.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been more frustrated this year than at any other time here,"
Lavin said. "I've not been able to put the pieces together and make
them work."</TE>
<TE>   Look no further than last Saturday for proof.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine a coach, in a tight second half of the team's
final regular-season game, inserting an entirely new five-man squad
of four freshmen and a sophomore to play for a long stretch?</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine that coach even pondering the same approach in the
tournament?</TE>
<TE>   "I know everybody talks about it being hockey substitutions, but
it gave us a lot of energy. I might do it again," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the young guys didn't play well. It's just that it
made the coach look confused.</TE>
<TE>   Don't even get me started on the failure to call timeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a hard team to judge," said Hines. "We are so
laid-back. The nicest bunch of guys I've ever been around."</TE>
<TE>   Too nice. With a coach who has been too nice. In a situation where
they must suddenly flip a switch and become tough.</TE>
<TE>   Looking up at the words above this sentence, I realize I have
written some variation of this same column before every postseason of
Steve Lavin's career.</TE>
<TE>   Every spring, I have forecast doom.</TE>
<TE>   Every spring, Lavin has proved me wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But this spring is different, this time it's really serious, this
time the coach is ... or maybe he's ... no, wait, he's ...</TE>
<TE>   Other towns just watch March Madness.</TE>
<TE>   With Steve Lavin, we live it.</TE>

<DH>Boys' basketball: Jackrabbits use size advantage to defeat
Loyola, 80-58, in Division I regional playoff game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach Poly High Coach Ron Palmer didn't need John Wooden's
basketball acumen to figure out how his Jackrabbits should go about
beating a Los Angeles Loyola team whose post players were three
inches shorter on average. Look for the open man down low. Pound the
ball inside. Score easy baskets.</LD>
<LD>   Poly executed its plan to perfection Wednesday night as the
third-seeded Jackrabbits hammered Loyola, 80-58, in a Southern
California Regional Division I first-round boys' basketball game at
Long Beach City College.</LD>
<LD>   Poly (29-3) advanced to play second-seeded Fairfax, a 65-49 winner
over Carlsbad, in a Saturday semifinal. Fairfax (30-4) will host the
game at a site to be determined today.</LD>
<TE>   Against Loyola, Jackrabbit forward Marcedes Lewis scored 21 of his
career-high 30 points in the first half as guards Carlos Rivers and
Barry Barnes continually fed the 6-foot-7 senior for effortless
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guys to look for me on the inside," said Lewis, who
muscled past Loyola's Chris Rucker for rebounds and layups. "[Rucker]
was overplaying me."</TE>
<TE>   Jackrabbit forward Bobby Jones added 24 points and Reggie Butler
had 10.</TE>
<TE>   Poly scored the game's first 13 points before the Cubs (27-4)
finally scored with 3 minutes 13 seconds to go in the first quarter
on a basket by Rucker inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits maintained a comfortable lead until the third
quarter, when Loyola made its only real push of the game to pull
within seven points. Josh Flynn-Brown got the Cubs going with a
basket, a three-pointer and a pair of free throws. Rucker scored
inside off an inbounds pass and then Terence Balagia scored off a
steal forced by Loyola's full-court press to end an 11-0 run, making
the score 41-34.</TE>
<TE>   But Poly responded with 17-6 run to close the quarter and retake
the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker finished with 13 points, Flynn-Brown added 12 and Omar
Wilkes had 11.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside Notre Dame High's football program is facing sanctions by
the Southern Section after an investigation concluded that improper
contact took place with prospective athletes.</LD>
<LD>   "The CIF Southern Section is deeply troubled by recruiting efforts
by a small group of individuals associated with the Notre Dame
football program," Southern Section Commissioner Jim Staunton said.</LD>
<LD>   "We found improprieties and rules violations that appear to have
gone back to the transfer of two students two years ago."</LD>
<TE>   The allegations were made against Hal Pfeiffer, Notre Dame's
football coach and athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeiffer has been placed on paid administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   A Notre Dame parent videotaped Pfeiffer meeting last February with
a group of parents from other schools.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeiffer allegedly offered to help find ways to pay the cost of
tuition if the parents had their sons enroll at Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Offering financial incentives to lure high school athletes is
legally and morally wrong," said Father Howard Lincoln, a spokesman
for the Diocese of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already putting safeguards in place to ensure this never
happens again."</TE>
<TE>   Pfeiffer declined to comment.</TE>

<LD>U.S. basketball fans, meet Frederick Jones. Freddie, show the folks
what you can do. Show them how you are a better shooter, better
scorer, better passer, better player than Steve Logan, All-American
guard at Cincinnati who is seen on television all the time.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. basketball fans, meet Sam Clancy. Sam, show the folks what
you can do. Show them how you can go through big chunks of games
touching every rebound, taking most. Show the folks that you can then
turn around and softly drop a 10-foot jump shot, a feathery thing.
Beauty and the beast, all in one play.</LD>
<LD>   Some Pacific 10 coaches--not to name names or anything, Lute and
Mike--have been vocal about how terrible it is the Pac-10 has decided
to have a conference tournament again.</LD>
<TE>   They are so very wrong.</TE>
<TE>   There is no conference in the country that needs a conference
tournament more than the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, fans deserve this. It is a chance to gather all
those colors--green and gold and blues of every shade, reds of every
hue--in one kaleidoscopic mass. The boasting, the bravura bets, the
mingling in the Staples Center lobby of Bruin and Cal boosters,
Cardinal and Trojan rooters, is part of a celebration that everybody
else has had for years.</TE>
<TE>   But more than that, no one pays much attention to the Pac-10. Not
really, not seriously.</TE>
<TE>   All people--and by people we mean Dick Vitale and the folks at
ESPN who televise the Big East, the Big 12, the Big Ten, the SEC and
the ACC--know about the Pac-10 is that Steve Lavin can't coach, that
Arizona is good again and that the kids at Stanford are smart.</TE>
<TE>   Stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   It is not fair, but it is true. Pac-10 teams play games when it is
late at night on the East Coast and they aren't on ESPN. When the
networks have split-audience weekend games involving the Pac-10, the
Pac-10 ends up being seen in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
And we already know how good the Pac-10 is.</TE>
<TE>   This conference needs to play in front of sellout crowds at
Staples Center. It needs to get buzz before Selection Sunday. It
needs some games with extraordinary highlights that will make all the
sports shows the next three days.</TE>
<TE>   It needs to be seen and heard, loud and clear.</TE>
<TE>   As wonderful as the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament is, ACC
teams don't need a tournament. When members of the NCAA selection
committee lock themselves up this weekend, there will not be an
overlooked or under-seeded ACC team.</TE>
<TE>   Cal needs the Pac-10 tournament. Ben Braun's team has matured
slowly and well this year. The 25th-ranked Bears go 12 deep and beat
UCLA, USC, Stanford and Oregon. Some "experts" have suggested Cal is
a bubble team, which is ridiculous and wouldn't happen to a
comparable team in the ACC or Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA needs the Pac-10 tournament. The Bruins are still waiting for
that Big Roll, the one that comes at the end of the season and
traditionally saves Lavin's job. Nothing beats tradition, or Lavin's
Bruins at the end of the season. Except this season the roll hasn't
begun yet. Staples Center would be the Big Stage to start the Big
Roll.</TE>
<TE>   USC needs the Pac-10 tournament. Last time anybody noticed the
Trojans was when they went to the Elite Eight last year. Say they
beat Stanford today for the third time this season; say they get into
Saturday's championship game. Selectors won't think about all the
last-second losses. They'll think about the Pac-10 tournament wins.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to build tradition," USC Coach Henry Bibby
says. "Like Oregon, we're trying to get on the map. Maybe knocking
off some of the bigger people will get us more respect."</TE>
<TE>   And most of all, Oregon needs the Pac-10 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Kent, Oregon's coach, is not boastful enough, not nearly
demanding enough.</TE>
<TE>   Having coached the team that won the Pac-10 regular-season
championship by two games, having come to Los Angeles last weekend
and swept USC and UCLA, having built a smart, solid, well-conceived
team, Kent was not willing to campaign even a little bit for a No. 1
seed in the NCAAs.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on what would happen with Oklahoma and Cincinnati,"
Kent says, "but for us, a two or a three seed would be just as
exciting for our team, the university and our fans."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati has beaten no team of great national strength, and
Conference USA is not nearly as strong as the Pac-10. Kent should be
pounding the tables and demanding a No. 1 seeding. Because he won't,
the Ducks can use the Pac-10 event as their table to pound.</TE>
<TE>   "I've sat at home the last couple of years," Kent says, "watching
the Big Ten, ACC, Big East tournaments, caught up in all the
excitement and saying 'We've got to have that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Exactly.</TE>
<TE>   News flash: Kent, the coach of the league champions, was actually
mentioned in a Chicago newspaper as a leading candidate for the
DePaul job. DePaul has been a basketball not-much-of-anything for a
long time. Yet, there were people in Chicago on Wednesday morning who
saw Kent's name and said, "Who's he?"</TE>
<TE>   Who's he? One of the best coaches in the country of one of the
best teams with one of the best players. Who knew? Not enough people.
Yet.</TE>

<LD>Welcome to the Rip-Off 10 Tournament at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Bring your money, park, eat, buy a program, stay for one
game--stay for all seven, it doesn't matter to the folks at the
Rip-Off 10 once they get you here.</LD>
<LD>   You say you want to go to only the UCLA game? Well, the only way
you can get into the building is to pay $160 or $135 for a ticket to
all seven tournament games to be played here over the next three
days.</LD>
<TE>   You say you're not interested in the other six games, because
we're talking UCLA here and the Bruins might very well be one and
done, that will still be $160 or $135, and thanks for the Rip-Off 10
donation?</TE>
<TE>   You say you're a student, who paid $7 to watch the Bruins play in
Pauley Pavilion and you were there for the guys through every
turnover against Pepperdine and Arizona State, and now you want to
watch Steve Lavin coach at Staples Center in case he never gets
another chance, maybe even paint your face and wave to Mom and Dad on
TV the way you see other college kids do? Then you better also make
up a sign: "Mom-Dad, I'm $135 in the hole."</TE>
<TE>   There are no student discounts for the Rip-Off 10, no single-game
tickets on sale for the Rip-Off 10, and after tickets were
distributed to the conference's schools, there remain about 1,000
ticket packages for the general public--at $135 each--in the upper
reaches of Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Shaq would look like an ant from up there--a big ant, but an
ant, nonetheless," said Colin Kingston, who called himself "a
suffering Bruin fan," in an e-mail to express his unhappiness at
being unable to buy a single-game ticket to watch UCLA. "What I want
to know is, who has the time or interest in attending all seven
games? I'd sure like to know if it was officials from the Pac-10 or
officials from Staples who decided to get greedy."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Staples Center said, "Ticket policies are set by
the event organizers," making it clear it's the Pac-10 that's greedy.</TE>
<TE>   Who chose not to have a student discount? I asked, and the
spokesman said, "That was a Pac-10 decision."</TE>
<TE>   That's the Rip-Off 10, staging this student-athlete event but
making no economic allowances for student-grunts to enjoy a memorable
college experience.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just doing what everyone else is doing, and what they do in
the NCAA tournament," Rip-Off 10 assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Correction: A spokesman for UCLA said that in the NCAA tournament
students buy tickets for the session in which their team competes,
and their places are taken by students from another school in the
next session. The losers go home, without paying for tickets they
didn't use, while the winners then occupy the seats for the
championship session.</TE>
<TE>   Correction: The Big West tournament at the Anaheim Convention
Center sells tickets on an individual-game basis, and it has $7
student tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Correction: The Mountain West tournament in Las Vegas has
single-session tickets, and a $15 student discount ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "I can give people advice on how to get single-game tickets,"
Muldoon said. "It happens in the NCAA tournament, teams lose and
people walk out of the arena and sell their tickets to the remaining
games. There are ways to get tickets."</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the Rip-Off 10's willingness to teach scalping
techniques, and look forward to Muldoon's seminars, although I should
probably point out that the small print on the back of each ticket
indicates it's against city law here to resell a ticket to
anyone--even at a discount price. That suggests a sign of a different
sort: "Mom-Dad, please send bail money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE RIP-OFF 10, which is paying for transportation and hotel and
giving players $50 a day for food, expects to divide more than $2.5
million in profit among its 10 schools. Many of the sportswriters
covering the tournament accepted very nice media gifts from the
conference, or the haul might have been bigger.</TE>
<TE>   "We're selling this as an event, not as a single game," Muldoon
said, and they've made that clear. "If there are any ticket packages
unsold [as of today], we'll break them down and sell them as single
[session] tickets."</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't they say that in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   "I asked, and was told, 'no,'" wrote Kingston. "Either the lady at
Staples was incompetent or directed not to inform callers in an
attempt to boost sales of the $135 ticket packages. I have no
assurances tickets will be available, so I won't even attempt to
drive there, and I'm not going to pay for games I don't plan on
watching."</TE>
<TE>   As long as there are 17,000 suckers willing to spend money for
games they're not going to attend, the Rip-Off 10 is in command. The
last time they tried to conduct one of these Pac-10 tournaments,
however, they failed to gain fan support and after four years
disappeared. "We never lost money on one of them," chimed in Muldoon.</TE>
<TE>   They probably didn't give the media nice gifts in those days.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel we're ripping people off whatsoever," Muldoon said.
"I think this is one of the great bargains there are in sports."</TE>
<TE>   I have no doubt the Rip-Off 10 is convinced of that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Bradley Hutchins:</TE>
<TE>   "They were discussing the upcoming celebrity boxing matches on Fox
the other day on TV and Channel 4's Carlos Del Valle suggested you
going up against Mike Garrett. Any chance of seeing this?"</TE>
<TE>   I've put on some pounds recently, so I believe we're in different
divisions. If I'm not mistaken, Garrett's still a lightweight.</TE>

<HD>Russian's Debut Is a Real Winner</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Promising Sharapova, 14, impresses against Rippner
in her first WTA match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Robert Lansdorp treated the eager Russian family with his usual
manner, which is to say he delivered the bad news with no softening
qualifiers. The vaunted coach observed Maria Sharapova, then a
pre-teen, and issued his verdict.</LD>
<LD>   "I took a look at her," he said. "I said, 'Well, I think her
forehand [stinks]. And her concentration is no good. They [the
family] basically didn't leave. They kept coming back for more, for
more punishment. I was right. When you have someone who is very
talented, everybody will start raving and never tell you the truth.
But I really don't care."</LD>
<LD>   It turned out Sharapova didn't care either. Lansdorp's tough words
amused her, instead of scaring her, and if her dad had read about
this famous coach when she was a child in Russia, well, this was
where she would learn.</LD>
<TE>   Graduation day came about four years later, on Wednesday at the
Pacific Life Open at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. The 14-year-old
made her WTA debut and defeated Brie Rippner, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2, in one
hour 26 minutes. Rippner, at No. 74, is the highest-ranked player
Sharapova has beaten. Rippner's ranking was an injury exemption
because she had ankle surgery last year.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Sharapova's first-round match followed compatriot
Anna Kournikova's. For most of last year, the teenager was touted by
some as the next Kournikova. Her victory followed Kournikova's 6-1,
6-4 exit against Lilia Osterloh, an interesting bit of symmetry. The
struggling Kournikova not only has yet to win her first tournament
but her ranking has stagnated at No. 67.</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons between Sharapova and Kournikova aren't many.
Sharapova actually seemed to enjoy being interviewed, something you
can't say of Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect her," said Sharapova, a wild-card entrant. "I'm just
trying to do my own thing, just trying to be Maria Sharapova, not
look for anyone else's game. I try to be myself."</TE>
<TE>   She cannot play another WTA event until she turns 15, which is
April 19. Her parents decided to bring her to the United States when
she was 7 for her tennis. Sharapova, 5 feet 9 and 108 pounds, was
born in Siberia and moved to Sochi when she was 2.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hard decision," she said. "Of course it was great
because I'm here doing an interview. In Russia, I could have been
going to school with my friends and doing my homework and looking at
Monica Seles on TV when I'm going to play her tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Sharapova is such a special case, she is one of the very few
youngsters to split her time between Nick Bollettieri's academy and
Lansdorp. She lives near the academy in Florida and travels to
Southern California frequently to train with Lansdorp at the South
Bay Tennis Center in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Lansdorp's most famous protege was Tracy Austin, who won her
second U.S. Open title in 1981, six years before Sharapova was born.
"He makes jokes sometimes," Sharapova said. "If you hit a bad
forehand, he would say, 'Oh my god, Tracy would kill that ball.'"</TE>
<TE>   One of the few times Sharapova got rattled recently was when she
was making her morning trip to get Lansdorp coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to bring him coffee," she said. "By the club
there is a gas station where you get coffee. Someone is waving at me
from the car, and you never expect Tracy Austin to be waving at you.
I'm thinking, 'Tracy Austin. At a gas station.' I take the coffee and
I forget to pay for it. So I had to go back and the guy said, 'Didn't
you just come from there?'"</TE>
<TE>   Lansdorp laughed at that one. He is delighted with his latest
prodigy and long ago changed his mind about her forehand.</TE>
<TE>   "Her forehand is starting to be a weapon and she can stay focused
for a long time," he said. "She's a very good shot maker, and the
girl has no fear."</TE>

<LD>Finishing sixth in the Pacific 10 Conference was actually a blessing.
That's the latest lipstick applied to UCLA's underwhelming regular
season.</LD>
<LD>   A higher spot in the standings would have meant a tougher draw in
the first round of the conference tournament. UCLA is ecstatic at
being matched against No. 3-seeded California, which defeated the
Bruins by 18 points Feb. 21 in Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel we got a good draw in Cal," senior guard Rico Hines said.
"We are a good fit. We match up with them pretty good.</LD>
<TE>   "They beat a lot of teams bad [at home], but we beat them down
here. All the guys are excited about the draw."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defeated the Bears, 64-57, in January, using a zone defense
that kept the ball out of the paint and forced Cal to attempt 25
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins went to a man-to-man for much of the game at Berkeley
and the quicker Bear guards beat them off the dribble, repeatedly
scoring inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing a team a third time, there are less surprises," UCLA
Coach Steve Lavin said. "It will come down to your ability to take
care of the basketball, or a missed free throw, or who comes up with
a loose ball."</TE>
<TE>   This might be the only game of the four where both teams play with
smiles.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins and Bears--unlike many of their Pac-10
counterparts--embrace the idea of a conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Cal, clinging to the No. 25 spot in the rankings, could use a
victory or two to gain a higher seeding in the NCAA tournament. UCLA
is just trying to reach at least one of its preseason goals.</TE>
<TE>   "There is definitely a sense of urgency," Hines said. "We set a
lot of goals--to win at Maui, to the win Pac-10 regular season--and
we didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is our chance to do good things and prove a lot of people
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lavin used Ryan Walcott at point guard for 16 minutes of
the second half against Oregon on Saturday, he made it clear that
Cedric Bozeman's starting job is not in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "Cedric is the starting point guard, and Ryan and Cedric will play
together sometimes," he said. "They are a nice complement to each
other. I actually think Cedric and Ryan are right where they should
be at this stage in their career."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin pointed out that other Bruin point guards who played as
freshmen went through turbulent times, including Baron Davis and
Cameron Dollar. Getting Bozeman--who missed all or part of 11 games
in December and early January because of a knee injury--more playing
time is another reason UCLA is all for the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "This tournament is great for young players," Lavin said. "They
get to play in a tournament atmosphere in a big place like Staples,
then do it again a week later [in the NCAA tournament.]"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal is the worst three-point shooting team in the Pac 10 at 31.8%,
but the Bears are capable of getting hot from long range.</TE>
<TE>   They set school records for three-pointers in a game twice this
season, making 14 against Fresno State on Dec. 14 and hitting 15 in a
victory at USC on Jan. 24, a game won on a last-second three-pointer
by Shantay Legans.</TE>

<DH>Tough Love Works for Trojans, as Bibby's Early Abuse of
Granville Has Turned to Respect</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was during a recent coaches' meeting that Henry Bibby took
exception with the play of his starting point guard.</LD>
<LD>   The USC coach wasted no words or time in ripping Brandon
Granville, who, on occasion, has been called everything from too
short to too slow to too strong-willed.</LD>
<LD>   But Bibby's staff, used to his brutal honesty and his drill
sergeant-like tendency to break down his players before rebuilding
them in his image, just smirked.</LD>
<TE>   "They told me, 'Oh yeah, sure, you like him the best,'" Bibby said
with a grin. "They're probably right. He's a point guard just like I
was and he's just so smart."</TE>
<TE>   The love-hate relationship between Bibby and Granville is now
mostly love. The amiable Granville now respects the curmudgeon that
Bibby can be, and the old-school taskmaster sees a lot of himself in
Granville.</TE>
<TE>   One can almost imagine Bibby, with his Dr. Evil-like bald pate and
narrow eyes, ensconced in his Heritage Hall lair, looking over the
5-foot-9 Granville with his shaved head and proclaiming: "I shall
call him, Mini-Me."</TE>
<TE>   It's around that vibrant bond that the 22nd-ranked Trojans'
fortunes revolve as they begin postseason play today at Staples
Center against No. 16 Stanford in the reborn Pacific 10 Conference
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been times when I've been on the court and we'll both
call the same play at the same time," Granville said. "That's when we
knew we were on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't always that way. There was a time when they weren't
even reading from the same book.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the moment Granville arrived at USC from Westchester
High, he became the object of Bibby's scorn. Bibby chastised and
challenged Granville on a seemingly daily basis. Nothing the high
school all-star selection did was ever good enough.</TE>
<TE>   The browbeating made Granville question whether he wanted to
continue playing for Bibby and follow the trail blazed by Kevin
Augustine, the point guard Granville replaced when Augustine
transferred out after he could no longer stand Bibby's methods.</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon fans' chants of "Oompa Loompa," which are aimed at
Granville with a nod to the little orange people from the movie
"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory," paled in comparison to how
hard Bibby was riding him.</TE>
<TE>   But the mental smackdowns began arriving with less frequency
toward the middle of Granville's junior season.</TE>
<TE>   And there was a revelation on the player's part.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a kind of a tough love," Granville said. "I had to tell
myself and realize that he's just trying to get the best out of me
and trying to win, just like I am. Last year, I could sense that
there was more of a respect for my game. He's kind of handed the team
over to me."</TE>
<TE>   While not spectacular, Granville has been steady enough to notch
some personal bests and etch his name all over the USC record book, a
fact Bibby proudly points out.</TE>
<TE>   Granville owns school career records for assists (749), steals
(221), three-point baskets (211) and games played (120).</TE>
<TE>   And with 3,900 minutes played, Granville is 79 minutes away from
breaking Wayne Carlander's school mark for durability. Granville is
also on course to join Carlander as the lone four-year Trojans to
have played in every possible USC game during a career.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,366 points Granville has scored rank ninth in USC annals and
he's fifth in Pac-10 history in assists.</TE>
<TE>   This season, he is committing a career-low 2.2 turnovers a game
and his 2.48 assist/turnover ratio leads the Pac-10. His free-throw
percentage of 79.5% is a career high.</TE>
<TE>   "Brandon Granville is a little cocky guy," Bibby said admiringly.
"He knows a lot but sometimes he knows too much. He might not be the
quickest guy or the best shooter or have the most talent. But boy, he
knows the game."</TE>
<TE>   This year, though, Granville's offensive stats are suffering in
comparison to previous years.</TE>
<TE>   He's the Trojans' third-leading scorer with a 12.0 average, the
lowest since averaging 7.7 as a freshman, and his three-point
shooting percentage of 34.3% is also the second-lowest of his career,
as is his 5.5 assist average.</TE>
<TE>   And he has hit a slump of late, scoring four points against Oregon
last week before going scoreless against Oregon State while shooting
a combined one for 13.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is he's lost a lot of confidence and I don't know
why," Bibby said. "I attribute Thursday [against the Ducks] to him
being sick [with flu] but he should be fine now."</TE>
<TE>   A Bibby excuse for Granville's poor performance would have been
unheard of in years past, and none of Granville's accomplishments
would have seemed probable when the freshman joined the team four
years ago. But none of them would been possible, either, without
Bibby gaining trust in Granville.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bibby spent the early part of this year knocking his team,
his seniors in particular, for a seeming lack of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, he proclaimed the search over, anointing himself as
Trojan leader, though he did give a wink to Granville, saying the
diminutive one was the closest thing to a vocal on-court leader USC
has. So is this a thawing in the iceberg formerly known as Bibby?</TE>
<TE>   Could be. Bibby used warm and fuzzy words to describe his bringing
his seniors together Monday to "join hands" for a "heart-to-heart"
with them "to show my love for them and their love for me" as well as
to "remind them to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   For Granville, his decision to play for a notoriously tough coach
has been validated.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was choosing a college, you see that special bond or
relationship between some players and their coaches and I had hoped
to have that," Granville said. "It's evolved over time. You just know
that he's there and he has the life experiences and of playing in the
NBA."</TE>
<TE>   Granville also intimated that, with all of Bibby's mind games and
button-pushing, the respect is reciprocal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has an appreciation of us [seniors] in that we helped
turned the program around from winning nine, 15 games and losing in
the first round of the NIT to getting to the Elite Eight last year. I
think he's thankful for that."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby can continue to defend his strong-arm coaching tactics,
which fall short of Bob Knight's antics, by pointing to the success
of Granville, who is contemplating going immediately into coaching
after his eligibility expires.</TE>
<TE>   "A coach is like a parent," Bibby said. "You want your kids to do
well and you punish them when [they're bad]. That's not abusive.
That's love."</TE>
<TE>   Walking through Heritage Hall on Tuesday afternoon, Bibby spotted
Granville across the way and without saying a word, made his feeling
clear.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby thumped his chest twice with his right fist and extended an
olive branch of an arm toward him, and went on his way.</TE>

<LD>Stanford skipped Wednesday's Pacific 10 Conference tournament
practice and media day at Staples Center. Cardinal Coach Mike
Montgomery, who has voiced his disdain for the tournament, cited
academic concerns in delaying his team's departure.</LD>
<LD>   No one would have blamed him, though, had he spent the day
recruiting the university's academic scholars to help him figure a
way to beat USC's full-court press.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans pressed and harassed Stanford into 27 turnovers the
first time the teams met this season, a 90-82 USC victory at the
Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans threw different variations of the press at the
Cardinal in the rematch at Maples Pavilion and rode the mayhem to a
77-58 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any wonder what Stanford expects USC to throw at it today
at 3:30 p.m. in a first-round game?</TE>
<TE>   "Why change something if you've had success with it?" mused
Stanford center Curtis Borchardt, who sat out the first game because
of a hip injury before being limited to five shots up north.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to attack their press better," Montgomery said. "They
manage to disrupt our offense. They are big and strong ... we can't
do anything about that. USC does a good job of adjusting their
press."</TE>
<TE>   Even Casey Jacobsen acknowledged USC's power of the press.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps you off balance so you can't really do as many things as
you'd like to," he said. "They've done a pretty good job of
neutralizing me. They also have this soft, switching zone man
[defense], or whatever you want to call it, always bringing a second
guy over on me."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, who led Pac-10 scorers with a 23.1 average in league
games, averaged 22.0 against the Trojans, though some of the points
were in garbage time.</TE>
<TE>   "Their frontcourt is pretty big," Jacobsen said. "I've had to
settle for some really deep three-pointers and while I like to take
them, I don't want a steady diet of them. But against [USC] most of
my perimeter shooting has come from way outside."</TE>
<TE>   And that's just fine with USC Coach Henry Bibby, who lists
Jacobsen as his No. 1 focus, followed by Borchardt and guard Julius
Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate to have beaten them two times," Bibby said.
"They're a good team, but so are we."</TE>
<TE>   In Palo Alto, Bibby started 6-foot-8, 250-pound Gregg Guenther at
center to lean on the 7-foot Borchardt. Guenther might start again
today.</TE>

<LD>Bicycle rider's race--An article in Tuesday's California section
misidentified the race of Conrad Richard McKay because of erroneous
information provided to The Times by a deputy attorney general. The
prosecutor said in the article that McKay is white, basing the statement
on information in a county probation report. According to the state
Department of Corrections, McKay, whose 1999 arrest was upheld by the
state Supreme Court on Monday, is African American. McKay was taken into
custody and searched for riding his bicycle in the wrong direction on a
residential street and not carrying identification.</LD>

<HD>'Untouchables' Go by Board</HD>
<DH>Election: Chris Norby's upset victory over Cynthia P. Coad
disproves notion that supervisors can't be beat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than two decades, Orange County supervisors have been nearly
untouchable, enjoying a political free pass for reelection that
became as routine as going through a turnstile at a Disneyland ride.</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<LD>   Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby's stunning victory over
incumbent Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad has left political scientists
and pundits pondering why she lost and Norby won. On this they agree:
Norby's win was extremely unusual.</LD>
<TE>   Incumbents on the Board of Supervisors have time to build campaign
war chests, dole out patronage and cement name identification during
their tenure. It's a combination that should spell an easy victory on
election day, said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science
department at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "You could make an argument that this is more significant in
historic terms than Measure W, which was a culmination of a long war
that has gone on since 1994," said Petracca, referring to the
anti-airport ballot initiative voters approved Tuesday to stop
airport planning at the closed El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   No incumbent has been unseated since Roger Stanton defeated former
Supervisor Phillip Anthony in 1980, who had been indicted in 1977 on
campaign finance charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely unusual for an incumbent to get beat," said Stan
Oftelie, president of the Orange County Business Council and longtime
county political observer.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Stanton, during a telephone interview Wednesday at his
residence, leafed through old news clippings that called his victory
"political history."</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, both Norby and Stanton are educators. Both were
city councilmen and both faced incumbents who outspent them.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly what I thought last night while seeing election
results," Stanton said. "Anthony was a first-term supervisor, like
Coad, and he outspent me 10 to 1."</TE>
<TE>   Though an analysis of county vote totals suggests Measure W was
opposed by a majority of north Orange County voters, Petracca credits
Norby's victory, at least in part, to his anti-airport views.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably Norby's defeat of [Coad] would not have been possible
without Measure W," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Coad contends she had to battle two campaigns: Norby's and
an onslaught of campaign mailers bought with South County money.</TE>
<TE>   Tired and emotionally drained, she chose not to go into the office
Wednesday. Instead, the 68-year-old former educator and community
college board member said she awoke and had coffee and doughnuts with
two of her grandchildren. Relaxation is what she wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Coad has yet to offer the 52-year-old Norby congratulations.
Instead, she has asked county staff to investigate any possible
ballot-counting errors that could have occurred because her name was
printed second under Norby's on an estimated 70,000 ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Though election officials are confident the results will stand,
with Norby getting nearly 54% of the vote to Coad's 46%, they will
run tests to ensure ballot-counting machines had correct tallies,
said Steve Rodermund, chief deputy registrar.</TE>
<TE>   The tests, done as part of a state-mandated quality-control
measure, will be done this week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coad, who is planning a vacation to Spain in the next few weeks,
said she intends to return and vigorously carry out the remaining
nine months of her term, which ends the first week in January with
Norby's swearing-in ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll still be there fighting for my district," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her district, at least as it was reshaped to reflect the latest
census numbers, may have been her downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "You can trace it to the redistricting and how the boundaries were
designed," Oftelie said. "She lost Anaheim, where she was strong, and
picked up Fullerton and may have overestimated her name I.D. in
Fullerton compared to the areas she let go.</TE>
<TE>   "In many areas she was virtually an unknown running for the first
time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Norby's arrival, the dynamic on the five-member Board of
Supervisors is guaranteed to change. A 3-2 pro-airport majority for
years has battled anti-airport forces that have marshaled successive
ballot measures aimed at killing El Toro. Now that Measure W has
rezoned the former base to block any airport use, El Toro probably
will give way to other county issues. New alliances will form.</TE>
<TE>   Said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, favored to defeat Democrat Bea
Foster in November in the heavily Republican 71st Assembly District
and leave a vacancy on the board: "There's going to be a lot of
changing dynamics, but we've got to concentrate on the people's
business, and we've got to focus on the job we do--the job we got
elected to do."</TE>
<TE>   With Coad as a lame duck and Spitzer's probable exit, many
political observers say it's too early to tell what power shifts may
take place.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Coad and fellow supervisors will be busy dealing
with the fallout from the U.S. Navy's decision to auction off the El
Toro base land and choosing a successor to replace county
Clerk-Recorder Gary Granville, who died last week.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith said Wednesday it is far too early to begin
analyzing the board's new composition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still extremely disappointed and shocked that Coad lost the
election," he said.</TE>

<HD>Condit's Loss Brings Sense of Relief to Central Valley</HD>
<DH>Congress: Weary of the notoriety over his role in Chandra
Levy case, residents hope to get back to normal life.</DH>

<DL>MODESTO</DL>
<LD>When the end came, Rep. Gary Condit found it hard to admit defeat.</LD>
<LD>   But throughout the district once known as "Condit Country," many
were quick to embrace Tuesday's election results as the end of a
morality play that has roiled this steadfast Central Valley community
for almost a year.</LD>
<LD>   Condit's 18-percentage-point loss to a former friend brought an
abrupt halt to his 30-year political career and ushered in a sense of
relief among residents eager to escape the notoriety of a congressman
entangled in the mystery of a missing 24-year-old Modesto woman.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a new day dawning in the Central Valley," said Sandra
Lucas, chairwoman of the Stanislaus County Democratic Central
Committee. "There's been a lot of pain.... It's time for healing and
time for us to get back to normal, everyday life."</TE>
<TE>   After years of easy victories, Condit was undone by his
association with Chandra Levy, an intern in Washington who
disappeared May 1. Although police say the congressman is not a
suspect in her disappearance, Condit's equivocal answers about their
relationship angered many.</TE>
<TE>   "The only message that I take from this election is that Chandra
Levy mattered," said Lawrence Giventer, a political science professor
at Cal State Stanislaus.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no other issues. It was a referendum on Gary Condit,
and it was a referendum on his behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Condit did not return calls for comment Wednesday. His local
district office said he was flying back to Washington to work.</TE>
<TE>   Though the seven-term congressman's downfall opened up his
district to new leadership, many political experts said it is
unlikely that Condit's departure will dramatically change the Central
Valley's political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced), who once worked as an aide
to Condit, is considered the favorite to win the November election
over state Sen. Dick Monteith (R-Modesto) in the 18th District, which
was redrawn this year to include more Democratic voters.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza would cut a different figure on Capitol Hill than Condit,
renowned for his toothy smile and thick head of hair. Soft-spoken,
bespectacled and still slightly pudgy (he lost nearly 100 pounds over
the last nine months), Cardoza has the demeanor of a college
professor.</TE>
<TE>   But the assemblyman said he considers himself a centrist and very
similar to Condit politically.</TE>
<TE>   During his victory speech at a downtown Modesto hotel Tuesday
night, he promised to continue the tradition of strong constituent
services that marked Condit's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza, the grandson of Portuguese immigrants, worked for Condit
in a variety of capacities for less than two years, serving as a
legislative aide, driver and scheduler when Condit first ran for
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't betray a friend; I feel like the friend sort of left us
all," Cardoza said. "I feel very bad for him. He got himself in a
terrible fix."</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza, who was endorsed by both of California's U.S. senators
and has strong state party support, said he is more of a consensus
builder than Condit.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary was sort of always an outsider and fought his battles from
the outside," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he added: "Really, at this point, I don't want to dwell on
Mr. Condit."</TE>
<TE>   Many residents concur, saying they hope Cardoza will be able to
work for the district without being dogged by the Levy investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure of all the rumors is going to be off him and he's
going to be able to start fresh," said Salida resident Arlene
Morriston, 42, a bakery clerk.</TE>
<TE>   State and national party leaders also are privately expressing
relief at Condit's loss, worried that the beleaguered congressman
could have been a liability for Democrats, according to some
insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It presented a huge problem if he won, in terms of how you deal
with it politically," said one Democratic consultant who works with
state and national leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Before Levy disappeared, Condit was an important player in state
politics. He helped deliver Central Valley votes for Gov. Gray Davis
in 1998. But Davis broke with Condit last summer when he publicly
criticized him for not being more forthright about his relationship
with Levy. In protest, Condit's two children, both of whom worked for
Davis, quit their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday morning, Chandra Levy's parents, Robert and Susan,
emerged from their Modesto home and issued another appeal to Condit
to assist the investigation into Chandra's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Condit has made promises and pledges for a long time, before
the campaign and during the campaign, that he would do anything he
could to help the investigation," said Robert Levy. "We just ask that
he keep his word."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the scandal, Condit's popularity has remained strong in
parts of his district. On Tuesday, he carried Stanislaus County,
which includes Modesto and his hometown of Ceres, by 3 percentage
points.</TE>
<TE>   Some Condit supporters worried that with him gone, they will lose
a strong advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "We call him 'The Workhorse' because he has always worked so hard
for the whole Valley," said Jerry Westlake, mayor of Dos Palos, a
town of 5,000 people in the district's southern tip.</TE>
<TE>   Condit helped keep the local hospital open last year, Westlake
said, saving 75 jobs, and wrote letters to each member of the high
school football team when it won the regional championship.</TE>
<TE>   Without the congressman, "the small towns are not going to be
represented," Westlake said dejectedly.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, Central Valley residents said they are glad
to be rid of Condit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy he's not our representative in Congress," said Jorge
Guerrero, 43, a warehouse driver from Modesto. "He made me sick. I am
glad that he has been defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Stanislaus County Supervisor Pat Paul once was a strong ally of
Condit, who endorsed her when she first ran for office and helped her
become the first woman on the Board of Supervisors. But last summer,
dismayed by Condit's refusal to answer questions about his
relationship with Levy, she encouraged Cardoza to run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's finally over and I can hold my head up and feel some
dignity," Paul said Wednesday. "It's just been embarrassing. First,
nobody ever heard of where I live. Now everybody knows, but it's not
a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Already, Modesto is getting back to normal. The satellite news
trucks trundled away Wednesday, and the protesters who held vigil
outside Condit's congressional office for eight months with signs
"Honk for Gary to Resign Now" were gone.</TE>
<TE>   For Condit, though, the election means having to chart a new
course.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, friends and family members gathered with him at
his home in Ceres to await the results, eating chili and chocolate
pie as the numbers came in. Some played basketball in the backyard to
burn off nervous energy.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday, Cardoza held a large lead over the
congressman, and it was apparent that Condit's longshot campaign to
win reelection and restore the trust of his constituents had failed.</TE>
<TE>   But, standing in front of his house to face reporters, Condit
couldn't bring himself to formally give up the race.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking briefly, Condit thanked his supporters and promised to
serve the rest of his term with diligence, then quickly went back
inside.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, his son, Chad, said that though the numbers
were not in their favor, his father hadn't officially conceded.</TE>
<TE>   "He feels like he's the luckiest man in the world," Chad Condit
said, standing on a dark street corner, lit only by the glare of a TV
news camera.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows who his friends are.... We ran a good race and we have
nothing to be ashamed of. And there's life after politics."</TE>

<HD>Greuel Apparent Winner in District 2</HD>
<DH>City council: A 55-vote lead over Cardenas not yet official
with ballots still to be counted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wendy Greuel celebrated Wednesday after an initial election count
gave her a 55-vote lead over Tony Cardenas for the Los Angeles City
Council's 2nd District seat, but both candidates anxiously awaited
the tally of about 3,000 uncounted ballots.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel, a DreamWorks SKG executive who was fielding congratulatory
phone calls at her Van Nuys home Wednesday morning, met later with
constituents in Sunland-Tujunga and North Hollywood to make plans for
assuming office.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm making plans with the community, talking about their
priorities, so I can hit the ground running," Greuel said late
Wednesday, operating on just three hours of sleep.</LD>
<TE>   However, she stopped short of declaring victory over Assemblyman
Cardenas (D-Panorama City) in the east San Fernando Valley district.
The final outcome may not be known for a week or more, officials at
the county registrar said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident," Greuel said. "Fifty-five votes is fifty-five
votes. The trend all evening was in my favor, and I think the trend
will continue."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's tally of all precincts, subject to official
verification, gave Greuel 13,224 votes or 50.10%, compared to 13,169
votes or 49.90% for Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates were amazed that, with 26,393 votes counted, so few
separated them.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Conny B. McCormack estimated
that about 3,000 ballots are uncounted--provisional ballots cast by
people not on the official rolls at polling stations and absentee
ballots hand-delivered by voters to the polling places Tuesday or
arriving in the mail close to the election.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there are enough ballots outstanding that could make a
difference in the race," McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   She and others said the close race reminded them of the 1998
Senate primary race between Richard Katz and Richard Alarcon, which
Alarcon ultimately won by 29 votes. Katz dropped his demand for a
recount after a month.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said it is premature for anyone to claim victory, but he
was hopeful of his chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable," he said. "I respect every vote, and I think
we should wait and see what the outcome is."</TE>
<TE>   The county legally has 28 days to finish the count and certify the
election, but Greuel said that, after consulting with legal experts,
she is confident that it will take less than half that time.</TE>
<TE>   Once the results are certified, any candidate may demand a recount
within five days, but the candidate must pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said that he has not decided about requesting a recount,
but that some district residents may file complaints about voting
irregularities, including the late opening of some polling places.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates sent campaign officials, including an attorney for
Greuel, to county offices Wednesday to monitor the counting of the
remaining ballots.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said the county will issue an update Friday regarding
the count of absentee ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla said Wednesday that he is still
hoping for victory for Cardenas, his former boss and close ally.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still very, very possible," Padilla said. "We knew it would
be a very close and very competitive race from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   After finishing more than five percentage points behind Cardenas
in the primary, Greuel apparently closed the gap because of several
factors, including a larger campaign treasury and a low voter turnout
with more conservative voters going to the polls, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Voter turnout Tuesday was 24.7%, which was lighter than many
expected but still more than the 18% in the December primary
election.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel's barrage of attack mail, calling Cardenas a Sacramento
politician tied to Indian gaming and other interests, also apparently
had an impact, said Harvey Englander, a political consultant not
involved in the race.</TE>
<TE>   "Attack mail always hurts," Englander said.</TE>
<TE>   The election outcome is likely to have implications beyond the
district.</TE>
<TE>   John Emerson, chairman of the Redistricting Commission, said
Wednesday that if Greuel wins, he will support a controversial plan
that would create a separate district with a concentration of Latino
voters to make sure the city complies with the Voting Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   If Cardenas wins, the commission can argue that his victory in the
existing 2nd District, with 24% Latino registration, justifies only a
minor change of boundaries that increases that number to 34%, Emerson
said.</TE>
<TE>   A Greuel victory also could affect Padilla's hold on the council
presidency. Although she was backed by several council members who
want to replace Padilla, Greuel has not announced a position on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about that," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   In other city voting Tuesday, the council president's coattails
did not appear to help causes and candidates he supported. Padilla
headed the coalition campaign for Proposition Q, the police bond
measure that appeared to fall just short of approval. He also backed
Yolanda Fuentes, who lost a Democratic primary race for Cardenas' old
Assembly seat to San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was one of the last people to leave the Cardenas campaign
party early Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   By 1:30 a.m. at La Sirenita restaurant in Panorama City, about 10
Cardenas supporters, including Padilla, hovered around a laptop
computer, awaiting any change in the vote tally.</TE>
<TE>   By 2 a.m., most could wait no more. They hugged Cardenas and his
wife, Norma, congratulated him on waging a good fight and left.</TE>
<TE>   At Greuel headquarters, the candidate also celebrated into the wee
hours.</TE>
<TE>   With U2's "Beautiful Day" playing, an upbeat Greuel waited calmly
for updates.</TE>
<TE>   At about 2:25 a.m., as soon as the computer screen showed all 125
precincts reporting giving her a 55-vote lead, Greuel got up and gave
a speech amid cheers of "Wendy! Wendy!"</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of naysayers out there," Greuel told a lively
crowd of supporters. "But boy, did we prove them wrong."</TE>

<HD>New Chapter in O.C. Judge's Race</HD>
<DH>Runoff: Officials must tally write-in ballots to see who
runs against jurist facing molestation charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flogged by talk radio DJs, caught in the glare of the national media
and abandoned at the ballot box by even his next-door neighbors, an
Orange County judge facing child-molestation charges reaped a meager
one-third of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline now faces an uphill battle to
keep his judgeship in a November runoff against a write-in candidate
whose identity won't be known for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday began a new chapter in the campaign, which pitted Kline,
who remains under house arrest, against 11 write-ins. Election
officials are preparing to hand-count 233,843 write-in ballots to
determine who will face the judge.</LD>
<TE>   Collectively, the write-in candidates nabbed 66% of the vote,
although none of the little-known challengers emerged as a
front-runner during the frenzied campaign. The field of judicial
hopefuls include a local councilman, a former judge and an attorney
now facing disbarment after being accused of withholding settlement
money won by a client.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials may be called upon to make tough "hanging
chad"-type decisions that created so much turmoil in Florida during
the 2000 presidential race. Orange County Registrar of Voters Rosalyn
Lever already has said that voters who wrote in a candidate's name
but forgot to punch the "write in" selection for candidates won't
have their votes count.</TE>
<TE>   However, ballots with write-in names that are close to but not an
exact match with one of the qualified candidates will still count if
the "intent is clear," said election office spokeswoman Terri Niccum.
Questionable votes will be decided on a case-by-case basis by
election officials, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can tell who it is cast for, we count it. A misspelling is
not going to kick out their vote," Niccum said. "We'll have observers
present, and I'm sure the candidates know they can come in and
observe the process."</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to call in at least 100 poll workers who will
work in teams of four to count the write-in ballots, a task that
could take until early April, Niccum said.</TE>
<TE>   That gives the 11 write-in candidates plenty of time to
second-guess their campaign strategies, and possibly stir up
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I never looked at my opponents as opponents. They were on the
same team as me," said write-in candidate Terese Oliver, a longtime
prosecutor from Anaheim. "Now, I'm looking at it, saying I should
have done this, I should have done that.... We're all doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, Kline's challengers were bonded by a common goal to
oust the judge, but now they face the prospect of a fierce political
firefight if questions arise about how the ballots are counted,
especially if it's a close race.</TE>
<TE>   "All 11 people stepped up to the plate without taking potshots at
one another," said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science
department at UC Irvine. "They had a common target. Now, we'll see
how eager they are to become a Superior Court judge."</TE>
<TE>   Local judicial races usually get scant attention, but this one has
become a national story, with outlets from a CNN talk show to "Good
Morning America" weighing in with coverage. Many focused on the
likelihood that Kline would be reelected because he was the only name
on the ballot. Even NBC's "Today" show host Katie Couric took a shot
at Kline on election day, calling him the "judge who now knows what
it's like to be on the other side of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Couric's quip was tame compared with abuse Kline has taken has
from the KFI radio talk show duo John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, who at
one point railed against the judge from a makeshift studio outside
Kline's home.</TE>
<TE>   Leading up to election day, the "John and Ken Show" broadcast
explicit excerpts from a diary allegedly taken from the Kline's
computer--including yearning passages about boys playing Little
League baseball.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Kobylt and Chiampou praised voters for "proving the
pundits wrong" and forcing Kline into a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned at the turnout against him, nearly a quarter of a
million votes against him. This is what he deserved," Kobylt said in
an interview Wednesday after his radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's challengers credited the crush of media attention for
their success in forcing Kline into a runoff election.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether there was 11 candidates or 300 candidates, we could not
have gotten the message out to 1.3 million voters without the help of
the media," said Gay Sandoval, a trial lawyer from Costa Mesa who
spent $23,000 on the race.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a Superior Court judge also gave the write-ins a major
boost when he ordered election officials to post signs at polling

third of the vote.</TE>

<TE>   On Nov. 9, two days after the filing deadline for judicial

<TE>   A federal judge ruled that Kline was a danger to children and
ordered him to remain at home and wear an ankle bracelet. He was
allowed, however, to vote Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>The Term Limits Door Slams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The voters' message was strong: Don't mess with term limits.
Proposition 45, to allow state lawmakers to serve up to four
additional years, lost in Tuesday's election 58% to 42%. The issue of
easing restrictive term limits--six years in the state Assembly and
eight in the Senate--is probably dead for years to come.</LD>
<LD>   That's regrettable because the constant turnover in the
Legislature, especially the Assembly, has wiped out institutional
memory and turned the speakership and committee chairmanships into
revolving doors.</LD>
<LD>   However, voters just as strongly favored  environmental
preservation and renewal by giving a 57% nod to Proposition 40, a
$2.6-billion parks, recreation, land and water bond issue. Backers
feared that the shadow of a huge budget deficit would hurt their
measure. Instead, approval of Proposition 40 restated Californians'
strong support for the environment, even in an election with low
turnout and a high relative proportion of conservative voters.</LD>
<TE>   Approval of Proposition 41, a $200-million bond issue to help
counties replace their  antiquated, chad-producing voting machines,
will be a key factor in helping counties meet a 2004 deadline to
accomplish this. Even with the ballot scandal in Florida, this
measure barely passed. Los Angeles County made the difference,
favoring the proposition by more than 56%.</TE>
<TE>   State term limits passed by a mere 2% margin in 1990, but they
have become a politically untouchable issue. Proposition 45 had
powerful support, from big businesses to organized labor. But the
initiative was hindered by its origin, not in the grass roots but in
the Legislature, where it was pushed by the Democratic Party. A
majority of voters obviously suspected this was nest-feathering by
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County voters had term limits proposals of their own
and gave a resounding yes. But Sheriff Lee Baca, who won reelection
handily, has challenged Charter Amendment A, which imposes 12-year
term limits for all elected county officials. The Board of
Supervisors reluctantly placed this measure on the ballot to settle a
lawsuit brought by supporters of a citizens initiative campaign. It,
along with a separate measure imposing limits only on the five
supervisors, won by double digits.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff claims that only the Legislature can put a measure on
the ballot restricting the sheriff's term of office. A trial judge
declined to strike the ballot measure before the election, but Baca
has appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, Tuesday's voter turnout was a lamentable 31%, not
counting absentee ballots. The range was probably unique in
California elections, from a low of 23% in Los Angeles County to an
astounding 73% in Merced County. Why Merced? It's part of Rep. Gary
A. Condit's district, and a strong majority of those voters rejected
Condit (D-Ceres) for his irresponsible behavior following the
disappearance of Washington  intern Chandra Levy. When there is an
issue on the ballot that grabs them, the voters will come.</TE>

<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion, more than a
decade ago, that breathing someone else's cigarette smoke can cause
cancer galvanized support for passage of tough anti-smoking laws in
California and nationwide. Let's hope a new study forging a clear
link between exposure to soot and lung cancer also prompts swift
political action, the most significant of which would be a reversal
by  President Bush of  his administration's unhealthy effort to
weaken air quality rules.</LD>
<LD>   The study, released Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn., finds that breathing air containing microscopic particles of
soot or dust over a long period greatly increases the risk of dying
of lung cancer or other lung or heart diseases. Many city residents
who inhale air laden with these particles face a risk of developing
fatal lung cancer similar to the risk faced by those living with a
smoker.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier studies have hinted at this link. But this latest
research, a team effort led by George D. Thurston at the New York
University School of Medicine, is far more compelling because it
follows a large sample--500,000 individuals--over a long period, 16
years.</LD>
<TE>   The tiny particles swirling over American cities have long
bedeviled air quality officials. They come from diesel trucks and
buses, farm equipment, power plant smokestacks, dust blowing off
unpaved roads and portable generators. Invisible to the naked eye,
these specks can float in the air for weeks and bypass the body's
defenses to lodge deep in the lungs. Until recent years,
lower-emitting diesel engines and traps to contain particle emissions
from older engines weren't commercially available.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the EPA adopted tougher standards for diesel engines,
requiring that they spew far fewer particles. But those rules don't
take effect until 2007. In the meantime, the Bush administration is
trying to block rules that require utilities to tighten pollution
controls when they modernize power plants.</TE>
<TE>   In California, there is both good news and bad. The state has some
of the highest particle pollution levels in the nation due in part to
the many valleys ringed by mountains that trap particle-laden haze.
On the other hand, officials with the South Coast Air Quality
Management District are now requiring local governments to gradually
replace their belching trash trucks, buses and street sweepers with
cleaner natural gas vehicles. State funds help underwrite the cost of
these new vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Lung cancer is often hideously painful and sometimes as terrifying
as drowning, as lungs eaten away by renegade tumors strain for a
taste of oxygen they're no longer able to process. The latest study
argues powerfully for redoubled federal action to control this cause
of disease, not for cutting corporate polluters more regulatory
slack.</TE>

<HD>A War Without Congress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As American troops battle Al Qaeda forces near the Afghan city of
Gardez, the war on terrorism is headed for trouble with Congress. The
Republicans are howling about what they see as unpatriotic behavior,
but Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) was right to complain
this past weekend that the administration failed to honor its
constitutional obligation to keep him and other officials in the
loop. This war is just, but it is still the responsibility of
Congress to fund it--a fact that the White House can't ignore
forever.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration's snubs of Congress have been frequent and
in-your-face. On Monday, the White House said Thomas J. Ridge would
not respond to a bipartisan request to testify before the Senate
Appropriations Committee about a $38-billion boost in spending for
his homeland defense agency. On Tuesday, House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) learned that the White House had failed
to inform him of a contingency plan briefing for congressional
leaders.</LD>
<TE>   Daschle, John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and other senators are bridling
at President Bush's vast expansion of foreign commitments, made
without consulting Congress and, they argue, without a clear game
plan. If Bush's popularity ratings are an indication, the public will
have little patience for any politician who seems ready to tiptoe
away from an aggressive offensive against the international
terrorists who remain so eager to slaughter Americans. The
administration may be right to send advisors  everywhere from Georgia
to Oman. But it does not have license to intervene anywhere, anytime,
without congressional permission.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has asked for $4.7 trillion over the next 10
years for the Pentagon, $600 billion more than was anticipated before
Sept. 11. The 2003 budget is supposed to be $379 billion, an increase
of $48 billion. Many of the administration's requests are reasonable.
It wants to improve housing for military personnel and their
families. It wants to up spending on aircraft for reconnaissance and
on chemical and biological defense. But the administration has
refused to junk such Cold War relics as the M-1 Abrams tank. It also
clings to missile defense, asking for $7.8 billion, even though a new
study by the Congressional Budget Office pegs the cost for a
full-scale system at $68 billion or more.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle has declared in a resolution that the Senate "stands
united with the president." But he's unwilling to hand the
administration a blank check for the war. As Congress asserts itself,
the administration will start realizing that this may not be the time
to put the military on a Slim-Fast diet but it's also not a time to
start binging. Congressional oversight of the war is not meddling. It
is a constitutional duty.</TE>

<HD>2-Term D.A. to Face Runoff</HD>
<DH>Election: Incumbent Paul Pfingst squares off against
Superior Court Judge Bonnie Dumanis in San Diego County. Third-place
finisher endorses Dumanis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Two-term Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst will face a runoff with
prosecutor-turned-Superior Court Judge Bonnie Dumanis after a
withering primary campaign in which three challengers accused Pfingst
of cronyism and mismanagement.</LD>
<LD>   Pfingst carried 41% of the vote, Dumanis 23%. In order to win, a
candidate had to get 50% of the vote. Former federal prosecutor
Michael Aguirre had 21%. Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine received
16%. Aguirre immediately endorsed Dumanis.</LD>
<LD>   Dumanis said the vote shows that "Paul Pfingst is very vulnerable"
because of allegations of mismanagement in his office.</LD>
<TE>   The Deputy District Attorneys Assn. has given Pfingst a vote of no
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst has attributed much of the criticism to a labor-management
struggle in which the association blames him for not doing more to
assist in its contract negotiations with the county Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Dumanis contended that Pfingst enjoyed a last-minute boost in the
polls by holding several news conferences to discuss the high-profile
kidnapping case of Danielle van Dam, 7, whose body was found in the
desert late last week.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst denied that he had held the news conferences for political
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, Pfingst was described as an aloof and
arrogant boss who denigrated the work of deputies who did not support
him politically and covered up the misdeeds of those who did.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst responded by saying that his office has the highest
conviction rate--92%--of any district attorney's office in California
and that his efforts to toughen prosecutions in rape cases, welfare
fraud and hate crimes have been lauded by outside agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "If we talk about my record, I'm fine," Pfingst said after
Tuesday's primary. "I hope we have a campaign that finally talks
about the record rather than a campaign that has tended to be
negative."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Pfingst ousted a six-term incumbent who had the backing
of the Deputy District Attorneys Assn. He was unopposed in 1998, but
a series of controversies left him politically weakened.</TE>

<HD>Incumbents' Support Is No Help for 2 Aides</HD>
<DH>Assembly: In Valley's 39th and 40th districts, Montanez and
Levine beat Capitol staffers Fuentes and Cherny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Endorsements from two influential Assembly incumbents were not enough
to boost their aides to primary victories in the San Fernando Valley.
Instead, the Democratic nominations--and, most likely, the Assembly
seats--went to a small-city mayor and a Capitol staffer whose
opponent turned sharply negative in the race's final week.</LD>
<LD>   By 11 percentage points, Lloyd Levine defeated Andrei Cherny in
Tuesday's Democratic primary for the 40th Assembly District, an area
of the southwest Valley with enough Democrats to secure the seat for
Levine in November's general election.</LD>
<LD>   Cherny, a 26-year-old regarded by many in his party as a
Wunderkind, boasted the endorsement of incumbent Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks), who was the Assembly's speaker and Cherny's boss.
But Levine, 32, seemed buoyed more by his work in Sacramento for
Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto), the support of several labor
unions and the connections of his father, a prominent political
consultant.</LD>
<TE>   In the northeast Valley's 39th Assembly District, San Fernando
Mayor Cindy Montanez, 28, trounced Yolanda Fuentes, 27, a staff
member for outgoing incumbent Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama
City). Beating Fuentes by nearly 2 to 1, Montanez said she is
confident she will defeat Republican real estate agent Ely De La Cruz
Ayao.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Democratic seat ... but we're still going to run an
effective campaign to make sure that we're victorious in November and
also to help out other Democrats," she said.</TE>
<TE>   (Cardenas, like Hertzberg, was barred by term limits from running
for a fourth two-year term. On Wednesday, he was still awaiting the
outcome of his close runoff in the Los Angeles City Council's 2nd
District.)</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Tuesday's Assembly results were disheartening to
incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   In the Antelope Valley, a safely Republican seat reaching into San
Bernardino County will almost certainly stay in the family--the wife
of incumbent George Runner, Sharon, beat three other Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Among the losers was Kern County Assemblyman Phil Wyman, who had
moved into the district to run.</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, television producer Robert Davenport
received 101 more votes than retired businessman Byron Bostic.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two Assembly districts confined to the San Fernando Valley,
Levine and Cherny's race to represent Canoga Park, Northridge,
Reseda, Van Nuys, Woodland Hills, West Hills and Winnetka was by far
the more competitive. The first-time candidates struggled to strike
differences on issues on which they mostly agreed. In its final days,
the contest became bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Cherny's campaign, in particular, produced hit pieces so nasty
that several top Democrats came out of neutrality to endorse Levine.
One Cherny mailer questioned Levine's pro-choice position on
abortion, using reasoning that Cherny's strategist admitted Tuesday
was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, crammed into a two-room campaign office in a
Van Nuys shopping center, Levine's supporters waited nearly four
hours for the tallies that indicated he had won.</TE>
<TE>   About one-quarter of the 40th District's registered Democrats
voted Tuesday in the party's primary. Levine won 55.5% of the 20,805
votes cast; Cherny took 44.5%. The lone Republican, business owner
Connie Friedman, received 12,101 votes in her party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said he is not counting out Friedman but will prepare for
November's general election as if he were already headed to
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to make wise use of that time and be willing to hit the
ground running from day one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Cherny's headquarters, the candidate conceded his loss just
after midnight in front of his staff, parents and friends from as far
away as Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath an admonition from Winston Churchill that "in this house
... we are not interested in the possibility of defeat," the former
White House speech writer said he was "so touched by the faith that
everybody has in me."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg called soon after to congratulate Levine, whom he had
previously dismissed in interviews as an unknown Sacramento staffer.</TE>
<TE>   The former Assembly speaker did not call from Cherny's
headquarters, however. Hertzberg had spent the evening in Merced,
cheering fellow assemblyman and congressional candidate Dennis
Cardoza to victory over besieged 18th District incumbent Gary Condit.</TE>

<HD>Voters Approve 2 'Big Box' Store Plans, Reject 2 Others</HD>
<DH>Retail: Ikea in East Palo Alto and a Wal-Mart proposal in
Calexico win. Home Depot loses in two cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two "big box" retail development plans were approved and two were
defeated this week in California cities where local officials left
the decision in the hands of voters.</LD>
<LD>   In East Palo Alto, a struggling municipality bordered by some of
Silicon Valley's most affluent neighborhoods, voters Tuesday narrowly
approved construction of an Ikea furniture store that was
controversial because some residents feared it would worsen traffic.
In the Imperial County town of Calexico, a measure backed by Wal-Mart
also carried the day.</LD>
<LD>   Home Depot was the big loser: A proposed store in Agoura Hills was
handcuffed by size limits approved by voters in that Los Angeles
County city, and a construction proposal in the Bay Area community of
Mountain View was resoundingly defeated, even though Home Depot sent
videotapes to 14,000 voter households seeking support.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, dueling campaign forces in Mountain View spent more than
$700,000 in what became the city's most expensive political battle.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a measure that would have allowed Home Depot to build
on the site of an abandoned department store lost in a
landslide--opposed by 65% of voters.</TE>
<TE>   "In a campaign such as this, the 'no' side has the definite
advantage," said campaign consultant Victor Ajlouny, who headed Home
Depot's Mountain View campaign. "All they have to do is confuse
voters. 'No' is the status quo, and that's a comfort zone for people.
And a quarter of a million dollars buys you a lot of confusion."</TE>
<TE>   Cities have increasingly turned to the ballot as a way of deciding
controversial planning measures including the so-called big box
retail stores, especially in California, where it is relatively easy
to bring initiatives to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   East Palo Alto has long struggled to stay afloat as other Bay Area
communities have prospered. The city's unemployment rate is about
double the countywide figure.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents worried that the giant store next to the Bayshore
Freeway would bring more congestion to a city already choked by
commuter traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But the project also offered the promise of about 550 jobs, and
guaranteed at least $1 million in annual revenue to the city for
eight years. Additional money for job training and city services has
also been pledged.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, East Palo Alto voters endorsed the plan to build the
300,000-square-foot Ikea store by a margin of just 75 votes out of
2,715 cast. An unknown number of absentee ballots remained to be
counted today, but proponents of the store expressed confidence that
their advantage would hold.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain View, just two towns away, is considered more affluent
but has suffered recently from the slowdown in high-technology
businesses. By some accounts the city's commercial vacancy rate
soared from less than 2% at the height of the boom to more than 25%
early this year.</TE>
<TE>   But the jobs and tax revenue offered by a Home Depot were not
enough to sway voters.</TE>
<TE>   "As communities become more affluent and more economically secure,
they reach a level where other kinds of values and concerns take
priority," said Rich DeLeon, a political science professor at San
Francisco State who studies community development. "As your basic
security needs are satisfied, new higher needs turn out to be
increasingly important motivators, such as aesthetics and other
concerns not related specifically to survival."</TE>
<TE>   The East Palo Alto campaign was decidedly low-tech--and far less
costly than Mountain View's--but no less contentious.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 20 years of politics, it's the hardest election I've ever
run," said Ikea's campaign consultant, Ed McGovern. "It seems like
every person in that town takes political issues very personally."</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills voters approved Measure H, a ballot initiative that
would prohibit construction of any retail building larger than 60,000
square feet. The issue arose from business owners and residents
ruffled by a preliminary proposal to build a Home Depot that would
include a 115,000-square-foot anchor store alongside a
24,000-square-foot garden center.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Denis Weber said Wednesday that he was disappointed because
voters would have to approve a new ballot measure before a developer
could plan to build a similar business. ''We're handcuffed,'' he
said, adding that the city needs the sales tax for police, fire, road
improvements and other city services.</TE>
<TE>   In Calexico, meanwhile, 65% of voters approved a measure backed by
Wal-Mart, overturning limits on the amount of floor space that large
retailers can devote to grocery sales.</TE>
<TE>   There is already a Wal-Mart in Calexico, and the corporation has
not decided whether to build a bigger store there.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to have our options available to us," said
Wal-Mart spokesman Peter Kanelos.</TE>

<HD>Uncounted Ballots May Pass Prop. Q</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $600-million bond measure to fund Los Angeles police and fire
facilities appears short of the two-thirds vote needed to pass, but
thousands of outstanding ballots must be counted before it can be
considered defeated, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 356,849 votes cast in Tuesday's election, Proposition Q
garnered 66.61%, just .05% short of the 66.66% needed.</LD>
<LD>   The slim margin left little room for gloating by the taxpayer and
homeowner groups that opposed the measure as an unnecessary tax
increase, or by the city officials who touted it as crucial to public
safety.</LD>
<TE>   Both groups, however, were cautiously optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still holding out hope," said City Council President Alex
Padilla, who co-chaired the Proposition Q campaign. "There are
several thousand votes that have yet to be counted by the county. We
are hoping there is enough there to put us over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Without declaring the measure dead, Jon Coupal, president of the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., said, "This was a public-safety bond
in the wake of 9/11. If it fails, I think it speaks to a higher
degree of sophistication on behalf of voters than proponents of
Proposition Q figured. Apparently they thought anything with the
words 'public safety' on it was going to pass."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, whose bid
for a second term Hahn refused to back, made a rare joint appearance
last month to announce their support for the measure. City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who supported the measure, said,
"This is one occasion where [Hahn and Parks] stood together," and
called the 66.61% favorable vote "overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office was tallying
the outstanding, or provisional ballots, Wednesday afternoon. These
include absentee ballots received at the polls or in the mail,
damaged ballots and ballots cast by voters whose eligibility has yet
to be determined by the registrar's office.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 63,000 absentee voter ballots by Tuesday night," said
Grace Chavez, a spokeswoman for the registrar-recorder's office.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said her office should have "a good feel" for the number of
provisional votes by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to certify the
election April 2.</TE>

<HD>School Bonds Need Matching Funds</HD>
<DH>Education: Some of the construction projects hinge on a
statewide measure to be decided in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Orange County school officials celebrate the passage of more than
$730 million in construction bonds, their prospects for matching
funds from Sacramento to fulfill their building dreams is less
certain.</LD>
<LD>   Although the local bond measures will go a long way to help
modernize local campuses and build new schools, some of the projects
are contingent on California voters approving a statewide bond
measure, likely $13billion, in November.</LD>
<LD>   "The work will be done," said Patricia Godfrey, assistant
superintendent of business services for Fullerton School District,
which passed a $49.7-million measure. "It is just the extent of work
that will get done. [The state money] will enhance what we will be
able to do."</LD>
<TE>   Godfrey said her district will move forward with building an
elementary school in the Amerige Heights housing development and
making improvements in all of its 19 campuses. The district is also
eligible for $17 million in state matching funds for additional
modernization projects at six of its campuses should the state
measure pass.</TE>
<TE>   For Anaheim City School District, which passed $111 million in
local bonds and hopes to receive $120 million to $130 million more
from the state, the matching funds will mean the difference between
building five new schools or perhaps only three. And in the North
Orange County Community College District, officials hope to get $35
million in state funds to augment $239 million in local bonds. The
state money will be needed to complete two new libraries and learning
centers at its Cypress and Fullerton campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We've passed statewide bonds in the past," said Donna Hatchette
of the college district.</TE>
<TE>   Californians have passed 11 of 12 statewide school construction
bond measures since 1982, with the only exception failing by less
than 1% in 1994. And unlike local bonds, state measures need only a
simple majority to pass.</TE>
<TE>   However, state officials also predict there will be more demand
for matching funds since Proposition 39, passed in 2000, lowered
required votes for local bond measures from two-thirds majority to
55%.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 50 of 57 school districts and 13 of 14 community
college districts passed bond measures Tuesday under the new 55%
guideline. Of the districts that made it, 39 school districts and 10
college districts would have failed under a two-thirds majority
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County for example, all the bonds passed thanks to the
lower vote threshold: from Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School
District's $102 million measure, which got the highest percentage
with 65.7%, to North Orange County Community College's measure, which
got the lowest, 57.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The Placentia-Yorba Linda district is now eligible for $115million
in state matching funds. The district will move forward with plans
for two elementary schools, one middle school and one high school,
but if state funds are not forthcoming some of the modernization
projects at its existing campuses will not be completed, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Denis Fitzgerald, director of the Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining
their Environment, which opposed some of the local measures,
complained about the new system.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, the Democrats and the state lowered the rate to
55%," said Fitzgerald, "and raised the taxes for the people of
Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   The local bonds will be repaid with increases in property taxes.
State bond measures are repaid from the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Beach City School District, with its successful
$30-million bond measure, would qualify it for $16.7 million in
matching funds. And Anaheim Union High School District, which passed
a $132-million measure, would qualify for $125 million in state
money.</TE>

<HD>Agoura Hills Bans 'Big Boxes'</HD>
<DH>Development: After apparent narrow defeat, opponents of
Measure H say prohibition of large stores will hurt economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With some absentee ballots still to be counted, Agoura Hills voters
appeared to have narrowly approved an initiative that prohibits
construction of any retail building larger than 60,000 square feet.</LD>
<LD>   Measure H won by 120 votes out of about 4,600 counted Tuesday.
City Clerk Carol Tubelis said election workers today will begin
tallying an unknown number of absentee ballots dropped off at the
polls.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if it will affect results," Tubelis said Wednesday.
She estimated that Los Angeles County officials will have a final
count by Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The measure arose from opposition to plans to build a Home Depot
store on Agoura Road, near the city's most prominent point, Ladyface
Mountain. Passage of the initiative effectively kills that project.</TE>
<TE>   All five City Council members opposed the measure, saying it was
too restrictive and bad for the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're handcuffed," Mayor Denis Weber said Wednesday. "Who is
going to want to take the risk to build?"</TE>
<TE>   Measure H supporters said the election results proved that big-box
stores did not belong in Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't fit with our city," said Michael Gallop, a member
of Citizens for Responsible Growth, which promoted Measure H.
Businesses that would have competed with the Home Depot also backed
the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the 11.4-acre Home Depot project call for a
115,000-square-foot anchor store and 24,000-square-foot garden
center. The development would generate an estimated $500,000 in sales
tax revenue in the first year of operation and more in later years,
Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our budget is pretty bare-bones," said Weber, suggesting that the
council might have to enact some city taxes. "Measure H is going to
hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   The developer of the Home Depot project, Dan Selleck of Selleck
Development Group in Westlake Village, declined to comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We will wait until we have the final results," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said Thom Bancroft, co-chair of Taxpayers
Opposing Special Treatment, a group that fought Measure H. He said
voters were misled to believe the initiative only applied to the Home
Depot proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never able to free ourselves from the misconception," he
said.</TE>

<HD>'Big Brush of Scandal' Sweeps Away Boyd</HD>
<DH>City Council: Seal Beach official says ongoing criminal
probe is the reason he finished third in race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite efforts by the candidates to downplay a criminal
investigation into Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd, his troubles
appeared to be the key factor in his defeat in Tuesday's election.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, who is being investigated by the district attorney's office
for allegedly voting on the purchase of a trailer park while having a
business connection with the owner, came in third in a field of four
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   "I got painted with this big brush of scandal that soured people.
Plain and simple," Boyd said.</LD>
<TE>   Businesswoman Beverly Pearce was the top vote-getter with just
over 40%. Charles Antos, a county planner, received about 28% of the
vote. Boyd got 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Pearce and Antos will face each other in a runoff election May 14.
The winner will be sworn in at a council meeting May 21.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd, 33, who has yet to be charged with any crime, said the
investigation was clearly the reason he lost the race for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are looking into links between Boyd and Richard Hall,
who bought the Seal Beach Trailer Park for $2.9 million in 1998 and
sold it two years later to a nonprofit group for $7.4 million. The
sale was backed by city financing. Boyd abstained from votes
regarding the trailer park purchase four times but voted on the
matter at least seven times without disclosing that he worked for
Hall on at least two other real estate ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people believe you are guilty until proven innocent," Boyd
said. "I'm not bitter. I've enjoyed my time in public service and
maybe this was a blessing in disguise. It's given me time to focus on
other priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his colleagues on the council believe Boyd was the
architect of his own undoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for him," Councilman Paul Yost said. "It's a
difficult thing when you're elected to public office. It's not about
[an individual] in that seat, it's about the district and the
community ... and I think Mr. Boyd got into a direction that it was
more about Mr. Boyd than it was about the community."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said he plans to take some time off after the new councilman
takes over in May.</TE>
<TE>   "I need that," he said. "And I'm going to reassess what my
priorities are. I'm going to stay active in the community. I care
about Seal Beach and I care about Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he is not soured on politics, he complained that
"small-town politics is just brutal. Anybody who wants to run for
higher office is best advised not to run into that fray."</TE>

<LD>A plan to encourage energy-saving and environmentally friendly
designs in new college buildings was approved Wednesday by Los
Angeles Community College District trustees.</LD>
<LD>   The "sustainable building" or "green-building" plan will guide the
district's use of $1.2 billion in construction funds from Proposition
A, a measure passed by voters last year. The money is expected to pay
for 40 to 50 buildings. Construction on the first projects at the
district's nine campuses is expected to begin in about a year.</LD>
<LD>   The building plan encourages construction with recycled materials
and designs that limit the consumption of electricity and water.</LD>

<LD>Defense attorneys Wednesday continued presenting witnesses who said
the two dogs that fatally mauled a San Francisco woman were usually
well-behaved.</LD>
<LD>   "I never saw them being aggressive at anyone," said Angelos
Prongos, owner of Mayflower Market.</LD>
<LD>   The manager of Left at Albuquerque, Michael Beachnau, said the
dogs' owners, defendants Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, took them
to the restaurant regularly.</LD>
<TE>   Three veterinarians testified that the dogs did not cause any
problems while being treated.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Whipple, 33, who was the defendants' neighbor, died in
January 2001 after being attacked by the two Presa Canario dogs in
the hallway of her apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller is on trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court for
second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and keeping a
mischievous dog. Her husband, Noel, faces the latter two charges.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday approved a $4.3-million
settlement with John A. Francois, who alleged that he was subjected
to racial harassment and discrimination as the first African American
on the Los Angeles Police Department's elite bomb squad.</LD>
<LD>   After Francois was awarded $5.34 million by a Superior Court jury
in October 2000, the city vowed to challenge the verdict.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's settlement was approved in closed session, and city
officials declined to comment under terms of the agreement, a
spokeswoman said. A phone call to Francois' attorney was not

<LD>With a court battle looming, the Glendale City Council unanimously
rejected plans for a 572-home mountainside subdivision after a
marathon hearing that lasted until 5 a.m. Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the Oakmont View V project hugged, cried and cheered
when the council denied the proposal to build the luxury homes in the
Verdugo Mountains. The project has been debated for more than a
decade.</LD>

<HD>Political Link May Have Been Liability</HD>
<DH>Dynasties: Kimiko Burton's father heads the state Senate,
but she lost S.F. race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Adachi's trouncing of Kimiko Burton, the heir to a family
political dynasty, in a bitter race for San Francisco public defender
was seen Wednesday as the triumph of an independent over the machine.</LD>
<LD>   Although the influence of state Senate leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco) over the race was exercised out of fatherly love, it
appeared to have backfired, possibly costing his daughter the
contest.</LD>
<LD>   Adachi, the former chief attorney in the public defender's office
who cast himself as the underdog fighting the Burton clan, says the
voters' message was clear:</LD>
<TE>   "It says that money, power and political influence won't always
carry the day," said Adachi, 42, who spoke Tuesday night from his
campaign headquarters, where he celebrated with hundreds of
supporters and a mambo band.</TE>
<TE>   "There is room for an independent person who's got experience to
be elected to office."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the incumbent Burton would be--is already--a better
public defender than Adachi may have been overshadowed by voters'
perception that her father's influence got her appointed to the
office and brought her thousands of dollars. Mayor Willie Brown
appointed Burton last year to fill the term of the public defender
who left the post.</TE>
<TE>   Kimiko Burton raised direct contributions of more than half a
million dollars--more than twice that of her opponent and largely
from outside the city. It's been estimated that another half-million
was raised in so-called soft money.</TE>
<TE>   "I think voters initially looked at this race as the type of
politics they wanted to reject," said David Binder, a San Francisco
political pollster. "I think the race never really was about who
could do a better job of running the office. The race was about
sending a statement to Willie Brown and John Burton, saying: 'We
don't like politics as usual.'"</TE>
<TE>   Both Adachi and Burton raised sums of money unprecedented for this
generally low-key race, then said they didn't intend to spend it all.
But voters may have found the amount of money raised by Burton, in
particular, to be distasteful, saidBinder: "There's a bit of a
backlash against big-money campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   Just being John Burton's daughter may have worked against Kimiko,
Binder said. "I think Kim Burton had a lot of supporters and fans,"
he said. It was her father they didn't like, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Binder even speculated that there was an odd coalition of
progressives and Republicans who voted for Adachi, allied in their
dislike of the senior Burton.</TE>
<TE>   And the demographics of the city are changing, said UC Berkeley
political scientist Bruce Cain. More recent arrivals to the city feel
no loyalty to the name. "You've got people coming in with new
expectations who don't know Burton and Brown from a hole in the
wall," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Cain said, he thinks the city's residents are
beginning to nurture a "resentment of Sacramento politics brought to
the local levels."</TE>
<TE>   Kimiko Burton said the election had less to do with her
qualifications for the job than with her opponent's negative
campaign. Adachi emphasized that Burton's father had cajoled hundreds
of people into giving her thousands of dollars and objected to
Brown's appointment of her, which Adachi characterized as a favor to
her father.</TE>
<TE>   (Brown denies the appointment was a favor to John Burton, whom he
has known since college.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think we ran a good campaign," said Kimiko Burton, 37, who was
at work in her public defender's office Wednesday morning. "But
people chose to buy into the negative campaigning and focus on the
fact that [John Burton] is my father and I was a mayoral appointee.
There are mayoral appointees all the time."</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, John Burton was angry Wednesday at how Adachi had
criticized his support of his daughter and how the media had focused
on this instead of her record in city government.</TE>
<TE>   "Did they use the fact that I raised money for my daughter? Yeah.
Did they write about the fact that the mayor appointed my daughter?
Yeah.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wanted to hear anything besides Willie Brown appointed her
and she was my daughter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Burton scoffed at the idea that he strong-armed people into
supporting his daughter with contributions that could not, by law,
top $500.</TE>
<TE>   "You think $500 is going to mean anything?" he said. "I got $500
[for Kimiko Burton] from [entertainment magnate] Haim Saban. Haim
Saban gives millions to everybody. You think he's going to ingratiate
himself with me with $500? Give me a break."</TE>

<HD>Howard Cannon, 90; Quiet but Powerful Nevada Senator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Howard W. Cannon, an unpretentious but rough-and-tumble Westerner and
decorated World War II aviator who served Nevada for 24 years in the
U.S. Senate, died Wednesday at a hospice of congestive heart failure.
He was 90 and had been in ill health for some time.</LD>
<LD>   During his four Senate terms starting in 1958, the Democrat
pursued political wheeling and dealing as a quiet, understated art,
shrewdly protecting Las Vegas' tourism and military industries while
holding powerful posts in the Commerce, Rules and Armed Services
committees.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the most underappreciated political figure in recent
Nevada history," said Richard Bryan, a former Nevada governor who
represented the state in the Senate from 1989 until last year. "He
was a major player in Washington, even though he was not
charismatically gifted. He was modest to the point of being shy,
which belied a life of great adventure."</LD>
<TE>   Among his political successes: shepherding laws that deregulated
the trucking and airline industries, which not only brought a sea
change to those businesses but also boosted Las Vegas as a tourism
destination thanks to cheaper air fares.</TE>
<TE>   He promoted the growth of Las Vegas in other ways too--by
capturing federal aid for local highway construction and marshaling
funds for nearby Nellis Air Force Base, even when it was a chronic
target for closure. Today it is home of the Air Force's Air Warfare
Center, which pits fighter pilots against one another in mock
dogfights.</TE>
<TE>   Cannon helped ensure Las Vegas' growth in another way, helping win
federal appropriations for pipelines so that thirsty Las Vegas Valley
could tap Colorado River water from nearby Lake Mead and no longer
rely exclusively on the desert aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   His allegiance to Las Vegas was payback to voters; he was the
state's first senator elected from southern Nevada, as the weight of
the state's population was shifting to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "He proved a master at protecting and encouraging key components
of Nevada's economy," said historian Michael Green. "He was a very
effective member of the Senate club."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) called Cannon "a natural leader, a
patriot, and a hero to the state of Nevada ... a great role model."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon lost reelection to the Senate in 1982, blindsided by
Republican Chic Hecht, a Las Vegas businessman who aligned himself
with Ronald Reagan. Hecht served only one term, and was succeeded by
Bryan.</TE>
<TE>   Many Nevadans today rue Cannon's defeat; Congress in 1987 passed
legislation naming Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the only prospective
site to be developed as a repository for highly radioactive nuclear
waste. President Bush approved the site last month.</TE>
<TE>   "If he hadn't been defeated, we wouldn't be facing Yucca Mountain
today," said Mike O'Callaghan, Nevada's governor from 1971 to '79.
"He would have stopped Yucca at the committee. He had that kind of
power."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon was born in St. George, Utah, in 1912, the only son of
Walter Cannon, who was a teacher, banker and farmer, and his wife,
Leah. As a youngster, he became an expert cowhand on his parents'
ranch, riding horseback in his first job as a newspaper delivery boy.</TE>
<TE>   While attending college in Arizona, he mastered the saxophone and
organized a small orchestra that booked gigs at local towns and on a
cruise ship. Infatuated with flying, he used some of his money to
purchase a biplane--and was again delivering newspapers, this time
dropping bundles from the air and aiming for desert brush to cushion
their fall.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his law degree in 1937 and opening a law office back
home, he enlisted in the Utah National Guard and soon found himself
assigned to the Army Air Corps with the outbreak of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He spent 20 months overseas and in 1944 was shot down behind enemy
lines in Holland, escaping capture for 42 days before rejoining
Allied troops.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, with multiple decorations as a retired major
general, he opened a Las Vegas law firm, and in 1949 was elected Las
Vegas city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   He was defeated in a run for Congress in 1956, but won election to
the Senate two years later, on the strength of labor support and his
war record.</TE>
<TE>   A champion of all things Nevadan, he voted against the grain in
1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson was angry that Southern
Democrats had turned to filibuster to block a vote on his civil
rights bill. Nevada politicians had long aligned themselves with
Southern Democrats, whom they in turn counted on to protect Nevada's
gambling industry.</TE>
<TE>   But at Johnson's request, Cannon, himself a civil rights champion,
voted for cloture, clearing the way for the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.</TE>
<TE>   That fall, Cannon faced tough reelection competition in Paul
Laxalt, Nevada's popular Republican lieutenant governor. Cannon won
by a scant 48 votes, and Laxalt refused to run against Cannon again,
winning election instead 10 years later, replacing then-Sen. Alan
Bible, a Democrat who retired.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Cannon pursued his love of
aircraft and insisted on flying prototype aircraft before voting
funds for their development. Among the aircraft he piloted: the F-14,
F-15 and F-111.</TE>
<TE>   A consummate politician, Cannon used his clout with discretion.
"He had no national pretensions and wasn't a showboat," Bryan said.
"He was extraordinarily competent and a hard worker who knew how to
get things done as an inside player, so his colleagues were not
threatened by him."</TE>
<TE>   He was sensitive to the individual needs of his constituents. "He
was always looking out for the little guy with problems," said Sara
Denton, who managed his Las Vegas office from 1970 until 1982. "No
matter how trivial someone's problem was, the senator wanted us to
take care of him--whether it was a veteran, a senior citizen or just
someone having difficulty with the government bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't a glad-hander," she said. "He was just a shy, humble
and very caring person."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon is survived by his wife, Dorothy, children Nancy Downey and
Alan Cannon, and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending with Palm Mortuary in Las Vegas.</TE>

<LD>The "Rocky" theme song blared as the newly crowned Republican champ
bounded onto the stage, waving his arms, pointing to cheering fans
and grinning.</LD>
<LD>   Always the grin. I finally figured out whose grin this reminds me
of: the late U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston's. Like Bill Simon, Cranston was
an incessant, beaming grinner while working a crowd.</LD>
<LD>   But that's neither here nor there--just one similarity between two
very diverse politicians whose abilities to connect with voters were
underestimated.</LD>
<TE>   "Rocky" has been a hokey song for politicians ever since the movie
came out 26 years ago. But Tuesday night, in a hotel ballroom near
L.A. airport, the music matched the candidate perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon--a real-life Rocky Balboa underdog, a political
newcomer who had never run for office--was 14 points behind in late
January, according to the Times Poll. He won the GOP gubernatorial
nomination by 18 points--a 32-point turnaround in less than six
weeks. Based on the Field Poll, it was a 51-point turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   All of which prompted this dry comment in the ballroom from
political operative Sean Walsh, spokesman for Secretary of State Bill
Jones and, previously, for then-Gov. Pete Wilson:</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the candidates in this race, Bill Simon had the least to
do with his own success."</TE>
<TE>   Simon ran a good race. He listened to his coaches, kept cool,
stayed focused and never stumbled. But practically everybody I've
talked to outside Simon's own campaign agrees with Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Recapping this historic contest, by candidate:</TE>
<TE>   * The Democratic governor won his first-ever Republican primary.
With $9 million in TV attack ads, running from Jan. 25 until election
day, Gov. Gray Davis trashed the potential November challenger he
feared most--centrist Richard Riordan--and swung the election to
conservative Simon.</TE>
<TE>   It had never happened before in modern California.</TE>
<TE>   There's folklore--a myth--that Gov. Pat Brown influenced the 1966
Republican primary and helped nominate Ronald Reagan. It is true that
Democrat Brown mostly feared Reagan's GOP rival, former San Francisco
Mayor George Christopher. But Brown merely leaked one
anti-Christopher story to a national columnist. Any help that gave
Reagan was minuscule. Besides, he didn't need any. Reagan won the
primary by 34 points.</TE>
<TE>   * Riordan was an unwitting co-conspirator in his own demise. The
Davis attack ads knocked him off balance, and he made the wrong moves
trying to right himself. Moreover, he attempted to run a general
election campaign that ignored and insulted the Republican Party's
conservative base.</TE>
<TE>   The core of Riordan's problem was that he did not understand the
two-party political system. The former L.A. mayor's late-in-life
career had been spent entirely in nonpartisan local politics, and in
a city that was heavily Democratic. He did not comprehend the
delicate handling required of volatile Republican primary voters.</TE>
<TE>   He needed one seasoned, trusted campaign strategist--</TE>
<TE>   somebody in charge. Nobody seemed to be.</TE>
<TE>   That job was offered to Wilson's longtime strategist, George
Gorton. He looked around at a menagerie of unorganized hangers-on,
saw looming disaster and said no thanks.</TE>
<TE>   * Jones furnished former Gov. George Deukmejian, whose attack on
Riordan for aiding and abetting Democrats was devastating. When
Deukmejian declared in a TV ad that he could never vote for
Riordan--even over a Democrat--it was like pouring jet fuel on the
fire ignited by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   So Simon didn't win the election as much as Riordan lost it. And
Riordan lost it, in large part, because of poundings by Davis and
Duke.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to take anything away from Simon. He played it smart
and cautious--yet was bold enough to run.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, the wealthy investor talked about running for state
treasurer, or maybe lieutenant governor or attorney general.
Consultant Sal Russo convinced him his best shot was governor,
because Davis would be vulnerable--energy, spending, schools--and
without a strong GOP gubernatorial candidate, Simon couldn't win a
lower office anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, friends of Riordan tried to coax Simon out of the
race, tacitly offering to support him for another office--then or in
the future. But Simon liked his chances.</TE>
<TE>   He got a break when his mentor, former New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, became a national star after the terrorist attacks. Simon
took full advantage of that, stumping the state with the new
political hero and drawing attention to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Only two months ago, Simon was being dismissed by most politicos
and pundits, including me. No more.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus in the ballroom seemed to be that Simon's odds of
beating Davis--"Apollo Creed"--are 3 in 10. "Rocky" will gladly take
those odds.</TE>

<HD>8 Accused of Trafficking in Stolen Cargo</HD>
<DH>Crime: The arrests are part of a four-year multi-agency
effort aimed at denting multimillion-dollar regional problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sting aimed at cargo theft rings, the FBI arrested eight people
Wednesday suspected of trafficking in stolen car speakers, tea, men's
suits, CD-ROMs and luggage, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   They are among 16 people indicted by the four-year sting effort
dubbed "Operation Helping Hand," which worked out of a rented
Paramount warehouse, said Thom Mrozek of the U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Essentially, undercover officers from the FBI, the California
Highway Patrol and the Long Beach Police Department befriended
suspected members of two theft rings and promoted the warehouse as an
ideal place to store stolen freight, Mrozek said.</LD>
<TE>   Cargo theft rings typically track cargo that leaves Los Angeles
Harbor and often steal the truck and the cargo container it carries.
They then store it for a fee in warehouses run by cooperating thieves
until they can sell it at cut-rate prices on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   "Cargo theft is a huge problem in the Los Angeles region, where it
accounts for a sixth of the problem nationwide," said FBI spokeswoman
Laura Bosley. "We have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California, in fact, is the nation's capital for cargo
theft.</TE>
<TE>   Thieves in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties steal an estimated $2 million worth of goods each
day, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, a record loss of nearly $600 million was reported, FBI
officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   The first indictment charges nine defendants linked to a ring
allegedly led by Benjamin "Benji" Mercado, 29, of Burbank, who is
accused of using a blowtorch to cut the pin locks off cargo
containers loaded with Ricardo of Beverly Hills luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Eight other suspected members of the so-called Mercado crew
arranged for the storage and sale of merchandise, including $24,000
worth of men's suits, $585,000 worth of sport coats and $120,952
worth of luggage, the indictment alleges. The crew also used the
warehouse to store $100,000 worth of Lipton tea, which they hoped to
sell for about $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Two other suspects are still being sought.</TE>
<TE>   The second indictment accuses Darnell Forest Williams, 40, of
Cerritos and Billy Ray Davenport, 49, of Los Angeles of stealing
Kenwood brand stereo components worth $445,508, and 18,000 CD-ROMs
worth about $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 28, 1999, Williams delivered 26 pallets loaded with stereo
components to the warehouse, and told two undercover officers to be
sure and wipe their fingerprints off the truck he was driving,
according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Davenport paid the undercover officers more than
$5,000 in cash for storing the stolen items, the indictment charges.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the defendants is charged with conspiracy, grand theft and
illegal possession of stolen interstate and foreign shipments, and
faces up to 10 years in federal prison, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A year and a half ago, Operation Helping Hand broke a separate
cargo theft ring led by Juan Luis Villalobos.</TE>
<TE>   Villalobos' gang targeted trucks, truck yards and distribution
centers across the West, authorities said, and returned to Los
Angeles to fence the merchandise through a thriving domestic and
international black market.</TE>
<TE>   From late 1998 to early 2000, the 44-year-old Mexican national and
his gang stole an estimated $7 million worth of sleeping bags,
electrical products, computers, athletic shoes, cereal, basketballs,
and tires, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   As is typical, the merchandise was offered to mom-and-pop stores
for as little as 25% of its retail value.</TE>
<TE>   Villalobos pleaded guilty to the thefts.</TE>

<HD>Mental Hospital Forced to Close</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: Financial troubles are blamed for
shuttering of Anacapa by the Sea. About 120 lose jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the two remaining private psychiatric hospitals in Ventura
County closed Wednesday, putting about 120 employees on the street
and triggering the emergency transfer of nearly 60 patients to other
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Housed in a 50-year-old building in Port Hueneme, Anacapa by the
Sea was squeezed out of business by rising costs and falling
insurance reimbursements, said Charles D. Morris, the hospital's
president and chief executive. "We were caught in the trap of managed
care and the health economy," he said. "We tried our best, but we
didn't have enough room to turn it around."</LD>
<LD>   Employees plan to gather this morning for a farewell on the
hospital's front lawn. On Wednesday, some were tearful, particularly
veterans of Camarillo State Hospital, the mental health institution
that closed in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Anacapa's closure leaves Vista del Mar in Ventura as the county's
only free-standing private psychiatric hospital. It will make even
tougher the plight of families trying to find local treatment for
relatives with acute emotional problems, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County contracted with Anacapa for treatment of mentally
ill people referred by its crisis teams. However, the hospital's
closure will not significantly strain the public mental health
system, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anacapa provided good care and we're sad to see them close," said
Dr. David Gudeman, director of the county's behavioral health
department. "But overall, we probably have adequate capacity."
Anacapa had financial problems for years, Morris said. However, its
crisis heated up at the end of last year when the lease on its
five-acre property ended. Since then, Anacapa has fallen even further
behind in its rent.</TE>
<TE>   Between back rent and other debts, Morris said, Anacapa has
plunged several million dollars into the red. In some cases, the
hospital spent twice as much on treatment as it collected from
insurers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last Friday, the hospital's bank accounts were seized, ending the
long-running financial drama.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us our time was up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Morris relayed the news to his employees and to the
families of the hospital's 59 patients. Seven patients still await
placement elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the families were pretty understanding," he said. "There
was a huge amount of sadness."</TE>
<TE>   Patients in Anacapa's locked wards typically stayed for 10 to 12
days, often being placed there against their will. An affiliated
program, Steps, has about 30 voluntary patients and focuses largely
on substance abuse. Morris said he hopes to keep Steps open even as
he files for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   What will become of the property is unclear. According to Greg
Brown, Port Hueneme's community development director, the hospital's
owners have planned to sell it for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who has run the hospital for 11 years, said a city
official told him that he hoped the building would be torn down and
that the land would be developed for homes.</TE>
<TE>   Anacapa is only the latest psychiatric hospital to be shuttered.
In 1996, Thousand Oaks' 80-bed Charter Hospital also was closed for
financial reasons.</TE>

<HD>Orange County D.A. Lowers the Boom After Election Win</HD>
<DH>Clashes: Rackauckas transfers or demotes some of his

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas handily won a
bitter reelection showdown, he transferred or demoted some of his
loudest critics amid calls for unity in the district attorney's
office.</LD>
<LD>   The election fight between Rackauckas and Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally
Wade was the most bitter district attorney race in recent memory,
dividing many in the office. Wade focused his challenge by accusing
his boss of interfering in several cases involving campaign
contributors and friends--charges Rackauckas has denied.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, the accusations appeared not to sway voters, who gave
Rackauckas basically the same margin of victory--62% to 38%--that he
had four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   While many prosecutors hoped that election day would bring an end
to the infighting that has plagued the office for more than a year,
the rhetoric showed little signs of cooling Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas immediately transferred Wade, as well as some of his
most outspoken supporters, to the office's family-support division.
On July 1, that division will be broken off from the district
attorney's office and become part of a state agency. Among those
moved were veteran prosecutors Guy Ormes and Jane Shade.</TE>
<TE>   "This must be his idea of good management," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas did not respond to an interview request. His chief
assistant, Chuck Middleton, issued a statement that said:
"Reassignments in the office are always done in order to ensure that
the best needs of the office are met."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Rackauckas sent two other prosecutors, including
veteran Bob Gannon, to the family-support unit.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon supervised a prosecutor who filed a consumer-protection
lawsuit last year against a company owned by billionaire developer
George Argyros, a Rackauckas contributor who is now ambassador to
Spain. Rackauckas ordered the lawsuit retracted, saying he wanted to
continue negotiations with Argyros' firm. After his actions were
criticized, Rackauckas withdrew from the case and handed it to the
state attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Some Rackauckas supporters expressed hope that the transfers will
begin a healing process at the office.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nasty campaign, with a lot of mudslinging by Mr. Wade's
supporters," Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Flory said. "If the office is
going to come together, it doesn't do any good to have any
malcontents. We need to act together as a team again."</TE>
<TE>   The job transfers came the day after Rackauckas cruised to
reelection. Wade accused his boss of lacking integrity, saying the
Argyros case was one of several in which Rackauckas used his
influence to benefit political allies.</TE>
<TE>   A union representing county prosecutors voted to endorse Wade, the
first time in its history the union chose not to endorse an
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas in turn accused Wade of incompetence, and his campaign
suggested Wade wasn't up to the job of district attorney. Rackauckas
said turmoil in the office was caused by his critics who dredged up
false accusations against him.</TE>
<TE>   Wade's criticism did not resonate with voters. A Times poll
conducted two weeks before the election found that just 7% of likely
voters felt Rackauckas had ethical problems.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before the election, Wade's former campaign manager
held a news conference to accuse the candidate of campaign violations
and announce her support for Rackauckas. And Rackauckas noted that
crime had declined dramatically during his term, a drop he credited
to his emphasis on gang prosecutions.</TE>

<LD>A day after Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas handily won a
bitter reelection showdown, he transferred or demoted some of his
loudest critics amid calls for unity in the district attorney's
office.</LD>
<LD>   The election fight between Rackauckas and Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally
Wade was the most bitter district attorney race in recent memory,
dividing many in the office. Wade focused his challenge by accusing
his boss of interfering in several cases involving campaign
contributors and friends--charges Rackauckas has denied.</LD>

rope, but he just didn't do that," said Christian Collet, a visiting
professor at UC Irvine and an expert on public opinion polling. "It's
the challenger's responsibility to bring the electorate's attention
to these issues. This was a systemic, top-to-bottom failure by the
Wade campaign to make a strong case against the incumbent."</TE>

<HD>After Divisive Campaign for D.A., Totten Promises Healing</HD>
<DH>Election: He also pledges a smooth transition as he takes
over from Bradbury. Bamieh mulls future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riding a virtual tidal wave of community support, Ventura County's
newly elected district attorney pledged Wednesday to heal the wounds
opened during a divisive campaign and promised a smooth transition
when his predecessor steps down after nearly three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Totten, who will replace retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury in January, won an overwhelming victory over Ron Bamieh on
Tuesday night in the most expensive local race on record.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign pitted a seasoned administrator against a
well-financed trial lawyer who disagreed strongly about how the
prosecutor's office should be run.</LD>
<TE>   But in the end, voters in the law-and-order county, routinely
ranked as the safest in the West, decided they didn't need change.</TE>
<TE>   "The electorate is wise," Totten said. "They recognize that they
have good law enforcement in this community and that they have a
criminal justice system that, while not perfect, is working to keep
the community safe."</TE>
<TE>   With all the precincts counted, Totten walked away with 64% of the
vote despite being outspent by his opponent 2 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   He won every precinct in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark,
Camarillo, Ventura, Ojai, Fillmore and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Of 619 precincts, Bamieh picked up only 14, mostly in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The results suggested that Bamieh's million-dollar campaign did
little to chip away at the rock-solid support Totten received from
law enforcement leaders, including Sheriff Bob Brooks, local police
chiefs and several police unions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the greatest advantage that he had was the
establishment," Bamieh said. "Greg is a good candidate, no doubt
about it. But in terms of the politics, he had the machinery we
didn't have."</TE>
<TE>   But in his estimation, Bradbury said experience was the critical
factor.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, 47, has been a prosecutor twice as long as his 36-year-old
opponent and currently serves as the second-in-command of an office
with 600 employees and a $40-million budget. He also is the former
executive director of the California District Attorney's Assn. in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Greg had the edge on experience," Bradbury said. "The voters took
the time to look at each candidate, and that's what made the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   As the final election returns came in Tuesday night, Bradbury
congratulated Totten and embraced him amid cheers at the county
government center.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, Bamieh sank into a folding chair at what was supposed
to be his victory party in a balloon-festooned conference room at the
Pierpont Inn--stunned he was running so far behind.</TE>
<TE>   A senior deputy district attorney for nine years, Bamieh spent
more than $1 million--almost all of it donated by his father--on
mailers, signs, television and radio ads, and the services of a New
York-based campaign advisor and pollster known for his work on U.S.
Senate races.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when the absentee votes were returned, he was well behind
Totten.</TE>
<TE>   His position didn't change as the night wore on, yet he refused to
concede defeat until every vote was counted.</TE>
<TE>   At a private party a few miles away, Totten's supporters
celebrated late into the night.</TE>
<TE>   But the victorious candidate went home to sleep and took a sober
view of the race in the morning, vowing to move beyond the campaign
and make the transition to district attorney as harmonious as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time for leadership and working together for a common
purpose," Totten said, dismissing any notion of retaliation against
prosecutors who supported Bamieh.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be wrong and I have never been somebody who is
vindictive," he said. "They supported Ron for a variety of reasons,
and I hold no ill will. And I will do everything within my power to
ensure that everyone who works in the office takes the same
approach."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday morning, Bamieh said he tried to call Totten to
congratulate him, but was unable to reach him.</TE>
<TE>   He said he plans to return to work Monday after a short vacation
with his family and is committed to prosecuting an upcoming
death-penalty murder case.</TE>
<TE>   But after that, he is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "So far I've had three job offers," he said, "none of which I'm
going to do anything about right now."</TE>
<TE>   Questioned further about the campaign, Bamieh rejected claims that
his expenditures offended voters and renewed accusations that Totten
ran a dirty campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am not going to carry grudges," he said. "We lost. I've
lost things before ... You move on."</TE>

<HD>Drop in Violent Acts Leads Fillmore to 18% Reduction in
Crime in 2001</HD>
<DH>Public safety: Officials credit decrease to greater
community involvement. Only business burglaries rose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crime in Fillmore fell 18% last year, reaching levels not seen since
the 1980s with reductions in categories nearly across the board.</LD>
<LD>   Most significant was the one-third decline in acts of violence,
including a drop of 20 felony assaults, to a total of 28. Home
burglaries, auto thefts, arsons and vehicle break-ins also fell,
according to figures from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, it's great to see all the good news," said Sheriff's
Capt. Randy Pentis, who acts as Fillmore's police chief. "But when I
look at these numbers I want to see our weakness, where we can
improve."</LD>
<TE>   That would be in business burglaries, the only category where
offenses increased among the eight the FBI uses to set crime rates
nationwide. Fillmore's commercial burglaries increased from nine to
27 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's significant," Pentis said.</TE>
<TE>   The spike in store break-ins can be attributed mostly to two
businesses, a car dealership where losses were noticed when it was
sold and thefts at an oil company by an employee, Pentis said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officers are working with business operators to identify
changes that can make their stores harder to crack open at night.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we have an impact is if we work together with the
public," Pentis said. "We'll support them with a bicycle patrol,
surveillance, patrol [cruisers] or whatever is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The Fillmore sheriff's station has been using the public in crime
prevention since 1998, when thieves stole from and burglarized the
community at an alarming rate.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks sent in a new team of deputies who hammered
youth gang members with probation searches in their homes and reached
out to Fillmore's large Latino majority as allies in the war against
crime.</TE>
<TE>   A crew of veteran officers, more Spanish speakers and aggressive
young deputies helped kick down the walls that stood between
Fillmore's Latino immigrants--many distrustful of police--and law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Crime incidents tumbled from 428 in 1998 to 248 in 1999, before
increasing to 325 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the farm town of 14,000 residents recorded just 266
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   That is less than 19 offenses per 1,000 residents, slightly better
than in 1999 and far lower than the peak rate of nearly 41 a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pentis said the city's success last year had many
authors--cooperative schools and a 20-member citizen patrol that was
formed in the 1998 recruitment effort and that is still law
enforcement's eyes and ears in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "That brings the community into the police station, both English
and Spanish speakers," Pentis said. "When there's not a language or
cultural barrier, more people want to talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   Another key change occurred in early 2000, when a full-time
officer was assigned to Fillmore's schools for the first time, Pentis
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's had a big impact in dealing with things on campus, finding
out what's going on and earning the trust of young people," Pentis
said.</TE>

<HD>Glendora Voters Turning Out 3 Incumbents</HD>
<DH>Recall: Mayor and two councilmen appear headed for defeat
by narrow margins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendora's mayor and two council members apparently became the first
elected officials to be recalled in the city's 91-year history after
opponents raised about $200,000 to oust them from office.</LD>
<LD>   By razor-thin margins, Mayor John Harrold, Councilmen Richard
Jacobs and Paul "Sonny" Marshall seemed to have lost the bitterly
contested election in this foothills community 27 miles east of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Although final results are not official, 52% of the votes counted
favored ousting Jacobs while 51% favored ousting Harrold. The closest
of the races involved Marshall; 50.4% favored his removal from
office--a margin of about 90 votes.</LD>
<TE>   Voters elected a slate backed by a recall group to replace the
three lawmakers. Planning Commissioner Ken Herman was elected to
Harrold's seat. Business executive Gary Clifford will replace Jacobs
and Azusa Pacific University administrator Cliff Hamlow beat Eugene
Osko to succeed Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the narrow margins, recall proponents rejoiced Wednesday
and vowed to unite the community. "We are going to get the city back
on track and heal the divisions," Clifford said. "We'll treat people
like they want to be treated, and many of the problems will go away."</TE>
<TE>   Unless the results change as final ballots are counted, the new
council members will take office April 9.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a lawyer. I am waiting until the final results are in," said
Harrold, declining to concede defeat. "They spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars for this outcome. I got more votes than when I
was elected."</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, recall advocates charged that the three, as a
majority on the five-member council, abused their power.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said they ousted volunteer city commissioners to make way
for cronies, unjustly fired a popular city manager and secretly hired
a city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Bob Kuhn, a recall supporter, said he does not expect
the outstanding votes to change the election's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The ousted council members were longtime advocates of slow growth
in a 19.5-square-mile city that has traditionally been favorable to
developers of upscale homes in its foothills. In the campaign they
painted themselves as guardians of the hillsides who favored more
parkland in the face of sprawling development.</TE>
<TE>   Harrold and Jacobs won council seats in March 1999 and promptly
blocked approval of a retail development by the council. Voters
eventually approved the Glendora Marketplace in a referendum.
Marshall was elected last March, giving Harrold and Jacobs a new ally
on the council.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, Harrold, Marshall and Jacobs had sought to
capitalize on the geographical and class divides in the city of
49,000.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs chastised his critics as representing only those who live
in gated communities in the foothills, while ignoring those in
smaller homes south of Alosta Avenue, which is now named Route 66.</TE>
<TE>   The election was an unfortunate necessity, said Doug Tessitor,
recall group spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact the vote was split nearly evenly shows a lot of people
found the whole process of recall distasteful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, the recall targets "left us no choice. Our approach
now will be one of reconciliation."</TE>

<DH>Architecture: College district OKs design plan that is
environmentally friendly, if not so high-tech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What will new college buildings look like in the technology-mad early
21st century?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe not as space-agey as you think. As envisioned by the leaders
of the Los Angeles Community College District, cutting-edge and
environmentally friendly campus architecture will embody about as
much old-fashioned practicality as high-tech gadgetry.</LD>
<LD>   A plan approved 7 to 0 on Wednesday by the district's Board of
Trustees to guide the use of $1.2 billion in school-bond funds for 40
to 50 new buildings encourages such design wizardry as:</LD>
<TE>   Windows that actually open and close.</TE>
<TE>   Trees that shade buildings and help keep them cool.</TE>
<TE>   Roofing made from light-reflecting recycled materials--including
old toilet bowls and sinks.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is common sense. But a lot of our campuses are so old
that common sense is visionary," said Kelly Candaele, a trustee of
the nine-campus college district.</TE>
<TE>   Even if some of the proposed techniques sound old hat, the
district already is winning praise from many environmentalists for
its "sustainable building," or "green building," plan.</TE>
<TE>   The design specifics have yet to be spelled out for the new
buildings, which will be financed with the $1.2 billion from
Proposition A, passed by voters last year.</TE>
<TE>   But the planned approach reflects the nation's "sustainable
community" movement, with its emphasis on conserving resources and
placing as gentle a burden as possible on the environment. The aim
also is to ensure that new buildings provide healthy workplaces, free
of such ills as indoor air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is expected to start next year on the first batch of
projects, which most likely will include a media arts building and
library at Valley College in Valley Glen.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other Proposition A projects destined for San Fernando
Valley campuses are a technology center, a student store and a
building for science, agriculture and nursing at Pierce College in
Woodland Hills, as well as a parking structure, a fitness center and
an expanded student services building at Mission College in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Templeton, a project manager for the U.S. Green Building
Council, a nonprofit group that certifies buildings meeting key
environmental standards, called the community college district's plan
perhaps the most environmentally ambitious by any higher education
system in the country.</TE>
<TE>   If a room needs to be cooled, there will be options besides
turning on electricity-gobbling air conditioners. You could just open
a window--or, in a concession to high-tech, windows might
automatically open when temperatures hit a certain level.</TE>
<TE>   Also, to save precious water, more athletic fields might be
covered with artificial turf, and landscaping would feature
drought-resistant plants. Meanwhile, restrictions on the use of
paints that emit toxic fumes would be tightened.</TE>
<TE>   In approving the sustainable-building plan, trustees "are voting
to give students a healthier learning environment and to save
taxpayer dollars in lower energy costs in the long term," said Matt
Petersen, president of Global Green U.S.A., a Los Angeles-based
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is ready to embrace the plan. One touchy point is
that the standards in the plan are expected to raise construction
costs an estimated 8% to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, may mean that voters won't be getting as many
buildings as they anticipated when they approved Proposition A, said
Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assn. The district, he said, "may be skating on very thin legal ice."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, district trustee Nancy Pearlman, a longtime
environmental activist, said she doesn't think the district's plan
goes far enough. For instance, she would like it to do more to ensure
that new buildings are made with recycled materials. "I want to be
sure we're not cutting down the rain forest," she said.</TE>
<TE>   District Chancellor Marshall "Mark" Drummond defends the use of
taxpayer money for sustainable-building standards on two grounds. For
one thing, he said, voters were never promised that a specific number
of buildings would be put up with funds from Proposition A.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, he said, the savings from sustainable buildings that use
less electricity and water would enable the district to recover the
extra construction expenses in five to seven years. Assuming most
buildings will have a life span of about 30 years, he said, "you've
got 23 years of good news, because you're saving money all of those
years."</TE>

<HD>Grant Awarded to Clean Up Tainted Beaches</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: State money will be used to fight bacteria levels
at Kiddie and Hobie recreation areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After watching a former coastal hot spot suffer through more than two
years of poor marks for high levels of bacteria, county officials
finally have reason to cheer.</LD>
<LD>   The state Water Resources Control Board recently approved a
$1.5-million grant requested by Ventura County officials to find a
solution to the water pollution at Kiddie and Hobie beaches at
Channel Islands Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   The grant proposal includes two phases. The first calls for a
study of the causes and solutions to the high bacteria levels. Poor
water circulation and feces from birds and feral cats are among the
suspected culprits. The second phase will cover cleanup measures.</LD>
<TE>   "We are ready to go," said Lyn Krieger, director of the Harbor
Department. "The first thing we have to do is a complete water
circulation study. We need to know if the circulation of the water
will make a difference and if it will, then what can be done about
it."</TE>
<TE>   An engineering firm has been selected to conduct the tests, she
said, but no other steps can be taken until the funds become
available.</TE>
<TE>   Christy Madden, county community development manager, said the
first installment of $705,000 is expected during the next eight
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   After that, invoices can be submitted for both future measures and
measures the county has already implemented, such as placing metal
poles adorned with hanging Mylar strips along the shoreline to shoo
birds from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "The poles are kind of acting like a scarecrow and keeping the
birds away," county Supervisor John K. Flynn said. "I'm just pleased
we got this grant because the money will go a long way in cleaning up
the water."</TE>
<TE>   The two beaches at the south end of Channel Islands Harbor, where
Victoria Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard meet, gained notoriety the
past two summers when they were labeled "beach bummers" by Heal the
Bay, a Santa Monica-based water quality group. The distinction is
given to beaches that consistently fail to meet state standards for
bacteria levels.</TE>
<TE>   Madden said the county goes beyond mandatory testing at those two
beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is that the beach is so poorly ranked
that we test it a lot more than the others," Madden said. "We know
that it is very isolated with almost no circulation, so we do extra
testing. Now that the grant has been approved, we are going to do our
best to work out a long-term solution for keeping it clean."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Quaintance, an Oxnard resident and member of the watchdog
Beacon Foundation, agrees that the grant will ultimately mean a
cleaner beach but remains concerned about the short term.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good-news, bad-news sort of thing," Quaintance said.
"It's good to get the grant; it offers a long-term solution to what
we've hoped for. But the bad news is that by the time all of the
fundamental work has been done, it will still be a couple of years
before it's safe to go to those beaches."</TE>
<TE>   Liz Kanter, a water board spokeswoman, said there is no time frame
set for receiving the second and final installments of the grant.</TE>
<TE>   "Once phase one is completed by Ventura County, then the funds
will be released for phase two," Kanter said. "But as far as the
water board is concerned, the county has been allocated a
$1.5-million grant. From what we've seen it looks like they are on
the right track and very committed to clean beaches."</TE>

<HD>New Chapter Begins in Race for Accused Judge's O.C. Seat</HD>
<DH>Runoff: Officials will now count write-in ballots to see
who runs against jurist facing molestation charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flogged by talk radio DJs, caught in the glare of the national media
and abandoned at the ballot box by even his next-door neighbors, an
Orange County judge facing child-molestation charges reaped a meager
one-third of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline now faces an uphill battle to
keep his judgeship in a November runoff against a write-in candidate
whose identity won't be known for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday began a new chapter in the campaign, which pitted Kline,
who remains under house arrest, against 11 write-ins. Election
officials are preparing to hand-count 233,843 write-in ballots to
determine who will face the judge.</LD>
<TE>   Collectively, the write-in candidates nabbed 66% of the vote,
although none of the little-known challengers emerged as a
front-runner during the frenzied campaign. The field of judicial
hopefuls include a local councilman, a former judge and an attorney
now facing disbarment after being accused of withholding settlement
money won by a client.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials may be called upon to make tough "hanging
chad"-type decisions that created so much turmoil in Florida during
the 2000 presidential race. Orange County Registrar of Voters Rosalyn
Lever already has said that voters who wrote in a candidate's name
but forgot to punch the "write in" selection for candidates won't
have their votes count.</TE>
<TE>   However, ballots with write-in names that are close to but not an
exact match with one of the qualified candidates will still count if
the "intent is clear," said election office spokeswoman Terri Niccum.
Questionable votes will be decided on a case-by-case basis by
election officials, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can tell who it is cast for, we count it. A misspelling is
not going to kick out their vote," Niccum said. "We'll have observers
present, and I'm sure the candidates know they can come in and
observe the process."</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to call in at least 100 poll workers who will
work in teams of four to count the write-in ballots, a task that
could take until early April, Niccum said.</TE>
<TE>   That gives the 11 write-in candidates plenty of time to
second-guess their campaign strategies, and possibly stir up
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I never looked at my opponents as opponents. They were on the
same team as me," said write-in candidate Terese Oliver, a longtime
prosecutor from Anaheim. "Now, I'm looking at it, saying I should
have done this, I should have done that.... We're all doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, Kline's challengers were bonded by a common goal to
oust the judge, but now they face the prospect of a fierce political
firefight if questions arise about how the ballots are counted,
especially if it's a close race.</TE>
<TE>   "All 11 people stepped up to the plate without taking potshots at
one another," said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science
department at UC Irvine. "They had a common target. Now, we'll see
how eager they are to become a Superior Court judge."</TE>
<TE>   Local judicial races usually get scant attention, but this one has
become a national story, with outlets from a CNN talk show to "Good
Morning America" weighing in with coverage. Many focused on the
likelihood that Kline would be reelected because he was the only name
on the ballot. Even NBC's "Today" show host Katie Couric took a shot
at Kline on election day, calling him the "judge who now knows what
it's like to be on the other side of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Couric's quip was tame compared with abuse Kline has taken has
from the KFI radio talk show duo John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, who at
one point railed against the judge from a makeshift studio outside
Kline's home.</TE>
<TE>   Leading up to election day, the "John and Ken Show" broadcast
explicit excerpts from a diary allegedly taken from the Kline's
computer--including yearning passages about boys playing Little
League baseball.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Kobylt and Chiampou praised voters for "proving the
pundits wrong" and forcing Kline into a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned at the turnout against him, nearly a quarter of a
million votes against him. This is what he deserved," Kobylt said in
an interview Wednesday after his radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's challengers credited the crush of media attention for
their success in forcing Kline into a runoff election.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether there was 11 candidates or 300 candidates, we could not
have gotten the message out to 1.3 million voters without the help of
the media," said Gay Sandoval, a trial lawyer from Costa Mesa who
spent $23,000 on the race.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a Superior Court judge also gave the write-ins a major
boost when he ordered election officials to post signs at polling
places telling voters they could receive a list of the write-in
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge's decision was very important," Petracca said. "It
reduced the probability of voters having to rely on memory, or having
to bring a list."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Frank Barbaro, chairman of the county's Democratic Party
and a friend of Kline's, marveled at the judge's ability to pull in a
third of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Though many voters may have been unaware of the allegations,
Barbaro surmised, "there is good chunk saying that he's innocent
until proven guilty, and let this whole thing unfold."</TE>
<TE>   Some voters in Kline's well-groomed Turtle Rock neighborhood in
Irvine weren't as charitable, however.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just too many people with kids who live here. It's not
worth the risk," said neighbor Cathy Eusey, who voted for a write-in
candidate.</TE>

<HD>Museum to Return Artwork Looted by Nazis</HD>
<DH>Repatriation: Textile stolen from Poland is the first such
item found in county's collection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late medieval Persian or Mughal canopy that was looted from a
Polish collection by the Nazis and has spent most of the last three
decades in storage at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is being
returned to Poland.</LD>
<LD>   In a ceremony Wednesday afternoon at the museum, LACMA President
and Director Andrea Rich announced that the artwork will be sent back
to Poland after a yearlong inquiry that determined it had been
illegally seized during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, LACMA sends this textile to its rightful owners, not only
because it is our professional responsibility, but also because it is
morally and ethically the right thing to do," Rich said.</LD>
<TE>   The 7-foot by 9-foot woven canopy, which depicts a prince
surrounded by angels, birds and animals, is the first work in LACMA's
collection to be identified as Nazi loot and the first to be returned
by the museum to a pre-World War II owner. It will be transferred to
the Princes Czartoryski Foundation Museum, part of the National
Museum in Krakow.</TE>
<TE>   One of 25,000 pieces in LACMA's collection of textiles and
clothing, it is a rare example of a blend of Indian and Iranian
influences. Dated to the 15th century or early 16th century, it had
been damaged and extensively mended when the museum bought it for a
few thousand dollars in 1971. It has been displayed at LACMA only
twice, soon after it was acquired and again in the early 1980s. Its
current value is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a study piece, but we'll miss it," said Linda Komaroff, the
museum's curator of Islamic art.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA purchased the canopy in 1971 from Los Angeles textile dealer
Kay Robertson, whose father, Munich dealer Lowey Robertson, bought it
at an auction in 1970. Neither Robertson nor the museum suspected
that the work was Nazi loot at the time, LACMA officials say.</TE>
<TE>   But in January 2001, London dealer Andrew S. Ciechanowiecki, who
serves on the board of trustees of the Czartoryski Foundation, asked
his longtime friend, J. Patrice Marandel, who is LACMA's chief
curator of European painting and sculpture, if the museum might have
the missing canopy in its collection.</TE>
<TE>   Marandel forwarded the inquiry to the museum's costume and
textiles department. When the curators found that LACMA had a piece
that seemed to match the description, the Polish consul in Los
Angeles was notified.</TE>
<TE>   When Poland made a formal claim in October 2001, the matter was
turned over to art historian Amy Walsh, who heads LACMA's Provenance
Research Project, set up in 1999 to search the museum's records for
artworks that might have been looted during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh first searched the museum's archives on the canopy and then
went to the National Archives in College Park, Md., which maintains
records of artworks that were seized during the Holocaust and later
returned. She also contacted the National Museum in Krakow to study
its records on the textile.</TE>
<TE>   Her research convinced LACMA that its canopy was indeed the
missing artwork. On Feb. 6, the board of trustees voted to return the
piece to Poland.</TE>
<TE>   The return of the canopy is part of an international museum effort
to make restitution to victims of the Nazis. Art scholars are doing
detective work for organizations ranging from an Internet registry
based in Mageburg, Germany, to the Art Loss Registry in London and
individual museums all across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of these efforts, many looted works have been
returned. Berlin's National Museum gave a Vincent van Gogh drawing
worth more than $6 million to the family of a Jewish collector who
was forced to sell it in 1935 for the equivalent of $600.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA launched the Provenance Research Project nearly three years
ago, hiring Walsh to examine its collection in accordance with
national guidelines adopted by the American Assn. of Museums. She
began with paintings, focusing on works that had been created before
1945 and that had changed hands between 1933 and the years shortly
after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh looked for gaps in the provenance, or history of ownership.
It isn't unusual for records of ownership to be incomplete; artworks
that change hands don't always leave a paper trail. But gaps that
occur between 1933 and 1945 are of particular concern because they
raise the possibility of Nazi involvement. Walsh found five paintings
that raised questions of ownership during the period under scrutiny
and posted them on the museum's Web site in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has received no claims for any of the paintings, she
said. During the last year and a half, Walsh has combed through other
parts of the collection and conducted research on artworks loaned to
the museum to protect the institution from judicial procedures
resulting from ownership claims.</TE>
<TE>   But the return of LACMA's canopy is a special case, sparked by an
outsider's inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Records in Poland trace the canopy's convoluted history through
1944. It was part of the collection of the late Princess Maria
Ludwika Czartoryska, who installed it at her family's museum in
Krakow in 1931. She moved most of her collection to a palace outside
Krakow once the Nazis invaded Poland, but they soon discovered her
hiding place and transported the works to their depot at the
Jagiellonian Library in Krakow.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the works, including the canopy, were returned to the
family museum in the summer of 1940; the princess subsequently hid
them in her palace in Warsaw. In December 1941, the Germans raided
that palace, discovered 17 crates of artworks and sent them to the
National Museum in Warsaw, then under Nazi control.</TE>
<TE>   They remained there until 1944, when the Nazis moved them to an
unknown location in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the Allied forces rounded up objects that the Nazis
had seized and returned them to their owners. Most of the Czartoryski
collection was returned, but the textile had disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   It resurfaced in 1970, when it was sold at auction in London by
the foundation of Hagop Kevorkian, a noted archeologist, dealer and
collector. The auction catalog contains no information on the piece's
provenance, and no record of Kevorkian's acquisition of the textile

<CX>   Art dealer--Adolf Loewi was the art dealer who, at an auction in
1970, purchased the textile that was returned to Poland last week by the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, after museum officials discovered that
it was Nazi loot. Loewi operated his gallery, Loewi-Robertson Inc., in
Los Angeles until 1970, when he retired and moved to Munich. A story in
Thursday's California section incorrectly identified Loewi, his gallery
and his place of business.</CX>

<HD>O.C. Priest Faces New Allegation of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Accusation: A former altar boy, now 38, files a
molestation complaint with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former altar boy has come forward to accuse Father Michael
Pecharich--dismissed Monday by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange
for what he contended was an isolated sexual abuse incident 19 years
ago--of molesting him a quarter of a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged second victim, Jim Griley, 38, of Morro Bay, said he
reported the incidents Tuesday to diocesan officials. He said he felt
compelled to go public after reading that San Francisco Solano Church
parishioners in Rancho Santa Margarita decried the popular priest's
removal for a single molestation almost two decades ago. He added
that he would not pursue a lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   "Bottom line: He's a molester," said Griley, who said he was 10 to
12 years old at the time of the alleged attacks at St. Bridget of
Sweden parish in Van Nuys.</LD>
<TE>   Church officials confirmed that they received a new complaint
about the priest and that Pecharich was an associate pastor at St.
Bridget from 1973 to 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Bishop of Orange Norman F. McFarland, who stepped down in
1998, reviewed Pecharich's case in 1996 when the original victim came
forward. After consulting with a psychologist and the diocesan
"sensitive issues" team, he determined that Pecharich wasn't a threat
to children and allowed him to continue at San Francisco Solano with
additional counseling, restrictions around minors and continued
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   When told about the new allegation Wednesday, McFarland said he
was "floored."</TE>
<TE>   "[If true] ... that makes all the difference in the world," the
retired bishop said. "I was dealing with one case." "You make your
judgments by what you have.... If this is true, what can I say? It's
something I didn't know. If I had known, there's no question he
couldn't have continued."</TE>
<TE>   The accusation, if true, gives additional support to a new,
controversial "zero-tolerance" policy that requires the diocese to
fire any priest known to have molested a minor. Some parishioners at
Pecharich's church were outraged that their pastor had been fired for
a single 19-year-old sexual abuse case that involved a teenage boy.
But the new complaint bolsters the arguments of victims' rights
activists who say molesters tend to repeat their acts, and that once
one molestation comes to light, there probably are others.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles and Orange dioceses were forced to enact the new
policy as part of a $5.2-million settlement in another case alleging
sexual abuse by a priest.</TE>
<TE>   "In our society, you don't get one free bank robbery and priests
shouldn't get one free pass," said David Clohessy, executive director
of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles dismissed as many as a dozen
priests in the past few weeks because of the new guidelines, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich was the first Orange County priest forced to resign
under the zero-tolerance policy, though church officials said they
haven't completed a background check of all diocesan priests.</TE>
<TE>   Pecharich had told church officials and congregants Sunday that he
had "only transgressed personal boundaries of [one] adolescent."</TE>
<TE>   Both clergy and parishioners, here and across the country, have
fiercely debated whether priests with a substantiated--but
decades-old--molestation charge should be instantly dismissed,
despite years of apparent good service.</TE>
<TE>   "If these allegations are true, that's very tragic and certainly
gives more weight to the diocesan policy of not returning admitted
molesters or those judged guilty of sexual abuse to active ministry,"
said Tod D. Brown, the current bishop of Orange. "Certainly our
hearts go out to the victim."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco Solano, some of the 16,000 parishioners
questioned why the bishop had removed their pastor of 12 years
because of an old transgression for which, church officials said, he
had twice gotten counseling. Some suggested that the church's new
parish hall be named after him.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that's what makes us so passionate about the departure
of Father Mike, is the fact that the crime he is guilty of took place
19 years ago," said one parishioner before Griley's accusation.</TE>
<TE>   "In my eyes, he has done a noteworthy job of changing his life and
becoming someone we could feel safe to have our children around," the
parishioner said.</TE>
<TE>   Griley said that kind of talk is what spurred him to take action.
He said he lives a quiet life in Central California with his wife and
young son. He commutes to Los Angeles three days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew darn well it wasn't just one kid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also added that he understood the parishioners' reactions.
"I've been there. You idolize this person. They're devastated,
they're in shock, and they're in denial. He's not a nice priest."</TE>
<TE>   Griley said he didn't tell anyone about the molestation at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought didn't enter my mind that this was wrong or to tell
my parents," he said. "This was my priest."</TE>

<TE>   Controversial Policy Adopted by Church</TE>
<TE>   The accusation, if true, gives additional support to a new,
controversial "zero-tolerance" policy that requires the diocese to
fire any priest known to have molested a minor. Some parishioners at
Pecharich's church were outraged that their pastor had been fired for

<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles quietly dismissed as many as a

<TE>   At San Francisco Solano, many of the 16,000 parishioners
questioned why the bishop had removed their pastor of 12 years
because of an old transgression for which, church officials said, he
had twice gotten counseling. Some suggested that the church's new
parish hall be named after him as a tribute.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that's what makes us so passionate about the departure
of Father Mike, is the fact that the crime he is guilty of took place
19 years ago," said one parishioner before Griley's accusation. "In
my eyes, he has done a noteworthy job of changing his life and
becoming someone we could feel safe to have our children around."</TE>
<TE>   Griley said that kind of talk is what spurred him to take action.

<TE>   "The thought didn't enter my mind that this was wrong or to tell
my parents," he said. "This was my priest."</TE>
<TE>   Memories of Abuse Began to Resurface</TE>
<TE>   Griley said reports about molesting priests five or six years ago
began to dredge up his memories.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, last Saturday Griley told his sister about
Pecharich, on the same day the priest began telling his congregation
that he was leaving. His sister in Ventura County e-mailed the
newspaper accounts to him Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Man, that's the guy we were just talking about,'"
said Griley, who began calling former classmates Tuesday night to see
if they had a similar experience.</TE>
<TE>   Victim advocates and church critics point to people like Griley
when arguing that priests' misconduct for sexual abuse of minors
should be made public, as in Orange, so others can come forward and
parents can be warned.</TE>
<TE>   "The first person who comes forward, it's their courage that
inspires other people to come forward," said Clohessy of SNAP.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that the dismissals should be done quietly, as in Los
Angeles, to preserve the privacy of the priest.</TE>

<HD>Norby: 'I'm That Change'</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: History teacher and Fullerton councilman who
opposed international airport at Marine base beats Cynthia P. Coad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was nearly 4 a.m. Wednesday, and with 353 of 354 precincts
counted, the result was all but certain. Friends finally convinced
Orange County supervisor-elect Chris Norby that he'd better get some
sleep. Because in just a few hours, he'd need to return to his real
job: teaching history at Brea-Olinda High School.</LD>
<LD>   When Norby arrived on campus, bleary-eyed but savoring victory, he
was cheered by teachers and staff members. They too knew he had just
pulled off one of the biggest upsets in the county's political
history.</LD>
<LD>   A late entry into the 4th District Board of Supervisors' race,
Norby, 52, a Fullerton city councilman, defeated incumbent Cynthia P.
Coad, 54% to 46%. Coad, who was seeking a second term, had outspent
him 5 to 1 and had wrapped up most of the major endorsements before
he was even a candidate.</LD>
<TE>   But they were running in a redrawn district where a substantial
number of voters had never cast a ballot for Coad but were familiar
with Norby. And he positioned himself as an opponent of an
international airport at the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station
and a critic of supervisors who let the debate over El Toro drown out
other county issues.</TE>
<TE>   Coad has long been part of the board's three-member majority
favoring an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters wanted change, and I'm that change!" he yelled to
supporters at his campaign headquarters in downtown Fullerton
awaiting election results Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Norby sat patiently with a handful of volunteers and well-wishers,
one eye on the corner TV that was showing "Wheel of Fortune," another
on a laptop computer. On its screen was the county registrar of
voters' Web site, which soon would begin flashing the
precinct-by-precinct tallies.</TE>
<TE>   They were optimistic over the first returns, even though their
candidate was trailing. But when he surged ahead for good at 10:20
p.m., the cheers were thunderous. A theme song emerged:</TE>
<TE>   "Who let the dogs out. Woof! Woof!"</TE>
<TE>   It was an insider reference to a late campaign mailer in which
Coad accused Norby of being a lap dog for South County because most
of his campaign funds had come from South County opponents of the El
Toro airport proposal. The mailer showed Norby's face on a dog's
body.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, buoyed by the vote numbers going his way, put the mailer to
his face and scurried around the five-room suite barking. The song
was a constant cheer throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris worked so very hard," said Julia Emerson, his girlfriend
and one of his chief campaign strategists. "We all did. But wow, this
is so worth it."</TE>
<TE>   In victory toasts, the candidate was generous in his praise of
those who helped him win, including former state Sen. John Lewis, his
campaign manager, and Lewis' colleague, Matt Holder. John Cross, head
of the Fullerton Assn. of Police Officers, got great applause when he
walked in.</TE>
<TE>   "We love the FAPO," Lewis yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "And we love Chris," Cross replied.</TE>
<TE>   Still, long after the voting trend suggested he would win, Norby
was waiting for the final results. "I've still got some Yogi Berra in
me," he said. "It ain't over till it's over."</TE>
<TE>   After the throng departed, someone asked Norby what he'd do until
he takes office in early January. "In a few hours, go back to my
students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday morning, Norby was on campus early. It was his first day
back from a month of unpaid leave he'd taken to campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Norby talked with his students about the campaign for a few
minutes, but he soon was delving into 1950s American life and talking
about students' assignments.</TE>
<TE>   He has been teaching most of his adult life and clearly was at
home in the classroom. But he had to remind his class: "This may be
the very last time I ever teach."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," one girl said.</TE>
<TE>   Norby smiled.</TE>

rejected plans for a 572-home mountainside subdivision after a
marathon hearing that lasted until 5 a.m. Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the Oakmont View V project hugged, cried and cheered
when the council denied the proposal to build the luxury homes in the
Verdugo Mountains. The project has been debated for more than a
decade.</LD>
<LD>   After the 11-hour hearing, the developers said in a statement they
would take the matter to court.</LD>
<TE>   "Now, all bets are off," said the statement released by Gregg's
Artistic Homes. "We're headed back to court--soon and in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials declined to comment further. Vice President Lee
Gregg said before the hearing that a lawsuit would accuse the council
of violating the developers' property rights because of pressure from
homeowner groups opposed to the project.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier lawsuit resulted in a judge's order that prevented the
council from imposing hillside-protection limits on Oakmont. The
limits were adopted after the development was proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Council members said Wednesday their decision followed a close
review of the plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved with this for 10 years; I know the project
pretty well," Councilman Dave Weaver said. "We knew [the developer]
would sue. He didn't get his way."</TE>
<TE>   Other council members said they were influenced by negative
environmental reports. City planners released a 24-page report last
week that found the project "inconsistent" with Glendale's General
Plan and that it would be a potential landslide hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a 2,000-page environmental impact report concluded
that Oakmont would harm the air, wildlife and scenic vistas.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont "was not right for the city," Councilman Rafi Manoukian
said. "I feel comfortable with my vote."</TE>
<TE>   Gregg disputed the findings in both reports.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the overflow crowd at the hearing, the council
provided a televised link between City Hall and the Civic Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of opponents packed the auditorium early Tuesday evening,
and dozens remained when the hearing finally ended.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy the City Council did the right thing," said Odalis
Suarez, who argued against Oakmont at several public meetings. "There
is nothing good about the Oakmont proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists have persuaded state lawmakers to allocate $8
million to purchase the 238-acre tract, but developers said the land
was appraised at $46 million more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Brandstater, a spokesman for the developer, added Wednesday
that a conservation group had expressed interest in buying the
property, but that the council's decision "slammed the door" on that
option. He would not explain why.</TE>

<HD>County Divide Was Too Much for Airport</HD>
<DH>Measure W: High turnout and strong convictions of voters in
south O.C. cities trumped the north's population advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY F. HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters were deeply divided, north against south, over
the ballot measure that derailed plans for a commercial airport at
the closed El Toro Marine base, according to balloting details
released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in Newport Beach and all of the cities northwest of the
Costa Mesa Freeway rejected the ballot measure, which rezoned the
4,700-acre base as an urban park and nature preserve. Those in every
South County city, as expected, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the
measure, the latest unofficial returns from the county elections
department show.</LD>
<LD>   That clear north-south divide should have spelled defeat for the
anti-airport measure and its southern backers, for voters in the
northern cities outnumber those in the south by almost 2 to
1--835,000 to 450,000. But the turnout among South County voters was
44% of those registered--a third higher than the 33% turnout recorded
in the north.</LD>
<TE>   Intensity of voter sentiment in the south was also significant.
While 62.6% of North County voters opposed the measure, more that 81%
of those in South County backed it, helping to offset the greater
number of North County voters.</TE>
<TE>   In Newport Beach, which has lobbied for an El Toro airport that
would ease, if not eliminate, the environmental effects of John Wayne
Airport, voter turnout rivaled that in South County. With 84.2%
voting against the measure, they were the group most opposed to
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   In the South County cities of Aliso Viejo, Laguna Woods, Lake
Forest, Laguna Niguel and Laguna Hills, more than 90% of voters
backed the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Many South County cities banded together to fight the county's
plan for an international airport at El Toro, fearing that noise and
increased auto traffic into and out of the area would threaten
residents' quality of life.</TE>

<LD>Talk about getting a wrong number! The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise carried a report that an "upstairs tenant, who had
been evicted, became upset and threw a Yellow Pages at another
person."</LD>
<LD>   Sell a Girl Scout cookie--go to jail? No, that's NOT the law in
the People's Republic of Santa Monica. It was all a misunderstanding.
The controversy started with "a grocery store manager's comment after
being cited by the city for an unpermitted outdoor art sale,"
explained the city manager's office.</LD>
<LD>   Two store managers then decided against allowing the Scouts to
sell in front of their stores.</LD>
<TE>   But, the city emphasized, Santa Monica's "focus is only on
unlawful commercial activity."</TE>
<TE>   Now where are those Thin Mints?</TE>
<TE>   Has he dug himself into a hole? It's always risky to make
generalizations, but I believe that only one candidate in Tuesday's
primary combined his campaign Web site with a ferret legalization
site-- ferretsanon.com (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   That would be Pat Wright, the Libertarian nominee for lieutenant
governor. His beef: It's illegal to own ferrets anywhere in
California, including Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Inasmuch as he received less than 1% of the vote Tuesday, Wright
has some work to do mobilizing more support.</TE>
<TE>   But I do notice that incumbent Democrat Cruz Bustamante and
Republican challenger Bruce McPherson have so far weaseled out of
taking a position on this vital issue.</TE>
<TE>   Beat L.A.! That's the cry that resounds through sports stadia when
teams from the City of Angels play elsewhere. And it seems to be the
theme whenever an ex-L.A. mayor runs for governor. Tom Bradley failed
(twice), as did Sam Yorty. I just hope that Richard Riordan doesn't
make the same career decision that Yorty did after his losing effort
for the state job. Sam then ran for president in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The election (cont.): I thought that was a low blow by Riordan
rival Bill Simon paying a visit to Philippe's restaurant the other
day. Ninety-four-year-old Philippe's is, of course, a rival of
another landmark, the 82-year-old Original Pantry Cafe, which is
owned by Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sour notes: Bill Gibson of San Clemente discovered
there's finally a place where you can take out your aggressions
against annoying singers (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   More alphabet soup: Continuing our acronymal sandwich discussion,
Jeff Tritch of Eagle Rock recalled eating a BLAST made of bacon,
lettuce, avocado and tomato, on squaw bread.</TE>
<TE>   Actor's lament: In his cyber column, entertainer Phil Proctor
offered a colleague's update of Shakespeare as a comment on the labor
situation in show biz: ''All the world's a stage, and there's still
no work.''</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police log in Marina del Rey's Argonaut newspaper
reported this accusation: "Defrauding an innkeeper. A suspect
received a tattoo on the left hip and refused to pay $140 for the
service." Not sure I'd have the nerve to defraud a man wielding a big
needle.</TE>

<HD>Leo Ornstein, 109; Piano Prodigy, Avant-Garde Composer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Composer Leo Ornstein, regarded in the 1920s as a prophet of new
music on the order of a Stravinsky or Schoenberg before he withdrew
from public view, died Feb. 24 in Green Bay, Wis. He was 109.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Kremenchug, Russia, in 1892, the piano prodigy was
accepted at St. Petersburg Conservatory when he was 10.</LD>
<LD>   Because of rising anti-Semitism, however, his family immigrated to
the United States in 1907.</LD>
<TE>   The young pianist continued his studies at the New England
Conservatory of Music in Boston and the Institute of Musical Art
(which evolved into the Juilliard School) in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein made his New York recital debut in 1911. European tours
followed in 1913 and 1914.</TE>
<TE>   He excelled at standard repertoire--Beethoven, Chopin and
Liszt--but also programmed works by contemporaries such as Ravel,
Scriabin and Schoenberg. He gave many of the first U.S. performances
of works by Debussy.</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein soon began performing programs entirely of new music,
including his own compositions, which made use of polytonality,
polyrhythms and other modernist techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions--pro and con--were extreme.</TE>
<TE>   "Ornstein represents an evil musical genius wandering without the
utmost pale of tonal orthodoxy, in a weird No-Man's Land, haunted
with tortuous sound, with wails of futuristic despair, with cubistic
shrieks and post-impressionist cries and crashes," a reviewer wrote
in the Globe-London in 1914. Influential American critic James
Huneker, however, described Ornstein in 1918 as "the only true-blue,
genuine, Futurist composer alive."</TE>
<TE>   In 1933, at the height of his popularity and fame after nearly 20
years of public performances, Ornstein gave his last New York concert
and effectively disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "One beautiful day I decided I could not stand the incessant
practicing and the incessant traveling," he told the New York Times
in 1976. "So that's the story of why I gave up concerts."</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein met his wife, debutant Pauline C. Mallet-Prevost, while
they were students at the Institute of Musical Art. They were married
in 1918.</TE>
<TE>   After he retired from the concert stage, the couple founded the
Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia in 1935 and ran it
successfully until selling it in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in New Hampshire, Arizona and Florida before settling
in Texas. Pauline Ornstein died in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his withdrawal from public concerts, Ornstein never
stopped composing.</TE>
<TE>   His 40-minute "Biography in Sonata Form" received its world
premiere in 1977 in Texas by Los Angeles pianist Michael Sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein's apparent final composition, the Eighth Piano Sonata,
was written in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a son, Severo, of Woodside, Calif.; a daughter,
Edith Valentine of De Pere, Wis.; five grandchildren; and four
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Chief Staunchly Defends Record, Outlines Gains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of his most pointed efforts yet to defend his record,
beleaguered Los Angeles Chief Bernard C. Parks delivered a lengthy
speech Thursday to a group of prominent city residents in which he
sought to explain in detail his priorities during four years at the
helm of the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the Omni Los Angeles Hotel downtown at a luncheon
meeting of about 250 members of Town Hall Los Angeles, Parks
highlighted what he said were his accomplishments--including
improvements in discipline and in fighting crime--and invoked the
catastrophe of Sept.11 to argue against critics who want a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not the time for us to be tinkering ... to see if someone
out there is better and unknown, and doing a worldwide search to see
who that might be," he said.</LD>
<TE>   In a news conference preceding the speech, Parks also gave new
details about his approach to an evaluation process underway before
the Los Angeles Police Commission, the five-member panel that is
considering whether to appoint him to a second five-year term. And
for the first time, Parks raised the issue of consistency in
discussing the standards the commission will use to decide his fate.</TE>
<TE>   Parks told reporters he is examining whether a set of criteria the
commission has announced it is using to evaluate his merit is
consistent with those used by previous commissions to judge his job
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I was given certain criteria throughout my four years of chief
that they rated me on," he said in a follow-up interview. "I am
working with the commission to determine if the listed criteria are
the same."</TE>
<TE>   However, Parks stopped short of saying that he had detected
inconsistencies in the criteria, saying only that it has not been
determined whether they match those of previous evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   If it turns out that the criteria differ, he said, he would seek
clarification from the commission, asking: "If they are not the same,
then where does that come from and why is it different?"</TE>
<TE>   Parks, a 37-year veteran of the LAPD, faces opposition to a second
term from Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who announced last month
that he has philosophical differences with the chief over community
policing and other issues, and thinks Parks should step down. Hahn
appoints the members of the Police Commission, who will decide Parks'
fate.</TE>
<TE>   Commission members have asserted that a formal evaluation process,
not political considerations, will guide their choice.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Parks returned to subjects he has tried to
spotlight repeatedly in recent weeks, including efforts to make
officers more accountable and his efforts to control crime.</TE>
<TE>   He also defended his record on community policing, a sore point in
his relations with the mayor, by attacking community policing options
that he perceives serve only the most active and vocal community
members.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD should be "in partnership with the entirety of the
community, not just with people who show up at [police] stations, not
just those who like us, not just those who bring us cookies on
Thanksgiving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks received a modestly enthusiastic response from the crowd,
which laughed at his few jokes--he had decided to seek a second term
"only after talking to my psychiatrist," he said--and offered mostly
supportive comments afterward.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marvin E. Frankel, 81, a longtime human rights advocate and former
federal judge who helped spur the establishment of federal sentencing
guidelines, died of prostate cancer Sunday in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan
in 1965, co-wrote the influential book "Criminal Sentences, Law
Without Order," which made a case for creating federal sentencing
guidelines and ending what Frankel called a highly subjective
"nonsystem" of meting out sentences.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel returned to private practice in 1978 until 1983, then
became a civil rights crusader.</LD>
<TE>   As chairman of the board of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, he traveled widely, criticizing the repression of Jews in the
Soviet Union, the living conditions of political prisoners in Israel
and apartheid in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City-born Frankel graduated from Columbia Law School
in 1948 and argued his first case before the Supreme Court in 1952 as
a member of the solicitor general's office.</TE>
<TE>   While teaching at Columbia University Law School in the 1960s, he
helped constitutional scholar Herbert Wechsler draft the brief for
the New York Times in the landmark 1st Amendment case Times vs.
Sullivan, which set strict limits on libel suits filed by public
figures.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doreen Waddell, 36, a former vocalist with the influential British
dance band Soul II Soul, died Friday after being struck by three cars
on a highway in Shoreham, England.</LD>
<LD>   Police said it appeared that Waddell, the mother of a 4-year-old
boy, had been running from a supermarket after being accused of
shoplifting. Goods from the store were found scattered across the
highway. Waddell had recently been fined for shoplifting at a
Woolworth's.</LD>
<LD>   Waddell, who used the stage name Do'reen, sang on Soul II Soul's
best-selling 1989 album "Club Classics Volume I" and was lead
vocalist on the songs "Feel Free" and "Happiness."</LD>
<TE>   The singer had not been active in the music industry for several
years.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't really earning the sort of money that she had done,
but she didn't let that get her down," Annie Ingham, a neighbor, told
the Daily Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to remember she had been a very successful singer who
had appeared on television ... and then suddenly it was all gone. She
never resented that, but it didn't mean life was easy."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County is in talks to possibly transfer a prominent but
money-losing high school it operates to the Pomona Unified School
District.</LD>
<LD>   Launched nine years ago on the campus of Cal Poly Pomona,
International Polytechnic High School is one of the county's two
specialized high schools. The 440-pupil school attracts students from
throughout Southern California, requires them to complete elaborate
projects and allows juniors and seniors to take courses at Cal Poly.</LD>
<LD>   But the school has run a $726,000 deficit this year. In an effort
to save money, acting county schools Supt. Marilyn T. Gogolin
recently initiated discussions with Pomona Unified to possibly
transfer the school to the local district's control.</LD>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the county Office of Education and Pomona Unified
stressed that a deal is not yet in place. But county spokesman Rick
de la Torre said International Polytechnic teachers and staff will
receive notices this month that their jobs could be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the possibility of a transfer of operations, we have begun
contingency plans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   William Stelzner, public relations director for Pomona Unified,
said his district has had interest in the school because so many
Pomona children attend it.</TE>
<TE>   The county also runs the High School for the Arts on the Cal State
L.A. campus, and that is not being considered for transfer.</TE>

<HD>Mary Grant Price, 85; Designed Costumes for Film and Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Grant Price, costume designer who worked on such Broadway shows
as "Oklahoma!" and motion pictures including "Sweet Smell of Success"
and "Separate Tables," then built a second career rehabilitating
mansions, has died. She was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Price, who was married for 24 years to the late actor Vincent
Price, died Saturday in Boston after a brief illness, said their
daughter, Victoria Price.</LD>
<LD>   The second of the three wives of the actor, who died in 1993, Mary
Grant met Vincent Price when she designed the costumes he and Deanna
Durbin wore in the 1948 film "Up in Central Park."</LD>
<TE>   Until their divorce in 1974, she shared his interests in art and
worked with him to market fine art to a mass market through Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. A collector of antiques, she also started a line of
high-quality reproductions of antiques, National Treasures, and
marketed them through Sears.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, Mary Grant Price began buying, rehabilitating
and selling houses in Los Angeles. After the divorce, she developed a
new career and her own company, Mansions International, to buy and
redesign or build homes here and in Boston, Santa Fe, N.M., and
Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   Her homes, including the one she had shared with Price, were often
featured in architectural and design magazines and were spotlighted
once on Edward R. Murrow's "Person to Person" TV show.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a sea captain, Mary Grant was born on the coast of
Wales and reared in Shanghai, and Victoria, British Columbia. At age
18, she came to the United States to study dance at the University of
Washington in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   But she soon switched to design and moved to New York, where she
apprenticed with clothing designers. When she saw a Broadway play to
celebrate her 21st birthday, she wrote a fan letter to the costumer,
Raoul Pene du Bois.</TE>
<TE>   He hired her. The young Mary Grant worked with him and Miles White
on costumes for such landmark musicals as "Oklahoma!" and "DuBarry
Was a Lady" and then landed her own commission to dress the cast of
Cole Porter's "Mexican Hayride." She also designed costumes for such
musicals as "Seven Lively Arts" and "Polonaise," and Billy Rose
revues.</TE>
<TE>   The soon-to-be Mary Grant Price also began working in movies,
beginning with "Wonder Man" in 1945, starring Danny Kaye.</TE>
<TE>   Among other motion pictures for which she designed costumes
through the 1950s were the 1955 version of "We're No Angels,"
starring Humphrey Bogart, "The Vagabond King," narrated by her
husband, and three Burt Lancaster films, "Sweet Smell of Success,"
"Separate Tables" and "The Devil's Disciple."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her daughter, who lives in Santa Fe, Price is
survived by a stepson, Vincent Barrett Price of Albuquerque, and a
sister, Clay Grant Davidson, of Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   No services are planned. Memorial donations may be made to the
Delta Society, 289 Perimeter Road East, Renton, WA 98055.</TE>

<HD>New Challenge to Legislative Term Limits Vowed</HD>
<DH>Propositions: Teachers union suffers upset on sales tax
measure despite extensive advertising against it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI, DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A day after voters soundly defeated a measure to extend legislative
terms, a key supporter of the effort vowed to challenge California's
strict limits again and would not rule out November as a possibility.</LD>
<LD>   The other five proposals on Tuesday's ballot--including plans
dedicating gas sales taxes to transportation and authorizing bond
sales for parks and for new voting equipment--all passed, with nearly
all votes counted.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said the high
Republican turnout in the primary election contributed to the defeat
of Proposition 45.</LD>
<TE>   The measure, which would have allowed state legislators to seek
four more years in office, went down on a vote of 58% to 42%, with
only Los Angeles and San Francisco counties voting in favor.</TE>
<TE>   A disappointed Wesson described the outcome Wednesday as "an
opportunity lost" and said there would be another challenge to the
12-year-old limits. "I was surprised by the margin," he said. "It
would be closer in a November election when more Democrats turn out."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur, manager of the No on 45 campaign, brushed aside
Wesson's contention that timing was an issue.</TE>
<TE>   "If Proposition 45 had been defeated narrowly, I could see how
career politicians in Sacramento would be desperate enough to try
this again in November," Schnur said. "But voters overwhelmingly
rejected this effort to kill term limits and they would again in
winter, spring, summer or fall."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, senators must leave their posts after two four-year
terms, and Assembly members must move on after three two-year terms.
Those limits will force Wesson and Senate leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco) out of office in 2004, though Wesson could seek a state
Senate seat.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 45 would have allowed legislators to run for an
additional four years by securing signatures of 20% of the voters who
cast ballots in their districts in the prior election.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said polling showed that voters' attitudes toward the
measure changed when they learned it would cost counties money to
verify the petitions. He said he has not decided whether he will make
another bid to extend terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what happened was that people were more afraid about the
cost than anything," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said Wednesday that he didn't take a position on
Proposition 45 because he "didn't have a dog in the fight." The
initiative applied only to legislators, he noted, and not to
statewide officeholders.</TE>
<TE>   Davis would not say how he voted, calling it "a private matter,"
and suggested that he will not change his neutral stand any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "You never say never, but I think voters have spoken pretty
clearly, twice," Davis said. "I'm not saying I wouldn't examine the
issue somewhere down the road. But certainly in the short term, I
think we have to respect the will of the voters."</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. also suffered an upset Tuesday with
the passage of Proposition 42, which dedicates state sales taxes on
gasoline to transportation projects. Traffic-weary voters approved
the measure 69% to 31% despite a last-minute, $3-million television
advertising blitz by the teachers union and the Service Employees
International Union.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups fear that the measure will strip money from
education, health care and other services. Teachers union President
Wayne Johnson said he did not regret launching the late opposition
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew when we did it that it would be risky," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Macdonald, a spokesman for Proposition 42, said common sense
prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters want to spend the sales tax on gasoline on
transportation," he said. "That's where they thought it was going in
the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the $2.6-billion parks and water bond, Proposition
40, credited their success in part to low interest rates that make it
a smart time for California to borrow money.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Nichols, secretary of the state Resources Agency, said she
was extremely gratified by widespread support for the bond. It earned
57% of the vote, winning in counties such as San Bernardino,
Riverside and Imperial--outside the coastal areas that traditionally
support park bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Every county is guaranteed at least $1.2 million from the parks
bond. In coming months, horse trading in the Legislature will
determine how the money is spent within a variety of categories.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the measure dedicates $460 million to the purchase
and construction of urban parks, $267.5 million for buying and
preserving historically significant properties and $75 million for
restoring land along urban rivers and streams.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, ranging from Waste Management Inc. to the Nature
Conservancy, raised more than $6 million for mailers and television
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Voters barely approved a far less expensive bond measure,
Proposition 41, authorizing $200 million to help counties cover the
cost of new voting machines.</TE>
<TE>   Nine California counties, including Los Angeles, are under court
order to replace their punch-card voting systems by March 2004. The
measure squeaked by, getting 51.5% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "People were concerned about putting the state in more debt when
it's been pretty obvious over the last several weeks that we're in
big enough debt as is," said Mark Capitolo, spokesman for the Yes on
41 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But huge problems remain before L.A. County can retire its
punch-card machines, which are similar to those used in Florida's
"hanging chad" debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Conny B. McCormack estimates
the cost of a new touch-screen computer voting system at $100
million, of which Proposition 41 should cover $75 million.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said only one company in the nation makes touch-screen
voting equipment in the seven languages Los Angeles County requires.
She said the county will probably shift to an interim paper voting
system in which voters fill in bubbles with a pen.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also approved Proposition 43, which ensures that all votes
legally cast will be counted. The measure passed 71% to 29%.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a measure to crack down on insurance fraud among
California's 15,000 licensed chiropractors, Proposition 44, passed
with nearly 80% of the vote.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Knott's Berry Farm will remove its VertiGo thrill ride, an attraction
that launches people into the air, after the collapse of an identical
ride at another park, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   VertiGo, which opened in October, was closed in January after a
steel pole collapsed on the ride at Challenge Park in Ohio. The park
was closed at the time, and no one was injured. The cause of the
collapse has not been determined.</LD>
<LD>   Dismantling of the rides in Buena Park and Ohio will begin
immediately, Knott's officials said.</LD>
<TE>   VertiGo resembles a small spacecraft with six open-air seats and
is held by guide wires from three 300-foot poles. Riders are shot
into the air and given the sensation of being suspended in space.</TE>

<HD>Sister Act in Congress Is Closer to Reality</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Boosted to a Democratic primary victory in part through the
fund-raising prowess of her sister, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, Linda
Sanchez on Wednesday relished the prospect of joining her older
sibling in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Sanchez, a former labor attorney, narrowly defeated South
Gate Councilman Hector De La Torre. She is now considered the
overwhelming favorite in the largely Latino 39th Congressional
District in southeast Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "You showed me that this experience was really worth every ounce
of energy," said Linda Sanchez to Loretta, her voice cracking during
her victory speech. "If I am so lucky to win in November, I really
look forward to walking the halls of Congress with you."</LD>
<TE>   While salsa music blared at her Tuesday night celebration at a
Whittier restaurant, Linda Sanchez and her sister worked their way
through dozens of supporters angling for pictures of what could
become the first sister act in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so great to just be near them at these moments," said their
father, Ignacio Sanchez. "Just to breathe the same air is an honor."</TE>
<TE>   The district, which stretches from the immigrant gateway
neighborhoods of South Gate and Lynwood to the racially mixed
middle-class communities of Lakewood and La Mirada, was added last
year after the 2000 census. Its borders were carved out to increase
Latino representation in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Sanchez, an Orange County Democrat, called her sister's
victory important not only for Latinos but also for women. And while
they agree on many issues, she expects her more liberal sister to cut
her own path in Washington. "I'm excited at the possibility of her
being elected to the House," she said Wednesday. "She has lots of
talents, some of them different than mine, and I will try to help her
any way I can."</TE>
<TE>   Political observers say Linda Sanchez's immediate task will be to
dispel perceptions that she is an outsider from Orange County who
bought the election with big sister's help. Sanchez, who moved to
Lakewood in 1999, raised about $450,000, much of it with Loretta's
assistance. De La Torre raised about $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's barrage of negative mailers and cable television
advertisements angered many Latino leaders, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Linda has lots of fence-mending to do," said Jaime Regalado,
executive director at the Edmund G. Brown Institute of Public Affairs
at Cal State Los Angeles. "She ran a very negative campaign, and
virtually all the opponents in the race really disliked her
personally for it."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 33, said she was the victim of several negative ads
herself, and said she would try to repair relations with fellow
Democrats before the November election, in which she will run against
Republican businessman Tim Escobar.</TE>
<TE>   The Sanchez sisters grew up in a family of seven children in
Anaheim. Nine years older than Linda, Loretta playfully admits being
the "bossy" older sister who often played mother, dressing Linda in
the mornings and shuttling her to school.</TE>
<TE>   As adults, the sisters first teamed up politically in Loretta's
stunning upset victory over longtime incumbent Robert K. Dornan in
1996. Linda helped as a campaign worker in that effort and subsequent
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Their roles reversed last year, when Linda decided to run for the
open 39th District seat against four other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Sanchez returned from Washington on weekends and walked
precincts with her sister. She also tapped her donors and Washington
connections for contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The Linda Sanchez donor list, on file with the Federal Election
Commission, includes people from across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Painter Ann Stokes, who runs an art colony in West Chesterfield,
N.H., said she was approached by someone who asked for a contribution
"for Loretta Sanchez's sister."</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I don't know Linda Sanchez, but if she is Loretta's
sister, then I'll do it,' " said Stokes, who gave $250 last month.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said Loretta Sanchez's help was crucial. Her
sister ended up with 34% of the vote. De La Torre followed with 29%
while Assemblywoman Sally Havice captured 19%.</TE>
<TE>   Although victory belonged to Linda Sanchez, Loretta Sanchez also
stands to benefit. Still smarting from a controversial fund-raiser at
the Playboy Mansion in 2000, Loretta's role in the campaign helped
her reestablish credibility, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a power nationally, you have to prove you have power in
your own home base," said Allen Hoffenblum, a longtime political
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   While there have been other sibling teams in Congress, most
notably Robert and Edward Kennedy, the Sanchezes would be the first
sisters to serve simultaneously, according to the Sanchez campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Both are described as aggressive and headstrong, but they often
differ politically. Loretta Sanchez, a 42-year-old former
businesswomen, focuses on fiscal issues. Linda, who comes from a
labor background, says she's more attuned to civil rights and
immigration issues.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual move during the campaign, most of the Democratic
candidates criticized Sanchez and demanded that she pull negative
cable TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre appears to have suffered the most in ads that he says
distorted his record in South Gate. The ads called him corrupt even
though law enforcement authorities consider him a corruption fighter.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre kept his vow to not engage in negative campaigning, a
move some say hurt his chances. But he said he'll live with his
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be able to get up and look myself in the mirror and be
comfortable with everything I did," he said. "I don't think she can
say the same."</TE>

<HD>School Bonds Make the Grade</HD>
<DH>Education: Voters OK 63 of 71 measures, with most aided by
55% approval threshold.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A wave of school bond measures won voter approval in Tuesday's
California primary election, bolstering the hopes of education
advocates that decades of lean times for school construction may be
ending.</LD>
<LD>   Voters approved 50 of 57 local school construction bond measures
for kindergarten through 12th-grade districts and 13 of 14 for
community college districts, according to School Services of
California, a company that provides information to school systems.
All told, the K-12 bonds represented $3.5 billion, and the community
colleges' totaled $2.3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The lower threshold for school bond measures enacted by the
state's voters in 2000 provided the decisive edge in dozens of
districts, but aggressive campaigning also made a difference.</LD>
<TE>   The measures were largely successful despite backers' initial
concerns that a strong Republican turnout would dampen their chances.
The measures faced blanket opposition from the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just dynamite," said Scott Plotkin, executive director of
the California School Boards Assn. "It sure seems to have brought out
a lot of people, conservative or not, who wanted to support the
schools."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results continued a string of victories that began in
November, when all 25 school bond measures on the ballot were
successful. The November election was the first test of Proposition
39, the 2000 initiative that reduced the state's long-standing
requirement for a two-thirds majority to approve property tax
assessments. Under Proposition 39, school districts can submit
measures to the voters for 55% approval by setting up community
oversight and limiting the tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   In the two decades before November, just over half of the school
bond measures passed, said Ron Bennett, president of School Services
of California.</TE>
<TE>   "To have 100% pass at the 55% level, that's amazing," Bennett said
of the November results.</TE>
<TE>   Still, school advocates had worried the November results were an
aberration.</TE>
<TE>   "Patriotism was high," Bennett said. "People were thinking about
their kids and their communities."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results prove the trend is not fleeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think folks were persuaded by the arguments and could see for
themselves that some of the schools in their own communities needed
this kind of help," said Plotkin of the California School Boards
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of Proposition 39 was felt strongly in largely
conservative Orange County, where all six school districts and the
North Orange County Community College District passed their bond
measures thanks to the 55% threshold.</TE>
<TE>   From the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District measure,
which garnered 65.7%, to the community college district's, which
received 57.4%, none would have made it under the old standards.</TE>
<TE>   "Prop. 39 is certainly making it more doable," said Gary
Rutherford, superintendent of the Huntington Beach City School
District, which passed a $30-million measure. "To have to reach some
supermajority, that was an unfair disadvantage for schools."</TE>
<TE>   Most striking was the success of community college districts,
which often have more difficulty connecting with voters.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 14 community college districts that proposed bond measures,
only one--West Valley Mission Community College in Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz counties--did not pass.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the 13 districts would not have passed without the lower
limit.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question the two-thirds voter requirement had become an
insurmountable burden for many districts," said Scott Lay, director
of state budget issues for the Community College League of
California, the statewide association of community college districts.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale residents Tuesday passed a community college bond aimed
at improving parking and buildings as well as updating technology,
electrical systems and plumbing. Nearly 58% of the 21,819 voters
approved Measure G, a $98-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good day for education," said Armine Hacopian, a member of
the college's Board of Trustees and co-chair of the measure. "We're
ready to put it to good use."</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 18 school districts passed bond measures with more than
two-thirds majorities, even though they didn't need them.</TE>
<TE>   In Beverly Hills, a concerted community effort resulted in a
nearly 79% yes vote on a $90-million bond to renovate aging school
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Gwen Gross said she put together a campaign that included
community meetings, endorsements, phone banking, cable and television
spots describing the projects that would be funded, and a Web site.
Endorsements came from the City Council, homeowner groups and the
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a huge, momentous effort for a lot of people," Gross
said.</TE>

<HD>Possible Uses for El Toro Land Could Be Decided in Six
Weeks</HD>
<DH>Base: Buyers would face Measure W restrictions unless
Irvine annexes property. 'All we know is that there's not going to be
an airport,' says Rep. Cox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Christopher Cox, who has pushed for a private sale of the
4,700-acre El Toro Marine base for eight years, said the details of
how it would be sold, its potential uses and who would control its
development would be hashed out in the next six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy will declare the property surplus April 23. Until
Tuesday's vote, Orange County planners had worked for almost a decade
to build a commercial airport there.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a work in progress," Cox (R-Newport Beach) said
Wednesday. "All we know is that there's not going to be an airport."</LD>
<TE>   The county's plans were crushed after 58% of Orange County voters
approved rezoning the base as parkland, open space and institutional
uses, including museums, a university and a sports complex.</TE>
<TE>   Any new owner developing the land through the county would be
hamstrung by Measure W. Irvine, however, wants to annex the property
and would not be tied to the same zoning.</TE>
<TE>   The local measure also doesn't affect about 14,000 acres around
the site where building was restricted for 56 years because of jet
noise from the Marine base. A state zoning panel has continued those
restrictions, citing the county's plans for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The development community was abuzz Wednesday about how to get a
piece of the former base if it is sold.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a home builder in Orange County that would
not submit a proposal to make a purchase at that site," said Tom
Dallape, a vice president of the Hoffman Co., a land brokerage in
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Building at El Toro would take deep pockets, though. It could take
years before legal issues, rezoning battles, toxic cleanup in some
areas and site preparation are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Early reports indicated interest from potential buyers ranging
from the Irvine Co., which owns most of the land around the base, to
Ross Perot Jr. It was unclear whether the land would be offered to a
single buyer or split up and sold in parcels.</TE>
<TE>   Local developers declined to share their intentions.</TE>
<TE>   "Until more is known about what the Navy intends to do and what
their process is, it is premature to comment," said John Christensen
of the Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   Laer Pearce, spokesman for the Southern California Building
Industry Assn., said developers were eager to build in the base but
said another initiative to amend zoning inside its boundaries would
probably be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The development community wishes we could try to meet the housing
gap with more of that land than would become available to us under
Measure W," Pearce said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gollis, chairman of the Orange County chapter of the Urban
Land Institute, agreed that developers are anxious to put forth
housing proposals for the land. Developers believe they can convince
either county voters or Irvine council members that redevelopment
would be more viable and attractive with more intense building in
some areas, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to what is the optimum plan for a park," he said.
"There is going to be lots of give and take."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who fought the county's plan as one of
the board's two-vote anti-airport minority, said the land must be
sold consistent with Measure W's restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure allows for different visions of a park, said Bill
Gayk with the Center for Demographic Research at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have some real intensive uses there, or it can be a place
where you can stroll on for miles," he said. "It is going to take
some time before we have clarification on what it all means."</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters, meanwhile, continued their fight against the
park plan Wednesday, announcing that they intend to file a lawsuit
challenging the measure as unconstitutional.</TE>

<HD>Report Bolsters Bid to Secede</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: LAFCO says Hollywood can survive financially if
it splits from L.A. It could join Valley and harbor proposals on the
November ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood would be financially healthy if it split off from Los
Angeles, a state agency said Wednesday, greatly increasing the
likelihood that a secession proposal for the area will make the
November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   If that happens, Los Angeles voters could face three secession
plans at the same time--for Hollywood, the harbor area and the San
Fernando Valley. Such a combination, secession proponents say, would
improve the prospects for all three.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Wednesday by the Local Agency Formation
Commission envisions an independent Tinseltown, population 185,000 to
200,000, that would stretch from the Hollywood Hills to Melrose
Avenue. Thanks in large part to tourism, a five-member Hollywood city
council would have a budget of $176 million, with a surplus of $6
million after four years, according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would contract with Los Angeles for services
during a multiyear transition period, just as a Valley city and
harbor city would.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO reviews incorporation proposals and decides whether to
present them to the voters. The commission has given every indication
it will put the Valley, harbor and Hollywood plans on the November
ballot, if at all possible.</TE>
<TE>   To win, each proposal would have to carry a majority of votes
within the breakaway region and citywide. Secessionists had to
collect the signatures of 25% of registered voters within the regions
to submit the proposals to LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   Combined, the secession areas account for nearly half the city's
population of 3.7 million. The Valley alone is home to 1.4 million.
The harbor area's population is 161,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Having all three of them on the ballot would give it a better
shot, since it requires a majority vote in both jurisdictions," said
Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who sits on the LAFCO
board and represents parts of Hollywood and the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, City Council members and municipal labor
unions plan to mount an aggressive campaign against secession. Hahn
said he intends to raise $5 million for the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be bad for L.A. to lose any part of the city, whether it
be Hollywood, Boyle Heights or San Pedro," Deputy Mayor Matt
Middlebrook said Wednesday. "But the mayor is confident that
Hollywood will remain a part of Los Angeles for a long, long time.
Los Angeles provides great services to all these communities."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood breakaway drive has had a lower profile than the
other divorce campaigns. But supporters said the LAFCO report will
give their efforts a big lift.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a first," said Gene La Pietra, a Hollywood
nightclub and cafe owner who has spearheaded the campaign. "It's a
revolution without guns. It's the process at it's very best."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, who owns the Circus Disco and Arena Cafe on Santa
Monica Boulevard at Highland Avenue, spent $125,000 to fund the LAFCO
report. He also headed the effort that gathered 45,000 signatures to
put the proposal on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Ferris Wehbe, a secession booster who donated $5,000 to the cause,
said that, like the movements in the San Fernando Valley and harbor
area, Hollywood secession is rooted in a frustration with the quality
of city services.</TE>
<TE>   'Los Angeles Is Not Doing Its Job'</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is going to be an independent city," Wehbe said. "Not
because we are so smart and wonderful, but because the city of Los
Angeles is not doing its job."</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of Hollywood, residents seemed to like the idea.
They said secession might improve Hollywood's police and social
services, ease its parking crunch and reinforce its singular
identity.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood ... is its own entity," said Wendy Rose, who moved to
Hollywood last month from Bakersfield and supports secession. "It's
its own place. It exists with or without the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   But Kerry Slattery, who lives in Silver Lake and manages a
bookstore in Los Feliz, said she opposed secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be encouraging and celebrating diversity, but we should
also be sharing our strengths to make the city of Los Angeles
better," Slattery said.</TE>
<TE>   The state report stopped short of a complete endorsement of
Hollywood cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO consultants said a new city would need to pay Los Angeles
$11 million per year for revenue that L.A. would lose as a result of
the secession.</TE>
<TE>   If its boundaries are those suggested Wednesday, Hollywood would
also need to cut services by about $10 million each year for the
first three years, to make up for a loss in tax revenue and to build
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Its city council members would be elected at-large, and it would
have a city manager, city clerk and city controller.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, the city would lease police, fire and other
essential services from Los Angeles, but secession advocates have
said that they would probably contract with the county Sheriff's
Department for law enforcement after the transition period.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti Says Hollywood Ungrateful for Past Help</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Eric Garcetti, whose district includes
Hollywood, said secession advocates took the city's largess when the
area was down-and-out and want to leave now that the area is doing
well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, 'Thanks for the help, now, goodbye,'" Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom La Bonge, who represents Los Feliz and much of the
eastern end of Hollywood, said the city has to work harder to
convince Hollywood voters that Los Angeles can meet their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lesson in this for the city," La Bonge said. "You've
always got to listen to the people, and you've always got to improve.
It's like a marriage--you've always got to work to make it better."</TE>
<TE>   La Bonge also said Hollywood has something of its identity to lose
if it leaves Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this city as a whole, from Chatsworth to San Pedro and
from Boyle Heights to Venice," the councilman said. "The Hollywood
sign is in Griffith Park, and Griffith Park is in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to get the Hollywood sign."</TE>

<HD>San Francisco Turnout Is Unusually Low</HD>
<DH>Balloting: Past foul-ups are avoided, but fewer than 27% of
registered voters show up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Recently stung by embarrassing ballot miscues, this city managed to
pull off an election Tuesday that officials called free of mistakes
but--in typical San Francisco political style--not free of
controversy.</LD>
<LD>   There were no known lost or mishandled ballots, no activists on
the losing side of close races screaming for a recount.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, while voter turnout was down statewide, local elections
officials were chagrined that voting here--which historically runs
higher than the state average--plummeted to what could be an all-time
low.</LD>
<TE>   Less than 27% of registered voters cast ballots, compared with 31%
statewide, figures show.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to spend the time to find out why people did not come
out to vote," said Department of Elections chief Tammy Haygood.</TE>
<TE>   Officials largely attribute Tuesday's turnout to a lack of
galvanizing issues and few Democratic contests in this largely
Democratic city.</TE>
<TE>   Critics suggest another reason: voter frustration over lost and
mishandled ballots in the last election, after which a dozen ballot
box lids were found floating in San Francisco Bay. The developments
prompted a state investigation and a demand by the secretary of
state, who oversees California elections, that local officials
re-canvass 325,000 votes from the November 2000 races.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters have seen the way their ballots were mishandled, and many
decided to stay home rather than see their vote dishonored," veteran
activist Ross Mirkarimi said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a preelection poll that showed that 31% of San Francisco
voters no longer trust local election officials to properly handle
their ballots, Haygood said Wednesday that she wasn't buying the
"no-confidence" contention.</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever I go, I just don't hear voters saying that," she said.
"The people who are not under the dome of City Hall have a lot more
confidence in the election process than people under the dome--the
activists and spin makers--want to give them credit for."</TE>
<TE>   On election night, some voters who did report to the city's 649
polling spots said they were less discouraged by past foul-ups than
by complicated ballots that left them ready to scream.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Lemoult stood in a ballot cubicle Tuesday and gnashed her
teeth. "I'm at a complete loss here," she said after voting. "I'm a
graduate student and political science major, I speak English as a
primary language and I am still confused by the instructions to
complete these ballots. I can only imagine how difficult this must be
for people who speak English as a second language."</TE>
<TE>   Lemoult said the city should offer preelection classes on how to
handle the mass of information voters are confronted with inside the
ballot cubicle. Haygood says the city will do just that: "We'll do
whatever we can to demystify this process."</TE>
<TE>   Other voters were not put off. "It's OK to complain about the
process but I think many people use that as an excuse to stay home,"
said Anu Maria, a 35-year-old high-tech worker. "Go ahead and
complain, but come to the polls and make your noise."</TE>
<TE>   Mirkarimi says the city first must win back its credibility among
voters before they will return to the polls in acceptable numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be a time where San Francisco was the positive
contrarian to state trends," he said. "We'd have more, not less, than
the California average of people who care enough to turn out and
vote. But those days are gone."</TE>

<HD>Little League Official Accused of Spying on Children</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 65-year-old Long Beach Little League administrator who allegedly
used a hidden camera to spy on children using a bathroom in his home
faces federal child pornography charges, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Laurent "Larry" Blumenthal was arrested Tuesday afternoon at his
Temple Avenue home in Signal Hill by FBI agents and Signal Hill
police, said Police Chief Don Pedersen.</LD>
<LD>   Blumenthal has been indicted on charges of possessing child
pornography, FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley said.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Blumenthal was ordered held without bail at the
Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles by U.S.
Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Johnson. A bail hearing will be held Friday.</TE>
<TE>   According to an affidavit, Blumenthal placed a hidden camera in
his upstairs bathroom to secretly film juvenile boys.</TE>
<TE>   A 14-year-old boy spending the night at Blumenthal's home in
January discovered the hidden camera and a motion detector, Bosley
said. He took pictures of the spying devices and turned them over to
police, she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 14, a sheriff's computer forensic examination team
searched computers seized from Blumenthal's home and "identified
images of child pornography on the hard drive," Bosley said. They
also found videotapes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blumenthal had been a senior director--overseeing coaches and
managers and performing other administrative duties--for the Long
Beach Little League for more than a decade. He resigned the day his
home was searched, Pedersen said.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 13, Is Stabbed in Group Confrontation Near School</HD>

<LD>A 13-year-old boy was in stable condition Wednesday after being
stabbed during a confrontation with as many as 14 other teenagers in
front of his Garden Grove intermediate school, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We suspect it is gang-related," Sgt. Mike Handfield, a spokesman
for the Garden Grove Police Department, said of the fracas, which
began about 5 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Handfield said the boy was at a department store near Jordan
Intermediate School when he was confronted by a large group of boys
ages 13 to 15. They apparently moved to the sidewalk by the school,
he said, where the boy was stabbed twice with a knife.</LD>
<TE>   When police arrived, the boys fled on foot. Seven were caught and
held for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded teenager was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange.
His wounds did not appear to be life-threatening, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Parks Takes Aim at Finance Reform</HD>
<DH>Politics: Winner in county supervisor race cites need for
new election fund-raising laws and renews opposition to the Ahmanson
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emboldened by her victory over a big-money rival, slow-growth
advocate Linda Parks said her first priorities as a new member of the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors will be to call for campaign
finance reform and put the brakes on the Ahmanson Ranch housing
project.</LD>
<LD>   Even before Parks takes office in January, Supervisor Steve
Bennett said Wednesday he plans to revive the campaign finance issue
at the supervisors' Tuesday meeting. Parks and Bennett say local
fund-raising records shattered in this week's primary election
illustrate a need for reform.</LD>
<LD>   "My opponent spent a half-million dollars attacking me," Parks
said. "We really need to even the playing field. There are some major
issues at the county level, and reform will reduce the ability of big
money to influence those decisions."</LD>
<TE>   Action is necessary, Bennett said, to prevent a repeat of the
$600,000 race between Parks and millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman
and the record $1.5-million campaign for district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Although outspent by Hoffman 5 to 1, Parks topped the former
technology executive 53% to 47% at the polls to win the Thousand
Oaks-based 2nd District office.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for district attorney, veteran prosecutor Greg Totten
won by a 2-to-1 margin despite Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh's
expenditure of $1 million of his father's money.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said he will propose next week that contributions be
limited to $500 per individual and that voluntary spending maximums
be set. A similar plan failed to gain much support when Bennett first
announced it last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But Bennett said he hopes Tuesday's election and modifications to
his earlier proposal will make the board more receptive.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though those two won, how many good candidates who don't
have the political capital to withstand that kind of attack are going
to throw their hat in the ring?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people would feel like they couldn't stand up to a
half-million-dollar campaign, and that deprives the voters of more
quality candidates to choose from."</TE>
<TE>   If Bennett is rebuffed by the other supervisors, Parks said she
will support a reform measure once she is sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually wrote Thousand Oaks' first campaign reform law," said
Parks, a city councilwoman. "It's time to have a county law on the
books."</TE>
<TE>   In a second supervisorial race, embattled incumbent Judy Mikels
edged a law enforcement-backed challenger in her quest for a third
term. On Wednesday, Mikels said she stands firm in her opposition to
an expanded retirement package for sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw everything at me that they possibly could, and I still
won," Mikels said. "They couldn't do it. They couldn't unseat me. So,
no, I'm not scared into submission."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels took 51% of the vote, with Moorpark fraud investigator John
Lane 708 votes behind in unofficial results.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 absentee ballots won't be counted until Friday, but
Lane said he does not expect the election's outcome to change.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said the close call is not a signal that voters want her to
mellow her brusque style or sever ties to developers. She attributed
Lane's strong performance in the Simi Valley-based 4th District to
voters' empathy for law enforcement after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. Lane is a retired Los Angeles police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think the public safety unions worked it really hard with
their uniforms on," she said. "The whole 'America's Heroes' trick
worked for him."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies withdrew their support for Mikels after she
refused to approve a costly retirement benefits upgrade sought in
labor negotiations. The union backed Lane's campaign with money and
manpower, sending throngs of deputies and firefighters to walk
precincts on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Lane also targeted constituents who felt stung by Mikels' personal
style. And he offered himself as a slow-growth alternative to Mikels,
who supports the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development and received
campaign contributions from billionaire developer David Murdock as
well as mining and business interests.</TE>
<TE>   Lane, devastated by his brother's death from a long illness on the
day before the election, was gracious toward his opponent on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to focus on my family," he said. "I wish her well with
all the major problems this county is facing. I really do hope she is
able to bring peace in this settlement with the deputies."</TE>
<TE>   The deputies must now resume talks with a Board of Supervisors
that includes Mikels. If negotiations drag into next year, deputies
will have to contend with Parks, whom they also targeted for defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Union President Glen Kitzmann said his group doesn't plan to
change its strategy or scale back any demands. He maintained that
supervisors, not deputies, are to blame for stalled talks and said
there is little he can do.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always willing to work with whoever's there," he said.
"Both Judy Mikels and Linda Parks portrayed themselves to the public
as being strong public safety advocates. Now we'll see whether that
was just talk."</TE>
<TE>   In a fourth contested office, Assistant Recorder Phil Schmit will
most likely face Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez in a November
runoff. Schmit, endorsed by retiring Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean, led
a pack of six candidates with 34% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez squeezed into second place with 20%, 284 votes ahead of
county Board of Education trustee Yvonne Gallegos Bodle. Bodle did
not concede on Wednesday, saying she will wait until all absentee
votes have been counted.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was the lowest ever for a gubernatorial primary, election
officials said. Just 30% of the county's 385,000 registered voters
went to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' arrival on the Board of Supervisors could trigger other
changes on key board decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is fervently opposed to the Ahmanson Ranch development in
the Simi Hills. Supervisors approved the project in 1992, but it has
been delayed by more than a dozen lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery of a flower thought to be extinct and a threatened frog
in 1999 further stalled the project.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are now considering a new environmental study on
whether the project can be built without harming the threatened
species.</TE>
<TE>   If that hurdle is cleared, Bennett said he believes more review of
the project's effect on traffic may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to follow the process, but it's likely that traffic will
remain as an issue that needs additional study," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic report is grossly inadequate," she said. "We'll see
if I have an opportunity to vote on it."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Parks will pursue her first choice--trying to persuade
developer Washington Mutual to sell the land for permanent
preservation as open space.</TE>
<TE>   Although Washington Mutual has expressed no interest, Parks called
selling the acreage a "win-win" solution.</TE>

<HD>Hole Offers a Whole Lot of Challenges</HD>
<DH>The renowned golf course's 18th is among the trickiest,
and the gorgeous scenery is downright distracting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much can go wrong at golf's most celebrated hole, the 18th at Pebble
Beach, where the straightest path from tee to green crosses the
surging ocean and a long arc of rocky beach.</LD>
<LD>   You might try to play too sharp an angle across the water. You can
hook the shot, or hit it short. Thousands of balls plunge into the
surf or carom crazily on the rocks.</LD>
<LD>   Lifelong golfer Norm Gordon has suffered both results.</LD>
<TE>   "The 18th," he says, "is the most intimidating hole I've ever
played."</TE>
<TE>   You can be overwhelmed by the beauty--the crashing waves, the
sunlight, the trees. Harvey Goldberg flew out from Montreal and found
himself transfixed by the ragged shoreline and cypress-covered hills
of the Monterey Peninsula. He struggled all day to take a proper
swing.</TE>
<TE>   "You're playing in awe," he says. "To try to beat [a score of] 80,
which I can do back home--forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't just a golf hole, it's one of the genteel sport's
sacred places. It grew to renown during the earliest days of
televised tournaments--the spectacular finishing hole of Bing
Crosby's famed tournament, "the Clambake."</TE>
<TE>   Generations of golfing legends and celebrities have passed across
the manicured fairway and into memory: Clark Gable, Ben Hogan, Bob
Hope, Arnold Palmer, Richard Burton, Joe DiMaggio, Jack Nicklaus,
Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to measure up to that greatness can play havoc with the
delicate precision of a golf swing.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember standing on the tee, and it's like, 'Oh, Lord,' " says
Anne McAndrews, a top amateur when she first played Pebble Beach.
"You can't help but reflect on who's been here before you and all the
historical significance of the place. You feel like you're at the
Sistine Chapel."</TE>
<TE>   Her own tee shot at the 18th reflected a due degree of care. She
grabbed a four-iron and decided to swing easy.</TE>
<TE>   "At the last moment," she says, "out of the corner of my left eye
I spied the ocean--the deep, blue sea. And that's where my ball
went."</TE>
<TE>   Disaster always looms. But something about Pebble Beach draws
golfers from around the world every day of the year. They come
despite fog and rain and icy winds. They come despite some of the
costliest green fees in America--$350 a person. Tee times are booked
18 months in advance and, to make the list, you must also stay at one
of the Pebble Beach hotels. Rooms at the Lodge start at $475 a night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the course to play in the United States," says Alan N.
Stillman, the chairman and chief executive of a New York restaurant
group. He walked off the 18th one recent afternoon after firing a
double-bogey 7. His second shot hit the rocks and bounced back onto
the fairway. He promptly knocked the next one into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The hole beat me," Stillman admits. But he smiles about it. "When
you come 3,000 miles to play a course, it must be something special.
It was more than I expected it to be."</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of holes are well-known beyond the sphere of
hard-core golfers. In his book, "The 500 World's Greatest Golf
Holes," George Peper ranks the 18th at Pebble Beach in his "best of
the best" category alongside the 15th at nearby Cypress Point, the
13th at Georgia's Augusta National and the 17th on the old course at
St. Andrews, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "As a closer, Pebble's 18th is in a class of its own, the climax
to top all finales," Peper writes. "[It's] the quintessential hole on
America's most cherished links."</TE>
<TE>   Photographer Joann Dost, once a professional golfer, estimates she
has shot at least 100,000 frames at Pebble Beach, including aerial
shots of the 18th. The 543-yard, par-5 hole is positioned so you
could take every stroke, including your final putt, only yards from
the surf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always, always changing," Dost says. "I've seen 25- and
30-foot waves that have ... hit and broken and gone across the 18th
green. You've got weather all the time, and that really adds to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Heavy storms sometimes halt play, but generally the golfers bundle
up and endure. "At Pebble Beach, the wind can blow so hard the sea
gulls are reduced to walking, and wind coupled with driving rain,
hail and even snow can make controlling a golf ball nearly
impossible," writes Jaime Diaz, author of "Hallowed Ground: Golf's
Greatest Places."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz quotes Johnny Weismuller, the Olympic swimmer-turned-Tarzan,
after playing through a storm in 1960: "I've never been so wet in my
life."</TE>
<TE>   He also quotes Jack Nicklaus: "If I had only one more round of
golf to play, I would choose to play it at Pebble Beach."</TE>
<TE>   The man behind Pebble Beach was Samuel F.B. Morse, captain of the
1906 Yale football team. He came west and made the critical decision
to spare the prime lots of the peninsula from development.</TE>
<TE>   The golf course opened in 1919. It was sold a few years ago--along
with three nearby courses, hotels and other land--for $820 million,
to a group that includes Clint Eastwood, Arnold Palmer and Peter
Ueberroth.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of old photos decorate the Tap Room, a pub just off the
18th where golfers congregate after playing Pebble Beach. Some make
it here as part of an annual pilgrimage. Others regard the trip as a
once-in-a-lifetime indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   Don Wallace still talks about the time he played Pebble 30 years
ago. He was a longhaired college kid, with a prodigious slice,
dragged here by his parents. Over the first 17 holes, he says, he
lost 36 golf balls. On the 18th, he made what he calls "a Copernican
leap," lining up to allow for the massive curvature of his shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of facing the hole," he says, "I faced straight out to
sea."</TE>
<TE>   One great slice put him in the middle of the fairway. Another put
him on the green, to the astonishment of those watching. He
three-putted for a five. "Now I can look people in the eye and say,
'Sure, I played Pebble Beach. I parred 18,'" Wallace says. That
became important many years later, when he became an editor at Golf
Digest. "Maybe it's why I got the job."</TE>

<HD>Colleges, Moorpark Schools Hit Jackpot</HD>
<DH>Education: Bond victories will provide sorely needed funds
to improve county campuses and address overcrowding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moorpark school leaders joined county community college officials
Wednesday to celebrate the passage of bond measures giving both
districts millions of dollars for a new school, auditoriums, parking
garages and a regional training academy for police and firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   "Someday my feet will touch the ground but not for a while," said
Phillip Westin, chancellor of the Ventura County Community College
District. "We spent two years planning this. We made it real clear
that this was not a wish list but a needs list."</LD>
<LD>   The college district-backed Measure S, a $356-million bond that
passed with 66.7% of the vote, provides funds to cover building needs
for the next 30 to 50 years. Ventura College, the oldest of the three
colleges, will receive most of the money because its facilities are
in the worst shape, Westin said.</LD>
<TE>   Bond proceeds will also pay for a $24-million training academy
near the Camarillo fire station for police, sheriff's deputies and
firefighters, the chancellor said.</TE>
<TE>   Passage of Moorpark Unified School District's $33-million bond
measure clears the way for a new school in the overcrowded district.
The current 7,800 enrollment is expected to grow by 21% over the next
five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked real hard, we walked precincts and made phone calls up
to 7:30 p.m. [Tuesday] night, and it paid off because we got 69.5% of
the vote," said Supt. Frank DePasquale, noting that similar bond
measures failed in 1997 and 1998. "We have at least five years' worth
of projects. And one of them is a brand new school."</TE>
<TE>   DePasquale hopes the school, to be built just north of High Street
and Spring Road near a new housing tract, will alleviate
overcrowding. The additional classroom space will eliminate the need
for the district's 100 portable classrooms spread over nine campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The school, to cost an estimated $12 million and open in about
three years, is the top priority now. DePasquale proposes that the
school accommodate kindergarten through eighth-graders but a final
decision won't be made until fall. Other priorities include
additional classroom space, spending $1 million for new technology
and a performing arts auditorium at Peach Hill Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Bond payments will cost the typical Moorpark homeowner about $8 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Community college leaders also worked hard to win over voters.
They gave presentations to civic groups and sent out mailers in a
simple question-and-answer format so as not to break the law that
prohibits open campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Students from Oxnard, Ventura and Moorpark colleges launched voter
registration drives, and public officials, including Ventura County
Sheriff Bob Brooks, a Moorpark College graduate, endorsed the
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The 70 proposed building projects will be scattered among the
colleges. Westin will form a committee to rank the projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to do so before because I didn't want to jinx it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements will include building computer labs, classrooms and
parking garages and renovating gymnasiums, libraries, athletic fields
and auditoriums.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the measure means Ventura County property owners will
pay an additional $18.97 a year for every $100,000 of assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   In Fillmore, city officials held out hope that Measure Q, an
attempt to finance the maintenance of a new swimming pool, could
still be approved. About 10,000 absentee ballots countywide remained
uncounted.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is winning 1,201 votes to 638, but needs 66.6% of the
vote. It currently has 65.3%, officials said. "We need to find about
75 'yes' votes," Deputy City Manager Tom Ristau said. "We are still
holding out hope."</TE>
<TE>   The measure would cost property owners up to $15 a year.</TE>

<HD>No Health Threat From Dioxane-Tainted Wells, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Water: O.C. district takes steps to purge the chemical from
supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State health officials cleared the way Wednesday for reopening nine
wells that had provided drinking water to more than 100,000 Orange
County residents before testing revealed traces of a potential
carcinogen.</LD>
<LD>   The amount of dioxane in the well water does not pose a health
risk, the state Department of Health Services concluded after a
series of tests. The wells provide drinking water for Newport Beach
and parts of Costa Mesa and Fountain Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel there isn't any significant risk to the public with the
use of these wells," said David Spath, chief of the division of
drinking water and environmental management at the state Department
of Health Services.</LD>
<TE>   Cities and water districts had been forced to buy water from
Northern California and the Colorado River after the wells were
closed in January.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical, used to stabilize industrial solvents, was
inadvertently added to the water supply by the Orange County Water
District during an ongoing process in which treated sewage is
injected into the ground. The injections provide a buffer between
fresh drinking water and salt water.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the long-term health effects of dioxane, a
man-made chemical that also shows up in foods such as shrimp,
tomatoes and coffee, and household products such as shampoo, soap and
baby lotion. Federal environmental officials have classified it a
probable human carcinogen and the state recently deemed it a
"contaminant of concern." It is one of about 50 compounds that the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed as new potential
drinking water contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   There are no federal or state testing requirements or limits for
dioxane, but the state recommends closing water wells if it shows up
at elevated levels. Dioxane has been found in ground water in the
Silicon Valley and the San Gabriel Valley, but water officials
believe Orange County is the first place along the coast where it has
been discovered. In the other regions, industrial waste has
contaminated water with the substance.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Orange County Water District's 230 wells in northern and
central Orange County, 72 have been tested for dioxane so far.
Ten--nine active and one inactive--showed trace levels of the
chemical.</TE>
<TE>   Although the levels of dioxane in the wells is far below the point
at which the state recommends sealing off water supplies, officials
decided to shut the nine active wells.</TE>
<TE>   Since its four wells were shut Jan. 28, Newport Beach has spent
about $300,000 on imported water. The city began reopening its wells
Wednesday, said Dave Kiff, assistant city manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted the reassurance of the Department of Health Services
that the levels of this chemical were below anything that should
cause us concern as stewards of our community's water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa Consolidated Water District, which serves Costa Mesa,
reopened one of its three wells Wednesday, and plans to tap the other
two as needed, said Diana Leach, general manager. The wells supply
one-third of Costa Mesa's drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley has no plans to reopen two wells that were closed
by dioxane contamination, a city official said. The city's other
wells provide enough water to supply the city. "If we moved into the
summer months and the demand was there, we would put the wells back
in service," said Bob Kellison, the city's field services manager.
"At this time, we don't have to and we'd like to continue to monitor
them."</TE>
<TE>   A 10th contaminated well that serves Irvine and parts of Tustin,
Orange and Santa Ana Heights was already out of service when the
dioxane was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Water District has stepped up treatment of the
sewage injections to ensure more dioxane isn't added to the ground
water. But the effort continues to cleanse the dioxane from the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   It will cost about $10 million over two years to build several
ultraviolet light and peroxide treatment facilities to clean the
water once it's extracted from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have also asked the district to reimburse them for buying
extra imported water, an issue that a district committee will discuss
next week, said district spokeswoman Jenny Glasser.</TE>

<HD>Seasoned Politicos the Victors</HD>
<DH>Primaries: Among newcomers, two are likely to become the
first openly gay men in Assembly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Blessed with the ubiquitous name identification that
comes from two decades in public office, Democrat March Fong Eu was
widely considered a strong favorite as she attempted a comeback to
her old job as secretary of state.</LD>
<LD>   But the grandmother, who turns 80 this month, met her match
Tuesday in Assemblyman Kevin Shelley--or more accurately, perhaps, in
California's Democratic establishment, which abandoned tradition and
strongly sided with the San Francisco lawmaker, helping him line up a
parade of endorsements and finance a torrent of television ads.</LD>
<LD>   "The party was a factor. A million slate cards, getting all those
endorsements--it was a big help," Shelley said Wednesday during a
whirlwind tour of the state with Gov. Gray Davis and other Democratic
winners. "But frankly, we just hustled."</LD>
<TE>   Shelley's victory this week was perhaps the most surprising
outcome in California's down-ballot primary contests, which were
largely won by seasoned politicians returning to positions they once
held or moving up the ladder from the Legislature to statewide
office. Shelley will face Republican Keith Olberg in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant development probably occurred in two Assembly
races in which openly gay candidates--John Laird in Santa Cruz and
Mark Leno or Harry Britt in San Francisco--won primary contests.
Because both areas are strong Democratic bastions, their primary wins
all but guarantee an openly gay man will be elected to the
Legislature this fall for the first time. Four openly lesbian
candidates have been elected to the Senate and Assembly, starting
with Sheila Kuehl of Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for insurance commissioner, a position that has gained
new prominence since Chuck Quackenbush left the job in a cloud of
scandal two years ago, Democratic voters selected a familiar face:
former Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tom Calderon (D-Montebello) had far outpaced Garamendi
and another prominent Democrat, former Orange County Assemblyman Tom
Umberg, in fund-raising. But much of Calderon's money--more than $1.5
million--came from the insurance industry, and the perception that
Calderon, like Quackenbush, was too cozy with insurers, may have
doomed his candidacy, some political experts said. He finished a
distant third.</TE>
<TE>   "Him taking all that insurance company money--that was the kiss of
death," said Dick Rosengarten, editor of the CalPEEK political tip
sheet. "He got pounded by Garamendi and Umberg."</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi will face Republican Gary Mendoza, a Los Angeles
attorney with strong ties to failed GOP gubernatorial candidate
Richard Riordan, in November. Mendoza survived a scare from Stefan
"Watchdog" Stitch, an insurance auditor who legally changed his name
to convey a consumer-friendly image on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   With Democrats now holding all but one of California's eight
statewide offices, Democratic Party leaders are gunning for complete
dominance this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We will sweep all eight," predicted the Democratic Party's brash
spokesman, Bob Mulholland. "We've got eight thoroughbreds in this
race. They've got a bunch of misfits.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans are so weak, they could not even get their
candidate for the state's top schools job into the runoff," he added,
referring to the defeat of Assemblywoman Lynne Leach (R-Walnut Creek)
in the race for superintendent of schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats' choice for schools chief, state Sen. Jack O'Connell
(D-San Luis Obispo) will square off against Anaheim school board
member Katherine Smith in November, because no one captured a
majority in Tuesday's general election for the nonpartisan post.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of Republican Bill Simon's run to unseat Democratic Gov.
Davis, members of both parties believe the GOP's best hope of
averting a shutout may lie in the race for state controller, where
state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) will face former EBay
Vice President Steve Westly.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock edged out Board of Equalization member Dean Andal in a
battle of Republican taxpayer advocates, thanks in part to his quirky
ad campaign featuring "Angus McClintock," a fictional Scottish
relative who boasts McClintock is "tight as a bullfrog's behind, and
that, me friends, is watertight."</TE>
<TE>   True to his image as self-styled cheapskate, the ads were actually
recycled from McClintock's failed 1994 race against Controller
Kathleen Connell, who is being forced out by term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "Angus makes a very simple point in a very humorous way: This is
an office designed to combat waste, and you need someone with a
proven record of being a fiscal watchdog," McClintock said. "I have
devoted my career to identifying waste in California's budget and
proposing the reforms needed to streamline the state's
bureaucracies."</TE>
<TE>   Westly beat out another Board of Equalization member, Johan Klehs,
for the Democratic nomination, despite Klehs' efforts to paint Westly
as a dot-com millionaire trying to buy an election. Westly, who has
taught at Stanford and worked for years in the Democratic Party,
including losing an election for party chairman to Jerry Brown more
than a decade ago, may be able to avoid the pitfalls that commonly
befall wealthy candidates, according to some political experts. At
the very least, McClintock will need a lot of campaign cash to make
his case, and he has never been known as a fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Several Democratic incumbents cruised to victory unopposed or
after mere formalities and are heavily favored to win this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer will face state Sen. Dick Ackerman
(R-Irvine), Treasurer Phil Angelides will square off against former
Public Utilities Commission President P. Gregory Conlon, and Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante will meet state Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz).</TE>

<HD>In Jolt to O.C., Navy to Sell Off El Toro Land</HD>
<DH>Military: The move, which kills any chance of an airport on the
site, will raise cash for the Defense Department. A developer buying
spree is possible.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after Orange County voters rezoned a proposed international
airport out of existence, Navy officials unexpectedly announced Wednesday
that they intend to auction off the El Toro Marine base where it would
have been built.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which effectively kills any chance of a new Orange County
regional airport on the 4,700-acre site, caught transportation officials
by surprise and left a gaping hole in plans to use El Toro to alleviate
anticipated air-traffic congestion across Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The decision probably will increase pressure on Los Angeles
International Airport and other regional airfields from Long Beach to
Ontario. While there is room for some expansion at those airports,
experts said it is unlikely it could keep pace with the projected need.
Political tensions could escalate over who should bear the noise and
inconvenience of an airport designed to serve a broad public.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it increases pressure on some other airport to get built into
that second [major] regional airport," said Raphael Sonenshein, a Cal
State Fullerton political science professor. "At a certain point you have
to start all over again and ask what the purpose is of the expansion, and
put everything on the table, including whether LAX or Southern California
should have that much air traffic."</TE>
<TE>   What will ultimately happen to the closed El Toro base is uncertain
after the Navy's decision. Although Orange County voters Tuesday
overwhelmingly backed Measure W to rezone the area as parkland, that
doesn't mean a park will get built.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario bandied about Wednesday, developers could embark on
a land rush, buying up chunks of the former base, drafting development
plans and then having Irvine annex the area, removing the development
shackles imposed by Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation is money. Analysts estimate that prime land at the site
could be worth $750,000 to more than $1 million an acre. The site, near
affluent communities in south Orange County, is the largest piece of
developable property that private landowners do not already own in the
county.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest on a scale of one to 10 will be a 10 for anybody that's
a land buyer," said Craig Atkins, a principal at O'Donnell/Atkins Co., a
land brokerage in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>Cox Had Supported Letting Market Decide</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision was a partial victory for Rep. Chris Cox
(R-Newport Beach), who has advocated for eight years that the base should
be sold and market forces should decide what would be built.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said Wednesday that Defense Department officials only recently
became receptive to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The key difference was the Sept. 11 terror attacks, he said. With war
in Afghanistan, defense officials wanted to dispose of two bases in
Orange County, one at El Toro and the other in Tustin, and collect money
from land sales.</TE>
<TE>   "They were anxious to get these bases wrapped up," Cox said. "They
didn't want to stay bogged down in local planning decisions. I was
encouraging them to move as soon as [the vote was in on] Measure W. . . .
You can believe that the Pentagon would have taken the same steps to
pursue aviation uses at El Toro if the vote had gone the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Regionally, scrapping plans for an El Toro airport could fuel an air
transportation crunch and retard economic growth, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Expanded regional airport capacity and diversity is important over
the next 20 years," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. "It will
definitely constrain the economy if there is no other capacity built
outside of LAX."</TE>
<TE>   But anti-airport forces dispute assumptions that Southern California
will face an air-capacity shortage without El Toro. They say Orange
County's population will increase by only about 500,000 in the next 20
years and that air-travel demands can be met by John Wayne Airport and
other area airports.</TE>
<TE>   Under current proposals, LAX could add up to 17 million passengers a
year. Ontario International Airport's passenger volume could be doubled
to more than 15 million a year. And several million more passengers a
year could be added to John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   But if trends continue, regional demand will increase from 90 million
passengers a year to 164 million by 2025, according to estimates by the
Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency. The
association also predicts that air cargo will almost triple from 3
million tons a year to 9 million tons by 2025 for Los Angeles, Orange,
Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to build El Toro could cost the region up to 135,000 jobs and
$16 billion to $18 billion a year in lost commerce, the association has
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a significant impact on employment growth in the
region," said SCAG Executive Director Mark Pisano. "The economic decline
is not small and we will still have deficiencies despite improving other
airports."</TE>
<TE>   While the region's facilities can accommodate some of the projected
demand in air travel, most of them have capacity limits and drawbacks for
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The Palmdale Regional Airport, for example, is more than 100 miles
from Orange County, presenting access problems. Ontario Airport has air
pollution concerns that could frustrate expansion plans. John Wayne is
capped at 8.4 million passengers a year through 2005; a recent proposal
endorsed by Orange County supervisors would limit growth there to 9.8
million until 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has proposed that LAX's planned
expansion be limited to 78 million passengers a year. The volume is now
about 61 million. But LAX expansion opponents said Wednesday that they
oppose adding passengers to the facility's aging infrastructure, already
at 52% over the capacity it was built to serve in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is committed to the 78 million annual passenger cap," said
Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "Los Angeles is taking responsibility for
what it can take responsibility for. Orange County and northern San Diego
County can't look to Los Angeles to solve their problems forever. If not
El Toro, they need to look for other solutions to their need for air
transportation."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn announced last fall that he would scale back a $12-billion
expansion plan for LAX developed under his predecessor, Richard Riordan.
The mayor also has asked airport commissioners to "intensify planning to
develop Palmdale Regional Airport" by marketing the facility to airlines
and developing a master plan for the 17,000-acre airport, which has no
commercial air service.</TE>
<TE>Both Sides Caught Off Guard by Decision</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's announcement that it would carve up El Toro caught both
sides of Orange County's airport debate off guard. Yet there were
murmurings in recent months that Navy officials were tired of the
seemingly endless bickering--which included four ballot issues over eight
years--and would move to end the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials telegraphed their intentions last week when they
threatened to sell another Orange County property, the 1,600-acre former
Tustin helicopter base, if local authorities couldn't agree on a
redevelopment plan. The Navy ultimately agreed to turn over most of the
base to Tustin but kept a 240-acre residential area to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy said it would sell El Toro--whether in pieces or as a
whole--to the highest bidder, and in keeping with zoning changes included
in Measure W, which passed Tuesday by a 58% to 42% vote. The proceeds
would go to the Defense Department's Base Closure Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll work closely with the federal government and community to
evaluate our options," said Gary Simon, head of the county's El Toro
planning office.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision won't deter an expected legal challenge to Measure
W by airport supporters, who argue that disposal of a federal military
base is too important to be decided by a local zoning measure.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off will probably shift the nine-year, $100-million battle
over what to do with El Toro from a debate over airports to such issues
as homes versus businesses and schools versus factories.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro debate was long and rancorous, and the lines were sharply
drawn on election day. About 44% of South Orange County voters went to
the polls, compared with 33% of North County voters. About 81% of South
County voters supported Measure W, while 63% of North County voters
opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   A federal environmental review of the base--required before the Navy
can dispose of the land--will be released Friday, Navy officials said.
Cox said the review has been written to "comfortably comply with Measure
W, so that no aviation use will be further pursued by Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Airport critics said selling off El Toro won't erase worries about
toxic contamination at the air base, which is on the nation's list of the
most toxic public properties.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure who's going to buy four runways and all of the toxics
underneath those runways," said Bruce Nestande, chairman of one of two
groups that has promoted an El Toro airport since 1994. "It's not going
to be that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Conveyance of the property for another use is still possible,
officials said, but the only application before the Navy is for an
airport that voters have said the county can no longer build.</TE>

<LD>Their primary campaigns behind them, Gov. Gray Davis and his
Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. plunged Wednesday into their
head-to-head race for governor by sparring over energy, abortion and the
state's fiscal troubles.</LD>
<LD>   A day after Simon easily defeated rivals Richard Riordan and Bill
Jones in a nasty, low-turnout, three-way primary, the Republican nominee
tried to rally his fractured party behind him. The three Republicans
appeared together and--just days after Riordan called Simon an
extremist--pronounced themselves united in the fight to topple the
Democratic incumbent.</LD>
<LD>   "We can beat Gray Davis, not only because he's vulnerable, but because
he's got the wrong ideas," Simon said.</LD>
<TE>   In their initial appearances, the two candidates set off on precisely
the course that political strategists had projected: Simon tried to frame
the campaign as a referendum on Davis's handling of California's budget
and energy problems, while Davis set about casting his rival as a
far-right conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who faced no serious primary challenge, barnstormed across
California with the newly elected candidates on the Democrats' statewide
ticket. In Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fresno and San Diego, he hammered
Simon for his conservative positions on social issues.</TE>
<TE>   The governor mentioned abortion at every stop.</TE>
<TE>   "His views are totally out of sync with Californians," Davis said. "He
is pro-life, pro-gun, pro-voucher and pro-deregulation." In the primary,
Simon's opposition to abortion rights and gun control helped him
consolidate his party's conservative base and swept him past the
better-known but politically more liberal Riordan. Those same positions,
however, are more difficult for him now. Across the nation,
Democrats--including Davis--have defeated Republicans in part by
exploiting such issues with less conservative voters in general
elections.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon dodged questions on abortion and guns. He
responded to one question on abortion without uttering the word
"abortion"--and, in fact, without saying anything on the topic at all.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Simon told reporters after his unity breakfast with Riordan
and Jones that he would simply "change the subject" if Davis insists on
debating abortion, guns and other social issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The things that are on Californians' minds--the overwhelming
majority--is the economy and their pocketbooks and our schools," Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>Simon Stresses Budget Problems, Test Scores</TE>
<TE>   Simon argued that the main issue in the election will be Davis'
leadership. He criticized Davis for low school test scores, the state's
$17-billion budget shortfall and the lack of a master plan for roads,
water and power.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been inactive," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, though, defended his record and made it clear that guns
and abortion will be showcase issues in the race.</TE>
<TE>   In a CNN interview, Davis said Simon was "trying to minimize his
positions, because he is anti-choice, and he knows he is out of step with
Californians. But he is sadly mistaken if he is trying to convince people
that the governor has nothing to do on those issues."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, long known as one of California's most pugnacious candidates,
also raised questions about Simon's qualifications for running the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the voters of this state are going to entrust the
fifth-largest economy on the planet to someone who never held office
before, much less someone who rarely votes," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   During the primary, Simon, a former federal prosecutor who has run his
family's investment company, was criticized by Riordan and Jones for not
voting in more than a dozen elections.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't paid his dues," said Davis, a former lieutenant governor
and state Assembly member. "Hasn't served on boards and commissions.
Hasn't participated in the electoral process. He hasn't even really run a
company. He is just an investor."</TE>
<TE>   With Davis on the attack, Simon inevitably spent part of his day on
the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm out of step," he said. "If I was out of step with
California voters, I don't believe I would have gotten over 1 million
votes yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, the day began festively at the LAX Westin Hotel, where he
spoke to President Bush by speakerphone before a crowd of Republican
loyalists. Bush vowed to campaign for Simon in California "as soon as
possible" and joked about having encouraged Riordan to run against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to congratulate you for running a great race," the president
told Simon. "I've got a lot of friends out there, including the folks you
defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Even Riordan, who on Friday called Simon a "sanctimonious hypocrite,"
heaped praise on his former opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "We Republicans are lucky to have a great new leader, the next
governor of the state of California, Bill Simon," Riordan told the
cheering crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a senior White House official said it seemed that
Davis' television ad blitz against the President's preferred candidate
had "absolutely eviscerated Dick Riordan."</TE>
<TE>   But a GOP strategist close to the White House blamed the former Los
Angeles mayor for running "an absolutely horrible campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The strategist also voiced concern over whether Simon could overcome
the Davis attacks on abortion and guns. If Davis manages to beat Simon
handily in November, it could boost the governor's political prospects
"on the national stage."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' dual victories Tuesday--his easy walk to the Democratic
nomination and his instrumental role in pushing Riordan from the
race--helped to revive long-standing speculation that he might seek
national office. Early in his first term, Davis was talked about as a
potential presidential candidate, but that speculation largely
disappeared during last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the governor insisted that he planned to serve a full
four-year term--and not to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever like to rule things out, but I have no intention of
running," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing the things you would do if you would be a candidate,
like going to Iowa or New Hampshire. I fully intend to serve four years,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The realities are it is very hard for a Californian--with a full-time
Legislature--to participate in presidential politics," Davis said. "No
California governor has ever done it. Many have tried. All have lost."</TE>
<TE>Simon Cites Brown, Reagan as Role Models</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Davis surrounded himself with labor leaders, but
appealed to voters beyond his Democratic Party base.</TE>
<TE>   "All the independents and Republicans who might not be too happy with
the Republican nominee, we will welcome you," Davis told a crowd in
Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, too, tried to reach beyond his base. He cited as role models
two governors, and one of them was a Democrat, Pat Brown. The other was
Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he wanted to be a "builder" like Brown, who oversaw
construction of the state highway and higher-education systems in the
1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   On a more traditional Republican theme, Simon said he would rely on
private businesses to build toll roads and water facilities and to
provide power. The private sector, he said, works better than government.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he added, California has no choice: With the budget
shortfall and $170 billion of infrastructure needs, he said, the state
government will be forced to look outside government for solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Though Simon was largely successful in avoiding discussing social
issues Wednesday, he did say--in response to a question--that he would
have vetoed the landmark gay rights bill that Davis signed last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's appropriate for the government to enter into
legislation that has to do with sexual orientation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Dresner, a GOP pollster who worked for former Gov. Pete Wilson,
said Simon will have trouble steering the debate away from the topics
that Davis is determined to make the centerpiece of his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of dollars of Davis television ads on those issues could make
the task all but impossible, he said. Dresner also voiced doubts about
Simon's chances of overcoming the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much stuff there," he said. "The average voter in the
state is really not looking for a conservative Republican. I just don't
see it."</TE>
<TE>   In pressing the abortion issue Wednesday, Davis also challenged
Simon's contention that the next governor will not do much to affect
abortion rights in California.</TE>
<TE>   Davis noted that he has appointed 178 judges, saying every one of them
supports "a woman's right to privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also pointed to his approval of seven abortion rights bills,
including one to protect access to clinics and another to expand
distribution of contraceptives.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon, it does make a difference," Davis told a cheering crowd.
"And I'm not budging an inch."</TE>

<HD>In Jolt to Orange County, Navy to Sell El Toro Land</HD>

<LD>Hours after Orange County voters rezoned a proposed international
airport out of existence, Navy officials unexpectedly announced Wednesday
that they intend to auction off the El Toro Marine base where it would
have been built.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which effectively kills any chance of a new Orange County
regional airport on the 4,700-acre site, caught transportation officials
by surprise and left a gaping hole in plans to use El Toro to alleviate
anticipated air-traffic congestion across Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The decision probably will increase pressure on Los Angeles
International Airport and other regional airfields from Long Beach to
Ontario. While there is room for some expansion at those airports,
experts said it is unlikely it could keep pace with the projected need.
Political tensions could escalate over who should bear the noise and
inconvenience of an airport designed to serve a broad public.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it increases pressure on some other airport to get built into
that second [major] regional airport," said Raphael Sonenshein, a Cal
State Fullerton political science professor. "At a certain point you have
to start all over again and ask what the purpose is of the expansion, and
put everything on the table, including whether LAX or Southern California
should have that much air traffic."</TE>
<TE>   What will ultimately happen to the closed El Toro base is uncertain
after the Navy's decision. Although Orange County voters Tuesday
overwhelmingly backed Measure W to rezone the area as parkland, that
doesn't mean a park will get built.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario bandied about Wednesday, developers could embark on
a land rush, buying up chunks of the former base, drafting development
plans and then having Irvine annex the area, removing the development
shackles imposed by Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation is money. Analysts estimate that prime land at the site
could be worth $750,000 to more than $1 million an acre. The site, near
affluent communities in south Orange County, is the largest piece of
developable property that private landowners do not already own in the
county.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest on a scale of one to 10 will be a 10 for anybody that's
a land buyer," said Craig Atkins, a principal at O'Donnell/Atkins Co., a
land brokerage in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision was a partial victory for Rep. Chris Cox
(R-Newport Beach), who has advocated for eight years that the base should
be sold and market forces should decide what would be built.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said Wednesday that Defense Department officials only recently
became receptive to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The key difference was the Sept. 11 terror attacks, he said. With war
in Afghanistan, defense officials wanted to dispose of two bases in
Orange County, one at El Toro and the other in Tustin, and collect money
from land sales.</TE>
<TE>   "They were anxious to get these bases wrapped up," Cox said. "They
didn't want to stay bogged down in local planning decisions. I was
encouraging them to move as soon as [the vote was in on] Measure W."</TE>
<TE>   Regionally, scrapping plans for an El Toro airport could fuel an air
transportation crunch and retard economic growth, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Expanded regional airport capacity and diversity is important over
the next 20 years," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. "It will
definitely constrain the economy if there is no other capacity built
outside of LAX."</TE>
<TE>   But anti-airport forces dispute assumptions that Southern California
will face air-capacity shortages without El Toro. They say Orange
County's population will increase by only about 500,000 in the next 20
years and that air-travel demands can be met by John Wayne Airport and
other area airports.</TE>
<TE>   Under current proposals, LAX could add up to 17 million passengers a
year. Ontario International Airport's passenger volume could be doubled
to more than 15 million a year. And several million more passengers a
year could be added to John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   But if trends continue, regional demand will increase from 90 million
passengers a year to 164 million by 2025, according to estimates by the
Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency. The
association also predicts that air cargo will almost triple from 3
million tons a year to 9 million tons by 2025 for Los Angeles, Orange,
Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to build El Toro could cost the region up to 135,000 jobs and
$16 billion to $18 billion a year in lost commerce, the association has
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a significant impact on employment growth in the
region," said SCAG Executive Director Mark Pisano. "The economic decline
is not small and we will still have deficiencies despite improving other
airports."</TE>
<TE>   While the region's facilities can accommodate some of the projected
demand, most have capacity limits and drawbacks for travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Regional Airport, for example, is more than 100 miles from
Orange County, presenting access problems. Ontario Airport has air
pollution concerns that could frustrate expansion plans. John Wayne is
capped at 8.4 million passengers a year through 2005; a recent proposal
endorsed by Orange County supervisors would limit growth there to 9.8
million until 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn has proposed that LAX's planned
expansion be limited to 78 million passengers a year. The volume is now
about 61 million. But LAX expansion opponents said Wednesday that they
oppose adding passengers to the facility's aging infrastructure, already
at 52% over the capacity it was built to serve in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is committed to the 78 million annual passenger cap," said
Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "Los Angeles is taking responsibility for
what it can take responsibility for. Orange County and northern San Diego
County can't look to Los Angeles to solve their problems forever. If not
El Toro, they need to look for other solutions to their need for air
transportation."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn announced last fall that he would scale back a $12-billion
expansion plan for LAX developed under his predecessor, Richard Riordan.
The mayor also has asked airport commissioners to "intensify planning to
develop Palmdale Regional Airport" by marketing the facility to airlines
and developing a master plan for the 17,000-acre airport, which has no
commercial air service.</TE>

<HD>Riordan's Bid Plagued by Missteps</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When damaging details of Bill Simon Jr.'s political past surfaced
13 days ago, the brain trust of Richard Riordan's campaign learned about
them the same way everyone else did: by reading the newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   The same with a 1991 videotaped interview in which Riordan condemned
abortion as murder. The snippet was used to devastating effect in a Gray
Davis attack ad; Riordan's gubernatorial campaign learned of the clip,
again, from a newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   The former Los Angeles mayor spent $6 million on TV ads and handed out
generous salaries to a few favored aides. But modest expenditures--like
$25,000 for opposition research that might have dug up the revelation
that Simon had once registered as an independent--were nixed as
unnecessary. Most Riordan strategists were convinced the primary was
superfluous and the real race was against Davis.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's 18-point victory over Riordan on Tuesday represents a
turnabout of nearly 60 points from Riordan's peak in opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   That breathtaking collapse by Riordan was a product of miscalculation,
arrogance, naivete and foolish frugality, according to several observers
who saw the campaign up close.</TE>
<TE>   They describe a candidate who never internalized the campaign's
message, didn't trust advisors and refused to engage in many of the
rituals--like glad-handing fellow pols or financing basic research of an
opponent--that are key to a winning campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders describe an operation fraught with mismanagement, laden with
bureaucracy and overly cocky in dismissing the need to focus on
Republican rivals Bill Jones and Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Events such as a gay rights breakfast were placed on Riordan's
schedule at the whim of novice staffers who failed to appreciate the
message such an appearance might send to conservative voters who would
dominate the primary.</TE>
<TE>   "Running a Republican primary campaign is pretty basic," said one
campaign aide who had such experience. "It's Politics 101. But here you
had people who'd never taken even that course."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the historic belly flop of the Riordan campaign came down
to a single, essential failure: a candidate and campaign that took the
primary for granted and thus ignored the crucial first step toward a
general election match-up against Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan and his like-minded campaign strategists felt they were
entitled to the nomination. In their hubris, they failed to define
Riordan, so Davis did," said Arnold Steinberg, a former advisor to the
mayor, referring to the millions of dollars in negative ads the incumbent
Democrat ran in the GOP primary. "'If the Riordan candidacy had a
rationale, his campaign had a strategy, its ads had a message for
Republicans, then Davis would have been unable to seize the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan declined to be interviewed Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At bottom, according to several involved in his campaign, the former
mayor and many advisors fundamentally misunderstood the race.</TE>
<TE>   "His political experience was nonpartisan politics in Los Angeles,"
said one Riordan strategist who, like others, spoke on condition of
anonymity. "That's fine in a primary in which we could dominate the
discussion. But once it became an ideologically based primary"--driven by
the attack ads of Davis focused on abortion and GOP loyalty--"it became
very problematic."</TE>
<TE>Simon's Team Far From Confident</TE>
<TE>   If the Riordan campaign was run with a sense of entitlement, Simon's
effort was suffused with an air of uncertainty. Indeed, despite their
expressions of confidence, some members of Simon's team were privately
looking past the primary--lining up jobs in anticipation of unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate, who ran the West Coast office of his family's
investment firm, had only lived in California 12 years. He was largely
unknown in GOP circles, despite his namesake father, a member of
President Nixon's cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   It was the approach of Simon's 50th birthday last year--and dismay at
the state of one of his children's schools--that spurred him into running
for office, one aide recollects.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a personal friend, encouraged Simon to run for governor. But
others suggested that the novice candidate aim for a lesser job, such as
state treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   In late January of last year, Simon flew to Sacramento for a series of
meetings with consultant Sal Russo, a veteran of more than 25 years in
state politics.</TE>
<TE>   During those sessions, Russo told Simon that there was no point in
running a down-ticket race. "You can't win a lower constitutional office
unless you have the top of the ticket," Russo recalled telling Simon.
With only Secretary of State Jones in the race for governor at that
point, Russo figured there was plenty of room for an alternative.</TE>
<TE>   So by the time he left Russo's office, Simon had decided to explore a
run for governor. He announced his intentions in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling candidate proceeded cautiously. There would be no final
decision until summer, after seeing whether Simon could attract donors,
staff and supporters. "There were lots of different points in the first
six month when we would say, 'Does it make sense to consider another
office?' " Simon said in an interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He began traveling the state, speaking wherever a handful of
Republicans gathered. Simon flew to Washington to meet with the state's
GOP congressional delegation. By several accounts, most were unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   Looming large was then-Mayor Riordan. By that point, he had gotten a
birthday phone call from President Bush, urging him to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, anxious to build a California base for 2004, saw the
more centrist Riordan as the ideal candidate to reach out to disaffected
women and minority voters.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday in midsummer, Simon and Russo went to visit Riordan at his
Brentwood home. Steinberg, then working for Riordan, recalled that Simon
kept asking the mayor whether he was going to enter the governor's
contest. Riordan gave no clear answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked away feeling that Riordan had lost an opportunity to
persuade Simon to withdraw from the race," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>Improvisation on Campaign Trail</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the deliberate approach of Simon and his team, the
Riordan campaign was a perpetual act of improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate embarked on his own tour of California, to get a sense
of the issues he might face. He admitted how little he knew about the
landscape outside Los Angeles; agriculture was important to California,
he said at a stop in Lodi, but he didn't know much else about the state's
No. 1 industry.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, he went on, he would hire the best experts to solve
farmers' problems. The airy lack of specificity later hurt Riordan,
especially compared with Simon's programmatic approach.</TE>
<TE>   Things went well enough, though, that Riordan decided to run. That
left him to assemble his campaign team, something he undertook from
scratch.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Riordan was that his most trusted advisors were all
Democrats. Foremost among them was William Wardlaw, once Riordan's best
friend and most important confidant. Wardlaw, more than any person
actually serving in the Riordan administration, was responsible for
shaping the mayor's political agenda and anticipating where problems
might crop up.</TE>
<TE>   But Wardlaw and others declined to follow Riordan into the Republican
contest. Besides, Riordan was already being attacked for his close ties
to Democrats and past funding of the party's candidates and causes.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan hired an assortment of Republican advisors, but many quit over
a rocky summer. Several left because Riordan ignored their urging to run
a more conventional primary campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A large part of the problem, according to several people inside the
campaign, was a lack of discipline by the candidate. Compounding that,
they said, was the absence of someone strong enough to force a regimen on
the willful Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In Wardlaw's absence, the candidate brought in Ron Hartwig, one of Los
Angeles' best public relations executives but a campaign novice. As
campaign manager, Hartwig approved things--like Riordan's appearance at a
West Hollywood gay and lesbian breakfast--that might have been
red-flagged by someone more politically savvy.</TE>
<TE>Team Beefed Up in Late Going</TE>
<TE>   Some experienced advisors finally came aboard, among them veteran GOP
ad man Don Sipple, pollster Fred Steeper and the campaign's political
director, Kevin Spillane.</TE>
<TE>   But often, campaign advisors said, Riordan seemed more captivated by
the advice he received from Hollywood friends he and his wife brunched
with on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the campaign, strategists spoke of "the triangle"--issues they
saw as undergirding Riordan's efforts. Those issues were the economy,
jobs and fiscal management, and children and education.</TE>
<TE>   Aides repeatedly emphasized to Riordan the importance of hewing to
those issues. "But he didn't ever internalize it," said one campaign
advisor. "Too often, [his message] became inclusion, abortion and women."</TE>
<TE>   That was the sort of message that played well among his Westside
friends. It also held promise for the general election, when Riordan
would have to reach beyond the Republican base to court the moderate and
swing voters needed to win statewide.</TE>
<TE>   But in a GOP primary, the message was perilous.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point came at last month's state Republican Party
convention.</TE>
<TE>   The event brought together more than 1,000 of the party's most
dedicated followers. A straw poll was set as a fund-raising benefit. The
Riordan campaign, fearing embarrassment, worked behind the scenes to kill
the popularity contest. When that failed, the candidate announced a
boycott.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, devoting exhaustive time and resources, won the straw poll and
the headlines that followed. Perhaps more important, he energized
hundreds of party activists--the kind who go home and talk to their
neighbors, set up phone trees and stick campaign signs in their lawns.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the people who get the word out," said K. B. Forbes, a
conservative Republican strategist. "These are the party's political
shock troops."</TE>
<TE>   Bad turned to worse for Riordan when he insulted former Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian at a candidates debate. The two men had never been
friendly; Deukmejian could not forgive Riordan for contributing hundreds
of thousands of dollars to the Democrat, Tom Bradley, who twice tried to
beat him.</TE>
<TE>   The former governor, still a popular figure in party circles, showed
up at the convention with three ex-state GOP chairmen who announced they
would not support Riordan if he won the nomination. Asked during the
debate about Deukmejian's comments, Riordan said: "George has a bad
memory. The only things he remembers are his grudges."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of party activists gasped.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Riordan's polling showed dramatic slippage. For weeks, Davis
had pounded the former mayor over the death penalty, abortion, energy and
crime in Los Angeles. The most damaging attack, using Riordan's own words
describing abortion as murder, was one the campaign should have seen
coming.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, chief architect of Davis' campaign, had worked for Mike
Woo, the Los Angeles city councilman, when he lost to Riordan in the 1993
mayor's race. During that campaign, Riordan's abortion quote--from a
cable television interview--had surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   It had little impact in the mayoral contest. But in the governor's
race, with Riordan trying to straddle the divide between conservatives
and centrists, the ad proved explosive. It also proved a surprise to the
Riordan forces.</TE>
<TE>   "On a symbolic issue like that, pro-choicers couldn't trust someone
who once held that view. Pro-lifers couldn't understand an evolution from
there to pro-choice," said a Riordan strategist. "It puts you in no-man's
land."</TE>
<TE>Candidate Pumps In Money</TE>
<TE>   Simon's team began to see his numbers rise. With just three weeks
left, the candidate made his move on television, plunking down his first
significant chunk of money--$850,000--for seven days of television.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan began hemorrhaging support. He canceled a long-planned Sun
Valley ski trip. He abandoned his above-the-fray position and began
attacking Simon.</TE>
<TE>   With a little over a week to go, the Sacramento Bee published a story
revealing Simon's registration as a political independent when he lived
in New York in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan strategists despaired; it was just the thing they would have
loved to throw in Simon's face at one of the gubernatorial debates, when
Simon questioned Riordan's party loyalty. But having dismissed the need
for serious opposition research, the candidate and his campaign had left
that stone unturned.</TE>
<TE>   They seized on the revelation and made it part of their last-minute
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, it was too late.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Curb Computer Access by Foreigners</HD>
<DH>Government: To boost security, some Defense Department work will be
done only by citizens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sparked by heightened security concerns since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the Defense Department has begun laying the groundwork
to ban non-U.S. citizens from a wide range of computer projects.</LD>
<LD>   The planned policy--slated for adoption within 90 days--extends
restrictions on foreign nationals handling secret information to
"sensitive but unclassified positions," which include the swelling
numbers of contract workers who process paychecks, write software, track
supplies and maintain e-mail systems.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes amid a growing awareness of the vulnerability of
government computer systems in an era when software espionage and
malicious hacking have become commonplace.</LD>
<TE>   The Defense Department's proposal, covering a work force that accounts
for one-third of federal civilian employees, would represent the most
sweeping implementation of the government's restrictions on foreign
technology workers. The much-smaller Justice Department instituted
little-noticed restrictions in July, and the Treasury Department has had
a ban on noncitizens working on its communications systems since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the restrictions are needed to get a handle on the
proliferation of foreign nationals who work on government computer
systems, but the plan has raised concerns that the government is being
xenophobic and shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said barring foreign nationals from certain computer projects
opens the prospect that key jobs will go unfilled because of a shortage
of qualified citizens--a situation exacerbated by the relatively small
number of U.S. students who pursue advanced technology degrees. Costs may
also rise sharply as higher-paid U.S. citizens replace foreign workers.</TE>
<TE>   "You can easily create a critical manpower shortage," said Annalee
Saxenian, a professor of city and regional planning at UC Berkeley who
has studied the effect of immigrants on the technology industry. "There's
probably no company in Silicon Valley that doesn't have from 10% to 40%
of their work force who are foreign nationals. . . . [Defense Department
officials may be] boxing themselves into a situation where they will lose
the best talent."</TE>
<TE>   Even Richard A. Clarke, top cyber-security advisor to President Bush,
views the restrictions as a misguided priority.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than worry about what country somebody was born in, we ought
to focus on the design and the architecture of our information systems,"
he said, adding that he supports the use of background checks, automatic
recorders that log keystrokes by programmers and stricter rules on
individuals changing data.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, trying to restrict the [information technology]
professional that we use to American citizens is not going to be an
effective approach," Clarke said. "The United States does not produce
enough American citizens who are IT-security-trained to operate our
networks."</TE>
<TE>Computer Security Is Long-Standing Problem</TE>
<TE>   Analysts long have warned about lax security in government computer
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "These [software] systems are wide open," said Ed Yourdon, an
independent expert in technology security policy. "The vast majority of
bad things done on computer systems are done by insiders--not teenage
hackers in Moscow."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, studied the use of foreign contractors by federal agencies
working to fix year 2000 software problems. It found foreign nationals
working on 85 contracts for "mission-critical" software. Yet several of
the agencies investigated lacked even rudimentary controls over
contractors' work.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy sent software or data associated with 36 mission-critical
systems to a foreign-owned contractor yet "could not readily determine
how the code and data were protected during and after transit to the
contractor facility," the GAO report said.</TE>
<TE>   "In many instances, the [Defense Department] was not aware when some
programming changes were being done by a contractor who used foreign
nationals," said David L. McClure, who led the GAO study.</TE>
<TE>   The Health and Human Services Department used software engineers from
Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine without performing background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Similar lapses were found in the departments of Energy, Agriculture
and State, as well as NASA and other federal agencies. None of those
agencies is considering new restrictions in the use of foreign nationals,
although some require regular employees to be citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department previously had been developing a system of
security restrictions for foreign nationals working on unclassified
computer operations, but Sept. 11 prompted plans for more restrictive
measures.</TE>
<TE>IT Work Routinely Given to Foreigners</TE>
<TE>   "The IT business has become largely contractual, with programming and
data work being farmed out to areas where there is cheap labor," Pete
Nelson, the Defense Department's deputy director for personnel security,
wrote in an e-mail to The Times. "If this trend does not simultaneously
take into consideration security requirements, there would be reason for
concern. Some foreign nationals--those in the most sensitive
position--may not be permitted to remain."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said no details of the policy would be made public until it
becomes final.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department had no estimate of how many noncitizens it has
as employees or contractors but acknowledged that the shift could prove
costly.</TE>
<TE>   Some major defense technology contractors also said they could not
readily estimate how many of their employees are foreign nationals.
Industry experts believe that thousands of jobs could be involved.</TE>
<TE>   Major technology contractors, such as Science Applications
International Corp. in San Diego and Computer Sciences Corp. in El
Segundo, said they can meet any new Defense Department requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller contractors may have more difficulty doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Indus Corp., a 300-employee technology contractor in Vienna, Va., that
works with the military and other government agencies, fulfills military
contracts without tapping its 40 to 45 employees who are not U.S.
citizens, said Chief Executive Shiv Krishnan.</TE>
<TE>   "In the future, there may be opportunities we can't bid on because of
the dearth of available talent," said Krishnan, who came to the U.S. from
India to study and gained American citizenship 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Kuehl, a professor of cyber-security at the National Defense
University in Washington, said any move to restrict unclassified tasks to
U.S. citizens could create a logistical nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the high-tech recession, the country faces chronic shortages
of professionals who can manage the complex computer systems, databases
and networks prevalent in government agencies. The high-tech industry
relies heavily on Indian, Chinese and other Asian workers--a group that
long has complained about being unfairly targeted on issues of U.S.
loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Those shortages prompted Congress to create a special visa program
through the Immigration Act of 1990 known as H-1B, which permitted more
than 163,000 highly skilled foreign workers to take jobs in this country
last year. Many are employed by defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   A move away from using foreign nationals also could increase
contracting costs--building pressure on managers to make do with fewer
tech professionals, which would itself be a security liability, said John
Pescatore, a security analyst with GartnerGroup Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively few U.S. students are being trained to fill the gap, while
foreign student enrollment in technology programs at U.S. universities
has soared. From 1991 to 2000, 46% of U.S. doctoral degrees in computer
science were awarded to foreign students, the National Science Foundation
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The same security concerns are being expressed about the entire
critical infrastructure"--both government and private, Yourdon said. "We
have foreign nationals working in systems that control electrical power
or move billions of dollars around the financial systems or control
trades on the Nasdaq."</TE>
<TE>   But banning noncitizens from sensitive jobs may offer little assurance
of security, he said. Three of the most damaging espionage cases in U.S.
history--those of the CIA's Aldrich Ames, the FBI's Robert Philip Hanssen
and the Navy's Walker family spy ring--involved U.S. citizens who were
direct employees of the government and had access to classified computer
systems.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. troops fighting to eradicate a pocket of Taliban and Al Qaeda
resistance in eastern Afghanistan pushed forward aggressively Wednesday,
seizing caves and ground from the holdouts, who have seen hundreds of
their fighters killed, American and Afghan commanders said.</LD>
<LD>   About half of the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters have been killed since
the offensive in the mountainous Shahi Kot district started Saturday,
Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck said at a news briefing at the Bagram air
base north of Kabul, the Afghan capital. Hagenbeck, commander of the
Army's 10th Mountain Division, said the holdouts had originally numbered
600 to 700.</LD>
<LD>   "Several hundreds of Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists are no longer
with us," the general said, as the base teemed with military activity.
"We believe that among the dead are some of the higher-ranking leaders."</LD>
<TE>   This morning, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Bryan Hilferty said at
Bagram that U.S. forces had killed about 100 of the Al Qaeda or Taliban
extremists Wednesday, while suffering negligible casualties themselves:
one sprained ankle and two cases of altitude sickness.</TE>
<TE>   So far in the operation, eight Americans and three pro-U.S. Afghan
fighters have been killed and about 70 wounded, Hilferty said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to attack helicopters and high-altitude bombing, AC-130
gunships were brought into the fray Wednesday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An Afghan spokesman, Safi Ullah, of the shura, or council, of Gardez,
said that heavy U.S. bombing had resumed this morning and that U.S.
forces had just captured another hillside containing caves, weapons and
documents. He said there were also reports that they had attacked from
the air a convoy of Taliban apparently attempting to escape.</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, 25 miles north of the fighting, U.S.-allied Afghan leaders
confirmed that the American-led coalition had gained the upper hand and
said that they consider the battle all but won.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, they are defeated," said Taj Mohamad Wardak, the governor
of Paktia province. "It will be finished in a week or so."</TE>
<TE>   But in Washington, Army Gen. Tommy Franks, who is in charge of the
U.S. campaign, described the holdouts as "very hard and capable and
dedicated fighters." Franks said an additional 200 to 300 U.S. troops
have joined the 800 Americans already fighting in Paktia province and
that he may request more troops and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The troops would join about 200 commandos from Australia, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany and Norway also on the ground, in addition to
several hundred Afghans. Most of the Afghans are outside the central
battle, blocking escape routes, but they also include front-line
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial assault Saturday was rebuffed so aggressively by Al
Qaeda fighters that the Afghan troops were forced to retreat, coalition
fighters said the momentum swung in their direction following heavy
bombing Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military personnel expressed surprise at the fierce response of
the Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   As F-15 fighter jets approached a suspected Al Qaeda cave at an
elevation of 9,000 feet, fighters stopped launching mortars at the
Americans just long enough to duck inside, said Army Capt. Kevin Butler,
30, of Pattenburg, N.J. Then, as the jets receded, the fighters reemerged
to taunt their adversaries, grinning and flailing their arms over their
heads as they threw stones at the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really expect them to try and duke it out with us," said Lt.
Col. Ron Corkran, commander of a U.S. infantry battalion. "I was just
surprised at the intensity of what I saw on the valley floor."</TE>
<TE>   In the battle zone Wednesday, Abdul Matin Hassankhail, a brigade
commander in Gardez who contributed 75 fighters to the offensive, said
the U.S.-led forces were climbing up the sides of mountains to face the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Al Qaeda fighters are mostly foreigners--Pakistanis and
Arabs--but that they are believed to be led by a prominent former Taliban
official, Saifur Rahman, who is about 40 years old.</TE>
<TE>   At the briefing at Bagram, Hagenbeck provided new details about the
deaths of seven Americans in the offensive. After a Navy SEAL who fell or
dropped from a helicopter Monday was killed on the ground by Al Qaeda
fighters, the six other Americans died in a firefight trying to rescue
him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bagram, about 25 miles north of Kabul, has become the operations
center for the campaign, from which troops and supplies are ferried south
by helicopter. There are now "several thousand" U.S. troops at the base,
said Capt. William Rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck said the incident with the Chinook helicopter occurred
shortly after midnight Monday, or what he called "D-day plus 2."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, he said, the helicopter landed on an Al Qaeda position and
took heavy fire. It managed to take off and traveled about four miles
before touching down 20 minutes later. That's when the crew realized that
one of the men was missing.</TE>
<TE>   The crew of the first helicopter was picked up by a second, but the
men insisted on going back for their comrade. When they did, a firefight
ensued in which the six servicemen were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought home the body of that young sailor," Hagenbeck said. "I
would tell you, from all indications, the Al Qaeda executed him."</TE>
<TE>   The incident illustrated the perils of the military's "leave no man
behind" motto. In a briefing Tuesday, Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa
Jr., deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had
said the six men had died in a separate mission. Defense Department
officials deferred to the general but privately explained Wednesday that
the men were killed on a rescue mission.</TE>
<TE>   Hagenbeck offered several examples of heroism in the offensive. One
person singled out was a young American who lay for hours in the snow
alone, holding off an Al Qaeda opponent trying to seize his mortar
position.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he could be reached by other U.S. forces, his body
temperature had dropped to 90 degrees, but the soldier pleaded to be let
back into the fight, Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   The expected defeat of Al Qaeda and Taliban forces probably would not
provoke much protest or excitement in Paktia province, he said, because
the public is tired of fighting. "Most people today," he said, "are
thinking that this problem should end."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Wardak, who returned to Afghanistan recently after living for 15
years in the North Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, said that some
Taliban sympathizers remain in Paktia province but that the majority of
the region's people are happy at last for the chance to fight against Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda was very strong in the time of the Taliban regime, and we
could not fight against them ourselves," he said. "But now that the
Americans have weakened Al Qaeda, all of the people are wishing to fight
against them."</TE>

<DH>Case of Kurdish woman killed by her father for rejecting his
authority illustrates Sweden's cultural double standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOTKYRKA, Sweden
</DL>
<LD>When Fadime Sahindal told police her life had been threatened, they
gave her an alarm system. When she approached politicians for help, they
told her to make peace with her parents.</LD>
<LD>   And when she appealed in television interviews for aid in escaping a
death sentence imposed by her father after she refused an arranged
marriage, she provoked sympathy among Swedes--whose more liberal outlook
she shared--but little willingness to get involved in a family matter.</LD>
<LD>   Now that she's dead, shot in the head by her father, the 26-year-old
victim of an "honor killing" is drawing attention to the cultural double
standards she battled during the last four years of her life.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the first nor likely the last immigrant daughter to shame her
hidebound clan simply by acting Swedish, Sahindal has become a martyr
among women who came to this liberal country from patriarchal cultures.
Her death was a warning to officials that they ignore at great peril the
dangers of not integrating immigrant communities.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sahindal's father, Rahmi, came to Sweden from Turkey 20 years
ago, he still was guided more by pressure from his Kurdish clansmen than
by the rule of law or love for his daughter. When Fadime braved a visit
to her mother and sister Jan. 21 in the clan stronghold in Uppsala, about
40 miles north of Stockholm, her father got wind of it.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Rahmi, who is in jail awaiting trial, told them he felt he
had no choice but to make good on his vow to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   No comprehensive statistics exist to show the extent of such honor
killings here and elsewhere in Scandinavia, where whole communities of
Kurds and other Muslim groups have found refuge. But although such
slayings are believed to be infrequent, Sahindal's death has exposed the
region's failure to integrate immigrants, with their often fundamentally
different values, into these societies. Having long looked the other way
when religious and cultural clashes came to public attention, Swedes are
pondering what more they could and should have done.</TE>
<TE>   "The message this should send to Swedish people, especially the Social
Democrats who have been in power for 40 years, is that the system isn't
working," said Dilsa Demirbag-Sten, a former government advisor on
integration affairs whose Kurdish family came to Sweden from eastern
Turkey when she was 7.</TE>
<TE>   She accuses authorities of arrogance in their view that certain rights
and freedoms accorded Nordic residents, such as gender equality and
protection from forced marriage, are not necessarily applicable to
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "Fadime's brother told police that honor killing is part of our
culture. But most Kurds don't believe that," said the 33-year-old
activist, wife, mother and recording industry executive. "There is a
package you buy when you come to Sweden, and that should include respect
for the law."</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants have been coming to Sweden in increasing numbers in the
last decade to fill a persistent labor shortage. They also take advantage
of the country's liberal asylum policy, which grants refuge from the
conflicts occurring in many of the immigrants' homelands.</TE>
<TE>   But institutional flaws--such as the two years on average that it
takes to get a decision on asylum requests--encourage those waiting for
permanent refuge to band together in bleak housing projects in what
amounts to self-imposed segregation while awaiting the right to
citizenship and work.</TE>
<TE>   At least 15% of Sweden's 9 million residents are non-Nordic and
heavily concentrated in volatile ghettos of Somalis, Kurds, Bosnians and
dozens of other ethnic groups. Scandinavia's liberal values curry little
favor in many of those quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "There are places just outside of Stockholm where the entire
population is foreign. These people aren't living in Sweden at all," said
Keya Izol, head of the Federation of Kurdish Assns. in Sweden, referring
to towns and suburbs such as Botkyrka, a 30-minute drive from central
Stockholm.</TE>
<TE>Generation Gap</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mistake to have too many people from the same town or village
or clan together," Izol added. "It is the habit of exiles to want to
protect their way of life, and in such places they hear no Swedish, they
see no Swedish television and they have no jobs that bring them in
contact with Swedish people."</TE>
<TE>   A 1995 reform of laws on refugees and immigration has worsened the
situation, Izol said, by focusing training and jobs on the younger
generation, causing strains within families as well as between immigrants
and Swedes.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been too slow to integrate the older generation and too fast
in integrating the younger ones," former Danish Justice Minister Erling
Olsen said of the Scandinavian countries, which are all experiencing
social pressures amid recent immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "We in Denmark have tended to ignore incidents in the immigrant
communities that contradict our own understanding of human rights, but we
have a responsibility to ensure our values are respected," he added. Some
arranged marriages between young immigrant women and men in their
homelands are tantamount to illegal visa sales, he said, as the grooms
are then eligible for family reunification, immigrant aid and a speedier
path to Danish citizenship.</TE>
<TE>National Outcry</TE>
<TE>   Nalin Pekgul, a Social Democratic legislator of Kurdish origin in
Sweden, shares the revulsion over Sahindal's killing but cautions against
interpreting an act of criminal extremism as typical of fundamentalist
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweden has done a better job than most countries with integration,
which is why this case has caused such strong reaction," Pekgul said.
Other governments simply avert their eyes when immigrant girls and women
are shipped home, where they face possible death, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask if the Swedish government could have prevented this
killing. I say no, but the Kurds in Uppsala could have prevented it,"
Pekgul said, blaming backwardness and illiteracy for creating an
atmosphere in which patriarchs are held in disgrace when their wives or
daughters embrace Swedish culture.</TE>
<TE>   As a figure of respect in Sweden's 40,000-strong Kurdish community,
Pekgul tried to intervene on Sahindal's behalf. The young woman had given
interviews to Swedish media about the death threats from her father and
brother, Masud, a level of defiance that Pekgul feared was only enhancing
the danger.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmaker negotiated a compromise in 1998 by which Sahindal agreed
to stay away from Uppsala and her father promised not to stalk her
outside their hometown while she was living in seclusion near Stockholm.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Sahindal had been pursuing a sociology degree and
become an outspoken advocate of the opportunities Nordic immigration
presented for women from fundamentalist backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   She braved the fatal visit to her mother and sister to say farewell
ahead of her departure for Kenya, where she was to spend this year
writing her master's thesis. Her sister is mentally disabled and suffered
Sahindal's long absence in sadness and confusion, say friends trying to
explain what might appear a reckless action. Attractive and Westernized
in her dress and demeanor, Sahindal apparently was spotted upon arrival
in Uppsala by someone in her father's entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Pekgul said Sahindal underestimated the danger of clan mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "People who come to such a level of despair that they can kill must
feel cornered in this society," said Annick Sjogren, a sociologist
directing an integration program in Botkyrka, where more than 80% of the
30,000 residents are immigrants and refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't used to women being equal to men or nakedness being taken
as natural instead of sexual or the idea that you can choose your own
partner. They get scared and become defensive and much more
fundamentalist than they would be at home."</TE>
<TE>   Sjogren and Aina Bigestans, her colleague at the Multicultural
Development Center, defend the notion of honoring cultural practices,
including arranged marriage, more strongly than is popular in the wake of
Sahindal's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling a recent conversation with an Indian friend, Bigestans said
she was compelled to agree that a marriage arranged by caring parents
with an offspring's best interests in mind might be seen as more
"rational" than partnerships forged in the delirium of young love.</TE>
<TE>   Women's advocacy groups concede that there are profound contradictions
in the way Swedes, and Scandinavians in general, balance tolerance of
ethnic traditions with a commitment to human rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Fadime was a role model for young women in this society. She was
beautiful and intelligent and brave and spoke perfect Swedish," said
Angela Beausang, chairwoman of the National Organization of Battered
Women's Shelters in Sweden. "But now she stands as a scary example. The
message from her killing is that this could happen to you too."</TE>
<TE>   But Beausang believes Sahindal's death has forced Swedes of all
backgrounds to examine their behavior and values and discuss what kind of
multicultural society they should be working toward.</TE>
<TE>   If any good is to come of the slaying, Beausang said, laws and
practices that reflect a double standard must be changed to prevent such
honor killings.</TE>
<TE>Law Bows to Tradition</TE>
<TE>   Swedish law allows girls from immigrant families to marry as young as
15, while marriage for Swedish citizens is permitted only at 18 or older.
That de facto bow to immigrant cultural practice is expected to be
legislated out of existence as momentum gathers in a national campaign to
prevent forced marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Sahindal was not the first case of honor killing to come to national
attention. Three years ago, during a visit with family members to her
Kurdish homeland in Iraq, 19-year-old Pela Atroshi was shot in the head
by her uncle on the orders of her father and brother for having refused
to marry a cousin. A few months earlier, here in Sweden, she had been
scalded with boiling water and denounced by her clan.</TE>
<TE>   The uncle received a one-year sentence in Iraq for an action that was
viewed there with greater acceptance. Atroshi's sister, now in hiding,
gave testimony to Swedish prosecutors, which led to the three men's
conviction and sentencing to terms upward of 15 years when they returned
last year to Sweden, said an activist familiar with her case.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Mohammad, a 34-year-old Iraqi Kurd who changed her name after
immigrating here eight years ago to avoid creating problems for her
family back home, estimates that there are 30 to 40 young women in Sweden
hiding from male relatives who have vowed to kill them.</TE>
<TE>Clash of Values</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad, an outspoken activist and founder of Never Forget Pela, a
movement to empower Muslim women, accuses Swedes of misguided liberalism
in their tolerance of immigrant behavior that would be considered
repressive among Nordic peoples.</TE>
<TE>   "The Swedish government is to blame because they respect the culture
and religion of immigrants but not the people themselves or their basic
human rights," Mohammad said. "This isn't about religious freedoms in
Sweden, but about religious values clashing with women's and children's
rights. It's not about Swedish culture, but about human values and
norms."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad's group, to be renamed Never Forget Pela and Fadime, plans a
memorial gathering Friday on International Women's Day to raise awareness
about the dangers facing immigrant women.</TE>
<TE>   She has sent a list of demands for legislative change to Mona Sahlin,
the government official in charge of integration policy. They include
support for raising the minimum age for marriage to 18 for all women,
advisory sessions for new arrivals on the vast differences in gender
relations they will encounter and must respect, prohibition of head
scarves or veils for girls under 16, and equal opportunity in all aspects
of education. (Parents from conservative religious backgrounds currently
can opt to remove their children from sex education classes, swimming and
other coeducational sports, and field trips.)</TE>
<TE>   While her compatriots across the ethnic spectrum lament her death and
the social ills it exposes, Sahindal had the last word in her familial
clash of cultures. Aware of the risks she faced, she told friends she
wanted to be buried in the graveyard of Uppsala's Lutheran
cathedral--alongside her Swedish boyfriend, Patrik Lindesjo, who was
killed in a car crash in June 1998. Six young female friends carried her
coffin.</TE>

<HD>Ancient World Was a Vast Melting Pot, Study Shows</HD>
<DH>Genealogy: Analysis of 11 inherited traits finds that early humans
mingled with strangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spreading out of Africa like starlings, early humans conquered the
world by embracing the strangers they encountered around the globe, not
by forcing them into extinction, as many researchers believed, according
to a new analysis of human genetic history.</LD>
<LD>   In the textbook view, the founding fathers of modern humanity emerged
suddenly from Africa about 100,000 years ago and swept into oblivion all
other prehuman species--Neanderthals, for example--that they encountered.</LD>
<LD>   A new and elaborate computer genealogy of 11 inherited traits compiled
by Alan Templeton at Washington University in St. Louis presents a very
different slant on the origins of diversity.</LD>
<TE>   Templeton's work, published today in the journal Nature, suggests that
"interbreeding, not replacement," was the rule for successive waves of
primitive humans migrating out of Africa. By mingling, these ancestral
human groups "strengthened the genetic ties between human populations
throughout the world," said Templeton, who studies the history and
geography of genes.</TE>
<TE>   In his view, the ancient world was a vast melting pot in which tribes
of human ancestors scattered, rejoined and scattered again. As they did
so, they gradually intermingled inherited traits across thousands of
generations to mix the palette of modern humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton's work is the latest riposte in a 20-year-long debate in
which anthropologists, archeologists, molecular biologists and population
geneticists have battled over human origins with rounds of research
papers scattered like hand grenades.</TE>
<TE>   Several specialists in the field enthusiastically hailed the new study
of evolutionary parentage as "brilliant," while others briskly dismissed
it as "hocus-pocus" and "nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   For all their differences, both camps agree that the earliest
ancestors of humankind evolved in Africa about 2 million years ago,
before beginning waves of migration into Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Where the scientists part company is in deciding how those ancestral
groups gave rise to anatomically modern people--with small, pointed jaws;
smooth foreheads; high, rounded skulls; and advanced mental
abilities--emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the ambiguous fossil record, researchers have turned to
the genes that code for growth and development to flesh out this missing
chapter of human evolutionary history.</TE>
<TE>   To reach his conclusions, Templeton combined published data on 11
parts of the human genome. He analyzed mitochondrial DNA--genetic
material that each person inherits directly from his or her mother--as
well as data from genes carried on the Y chromosome, which is inherited
only from fathers. He also looked at genes on other chromosomes that can
be inherited from either parent.</TE>
<TE>   His analysis detected considerable gene mixing and evidence of two
separate waves of migration out of Africa into Asia and Europe, the first
from 420,000 to 840,000 years ago and a more recent one from 80,000 to
150,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers agree that there was generous mixing of valuable
genetic traits. But they disagree about when it might have happened.</TE>
<TE>   "If those ancestral populations were all in different valleys in
Africa, you would see the same thing," said Henry Harpending, an
anthropologist at the University of Utah. "This may have been gene flow
between ancestral populations in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania."</TE>
<TE>   Templeton had made a "valiant effort," but his study "all seems too
iffy to me," Harpending said. "Going from his findings to this sweeping
picture of human evolution is a jump I can't see."</TE>
<TE>   Molecular biologist Rebecca L. Cann at the University of Hawaii said
Templeton offered "strong genetic support" for considering Africa the
geographic wellspring of humankind, but his broader analysis was
"overambitious."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the debate, paleoanthropologist Milford Wolpoff
at the University of Michigan said he felt "vindicated" by Templeton's
work. Wolpoff has long championed the idea that modern humans evolved
more or less simultaneously around the globe by sharing their best
characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   Templeton's analysis "shows that human evolution is about traits and
not about kinds of people," Wolpoff said. "Lots of things separate human
populations, but more things unite them."</TE>
<TE>   Said molecular biologist Peter Underhill at Stanford University, who
uses male DNA to track human migrations, "My problem with this whole
field is that it is not dispassionate anymore. There is a lot of name
calling . . . . That is a shame."</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Expand Aid to Colombia</HD>
<DH>Policy: Powell's remarks come as Congress signals support for a
wider role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that the Bush
administration might ask Congress to lift long-standing restrictions that
limit U.S. military aid in Colombia to the fight against narcotics.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's remarks, a shift from the administration's previous
statements, came as Congress also showed signs of changing its view and
favoring more extensive involvement in the violence-racked Andean nation.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing before a House subcommittee, Powell said that the Colombian
government's decision in February to break off peace talks with rebel
groups had changed the situation and that the administration wants to do
more to help its ally amid an intensifying civil war.</LD>
<TE>   "We will have to readjust our policies, take a hard look at what we're
doing and see if there are not other ways we can help Colombia protect
itself, short of the United States armed forces going in to do it,"
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be necessary for us to give the government of Colombia
assistance that is outside the counter-narcotics [activity] in order that
they are able to deal with this threat to their survival as a nation," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, the Bush administration has been in the midst of an
internal debate over whether to widen its role in the three-sided war
that pits a weak Colombian army and growing right-wing paramilitary
forces against two large leftist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The reappraisal has come during a period of escalating violence. The
rebels have kidnapped national political figures, hijacked an airplane
and bombed important utility installations.</TE>
<TE>   Some American officials have argued for increased assistance to help
the Colombian government combat what they view as a terrorist threat that
endangers the United States. Some have called for declaring the
destruction of the rebel groups an explicit goal of U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   But others, fearing that the four-decade war could become a
Vietnam-style quagmire for the U.S., have argued for a more cautious
approach. State Department officials have, until now, lined up on the
side of a more limited role.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, Powell spoke with caution about the U.S. commitment.
He said American officials wanted to spend additional money to help
protect a large Colombian oil pipeline, but intended this to be done
through a "passive," or defensive, approach.</TE>
<TE>   And President Bush told reporters last week that the administration
did not intend to move beyond the policy that strictly limited U.S.
military aid to counter-narcotics activities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are providing advice to the Colombian government as to drug
eradication, and we will keep it that way. The law is very clear," Bush
said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a
nonbinding resolution inviting Bush to seek broader aid for Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time to help the Colombian people help themselves," said Rep.
Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House International Relations
Committee and a longtime supporter of greater aid to the South American
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime critics of U.S. aid to Colombia also have indicated that
their view of the war may be changing.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) has said that he has an open mind about
broader U.S. military involvement in Colombia, although he believes that
the administration should continue to require that the Colombian
government do all it can to uphold human rights.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has provided Colombia with about 75 helicopters as part of
its aid package. This year, the administration has proposed spending
nearly $600 million for counter-narcotics training and $98 million to
teach a new Colombian army brigade to protect the oil pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Pentagon has been limited to providing no more than 400
military personnel to train the Colombian army and is barred from sending
U.S. troops into combat.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Mayor Held in City Hall Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Colleague who was killed planned to reveal evidence of
municipal corruption, family members say.</DH>

<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The mayor of an affluent Mexico City suburb has been arrested in
connection with the assassination of a city council member, a 27-year-old
crusader who family members say planned to reveal evidence of municipal
corruption and involvement in drug trafficking.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Antonio Dominguez, the mayor of Atizapan, was placed under house
arrest Tuesday night following a probe by Mexico state officials into the
Sept. 5 mob-style slaying of Maria de los Angeles Tames, an attorney and
the daughter of a former federal senator.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives say she had gathered evidence of widespread public works
corruption, protection rackets and drug trafficking in the city
administration. She was preparing to resign from the council and present
the evidence to state authorities, they say.</LD>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office said in a statement that Dominguez
had been taken into custody because of his "presumed involvement in the
assassination of the councilwoman, who discovered and denounced various
administrative irregularities in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Tames was a member of a family that is prominent in President Vicente
Fox's National Action Party, known by its Spanish initials, PAN. Her
mother, Evangelina Perez Zaragoza, served a year in the Mexican Senate.
Her father was a candidate for Atizapan mayor in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez also is a PAN member.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Arnal, a federal deputy from the party who knew the victim
from when both were members of a PAN youth organization, described her as
smart, tenacious and well prepared. "Her style was always to be in the
trenches without being in the spotlight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they want to question City Clerk Gerardo Antonio
Cortez and Police Chief Antonio Vega de la Garza, neither of whom has
reported to work for several days. The investigators also are probing
alleged eavesdropping conducted by "high-level city officials" on
employees, including Tames.</TE>
<TE>   Also under arrest is the mayor's former personal secretary, Daniel
Garcia, who resigned last year after Tames and other council members
complained that city purchasing procedures were rigged.</TE>
<TE>   Tames had been involved in politics since grade school and had won
awards for oratory.</TE>
<TE>   "She had very fixed ethical and moral values and did not tolerate
lies," her father, Pedro Tames, said in an interview Wednesday at the
Notimex news agency, where he is administrative director. "Her goals were
to pursue justice and women's rights and to someday run for Congress."</TE>
<TE>   But fellow members of the city council said Tames' criticism of
questionable administrative procedures and land use during open council
sessions earned her powerful enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into her slaying focused for weeks on Dominguez, who
has maintained his innocence and last week complained of harassment by
investigators. In a statement Tuesday, he said the city government wants
to solve the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want public opinion and the news media to be misguided. That
is why the attorney general's office must conduct investigations
properly, so as to prevent confusion and protect other people's honor,"
Dante Moncada, the mayor's spokesman, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tames took the council job in August 2000 at the urging of the state
PAN organization, her father said. Within three months, she was openly
critical of the lack of competition for city contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The day she was killed, she told her father she had evidence of a sham
$265,000 city cleaning contract and that she would soon turn it over to
investigators. She was shot by assailants using high-caliber weapons
about 8 p.m. as she returned home.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Alleges Iraq's Army Is Rebuilding</HD>
<DH>Sanctions: American officials present spy photos at U.N., saying
pictures prove that trucks were illegally modified for military use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>In a scene reminiscent of Adlai Stevenson displaying aerial images
of Soviet bases during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, U.S. officials
Wednesday gave diplomats here a high-tech slide show of satellite photos
that the U.S. says prove Iraq has illegally converted recently imported
trucks to weapons carriers.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual U.S. intelligence presentation was staged on the eve of
the first high-level talks between Iraqi and U.N. officials in almost two
years.</LD>
<LD>   In a visit that diplomats say was prompted by U.S. threats of military
action against his government, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri is
scheduled to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York
today before flying back to the Middle East for a round of consultations
in Arab capitals.</LD>
<TE>   Although Iraq requested the meeting, U.N. officials say Annan set the
agenda: full Iraqi compliance with U.N. demands for the return of its
weapons inspectors, who left Baghdad hours before U.S. and British
bombing raids there in December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the secretary-general is concerned, they will be talking
about U.N. resolutions, and his emphasis will be implementation,
implementation, implementation," said Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>Photos Taken From Satellites, Iraqi TV</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government says the spy photos unveiled behind closed doors
Wednesday document Iraq's brazen violation of the U.N. resolution that
established the "oil-for-food" program, under which Iraq can import
industrial goods such as heavy trucks only for humanitarian purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Proof that Baghdad is systematically defying U.N. trade sanctions
could derail any Iraqi efforts to negotiate the removal of the import
controls, even if Iraq unexpectedly agrees to admit arms inspectors,
diplomats here said.</TE>
<TE>   And any evidence that Iraq is covertly rebuilding its army reinforces
U.S. arguments that Saddam Hussein's regime must be confronted
militarily.</TE>
<TE>   "It is doubly worrying," said Catherine MacKenzie, an official at the
British mission to the U.N. "The military buildup that it would bring
about adds to Iraq's ability to project its power more effectively. And
these are vehicles that should be distributing food and humanitarian
supplies, a job that is not being done. We know that Iraq's priority is
weapons, not food or welfare, and this is one more graphic illustration
of that."</TE>
<TE>   In two sessions here Wednesday--first with top officials of the U.N.
weapons inspections unit and later with diplomats from the 15 member
states of the Security Council--a team of six unidentified U.S. officials
gave half-hour presentations of computer images taken from spy satellites
and Iraqi television.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials who saw the presentation said the U.S. showed clear
pictures of heavy-duty Russian and German trucks being unloaded at an
Iraqi port last year; the same vehicles were later photographed at Iraqi
army bases and at a military parade in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the trucks in the televised parade were towing artillery that
U.S. officials identified as D-30 "field guns" with a maximum range of 10
miles. Satellite surveillance photos of an Iraqi army base showed what
U.S. officials said were dump trucks equipped with heavy-duty hydraulic
lifts, which they said were being altered to serve as missile launchers.</TE>
<TE>Some Diplomats Ask for More Documentation</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. officials showed the weapons inspectors at least one
photograph of a truck that had already been transformed into a
missile-launching platform, according to a diplomat who attended the
briefing. As many as 1,000 Russian- and German-made trucks imported under
the oil-for-food program have been diverted to military purposes, the
U.S. officials contended in their presentation to Security Council
members.</TE>
<TE>   They said many of the trucks could be identified as Russian-made
Urals, famously rugged heavy-transport vehicles that have been imported
by Iraq for approved civilian purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "You could clearly see that this was the same type of truck coming in
at Iraqi ports and then reappearing at Iraqi military bases," MacKenzie
said.</TE>
<TE>   But other diplomats said they wanted more documentation of the U.S.
allegations that the imported trucks photographed at Iraqi seaports last
year were the same vehicles later seen at army bases and the military
parade.</TE>
<TE>   "This all may be true or it may not all be true, but we need more
information," said one European diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N. said the officials who
gave the briefings could not be identified by name or title. Some
diplomats who attended the briefings said the U.S. officials included
intelligence agents.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of their appearance, on the eve of the Iraqi foreign
minister's visit, "was coincidental, though I know you won't believe me,"
said the spokesman, who also declined to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats and U.N. officials said they have limited
expectations for the visit, which is seen as one of a series of recent
gestures prompted by Baghdad's alarm at U.S. threats of military action,
and by its growing concern at the new unanimity in Security Council
demands for the reentry of weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   A stronger, streamlined trade sanctions program due to take effect in
June will increase economic and political pressure on Iraq, diplomats
note.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing its long-standing opposition to U.N. monitoring missions of
any kind, Iraq recently allowed the chief U.N. human rights official with
responsibility for Iraq to visit Baghdad for the first time in a decade.
It also recently permitted inspections of a nuclear power plant by the
U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, which verified that stocks of
uranium remained sealed and on site in accordance with U.N. rules.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. officials remain adamant that Iraq must permit weapons
inspectors to return to the country without restrictions. The inspectors
have said there is circumstantial evidence that Iraq is still
clandestinely smuggling in equipment for its outlawed nuclear weapons
program, and the allegations presented by U.S. officials Wednesday may
buttress their contention that Iraq appears intent on rebuilding its
military.</TE>

<LD>Seventy-year-old twin brothers riding their bicycles were killed,
each one hit by a truck, in separate accidents hours apart on the same
icy highway, Finnish police said.</LD>
<LD>   The first accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Constable Pauli
Ketonen said. Shortly before noon, the other twin was struck and killed
about a mile away. Both accidents occurred in Raahe, 370 miles north of
the capital, Helsinki.</LD>
<LD>   Ketonen said it was unlikely the second twin knew of his brother's
accident, because police had not had time to inform the family about it.</LD>

<LD>The Hague war crimes court will not close before its most wanted
men, Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his military
commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, are tried, a U.S. envoy said.</LD>
<LD>   "The tribunal will not close before they are brought to justice," said
Pierre-Richard Prosper, U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Prosper appeared to back away from criticism he leveled at the Hague

courts of lapses in professionalism and management and said they should
be wrapped up by 2008.</LD>
<TE>   His criticism did not sit well with U.S. Democrats and allies abroad
who support the tribunals. The Bush administration believes that they

<HD>Mugabe's Move Faces Challenge</HD>
<DH>Africa: Opposition vows to fight election rules reinstated by the
Zimbabwean leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The opposition said Wednesday that it would challenge President
Robert Mugabe's move to override the nation's Supreme Court and reinstate
polling rules that critics say favor his reelection bid this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, has exposed deep
political and economic crises gripping the southern African state Mugabe
has led since its independence from Britain in 1980.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe, 78, accuses his main opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, of being a
stooge of Britain and of the country's white minority.</LD>
<TE>   Mugabe used his presidential powers Tuesday to reinstate rules the
Supreme Court declared illegal last week.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, which has accused Mugabe
of trying to fix the election, said it would challenge the president's
latest move in court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to file the papers today, but I'm not sure whether it
will be held in the Supreme Court. It will depend on the chief justice,"
MDC lawyer Adrian de Bourbon said.</TE>
<TE>   The General Laws Amendment Act gives state-appointed election officers
the power to bar independent voting monitors from polling stations,
introduce strict identity requirements for voters and ban private voter
education.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a clear demonstration that Mugabe is determined to hang on to
power by all means, but mostly foul," said political analyst Masipula
Sithole.</TE>

<HD>Powell Criticizes Israeli Strategy</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary of State advises Sharon to 'take a hard look'
at his offensive against Palestinians in order to avoid all-out war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In unusually blunt language, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on
Wednesday challenged Israel's military strategy and urged Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon to reconsider his large-scale offensive against the
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   "If you declare war on the Palestinians and think you can solve the
problem by seeing how many Palestinians can be killed--I don't know if
that leads anywhere," Powell said at a congressional hearing on the
budget.</LD>
<LD>   "Prime Minister Sharon has to take a hard look at his policies and see
whether they will work," he said in testimony before the House
Appropriations Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Powell's admonition was a conspicuously sharp public criticism of
Israel. The same tough message was relayed in private Tuesday when Powell
telephoned Sharon, State Department officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of appealing to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat to help end the increasingly bloody cycle of violence, the Bush
administration now appears to be holding the Sharon government
accountable too.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also said it would like to see Israel's actions
tempered. While accepting Israel's right to counterattack in its own
defense, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, "[President Bush]
wants it to be toned down so people do not believe this becomes a matter
of war."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon angered U.S. officials earlier this week by saying that the
Palestinians must be "hit hard" and "beaten," implying open warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Powell on Wednesday pointedly expressed dissatisfaction with Israel
and the Palestinians and said both parties are responsible for policies
that have fueled the latest violence in the 17-month-old conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not satisfied that both sides have thought through the
consequences of the policies they are following . . . that lead to more
violence," Powell said. "They need to take a hard look at what they are
doing now."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary called the bloody deadlock "a tragic situation."</TE>
<TE>   As in the past, Powell also had harsh words for Arafat, who he again
said must rein in militants responsible for a series of bombings and
shootings of Israeli targets. "Arafat has to do more, can do more and
must do more," he told the legislators.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Onslaught Seen as a High-Stakes Gamble</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The prime minister may pay a heavy political price if
Israel's latest military campaign fails to break the Palestinians'
resolve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel's broadest military offensive against the Palestinians in
more than 17 months of fighting is a high-stakes gamble by Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon that he can deliver a blow so devastating it will force
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to seek peace.</LD>
<LD>   After pounding the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the army attacked targets
in Gaza and the West Bank early today in a furious assault that had begun
Tuesday night after Palestinians for the first time hit an Israeli town
with a Kassam-2 missile, injuring a year-old child. Palestinians reported
that 11 people were killed Wednesday, including three naval policemen and
three Palestinians trying to place a bomb on a road to the Jewish
settlement of Netzarim in Gaza. Two Israeli soldiers were killed, one
possibly by "friendly fire," the Israeli army spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians said two Palestinians were killed this morning when
troops entered the West Bank town of Tulkarm. Helicopter missiles were
fired there and in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem, where
offices of Arafat's presidential guard were hit. There were no immediate
reports of casualties in Bethlehem.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Israeli attack helicopters fired missiles into a
Palestinian security compound in Gaza City, badly damaging it and
Arafat's unoccupied home next to it. A nearby school for the blind also
was badly damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Palestinians reported that at least two missiles were
fired into the compound housing Arafat's Ramallah headquarters in the
West Bank, hitting a storage building. Arafat was meeting with European
Union envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos at the time. The two were unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   The government launched its intensified campaign of airstrikes,
assassinations of Palestinian militants and incursions into
Palestinian-controlled areas after a bloody weekend of Palestinian
attacks that claimed the lives of more than 20 Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   It promised that this offensive will take such a high toll of
Palestinian lives and damage so much Palestinian Authority security
infrastructure that Arafat will have no choice but to seek a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the Palestinians seem more interested in carrying out
revenge attacks than in surrendering. Few outside the Israeli Cabinet and
the army seem convinced that the latest offensive will come any closer to
changing Arafat's policies than any previous campaign has.</TE>
<TE>Snubbing Saudi Initiative</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has declared that the time has come to no longer speak of
diplomacy, only of restoring security. On Monday, the day the current
campaign got underway, he criticized a much-touted peace initiative by
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no diplomatic horizon," Sharon told reporters, "only a
security horizon."</TE>
<TE>   The tentative Saudi peace plan, which would offer Israel normalization
of relations with the Arab world in return for withdrawal from all the
lands Israel seized during the 1967 Middle East War, has been welcomed in
Washington and in European capitals and has sparked enormous interest in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon said it would be a "big mistake" to allow the initiative to
replace U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for
Middle East peace, because those resolutions, in Israel's view, do not
require total withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Polls and growing criticism here of Sharon's leadership indicate that
the former general may pay a heavy political price if this latest
military campaign fails to produce a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of Israelis now say that Sharon is doing a poor job and
that they don't believe that using more force will change the situation.
The center-left Labor Party is threatening to pull out of his coalition
government, and some commentators have demanded that he resign.</TE>
<TE>   "You bunch of impotent fools, we are tired of you," Sever Plotzker
wrote to the Cabinet ministers in a front-page editorial Wednesday in
Yediot Aharonot, the nation's largest daily newspaper. "Pack your bags,
gather up your papers, return the keys and leave the government. . . . In
a democratic country that is fighting for its life, failing governments
do not stay in power."</TE>
<TE>   Military analyst Alex Fishman, also writing in the paper, said that if
the current operations fail to sway the Palestinians, the next step will
be to recapture large parts of the West Bank ceded to them under the 1993
Oslo peace accords. He warned that such a move would require a call-up of
reservists that could spark regional war if Arab states perceived the
mobilization as a threat.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians are calling for immediate international intervention to
protect them from the new onslaught, even as Palestinian officials are
applauding recent attacks on Israeli soldiers at checkpoints and other
assaults. Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian Authority's West Bank security
chief, said he won't arrest Palestinians who are fighting Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon's crazy policy is pushing us into a corner," said Hussein
Sheik, the leader of Arafat's Fatah movement in the West Bank. "He can
reoccupy us, but we won't wave the white flag. He cannot defeat us."</TE>
<TE>   Amin Hindi, the Palestinian Authority's intelligence chief in Gaza,
accused Israel of trying to kill top-level Palestinian security officials
in an airstrike Wednesday. A helicopter fired a missile into a Gaza City
security compound seconds before a dozen officers were due to convene a
meeting, Hindi said. The building was destroyed, but no one was killed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the deaths in Gaza on Wednesday, three Palestinians
were killed in the West Bank. Soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian who
the army said was carrying a bomb at one checkpoint, and another
Palestinian was shot dead at a second checkpoint after he allegedly
hurled Molotov cocktails at troops staffing it. A third militant with the
radical Islamic movement Hamas was killed in the northern West Bank city
of Jenin under unclear circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government says it has no choice but to resort to massive
military force because Arafat cannot or will not stop militants.</TE>
<TE>   But the risks of carrying out large-scale operations in heavily
populated areas became evident the first day of the offensive, when
troops fired a tank shell at a car that the army said it thought was
carrying a Hamas militant in Ramallah. He was not in the car, but his
wife and three children were, and they were all killed, as were two
children riding in a car behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli civilians also may pay a high price. Security forces across
Israel are on high alert as the offensive continues, bracing for revenge
attacks at the end of a week that has seen at least 67 Palestinians and
31 Israelis killed, the most since the current conflict began in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>Funeral Notices</TE>
<TE>   News broadcasts on state-run Voice of Israel radio sound more like
"Voice of Hevra Kadisha [burial society], like announcements from a
particularly busy cemetery," wrote Chemi Shalev, senior political analyst
for the Maariv newspaper. "From morning till night, we are notified of
the departure times of funerals. In the little time left over, there are
reports of new terror attacks, fresh victims, whose funeral times we will
be notified of tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's strongest support is coming from right-wing Cabinet ministers
and Jewish settlers, who hope that the government will soon cross its
self-imposed "red lines," destroy the Palestinian Authority and oust
Arafat from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure Minister Avigdor Lieberman argued in a Cabinet session
Monday that the army should bomb Palestinian commercial centers, gas
stations and banks, and cut electricity and phone lines to Arafat's
Ramallah office and keep visitors from reaching him.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with such measures, Lieberman predicted, the Palestinians would
within three days "cry gevalt, and they'll beg to speak with us."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is being pushed not only from within the Cabinet, but also from
outside it. Political archrival Benjamin Netanyahu, a former prime
minister who is hugely popular within Sharon's Likud Party, is advocating
the Palestinian Authority's destruction as he tours the nation and
appears on news shows.</TE>
<TE>   The former prime minister is widely believed to be positioning himself
to wrest leadership of the party from Sharon. The political threat he
poses is seen as forcing Sharon farther away from the political center
and closer to the far right.</TE>
<TE>   But growing numbers of Israelis--although still a minority--would
support an Israeli-Palestinian initiative aimed at stopping the violence,
or even back international intervention, according to a poll by Tel Aviv
University's Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research. The center
conducted the telephone poll among 582 people Feb. 26-28 as part of its
ongoing Peace Index Project.</TE>
<TE>   Only 26.5% of Israelis believe that greater military force will change
the security situation, the poll indicated, down from 41% in August.
About 27% of Israelis said they want to see an Israeli-Palestinian
initiative to stop the violence--a 2 percentage point increase in support
since August. The number of Israelis who said they support international
intervention to stop the conflict jumped from 8% in August to 17%.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and his Cabinet have correctly interpreted the public's desire
to see Palestinians punished and to see Israelis' sense of personal
security restored, said professor Ephraim Yaar, one of the directors of
the Peace Index Project. The political mistake, Yaar said, lies in the
government's unwillingness to couple harsh military action with a
diplomatic initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep in their hearts, Israelis know that military actions by
themselves will not be effective," Yaar said. "The preferred option is
negotiations with the Palestinians--that is why we see a large majority
in our polls supporting the resumption of talks. But at the same time, an
even larger majority don't believe talks can be resumed or will lead to
tangible results. This is the psychological predicament of the Israelis."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Steel Tariffs Could Erode Anti-Terror Coalition</HD>
<DH>Trade: Key allies angrily lash out at Bush's 'political' action,
which may prove more costly on the security front than in economic terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Hefty U.S. tariffs on steel imports may shore up American Rust Belt
producers and Republican election chances, but they appeared to backfire
with key allies Wednesday, provoking trade conflicts and possibly
undermining support for the U.S.-led war against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Although Russia angrily invoked a ban on imports of all U.S. poultry
products, the American trade action could prove more costly on the
security front than in economic terms.</LD>
<LD>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the sole European leader to voice
support for Pentagon plans to target Iraq in the American-led global
anti-terror campaign, had urged President Bush to reconsider the action
for fear it could trigger retaliation and further damage the U.S. image
abroad. On Wednesday, Blair called the tariffs "unacceptable and wrong."</LD>
<TE>   From Seoul to Stockholm, those whose sales will be hurt by the
measures accused Bush of putting Republican Party interests in a handful
of traditional steel-producing states above his stated commitment to
international free trade.</TE>
<TE>   European Union leaders announced that they will take the high road and
refrain from imposing tit-for-tat sanctions on U.S. products. But EU
Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy blasted the tariffs as illegal,
shortsighted and damaging to global economic and political stability.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-nation EU is the world's biggest steel producer and supplies a
quarter of global steel exports to the U.S. market. The bloc will be
hard-hit: Its high-quality exports will be assessed the maximum tariffs
from a range of 8% to 30% announced in Washington on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "This U.S. decision is political, without any legal or even economic
foundation," Lamy warned, adding that the U.S. steel industry is in
crisis because of its failure to modernize, not because of foreign trade
pressures.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Lamy said the bloc will refrain from reorienting trade
policy to behave as in "the Wild West, where everyone does as he
likes"--an apparent blast at what Europeans often call America's cowboy
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   As America's chief ally in the war on terrorism, Blair had argued
against the tariffs in writing and in a telephone call to Bush last week.
Blair's failure to deliver on the economic front provides fodder to his
critics and weakens the prime minister as he tries to sell U.S. action
against Iraq to a reluctant Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Blair
of failing to defend a national industry. "The prime minister always puts
the interests of his friends ahead of the interests of his people," the
conservative said.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, facing a tough reelection
campaign this year and increasing popular resistance to Berlin's
participation in anti-terror military actions, called the tariffs
"totally unacceptable." Economics Minister Werner Mueller warned of "a
significant strain" on U.S.-European relations as a result of the
tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac criticized the tariffs as
"protectionist," and Italy's deputy industrial minister, Adolfo Urso,
demanded an EU appeal to the World Trade Organization and "instant
measures to defend the EU market."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Morris, general secretary of Britain's Transport and General
Workers' Union, said: "Britain and Europe stood shoulder to shoulder with
the USA in the war against terrorism. European governments must now stand
shoulder to shoulder in the U.S. war against our steel industry."</TE>
<TE>   Sweden also lashed out, with Foreign Trade Minister Leif Pagrotsky
comparing the tariffs to a surprise assault on unsuspecting allies.
Washington "has fired off its ammunition in this issue, and, completely
unprovoked and without us having any part in this, they have attacked us
in this war," he fumed.</TE>
<TE>   There were also calls in Asia for intervention. China expressed
"strong dissatisfaction," Japan and Australia warned that they would
complain to the WTO, and South Korea, which exported 2 million tons of
steel to the U.S. market last year, said it would use "all possible
means" to fight the tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   But it was here in Moscow that the loudest and most threatening
reaction made clear that Washington would pay for its attempt to salve
U.S. economic woes by shifting the pain abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Steel accounts for one-tenth of Russia's trade with the United States,
and Russian officials appear to have reached their limit of perceived
U.S. slights they can accept without losing face with their own
economically strapped public.</TE>
<TE>   Russians are still seething over doping and judging scandals at last
month's Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City that tarnished some Russian
medal winners and disqualified others.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow has been loudly skeptical of U.S. motives in expanding the war
against terror, in which Russians have so far proved reliable if
reluctant allies.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament, railed
against the tariff issue Wednesday, demanding retaliatory action as well
as reconsideration of Moscow's support for the anti-terror operation in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A ban on imports of U.S. poultry that was to start Sunday was in
effect imposed immediately when Russian customs authorities announced
that they would clear no more shipments. Import licenses have been
suspended, and the Russian Veterinary Services weighed in with a claim to
have discovered salmonella contamination in nine U.S. poultry
consignments inspected in St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow is the U.S. poultry industry's most important customer,
spending more than $600 million annually to buy half of all U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov denied that the poultry ban
was a quid pro quo for the U.S. steel tariffs, and Health Minister Yuri
L. Shevchenko blamed the move on "dissatisfaction" with the quality of
U.S. chicken products.</TE>
<TE>   Economics Minister German O. Gref warned that Russia might pull out of
all trade agreements with the United States unless the steel tariffs are
rescinded or reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "If this duty is fully imposed on Russia, we will not be able to
export steel to the U.S., and in this case, we will likely pull out of
the rest of the agreements with the U.S., as they would lose any sense,"
Gref said, calling on Washington to "cool down" and work out a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Economic retaliation is virtually assured, political analyst Andrei V.
Kortunov warned. But he noted that the more dangerous strain may be felt
in the U.S.-led global security campaign if Russians feel that the Bush
administration is hurting their economy to improve America's.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't disregard a serious indirect danger every dispute like this
may pose, given the lack of positive development in trade and economic
relations," Kortunov said. "Relations can't be solid and stable if the
political superstructure is not based on a serious economic foundation."</TE>

<HD>Ban Sought on Hindu Extremists</HD>
<DH>Asia: Christian council in India says the groups have waged a 'hate
campaign' against minorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>A leading Christian group in India called for a ban on Hindu
extremist groups Wednesday, saying they had also targeted Christians
during last week's religious violence in Gujarat state that killed more
than 600 people, most of them Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   The All India Christian Council said the Hindu groups have "engaged in
a constant hate campaign against the minorities" and are training
hundreds of thousands of people in armed warfare.</LD>
<LD>   It said it would ask the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and other
international agencies to investigate the activities and funding of the
Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council, and its affiliates.</LD>
<TE>   The Hindu council has branches worldwide and is supported by donations
from Hindu expatriates.</TE>
<TE>   Christians account for 2% of India's 1 billion people, and Muslims
12%. Hindus make up more than 80%.</TE>
<TE>   The Christian council's secretary-general, John Dayal, said that
members of the Hindu council and other groups burned down a Roman
Catholic mission in the village of Sanjeli, attacking two priests with
stones, and that a Hindu mob ransacked a missionary school near the city
of Godhra.</TE>
<TE>   The account could not immediately be independently confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu hard-liners are accused of encouraging riots that killed
hundreds of Muslims over six days in Gujarat. The riots followed a Feb.

<HD>China Again Boosts Defense Budget in Bid to Upgrade Military</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government announced a 17.6% increase in defense
spending Wednesday, matching last year's boost, in a continuing drive to
upgrade its military.</LD>
<LD>   Finance Minister Xiang Huai-cheng told China's national parliament
that the additional $3 billion was needed to cover the cost of advanced
weapons and pay raises for members of the 2.5-million-strong People's
Liberation Army, the world's largest military force.</LD>
<LD>   The extra funds will help China "utilize modern technology, especially
high technology, to raise our army's defense and combat capabilities,"
Xiang told delegates of the National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp
legislature.</LD>
<TE>   The increase will lift China's stated defense budget to $20 billion,
although outside experts say real military spending is at least double or
triple that amount, possibly even five times as much. Not included in the
official figure are research and development costs and the purchase of
foreign arms from countries such as Russia. Moscow is Beijing's main
supplier of big-ticket items such as fighter jets and naval destroyers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, military expenditures here pale in comparison to those of the
United States, where President Bush has proposed a defense budget of $379
billion for the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   Xiang's announcement reflected the rate of annual defense spending
increases of recent years, which have hovered in the double-digit range
since the mid-1990s. Particularly after the army was ordered in 1998 to
give up its myriad commercial enterprises--a major source of its
revenue--the Communist regime has been under pressure from the military
brass to help make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "A 17% to 18% increase is exactly what people expect," said James
Mulvenon, an expert on the Chinese military at the Rand Corp. think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's most recent five-year plan called for yearly defense
spending increases of 15% to 20%, Mulvenon said. Last year's boost was
17.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The government's biggest defense priority is to modernize what in many
respects remains a backward military reliant on manpower rather than
state-of-the-art weaponry, sophisticated tactics and new fronts for
combat, such as Internet warfare.</TE>
<TE>   In large part, the push stems from Beijing's awe and dismay over U.S.
military successes abroad. Chinese generals were shocked by the
superiority of U.S. troops and arms in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then by
the successful 1999 American-led campaign of airstrikes in
Yugoslavia--which Beijing opposed--and, more recently, by the quick rout
of the Taliban in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Washington's plans to develop a missile defense system and its
decision to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty have
convinced many Chinese officials of the need to overhaul the army to
counter U.S. prowess.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one here believes that China can catch up to the United
States any time soon, Beijing wants to become a regional power that other
governments cannot afford to ignore militarily, especially over trouble
spots such as Taiwan, the island Beijing claims as its own.</TE>
<TE>   The army upgrade campaign also involves improving morale among the
rank and file. Despite--or because of--their huge numbers, troops are
often sloppily organized, poorly trained and underpaid--officers and
recruits alike. Attracting career military personnel poses a challenge in
a society boasting so many other options for making money.</TE>
<TE>   One young former soldier said he received a monthly wage of just 100
yuan, or about $12, in addition to room and board during the first year
of his three-year stint. His duties--as with thousands of soldiers across
the country--were mainly to help build bridges and roads. He and his
fellow grunts slept several to a room in large dormitories, which were
locked each night after curfew. Having a girlfriend or a wife was
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   For third-year recruits, he said, the monthly stipend could increase
to 500 or 600 yuan if they signed contracts for further service, but he
decided to bail out last year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no real career future there," said the former soldier, a
22-year-old from Shaanxi province who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's announced budget increase is part of a larger boost in
public spending across the board.</TE>
<TE>   Xiang, the finance minister, unveiled an overall national budget of
$169 billion, with a projected $37.5-billion deficit that is China's
highest ever. Some economists warn that the shortfall could reach
dangerous proportions, but the government insists that it is at a safe
level.</TE>

<HD>Weapons Blast Kills 5 Peacekeepers in Afghanistan</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Five European peacekeepers were killed and seven others were
wounded in a powerful explosion during an ordnance-defusing exercise in
Afghanistan, the worst accident in the force's nearly 3-month-old
mission, German officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the dead were German soldiers and three were from Denmark's
contingent in the 4,500-strong peacekeeping force, which is patrolling
Kabul, the Afghan capital, and collecting weapons from the combatants who
have contributed to the Central Asian nation's two decades of chaos.</LD>
<LD>   The blast occurred as munitions experts were preparing to blow up two
Soviet-era SA-3 antiaircraft missiles at a weapons-collection point about
three miles outside Kabul. Taliban fighters were known to have had such
missiles in their arsenal, but officials said it was unclear where the
weapons came from.</LD>
<TE>   It was also unclear from initial reports received by the German
Defense Ministry whether one or both of the 2,100-pound rockets exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an accident," Gen. Harald Kujat, the German army's inspector
general, told journalists in Berlin. "We believe all necessary security
measures were taken."</TE>
<TE>   The wounded, including three who were in critical condition, were
being treated at German and French field hospitals in Kabul, Kujat said.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths were the first for the German and Danish deployments and
could fuel protests in both countries by opponents of participation in
the U.S.-led war on terrorism and its related security missions.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether reported shortages of transportation and equipment for
Afghanistan-based German troops might have played a role in the accident,
Kujat said he wouldn't speculate on the causes. But he said the
demolition experts had all the necessary materials to do their work.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder offered his condolences to the families
of those killed but urged Germans to maintain their commitment to doing
their part in the global anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "[The accident] did not have anything to do with military conflict.
There is no reason to question the mission," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder faces a tough reelection campaign this year, and German
participation in the anti-terrorism fight has become a divisive issue in
a country long constrained from taking part in foreign conflicts by its
post-World War II constitution.</TE>
<TE>   But Germany has taken on an increasingly active role in international
security actions in the years since the country's 1990 reunification and
has thousands of troops deployed to peacekeeping missions, primarily in
the Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin's decision in November to offer as many as 3,900 troops for the
fight against terrorism has provided a platform for opposition
politicians to accuse the government of overextending Germany's armed
forces while failing to increase defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has about 700 soldiers in Afghanistan. Denmark's contingent
numbers about 50, most of them de-mining specialists.</TE>

<LD>A panel of scientists endorsed the safety and effectiveness of the
anthrax vaccine, but it also recommended more research into how it can be
improved.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's anthrax-by-mail attacks focused additional attention on
the vaccine, already criticized by some military members who resigned
rather than take it because of concerns about side effects.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine
concluded that the vaccine protects against all forms of anthrax and has
no more serious side effects than other vaccines given to adults.</LD>

<LD>An air tanker and helicopter crews pummeled a stubborn wildfire
with water and retardant, trying to keep the blaze from spreading into a
renowned bird-watching preserve in southeastern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   On the ground, about 200 firefighters cut fire lines and planned to
set backfires to deprive the 935-acre blaze of fuel, said U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Joan Vasey.</LD>
<LD>   The wildfire was about three miles from the 380-acre Ramsey Canyon
Preserve, home to more than 170 species of birds, including up to 14
types of hummingbirds. Some homes are also tucked into the forest. The
preserve was closed late Tuesday.</LD>

<HD>White House Drops Cut-Rate Jobs From Welfare Plan</HD>
<DH>Policy: The Bush team, trying to counter an emerging backlash,
backs off a proposal to pay recipients less than the minimum wage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration backed away Wednesday from plans to pay
welfare recipients less than the minimum wage for required work.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson followed the disclosure that the administration was envisioning
a broad category of public service jobs for welfare recipients that would
not be subject to minimum-wage laws. The proposal--a reversal of current
federal policy--had begun to stir controversy among congressional
Democrats, unions and advocates for the poor as Congress considers
changes in the nation's $16.5-billion welfare program.</LD>
<LD>   "President Bush and I will insist that welfare recipients receive at
least the minimum wage for the hours they work, including community
service jobs," Thompson said in a statement Wednesday. "This is an
important principle that I fought for as governor of Wisconsin and one
that the president and I remain committed to today as we take the next
step in welfare reform."</LD>
<TE>   The White House approach to welfare reform, first detailed last week,
features an array of tough new requirements designed to steer welfare
recipients into work, including supervised community service jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A 36-page document on the policy, released by the administration last
week, said that certain types of work, such as supervised community
service, did not entitle welfare recipients to "a salary or to benefits
provided under any other provision of law"--a reference to the Fair Labor
Standards Act, which governs the minimum wage. Earlier this week, a
high-level welfare official at the Health and Human Services Department
explained the thinking behind that provision: that certain types of work
experience for welfare recipients are not equivalent to real-world jobs
and therefore do not have the same legal status.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, following a report about that finding in The Times, the
administration reacted swiftly. "The bottom line is: We are proposing no
change to the 1996 law governing minimum wage under the [welfare] law,
and this administration has absolutely no intention of abandoning those
very important protections," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's decision countered an emerging backlash on
Capitol Hill and was greeted joyfully by those who feared the creation of
a subgroup of workers laboring at the bottom of the job ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) decried the notion of welfare
recipients working at "near-slave wages" and warned that it "severely
undermines efforts to pass this legislation."</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to be helping people enter the labor force so that
they are proud of working instead of receiving assistance," he said.
"That's a little hard to achieve when you treat them like an army of
exploitable employees."</TE>
<TE>   Welfare activists openly mocked the administration's statement as a
sign of internal confusion over its welfare plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the tip of the iceberg in revealing the extreme nature
of the administration's proposal," said Deepak Bhargava, director of the
National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, a grass-roots network of
anti-poverty activists. "What other measures are in the president's plan
that the administration will later recant?"</TE>
<TE>   Critics of a sub-minimum wage--even when limited to certain
disadvantaged workers--contend that it could drag down wages more broadly
and could ultimately take jobs away from slightly higher-paid workers,
who risk being replaced by lower-paid ones.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Thompson's statement raised new questions about how
states would satisfy the stricter work rules the White House is
supporting.</TE>
<TE>   The administration seeks to place 70% of welfare recipients in jobs by
2007, a sharp increase from today's 30% level. In addition, it would
impose a more rigid definition of "work" than is the case today. Under
the plan, welfare recipients would have to work 24 hours a week before
being able to pursue such alternative activities as education and
training for an additional 16 hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said that states may face pressure to design their own job
programs in order to meet the work goals, particularly in a weak economic
climate. But many of the less affluent states may have trouble affording
such efforts if they must pay the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's "change in direction . . . is very important and
useful," said Wendell Primus, director of income security at the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group critical of
the White House welfare plan. But, he added, Wednesday's announcement
raised new questions about the viability of the tougher work rules. "This
backing away [from the minimum-wage provision]--what are the implications
of the decision?" Primus asked.</TE>
<TE>   Whether welfare recipients should be forced to work for less than the
minimum wage has been fiercely disputed for years.</TE>
<TE>   The issue flared up in the mid-1990s, when Congress overhauled the
welfare system and set new work goals for recipients of public aid. Many
Republican advocates of welfare reform endorsed proposals to exempt
certain welfare-to-work activities from the federal minimum wage, which
is currently $5.15 an hour. Some states, including California, have
higher minimums.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 welfare reform legislation ultimately did not address the
dispute. Then, in 1997 and again in 1999, the Clinton administration made
clear that most such jobs, frequently referred to as "workfare," were
generally covered by federal laws on the minimum wage, safety and health,
unemployment insurance and discrimination. States can consider welfare
recipients' monthly checks, along with food stamp benefits, as
compensation in calculating their pay.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Wednesday's HHS statement, advocates for the poor
expressed hope that the administration plans further changes to its
welfare proposal, which critics say leaves states insufficient latitude
to place welfare recipients in education and training programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This addresses one significant problem in the plan, and I hope they
can now address the others," said Mark Greenberg, senior staff attorney
at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a research organization with
expertise in issues affecting the poor.</TE>
<TE>   But Thompson, who as governor of Wisconsin pioneered welfare reform
efforts, insisted that the White House approach is on target. "This will
enable families to climb the career ladder and achieve self-sufficiency
while gaining valuable work experience--the ultimate goal of welfare
reform."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The assistant secretary of the Army, former Mississippi Rep. Mike
Parker, was fired Wednesday after he criticized the Bush administration's
proposed spending cuts for Army Corps of Engineers' water projects,
members of Congress said.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department issued a brief statement saying Parker had
resigned.</LD>
<LD>   "The department appreciates Mr. Parker's contributions and wishes him
the best in his future endeavors," it said. The statement made no mention
of the reason for Parker's departure.</LD>
<TE>   The White House had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently he was asked to resign," said Rep. Roger F. Wicker
(R-Miss.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee's energy and
water development subcommittee that oversees the Corps' budget.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
also said Parker had been fired.</TE>
<TE>   In his budget submission last month, Bush proposed cutting the Corps
of Engineers' budget by 10% to $4.175 billion, excluding federal
retirees' pensions and benefits. The Corps had requested more than $6
billion.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing before the Senate Budget Committee last week, Parker said
the cuts would require the Corps to cancel $190 million in
already-contracted projects providing 4,500 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "After being in the administration and dealing with them, I still
don't have warm and fuzzy feelings for them," he testified before the
committee. "I'm hoping that OMB (the White House Office of Management and
Budget) understands we're at the beginning of the process. If the Corps
is limited in what it does for the American people, there will be a
negative impact."</TE>
<TE>   Conrad said he will ask administration officials whether Parker was
dismissed because of his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "If the administration is firing him for that, I believe that is a
serious mistake on their part and is going to have an adverse effect on
relations with the Congress," he said. "You cannot fire people who come
up and answer questions honestly."</TE>
<TE>   Army Secretary Thomas E. White was directed over the weekend to seek
Parker's dismissal, said a congressional official.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, 52, was a Mississippi congressman from 1989 to 1998, when he
resigned to make an unsuccessful run for governor.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Could Have Been Convicted, Prosecutor Contends</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Ex-counsel, in his final report on the Lewinsky inquiry,
cites false testimony. But he never details the charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In his final report on the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation,
independent counsel Robert W. Ray contended he could have won a criminal
conviction of former President Clinton for his testimony that he did not
recall being alone with the former White House intern.</LD>
<LD>   But Ray, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate, did not say
what charges he could have brought. His report makes no mention of
perjury. Instead, he says rather vaguely that Clinton "impeded the due
administration of justice" when he falsely denied his sexual relationship
with Lewinsky during his deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones case.</LD>
<LD>   Ray also derides the "cynics and political opponents" who saw partisan
motives in his investigation.</LD>
<TE>   "We have reaffirmed the principle and the spirit of law that no
one--absolutely no one--is above the law," he said, quoting the Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski.</TE>
<TE>   "A generation later, let it also be said so here," Ray said in
closing.</TE>
<TE>   Lewinsky had a less charitable assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "I will forever contend that the spirit of law was abused," she wrote
in a rebuttal that was attached to Ray's report. Lewinsky quoted former
Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who said: "The qualities of a
good prosecutor are as elusive and as impossible to define as those which
mark a gentleman. And those who need to be told would not understand it
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's report is not the last word from Ray's office. The
independent counsel has also filed a report on the long and inconclusive
probe into the Clintons' investment in the failed real estate venture
known as Whitewater. But a three-judge panel has kept that report under
seal.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiries, which began in 1994, had cost $65 million as of March
31, 2001, Ray said. This month, he acknowledged that he is considering
entering the Republican primary in New Jersey to challenge embattled
Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   Some key players in the impeachment saga issued statements making
clear they had no interest in revisiting the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton attorney David E. Kendall called the investigation "intense,
expensive, partisan and long. There's still no Whitewater report, and
there's nothing new in this report. It's time to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who led the House managers
in the impeachment proceedings, said Ray's report should be the end of
the matter. "I think that's where America wants it, way back there."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Palmieri, a former Clinton spokeswoman, told Associated Press
that it was "not clear what the purpose of the report is other than to
promote Robert Ray's Senate campaign, Monica Lewinsky's HBO special and
the Paula Jones vs. Tonya Harding boxing match." Lewinsky was the focus
of a documentary shown on HBO, and Jones is set to do battle with
Harding, the former figure skater, on the Fox television network.</TE>
<TE>   Ray took over the independent counsel's post after the Senate
acquitted Clinton, and after his predecessor, Kenneth W. Starr, resigned.
His main task was to decide whether to prosecute the former president
after Clinton left office.</TE>
<TE>   "The independent counsel concluded that the evidence was sufficient to
prosecute President Clinton [and] there was a substantial federal
interest in prosecuting [him] for his testimony and conduct in the Jones
case," Ray wrote. And the "evidence would probably be sufficient to
obtain and sustain a conviction."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, however, Ray and Kendall arranged a deal that was announced
on Clinton's next-to-last day in office.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton admitted he "knowingly gave evasive and misleading answers" in
his Jones case deposition in the presence of U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright. For this misconduct, he agreed to a five-year suspension
of his license to practice law.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Clinton also paid $850,000 to settle the Jones sexual
harassment case, even though it had been officially dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Those sanctions were sufficient, Ray concluded. The "public interest"
had been satisfied because Clinton had admitted his wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   But several legal experts faulted Ray for announcing now that he could
have brought criminal charges and claiming he would have won a conviction
before a jury in the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like it when prosecutors say, 'He's really guilty, and he got
a break,' " said George Washington University law professor Stephen
Saltzburg, who once served as assistant independent counsel. "I didn't
like when it happened to Ed Meese [U.S. attorney general under Ronald
Reagan], and I don't like it here. Ordinary prosecutors don't say things
like this."</TE>
<TE>   Ray's report recounts the now-familiar facts that led to Clinton's
impeachment in December 1998. But it does not describe the legal
difficulties in bringing a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   A perjury charge requires proof that a person deliberately lied under
oath about a "material" or significant fact.</TE>
<TE>   Ray had strong evidence that Clinton made false statements during his
deposition in the Jones case. But Wright later dismissed Jones' lawsuit
prior to a trial and ruled that Jones had no legal claim of sexual
harassment. As such, it would have been hard to show how Clinton's lies
regarding Lewinsky were "material."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law makes "obstruction of justice" a crime, but the law refers
to actions that hinder a criminal investigation or an "official
proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   For example, threatening a judge or juror or trying to hinder an FBI
agent can be charged as obstruction of justice. But the criminal law had
been rarely applied to disputes involving private civil suits that seek
money damages, such as a sexual harassment claim.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Luque, a defense lawyer in Washington, said she found Ray's
statement perplexing. "Usually, a prosecutor says, 'Here are the facts,
here's the law, and here's how facts fit the law.' But this is strange.
He doesn't say what the charge would be. And I can't find a federal crime
that fits these facts."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ray acknowledged that a final verdict is not in yet.</TE>
<TE>   "All will no doubt agree that the decisions recounted in this report
form an indelible part of the American historical record," he said. "But
there agreement is likely to end."</TE>

<HD>FBI Issues Apology on Shooting</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE
</DL>
<LD>The FBI apologized Wednesday for shooting an unarmed man during a
search for a bank robber.</LD>
<LD>   "Let me express our sincere sorrow for this unfortunate accident,"
said Lynne Hunt, the agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore office. "We
will do everything necessary to complete a full investigation of the
facts."</LD>
<LD>   In her first public remarks since 20-year-old Joseph Schultz was shot
in the face Friday as he sat in a car with his 16-year-old girlfriend,
Hunt offered few new details about the incident and defended her agency's
policy against providing further public information.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be irresponsible for me to provide specific details," Hunt
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that four agents were involved in the incident, but she
refused to name them. Hunt said the agent who did the shooting asked to
be placed on administrative leave after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   She also played down the significance of the weapon, an M4 assault
rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "You should not get hung up on the word 'rifle,' " Hunt told
reporters. "I know that many people think rifles are these huge, horrible
guns."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt said the car Schultz was riding in was similar to the one FBI
agents were pursuing after the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, agents pulled Schultz and his girlfriend from the
car and handcuffed them before calling a helicopter to take him to the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded man remained hospitalized Wednesday in serious condition
with a shattered right cheek and jaw.</TE>

<HD>Assisted Pregnancies and Risk of Defects Are Linked in Studies</HD>
<DH>Health: Babies conceived by such means as in vitro are said to be
likelier to have complications. But experts say the reports have
shortcomings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In vitro fertilization and other techniques for assisting women in
becoming pregnant may carry an additional, unanticipated risk of birth
defects and other complications, according to new research.</LD>
<LD>   Babies conceived via in vitro fertilization or the injection of sperm
directly into eggs are about twice as likely to be born with a birth
defect as babies conceived without artificial assistance, according to
one study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. Such
babies are also more likely to be born with low birth weight, even if the
babies are carried to term and are not part of a multiple pregnancy,
according to another, independent study also published in the journal.</LD>
<LD>   Even with the higher risk, 90% of babies born as a result of
artificial assistance are normal, the researchers on the birth defects
study said. But the work raises new questions that infertile couples must
weigh in deciding whether to seek high-tech help to become parents, said
the authors of the study.</LD>
<TE>   "People need to realize that there are risks associated with the
procedures--a whole range of them--and they need to know about those to
make informed choices," said Dr. Jennifer Kurinczuk, lead author of one
of the studies and a senior lecturer at the University of Leicester in
England.</TE>
<TE>   But fertility experts, responding to the study, said that the reports
had shortcomings and that the results are not in keeping with other,
earlier reports tracking the fate of babies born by so-called assisted
reproductive technology.</TE>
<TE>   "These are a couple more studies in a long list," said Dr. William
Keye, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and
director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at
William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. "They are not the only data
we have to fall back on."</TE>
<TE>   The new studies do not reveal the underlying cause of whatever higher
risk exists. One or more of the drugs and methods used in assisted
reproductive technology might be responsible, experts said.
Alternatively, the heightened risk might be related to whatever problem
caused the couple to be infertile, rather than to the methods used to
overcome the infertility.</TE>
<TE>   The studies examined large numbers of children conceived by one of two
methods. With in vitro fertilization, eggs and sperm are mixed together
outside the body, and the fertilized eggs are then implanted back into
the mother. In the newer technique known as intracytoplasmic sperm
injection, an individual sperm cell is injected into an egg, which is
then implanted.</TE>
<TE>   In vitro fertilization has been used since the late 1970s;
intracytoplasmic injection was pioneered in the 1990s and is mostly used
in cases of severe male infertility.</TE>
<TE>   Kurinczuk and her colleagues collected data from birth registries in
Western Australia for 1993 through 1997. They compared the rates of birth
defects in 1,138 babies conceived using assisted reproduction with that
of 4,000 naturally conceived infants in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   The authors found that rates of birth defects--ranging from
life-threatening heart defects to milder abnormalities such as hand
deformities--were doubled in the artificially conceived group. Rates of
chromosomal defects were also heightened in this group.</TE>
<TE>   The second study was conducted by a team led by Laura A. Schieve, an
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
team compared the birth weights of 42,463 U.S. infants born in 1996 and
1997 with assisted reproductive technology to more than 3 million U.S.
infants born in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that babies conceived by assisted reproductive
technology were twice as likely to be of low birth weight even when they
were not sharing the womb with another fetus and were carried to term.</TE>
<TE>   Statistical analysis suggested that the results couldn't be explained
by the somewhat older age of mothers undergoing fertility treatments and
the greater likelihood that this was their first pregnancy, Schieve said.
She and her colleagues suspect that something about the treatment is
causing the heightened risk.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are unable to separate what specific treatments may be related
to this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, babies with low birth rates are at higher risk for
neurological problems and developmental delays, and those with very low
birth weights are at especially heightened risk, said Dr. Michael E.
Speer, professor of pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston. Thus the results are of concern, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But there are many unanswered questions in the studies, said Keye and
Dr. Jamie Grifo, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive
Technology and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York
University School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear, for example, how much smaller the babies were in the
birth weight study and whether these lowered weights were severe enough
to create problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to tell my patients what I always tell my patients--we
don't know the impact and risk one undergoes with these procedures,"
Grifo said. "But for the next six months, I am going to go nuts with
every patient coming in with these articles. They should be discussed.
But we have to be careful about how we present these kinds of articles
because they can alarm people and create anxiety where maybe there
shouldn't be."</TE>

<HD>First Human Uterus Transplant Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Doctors in Saudi Arabia have performed the first human uterus
transplant, which produced two menstrual periods before it failed and had
to be removed.</LD>
<LD>   The experiment indicated a womb transplant is technically achievable,
but experts say it is highly risky and ethically questionable. Some say
it won't be practical until less toxic anti-rejection drugs become
available.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of uterus transplants was first explored in the 1950s. But
after 20 years of failed experiments on dogs and baboons, many scientists
considered it impossible because of the complex blood vessels that must
be connected and because of fears that anti-rejection drugs could harm a
fetus.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Wafa Fageeh, a professor at Abdulaziz University who performed the
transplant with her team at King Fahd Hospital and Research Center in
Jidda, Saudi Arabia, called the operation "a good start."</TE>
<TE>   "It is technically feasible, theoretically desirable, but presently
unsafe," said Roger Gosden, a fertility pioneer at Eastern Virginia
Medical School in Norfolk, Va. "Their results reveal the risks and this
procedure awaits the development of safe immunosuppression.</TE>
<TE>   "A transplant to save life is an acceptable risk, but not one for
fertility, when there are alternatives. This is why we would never be
given ethical clearance to try this in the United States" for the
foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, reported this week in the International Journal of
Gynecology and Obstetrics, failed because a blood vessel supplying the
uterus developed a clot, which cut off the blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give them credit. They took a concept that everybody
thought was undoable and they did it," said Dr. Louis Keith, an
obstetrician and gynecologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in
Chicago who was not involved in the research.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought enough blood to the uterus for the uterus to survive 99
days and function as a uterus is supposed to function--which is to
menstruate," said Keith, who is assistant editor of the journal that
published the report.</TE>
<TE>   The transplant, using the womb of a 46-year-old post-menopausal woman
who had to have a hysterectomy, was performed April 6, 2000, on a
26-year-old Saudi woman who had lost her uterus because of excessive
bleeding after childbirth.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Amtrak President George Warrington is resigning to become head of
New Jersey's bus and rail agency, a surprise move that comes as the
financially troubled national passenger railroad fights efforts to break
it up.</LD>
<LD>   Warrington will stay at Amtrak until an interim successor is named, an
Amtrak source said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Warrington, 49, has led Amtrak through a difficult four years, during
which the railroad tried to end its three-decade reliance on operating
subsidies from the federal government.</LD>
<TE>   Warrington's strategy was to have the railroad attain fiscal health,
but costs continued to rise. Watchdogs now agree that it will not achieve
self-sufficiency by the December deadline set by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak spokesman Bill Schulz declined to comment when asked if
Warrington was leaving. Warrington could not be reached.</TE>

<HD>Oldest Fossils Just 'an Illusion,' Scientists Contend</HD>
<DH>Paleontology: Signs of life 3.5 billion years old are only flaws in
rock, not benchmarks of early life, analysis says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most heralded findings of
paleontology--3.5-billion-year-old rocks considered to be the Earth's
oldest fossils--may be merely "an illusion," according to a new analysis
published Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which claims the rocks do not contain any signs of life at
all, is hotly contested by the fossils' original discoverer. If true,
however, it could rewrite much of Earth's early history. It could also
change notions of whether the planet's first life evolved in warm pools
or scalding hot springs. That, in turn, has bearing on how likely it is
that life may have taken hold on other planets.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA paleontologist J. William Schopf received worldwide acclaim a
decade ago when he said he had discovered 3.5-billion-year-old fossils in
ancient Australian rock. He concluded that some of the tiny traces were
the remains of cyanobacteria capable of photosynthesis that lived in
shallow, sunlit lagoons.</LD>
<TE>   Because more conclusive fossils showing signs of life are just 2.7
billion years old, the older find suggested that relatively complex life
forms had evolved on Earth spectacularly quickly--soon after the planet's
first rocks formed.</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of cyanobacteria is a benchmark in Earth history. The
organisms produce oxygen and were largely responsible for shaping the
environment that made the evolution of air-breathing creatures, like
ourselves, possible.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments now swirling around the ancient rocks involve complex
geochemical analyses and questions about what scientists see when they
look through their microscopes.</TE>
<TE>   Schopf sees complex biological structures that resemble bacteria that
live today: filaments of barrel-shaped cells capped by distinct
muffin-shaped cells on either end.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of experts from England and Australia say that Schopf--and
the many scientists who accepted his findings and enshrined them in
textbooks--were fooled. Schopf's fossils, they claim, are nothing more
than exotic minerals, rock flaws and isolated bubbles and blobs.</TE>
<TE>   "The cells are an illusion," said Martin D. Brasier, a paleontologist
at the University of Oxford who led the analysis published in today's
issue of the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   As proof, he said some of the same structures described by Schopf have
been found within volcanic glass, a place where life forms have never
been detected. He described himself as "100% confident" in the new
results.</TE>
<TE>   Schopf is equally confident that Brasier's team is wrong. When
questions arose, Schopf reexamined his original rock samples using a new
and superior imaging technique.</TE>
<TE>   The new technique, he writes in a paper also published in today's
issue of Nature, offers the strongest evidence yet that the fossils have
distinct shapes reminiscent of microbes. The shapes are made of a
coal-like organic carbon that is a signature of living creatures, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brasier asserts that a rare chemical process, and not life forms,
created the organic carbon. Schopf dismisses that as something that "has
never, ever been identified in the geological record."</TE>
<TE>   "They're just wrong. These are good fossils," Schopf said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute demonstrates the difficulty of looking for the first
traces of life on Earth. Few rocks from the Earth's earliest epochs have
survived unscathed. And the first life forms--microbes without bones or
hard outer shells--don't leave much of a trace.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient fossil organisms are the most difficult he has ever worked
with, microbes that are "fried, decayed, broken up," Schopf said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say fossils, people think about dinosaurs and wonder why
this is so difficult," said Andrew Knoll, a Harvard University
paleontologist and expert on younger and more complex bacterial fossils
than those studied by Schopf. "It's a really tough game to find evidence
of life in these really, really old rocks."</TE>
<TE>   Knoll agrees Schopf's rocks may contain chemical traces of some type
of past life but has long questioned the assumption that the chemicals
came from photosynthetic bacteria. There just isn't enough evidence,
Knoll said, to describe the physiological workings of ancient life forms.</TE>
<TE>   David DesMarais at NASA Ames Research Center, an expert on the Earth's
early chemistry, said the new report raises questions about whether
living things caused the microstructures seen in the rocks. DesMarais
said he believes the distinct form of carbon in the rocks probably did
come from living creatures.</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely that the carbon came from a rare chemical process, as
Brasier asserts, DesMarais said.</TE>
<TE>   The most important part of the new paper is what it adds to our ideas
about how life formed, he added. A thorough geological analysis shows
that the rocks did not come from a warm shallow pool but from a
hydrothermal spring 150 feet below ground.</TE>
<TE>   The finding adds weight to the theories that Earth's first life may
have originated in a tempestuous environment--on the flanks of undersea
volcanic vents or in steaming hot springs like those now found in
Yellowstone National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Schopf, who heads the Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin
of Life at UCLA, is considered the "dean of ancient life" and a leader of
the field he helped create.</TE>
<TE>   He has spent much of his career debunking myriad false claims of
fossils in ancient rock. In 1996, Schopf was one of the most vocal
critics of an idea put forth by NASA scientists that a Martian meteorite
contained traces of extraterrestrial microscopic life. The idea has since
been discredited.</TE>
<TE>   Now the same criticisms Schopf leveled at the Mars rock--that the
signs were not biological at all--are being leveled against his own work.</TE>
<TE>   Said Henry Gee, an editor at Nature who wrote an article accompanying
the new research: "That is the name of the game for claims of life at the
extremes of time and space."</TE>

<HD>Energy Lawsuits Imminent, Lockyer Says</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Attorney general says the actions will allege
antitrust violations, breach of contract by power producers during
crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he traveled California Wednesday with other leading Democratic
officeholders and candidates, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said he will soon
file major lawsuits against independent energy producers who profited
from last year's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "We've done sufficient investigation and research, and know there are
actions that need to be filed against energy producers," Lockyer said.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits could be filed as early as next week, according to the
attorney general.</LD>
<TE>   The suits will allege a variety of wrongs, including antitrust
violations, breach of contract, and violations of California's unfair
business practices statute, the state's main anti-fraud statute.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal investigations also continue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy
Producers, a trade association of private energy producers and marketers
in California, questioned why Lockyer is acting so long after power
prices peaked in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But he welcomed an opportunity to put allegations of gouging to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are real issues here that need to be publicly aired, we
would like to see that happen," said Smutny-Jones. "What's happening now
is this sort of constant innuendo and trial by headlines. But facts are
never brought forward, evidence is not brought forward."</TE>
<TE>   "If there's something there that's specific and needs to be addressed,
let's see it," he said. "But otherwise let's stop the rhetoric and fix
the underlying energy problems confronting California. Unless we get
those things fixed, we're almost guaranteed to repeat the history we just
had."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits, more than a year in the making, are sure to play a part
in Lockyer's reelection campaign against state Sen. Richard Ackerman
(R-Irvine), as well as that of Gov. Gray Davis, who led Wednesday's
Democratic barnstorming trip. The governor also could use the suits as
leverage as he tries to renegotiate contracts with energy producers.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration negotiated those contracts and defended them
for months, but more recently has said that some of them were struck
under adverse circumstances and should be reconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, meanwhile, explained his decision on Tuesday to nominate
Michael Peevey, a former Southern California Edison executive, to the
California Public Utilities Commission as an attempt to make the
five-member commission more moderate.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe the board needed some balance," Davis said. "We have
three consumer advocates. The PUC is dealing with some very complicated
financial matters. We needed someone with business acumen."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups protested Peevey's nomination when it was announced
Tuesday. Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
in Santa Monica said Davis was putting the interests of the power
industry ahead of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said that while Peevey profited from energy deregulation, he
probably will not advocate further deregulation if he is confirmed by the
state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters rightly assume my appointees will reflect more or less my
point of view, and I have said repeatedly that we will go back to energy
deregulation over my dead body," Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Behind That Winning Smile, a Bulldog Spirit</HD>
<DH>Politics: Those who know him say determination is the hole card of
mild-mannered Bill Simon Jr.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bill Simon Jr. told his eldest sister he was running for
governor last year, she gave him some free advice: "You're crazy!" How,
she wondered, could her gentle, lighthearted brother survive in the
"snake pit of politics?"</LD>
<LD>   The snakes may eventually get Simon, but he got through Round 1 in the
pit without losing much blood. In a wild finish that astonished even the
most seasoned political pros, the Los Angeles investor knocked off the
GOP gubernatorial favorite--Richard Riordan--with ample votes to spare.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes eight months of war with Gov. Gray Davis. And as a hoarse
but gleeful Simon reveled in his newfound status Wednesday, a few fateful
questions hung in the air:</LD>
<TE>   Just who is this mega-rich, 50-year-old father of four with the Clark
Kent look and perpetual smile? And does he have what it takes to stand up
to Davis' withering attacks?</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, there seems reason to wonder. Aside from a turn as
class president at Williams College, Simon is an utter political
greenhorn. A New Jersey transplant who settled here 12 years ago, he
hadn't even visited much of California until the campaign trail led him
there.</TE>
<TE>   And though Simon never wavered in his yearlong drive to win the
state's top political job, he admitted Wednesday that the reality of his
improbable coup is somewhat hard to fathom:</TE>
<TE>   "This is a little bit overwhelming for me," he told a cheering
breakfast crowd in Los Angeles. No doubt. Just moments before, President
Bush had called to congratulate him on the double-digit win--and offer
whatever help he might need.</TE>
<TE>   While comfortable in the spotlight, it is not a place where Simon--a
self-deprecating sort--typically resides. Despite his personal
fortune--he won't reveal his exact net worth--he is not one to rub elbows
with bigwigs and eschews many of the trappings of wealth.</TE>
<TE>   He may live in a $3-million home in Pacific Palisades, but friends say
he's happiest in a sweatsuit shooting hoops or eating a hot dog on the
beach. Until recently, he drove an old powder-blue Cadillac that often
had his surfboard strapped on top.</TE>
<TE>   A father of four, Simon the candidate still tries to get home at night
to help out with homework. Campaign schedulers, meanwhile, are under
orders to work around his daughter's horse shows and overnights with his
son's Boy Scout troop.</TE>
<TE>   Active in a host of charities, Simon is also a devout Catholic who has
made numerous pilgrimages to Lourdes, the shrine at the foot of the
Pyrenees. He says he tries to live by his mother's admonition:
"Character," she told Bill and his six younger siblings, "is what you do
when people aren't looking."</TE>
<TE>   Pundits marvel at Simon's surge from obscurity, but friends of the
earnest guy they call Billy say they never counted him out. A former
federal prosecutor in New York, Simon has a sunny exterior that masks an
indefatigable drive.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an unbelievable plugger," says friend Barbara Lyne. "He's like
the dog on your leg," adds Henry Brandon, who works at Simon's West L.A.
investment company, William E. Simon &amp; Sons. "You keep shaking and
shaking and he's always there."</TE>
<TE>   Tenacity is clearly an asset in politics, but Simon would probably not
be where he is today if not for one thing--his wealth. It took $5 million
of his own money, plus about half a million from siblings, to help
finance his primary campaign.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Simon's family pedigree makes government service a natural.
His late father, William E. Simon, served as Treasury secretary to
presidents Nixon and Ford and as Energy secretary during the oil crisis
of the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, however, Simon the son had charted a different
course, preferring to focus his public life on charity work. Most of his
time and money have been spent on Covenant House, which provides shelter
and other help to runaway teens, and Catholic Charities of Los Angeles.
He and his wife, Cindy, also launched a foundation that funds
scholarships and school improvement projects.</TE>
<TE>   Simon portrays his foray into politics as an extension of his
philanthropic work, but it also reflects his deep faith. In recent years,
his business accomplishments have left him feeling "strangely empty."
Becoming governor, he figures, is another way he might serve God and play
a more meaningful role.</TE>
<TE>   As it is for many rookies, the transition from private businessman to
candidate was a rocky one for Simon. Despite a battery of consultants and
public speaking tips from his priest at St. Monica's Catholic Church, he
appeared wooden and overly scripted in his early campaign speeches. He
struggled to master the myriad issues confronting the state, and faced
tough questions about his spotty voting record and credentials to vault
from nowhere to governor.</TE>
<TE>   "There were definitely good days and days that weren't so good," said
John Herrington, his campaign chairman. "He wasn't used to the exposure."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, however, Simon's performances took a dramatic turn,
showing new polish, greater command of policy and comfort before the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   He was buoyed in part by campaign help from his old boss at the U.S.
attorney's office, the popular ex-mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani.
Joining Simon for fund-raisers and in TV ads, Giuliani provided a
validating presence that analysts say helped put Simon on the map.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered around Los Angeles, Simon's friends had only one lament as
they watched their buddy become the GOP nominee:</TE>
<TE>   The popular pickup basketball game he used to host at his home each
Friday afternoon will be suspended for another eight months. Or more.</TE>

<HD>Top Republican Officials Distance White House From Riordan's Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>

</DL>
<LD>Although President Bush encouraged Richard Riordan to run for
governor, top Republican political strategists insisted Wednesday that
blame for the former Los Angeles mayor's stunning loss should not be laid
at the White House's doorstep.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, a senior administration official cited three reasons for the
outcome of Tuesday's Republican primary: a devastating attack on Riordan
by Gov. Gray Davis, Riordan's own poor performance as a candidate and
what the White House viewed as a mistake-free campaign by businessman
Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   A political strategist close to Bush said the White House now will be
watching how Simon fares in November as the GOP nominee. A strong showing
by Simon against Davis, the strategist said, could lead Bush to make a
point of competing for the state in 2004. Conversely, a sizable Davis
victory probably would discourage him from contesting California.</LD>
<TE>   "The result in 2002 could really determine that," the strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite spending more than $20 million on the state, Bush lost
California by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore in 2000. Since he
took office, Bush and his advisors have pondered how to improve on that
performance and rebuild the state's downtrodden GOP organization. Riordan
was seen by the White House as a centrist with the best shot at unseating
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Now, questions about the White House strategy are being raised anew in
the aftermath of Riordan's flameout.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House team has done a lot right," said Charlie Cook, an
independent political analyst in Washington. "But in the case of
California, they've done wrong. They just don't understand the state."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush team's misstep in the state contrasts with effective
interventions in GOP circles this year in Minnesota, North Carolina and
South Dakota. In those states, the Senate candidate embraced by Bush and
his team appears all but certain to win the party's nomination. And each
has a strong shot at winning in November.</TE>
<TE>   The senior administration official, asked if California should be
viewed as a continuing political mystery to Bush and his team, replied:
"California is a big state and they are going to make their own
decisions. We know that."</TE>
<TE>   Bush allies in California insisted that the president should not be
judged harshly for Tuesday's results.</TE>
<TE>   State Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga noted
that the president never directly endorsed Riordan and never campaigned
for him publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan was not 'the Bush candidate,' " said Brulte, who helped lead
the Bush presidential campaign in California. He said the White House
also encouraged him and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger to seek the
gubernatorial nod.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials and Bush hands in California repeatedly
helped the Riordan campaign, however. At one point, administration
officials arranged for Riordan to ask Bush to allow California to expand
health care for poor children. Actually, the administration had already
privately approved the move, but the arrangement gave Riordan the ability
to take credit for the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Bush aides on Wednesday were not second-guessing their strategy in
promoting a Riordan candidacy. But the strategist in Washington close to
Bush said White House aides began to have doubts about Riordan even
before the tide had clearly turned against him.</TE>
<TE>   That was one possible reason no one with links to Bush leaped to
Riordan's defense when his credentials as a Republican first came under
attack, the strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   "Long before [Riordan] really started to tank, there was a concern
about what kind of general election candidate he would be," said the
strategist, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush erred in nudging Riordan into the race, he had plenty of
company among prominent Republicans in Washington. Most of the state's
GOP House members urged Riordan to run. Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas)
co-chaired his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan was the one candidate with whom we had worked very
closely," Dreier said. He said Bush advisors did not mastermind the
Riordan strategy, and thus are not responsible for his defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Dreier also said that he advised Bush on Tuesday that it appeared
Simon would win and the president replied, tongue-in-cheek: "I was for
him all along."</TE>

<HD>Bush Tries to Forestall His Court Nominee's Rejection</HD>
<DH>Judiciary: President uses his bully pulpit in a bid to salvage a
Mississippi judge's chances to win an appellate seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday escalated his defense of federal
appeals court nominee Charles W. Pickering Sr., accusing Senate Democrats
who appear ready to derail the appointment of opposing Pickering for
purely partisan reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Pickering, a federal district court judge in Mississippi, is expected
to be the first judicial nominee of the Bush White House rejected by the
Senate Democrats. The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as
today on his nomination to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the
nation's second highest court.</LD>
<LD>   However, Wednesday night Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, ranking
Republican on the committee, said he would likely invoke his right to
obtain an automatic one-week delay. Hatch said that would give
Republicans more time to try to convince Democrats that Pickering "is not
being treated fairly" and to support him.</LD>
<TE>   The battle reflects a continuation of the acrimony over court nominees
that has marked recent administrations, both Republican and Democratic.
It also foreshadows the political war widely seen as inevitable if Bush
is called upon to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court and selects a
conservative candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think it's a warmup for the Supreme Court," said C. Boyden Gray,
who as White House counsel oversaw judicial nominations during the
administration of Bush's father. Those included the controversial pick of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the Pickering nomination argue that he is a conservative
ideologue whose decisions have been reversed because they violated
long-established legal precedent. (Pickering has served on the federal
bench since Bush's father selected him in 1990.)</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), a member of the Senate Judiciary panel,
questioned Pickering sharply on his adherence to judicial ethics in a
civil rights case, suggesting he sought to lessen the sentence for a man
convicted in a cross-burning case.</TE>
<TE>NAACP Chairman Opposes Pickering</TE>
<TE>   Julian Bond, the chairman of the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, has accused Pickering of "perpetuating voting
discrimination against black voters."</TE>
<TE>   Pickering also has been attacked for a law review article he wrote as
a student in 1959 that critics say urged strengthening the Mississippi
law against mixed-race marriages.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering's supporters call attention to the approval he has received
from the American Bar Assn., which gave him its highest rating,
"well-qualified," as evidence of his suitability for a seat on the 5th
Circuit Court.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Wednesday sought to use the prestige of his office to press
the case for Pickering. He invited Pickering, the nominee's son, who is a
Republican House member from Mississippi, and several Democratic
supporters, including civil rights leader Charles Evers, to the Oval
Office.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Pickering "respects the rights of all citizens" and cited
the support of, among others, Frank Hunger, a native of Mississippi who
is former Vice President Al Gore's brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Evers, brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, said
Pickering's critics were playing "the race card." Asked to comment on the
questions raised about Pickering's past positions on race, Evers said,
"Whatever he was then, he's not that now."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer questioned
the appropriateness of criticizing Pickering for the 1959 article. "If
actions taken by people 40 years ago were the criteria, there would be
some senators who were voting on this nomination whose very history would
come into play," Fleischer said. "So I think what you've seen is a nation
that has changed and a region that has changed."</TE>
<TE>   He would not specify any senator whose record might be challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Across the ideological spectrum of activists involved in judicial
fights over the last 20 years, there was agreement that Pickering is
caught in a fight that is likely the first such battle of the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Bush suggested that the conflict was also being played out over the
nomination of Miguel Estrada, his choice for a vacancy on the Circuit
Court in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing too much politics in the United States Senate on our
judge nominees," Bush said in a speech to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oval Office event with Pickering, Bush said of the Senate:
"They're holding this man's nomination up for political purposes. It's
not fair, and it's not right."</TE>
<TE>   The full Senate could vote on the nomination even if Pickering is
rejected by the Judiciary Committee. But Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said Wednesday that, out of respect for the panel and
Senate precedent, he would not bring the nomination to the Senate floor
for a vote. This would effectively kill it.</TE>
<TE>'Stop These Infantile Games'</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the Republican National Committee dispatched e-mails
to supporters accusing the Democrats of seeking at every turn to obstruct
the will of the Republican administration. It urged Republicans to
contact key senators and "tell them to stop these infantile games."</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Rios, president of the Concerned Women for America, a
conservative group, said Pickering has an "exemplary" record. He has
drawn fire, she said, as a shot-across-the-bow warning against any
nominee to the Supreme Court who opposes abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Having been unable to find rulings in his record related to abortion
issues, Pickering's opponents have looked for other issues on which to
challenge him, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Clarence Thomas. Look at Robert Bork [a Reagan Supreme Court
nominee rejected by the Senate], and now look at Charles Pickering," she
said. "These are fine men."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Neas, president of the liberal group People for the American
Way, who played a central role in opposing Bork and Thomas, said the ABA
had rated Pickering "well-qualified" before having had the opportunity to
review 90% of his rulings.</TE>
<TE>   One Republican veteran of previous Supreme Court fights equated the
current battle to the delays President Clinton faced in securing approval
of his nominees in a Republican-led Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's the Democrats' turn to flex their muscles a little bit," he
said. "This is the politics not only of payback but of putting cash in
the bank, establishing a benchmark," for future Supreme Court nominees.</TE>

<HD>Balanced Budget Now Possible, Analysts Say</HD>
<DH>Spending: In another sign of the economic rebound, a nonpartisan
agency says a federal surplus is within reach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Providing fresh evidence that the economy is rebounding, the
Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday backtracked on gloomy deficit
predictions and said a balanced budget may still be within reach this
year.</LD>
<LD>   The nonpartisan office now projects that, thanks to a surprising surge
in the economy, current federal budget policies would produce a surplus
of $5 billion this year and $6 billion in 2003--not the deficits of $21
billion and $14 billion it had projected in January for those two years.</LD>
<LD>   "The economy is currently rebounding in a remarkable fashion," CBO
Director Dan L. Crippen told the Senate Budget Committee.</LD>
<TE>   The change in outlook is small in the context of a federal budget that
totals about $2 trillion. But the shift in the CBO's projections could
have a significant political effect.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the numbers should provide new impetus to efforts by
House Republican conservatives to persuade their leadership to propose a
balanced budget this year, even though President Bush has said that war
and recession justify running a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're closer to a balanced budget than it appeared a few weeks ago,"
said Rep. John B. Shadegg (R-Ariz.). "We think that's good news."</TE>
<TE>   The revised CBO forecast also underscored uncertainty about the
trajectory of the economy--and the vagaries of economic projections
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like forecasting the weather," said House Budget Committee
Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Iowa). "Sometimes the wind changes and you have to
rework the whole forecast."</TE>
<TE>   Precisely because there are continuing questions about the strength of
the recovery, Congress is still looking for ways to pass long-stalled
legislation to stimulate the economy. Republicans mounted a new effort
Wednesday to end months of partisan bickering and pass a stripped-down
bill to provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits to the unemployed and
modest tax breaks for businesses. The measure is expected to pass today
in the House, then go to the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of pressure to do something," said Rep. Ray LaHood
(R-Ill.). "We took care of the airlines [following the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks]. We took care of New York. We never took care of the little
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats welcomed the new bill because it omitted the GOP tax cuts
they most opposed. "House Republicans finally released the hostages--and
these are the millions of unemployed people who have suffered, especially
after Sept. 11," said Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   The CBO's new projections were laid out in a report that included
several notes of caution. For one, the predictions of modest surpluses
were based on continuation of current policies--and thus assume no new
tax cuts or spending increases are adopted. That is unlikely because
Congress is expected to approve much of Bush's proposed increases in
defense and homeland security spending.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, CBO analysts estimated that if Congress passed all that Bush
requested, the budget would run a $121-billion deficit in fiscal 2003,
which starts Oct. 1, and a $51-billion deficit in 2004. Bush's budget
office had offered a more optimistic view, estimating that its spending
plan would run a deficit of $80 billion in 2003 and $14 billion in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for the CBO's new projections is that the economy did
not decline in the fourth quarter of last year, as the office had
expected. Instead, it grew by 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The CBO attributed the economic surge in part to surprisingly strong
consumer spending. The report also cited evidence of a rebound in
business spending and unexpected productivity growth.</TE>
<TE>   But Crippen warned that the outlook for growth in the coming months is
"extremely uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of acting on an economic stimulus bill say it is still
needed as a safeguard against recessionary relapses. But action on
stimulus legislation has been stalled for months by bickering between the
parties over the proper mix of tax cuts and unemployment benefits.</TE>

<HD>Army Chief Rebuked for Keeping Ties to Enron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White has drawn an unusual rebuke from
congressional leaders for moving too slowly to sever financial ties to
his former employer, Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "We are concerned by the manner in which you have handled the
divestiture of your interests" in Enron, wrote Sens. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and John W. Warner
(R-Va.), the panel's top Republican, in a March 1 letter to White that
was made public Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   While White did not respond to that letter, he said in a letter to the
senators last month that "I have disclosed all matters that were
requested by the Office of Government Ethics and by your committee. . . .
I will continue my efforts to comply with my ethics agreement."</LD>
<TE>   White spent 11 years at Enron, accruing millions of dollars in company
stock. Before joining the administration, he was vice chairman of Enron
Energy Services, whose accounting practices have come under scrutiny.
That has made him a target for congressional panels investigating the
Dec. 2 bankruptcy of the country's seventh-largest corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The senators' letter accused White of failing to abide by an ethics
agreement, signed in May, requiring him to divest his Enron holdings
within 90 days. In August, he received a 90-day extension.</TE>
<TE>   In October, White accepted an annuity payable in part by the energy
company, according to the senators, who complained that they did not
learn about it until three months later. Levin and Warner said they also
learned in January that White still owned Enron stock options, and they
expressed concern that White could get back Enron stock he had invested
in a partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe that your actions satisfied the requirements of
this committee," they said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Office of Government Ethics also questioned White's
compliance with the ethics agreement. "Secretary White should have
consulted with this office, and he should have amended his ethics
agreement, before electing to take the annuity," an ethics official said
in a Feb. 19 letter to Levin.</TE>
<TE>   But the ethics office, citing White's assurance that he would not
participate in any decision that could affect Enron, said that "as long
as Secretary White abides by this recusal, his interest in an annuity
does not create a conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the senators wrote White: "In the future, we expect you and
other Senate-confirmed officials in the Department of Defense to fully
carry out the commitments that they make in their ethics agreements."</TE>
<TE>   In January and February letters to the ethics office, White said he
believed he had done so.</TE>
<TE>   In other Enron developments Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce
Committee called on more than a dozen investment banks and credit-rating
firms to turn over records related to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   And the Senate Finance Committee reported that Enron offered to make
available its tax records to congressional investigations but set
conditions on how the information could be used.</TE>
<TE>   A joint statement by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the committee
chairman, and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking GOP member, said
the agreement "paves the way for a thorough and comprehensive probe to
determine whether Enron may have engaged in aggressive tax planning to
improperly avoid paying federal income taxes or exploited loopholes in
our tax system."</TE>

<LD>New state charges could be filed in the Abner Louima police torture
case if federal authorities decide against it, a prosecutor said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Charles Hynes of Brooklyn said he was prepared to file the
charges despite last week's appeals court decision throwing out the
federal obstruction-of-justice convictions of three officers.</LD>
<LD>   Hynes said his office would be able to file charges of hindering an

<HD>Spacewalkers Transplant Hubble Scope's 'Heart'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts gave the Hubble Space Telescope a new
central power unit in a risky "heart transplant" Wednesday that ended
with the patient surging back to life.</LD>
<LD>   In order to pull off the surgery, NASA had to turn off the 12-year-old
observatory for the first time while in orbit. A tense four hours and 25
minutes after Hubble went dead, electricity was sent to the newly
installed unit.</LD>
<LD>   "A postoperative report: We have a heartbeat," Mission Control
informed space shuttle Columbia's relieved astronauts.</LD>
<TE>   The telescope's old power control box had a loose screw that caused it
to malfunction on and off. But putting in a new unit amounted to the
riskiest repair job ever attempted on Hubble: The unit was never meant to
be replaced. And once NASA turned off Hubble, there was no guarantee it
could get the telescope working again.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the seven-hour spacewalk was a nail-biting experience for
NASA.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of emotion has been invested into this, in both the hopes that
it will work and the fears that it might not," flight director Bryan
Austin said. "I can tell you right now, those emotions are coming out in
all ways."</TE>
<TE>   "Now that we've given Hubble the power to see to the edge of the
universe, tomorrow we'll give it its eyes so it can see just that," said
astronaut John Grunsfeld, the chief repairman.</TE>
<TE>   During a spacewalk scheduled for early today--the fourth excursion for
Columbia's astronauts in as many days--the crew planned to install a
camera that should increase Hubble's discovery capability tenfold.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's spacewalk got off to a shaky start. A half-hour before
Grunsfeld was to float outside, his spacesuit began leaking. A popped
valve caused as much as a gallon of water to saturate the upper half of
his suit. He pulled off his soaked top and got into a dry one.</TE>
<TE>   He and Richard Linnehan made it out of the hatch two hours late.</TE>
<TE>   The spacewalkers took turns removing 36 connectors from the
telescope's original power-control unit. Grunsfeld pushed in the new unit
and hooked all 36 connectors back up. He used a long spatula and a
specially designed wrench to tighten the hard-to-reach connections on the
4-by-2-by-1-foot black box.</TE>
<TE>   The astronauts had to race against the clock. The telescope's systems
could have been damaged by the cold if left without power for eight
hours.</TE>
<TE>   With the repairs completed, power was sent coursing through the
telescope and, one by one, the multitude of systems slowly awakened.</TE>

<HD>Court's Ten Commandments Plaque Is Ordered Removed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Wednesday ordered county officials to remove an
82-year-old Ten Commandments plaque from a courthouse, calling it an
unconstitutional display of the biblical text.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-by-39-inch bronze plaque at the Chester County Courthouse is
inscribed with a version of the Ten Commandments from the King James
version of the Bible.</LD>
<LD>   "The tablet's necessary effect on those who see it is to endorse or
advance the unique importance of this predominantly religious text for
mainline Protestantism," U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell said.</LD>
<TE>   His ruling came after a two-day trial that included testimony from
theologians and members of the Freethought Society of Greater
Philadelphia, which describes itself as a group of atheists, agnostics,
humanists and others.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said they would consider an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our display of the Ten Commandments plaque is entirely consistent
with the original intent" of the 1st Amendment, said County Commissioner
Colin Hanna.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Is Ousted in a Town Divided</HD>
<DH>Economics: Voters in the debt-ridden city recall a three-term
incumbent. Race is a subtext writ large.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FLINT, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>A recall election ousted the longtime mayor this week, exposing
racial tensions in this segregated auto town that the good times have
forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   Woodrow Stanley, 51, lost decisively Tuesday in a recall election
sponsored by angry residents who accused the third-term incumbent of
being more interested in hanging on to his $107,000-a-year job than
dealing aggressively with a city budget deficit that has ballooned to
more than $30 million.</LD>
<LD>   Stanley said Wednesday that the recall vote was a "cruel hoax" that
has left voters believing "something magical is going to happen" to make
Flint's worries disappear.</LD>
<TE>   The black mayor also fingered the Flint Journal as the white
establishment force behind an election that has reopened deep racial
wounds in a place where the blacks live north of the Flint River, the
whites to the south. He said the effort turned black against black, just
like the old days in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "The stench of racism that reeks [from] this election will linger in
the nostrils of this community for decades," he told supporters late
Tuesday in his concession speech.</TE>
<TE>   Those who supported the recall agreed it hit a racial nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "It has reopened some long-laying wounds and divided the city along
racial lines," said Roger Samuel, publisher of the Flint Journal, the
paper that supported the recall. "The process is what did that, but the
end result will be the city moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Recall organizers say that their motives were driven by the former
mayor's mismanagement and that Stanley has a history of playing the race
card. They cite his last reelection, when he referred to his white
opponent's home in northern Michigan as the "big house," a reference to a
slave-master's plantation home.</TE>
<TE>   The recall is the first of a big-city mayor since Omaha booted its
chief executive in 1987. The vote was 15,863 to 12,336.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, city administrator Darnell Earley, who supported
Stanley, was sworn in as interim mayor and vowed to bring the community
together.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a state takeover of its finances, Flint, immortalized in a
1989 documentary about plant closings titled "Roger &amp; Me," must now slash
services even deeper than last year, when it closed a fire station, the
city jail and eliminated 86 jobs in the fire and police departments. The
choices are grim for a citizenry that has seen grass grown knee-high in a
downtown municipal park during summer and its roads lined with potholes
year-round.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will have to be on the table," Earley said. "Every option
must be explored and every effort must be made to bring a balanced budget
before the council for approval."</TE>
<TE>   It is possible for this city of 125,000, about 50 miles northwest of
Detroit, to have four different mayors within 20 months: Stanley, Earley,
a successor to fill out the unexpired term and a new mayor who wins the
regular election in 2003. And since the election to fill the unexpired
term will be a one-time contest held within the next 60 days, the next
mayor could emerge from a crowded field with far less than 50% of the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   The birthplace of General Motors, Flint rose and fell on the fortunes
of the auto giant. A 1937 sit-down strike at a GM plant here gave birth
to the United Auto Workers, and the city rode GM's hot streak to
prosperity during the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the energy crisis of the 1970s and Japanese imports that
flooded the market. A one-company town, Flint took the brunt of it as GM
cut large-car production and the number of auto jobs shrank from 80,000
in the 1980s to 20,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Michael Moore captured the effect of plant closings in his
social commentary, which featured vignettes of the city's
decline--including an interview with a woman who sold rabbit meat--as
Moore tried to get an interview with then-GM Chairman Roger Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the city is even worse off. In 1999, GM closed its Buick City
plant, idling 4,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   The city population has tipped to majority in recent years, even as
more affluent whites have moved into county areas south of Flint from
adjacent Oakland County. That dynamic has caused unease as Stanley worked
to shore up his political support among north Flint voters. (The city's
racial breakdown today is 53% black, 41% white and 3% Latino of any
race.)</TE>
<TE>   Whites still talk about Stanley's comments several years ago during
the selection of a replacement for the Genesee County sheriff, said Flint
Councilman Matt Schlinker. Stanley warned a three-member panel that it
better choose a black candidate he favored or "you better not come north
of the river." Stanley acknowledges making the statement but said it was
about political support in the black community, not a racial taunt.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Stanley said he's been made the scapegoat
for the downturn created by GM's painful withdrawal. And he said the real
force behind the recall is the Journal, which endorsed him when he first
ran in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley said the paper has changed its coverage of his administration
since getting a new publisher, editor and editorial page editor. Indeed,
most everyone here agrees the paper's Aug. 29 editorial, calling for
Stanley to resign, helped galvanize a nascent recall effort.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Keeler, a local UAW official who works in a GM factory here, said
a loose network of community activists was already working at the time to
fashion a recall of Stanley. "He was in our sights," Keeler said, adding
that the editorial gave the effort a big boost.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler said black and white volunteers circulated petitions to recall
Stanley. Many were angry because they believed the mayor was putting his
political longevity ahead of the city's welfare by not clamping down on
spending right after Buick City shut down, when Stanley last ran for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost 4,000 jobs and they were $40,000 per person," Keeler said.
"When you don't have the income coming in, you have to adjust. But since
it was an election year, he didn't want to adjust quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Schlinker, chair of the council's finance committee, said disgruntled
council members began challenging the mayor on the budget. They hired an
auditor, who discovered the 2000 spending plan looked better than it
should have because of a "phantom" $10 million in revenue. When council
members tried to amend the plan, Stanley sued them--forcing an
out-of-court settlement adopting a budget without the questionable $10
million, said Schlinker.</TE>
<TE>   The imbroglio revealed a growing deficit that now threatens the city's
$240-million annual budget. As the deficit mounted, citizens became even
more upset at Stanley's schemes, like a plan to make $300,000 by cutting
down selected trees in city parks and selling them for lumber. A public
outcry ensued and the plan was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens got fed up with a collection of abandoned houses, unrepaired
roads and unkempt city parks. Kearsley Park, in the middle of town, was
never mowed and had grass 2 feet high, said Journal columnist Andrew
Heller, a recall supporter. Residents finally had enough, got out their
lawn mowers and did the job themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler said the community's cumulative frustration fueled a
signature-collection effort that allowed the Citizens United for Better
Government, the grass-roots recall group, to hand in 13,600 names in
December--more than the 8,600 required.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's running out of hope, and I think that people have said we
don't have a year and a half [til the end of Stanley's term] to hang on,"
said Samuel, the Journal publisher. "We've got to start the change
process now, and we're doing so in a very uncertain way."</TE>

<LD>Bicycle rider's race--An article in Tuesday's California section
misidentified the race of Conrad Richard McKay because of erroneous
information provided to The Times by a deputy attorney general. The
prosecutor said in the article that McKay is white, basing the statement
on information in a county probation report. According to the state
Department of Corrections, McKay, whose 1999 arrest was upheld by the
state Supreme Court on Monday, is African American. McKay was taken into
custody and searched for riding his bicycle in the wrong direction on a
residential street and not carrying identification.</LD>

<LD>Milestones tend to sneak up on us while we're doing other things.
Suddenly, the "Musics Alive!" series is celebrating its 10th anniversary,
a validation of a good and worthy idea.</LD>
<LD>   What began as an offshoot of the Ventura Symphony, as a chamber music
event celebrating the convergence of world music and contemporary
classical fare, has become an important West Coast new music event.</LD>
<LD>   The series has continued boldly in the New West Symphony era, hosting
such noted living composers as Lou Harrison and Tania Leon. This year's
theme is summed up under the title "A Celebration of Chinese American
Cinema, Music and Dance 25 Years After the Cultural Revolution," and the
special guest is respected Chinese American composer Bright Sheng.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday night at Mission San Buenaventura's Serra Center, we'll
hear music of Sheng and the West Coast premiere of "Crouching Tiger
Concerto" by Tan Dun, with a companion film created by director Ang Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's "Chamber Gala!" (exclamation points are a series logo by now)
at Ventura City Hall includes Sheng scores and others, with both the
composer and the always impressive Gloria Cheng at piano.</TE>
<TE>   "Musics Alive!" Friday through Sunday. "Dynasties and Beyond: Lily Cai
Chinese Dance Company," Newbury Park High School Performing Arts Center,
456 N. Reino Road, Friday, 7:30 p.m.; $20, $10 children. "Crouching
Tiger," San Buenaventura Mission, 211 E. Main St., Ventura, Saturday, 8
p.m.; $25. "The Lions Roar: Free Family Concert," Pacific View Mall, 3301
E. Main St., Ventura, Sunday, 1 p.m. "Chamber Gala!," Ventura City Hall,
501 Poli St., Sunday, 5 p.m.; $20. (800) 639-9378.

<TE>   On the Choral Beat: This weekend the Ventura County Master Chorale
will perform Bach's towering St. John Passion with the Los Angeles
Baroque Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The chance to hear this music with a period instrument orchestra is a
rarity. "The Evangelist" will be played by Stephen Kronauer, who
performed this and other Baroque roles in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Master Chorale, with Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra,
Friday at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, Ojai, 8 p.m. Also Sunday at St.
John's Seminary, Camarillo, 5 p.m. $20, $18. (805) 653-7282.</TE>
<TE>   American Beauties: Channel Islands Ballet hits the stage of the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's Scherr Forum this weekend for a set of
dance works under the title "American Journey." Included on the program
are "Apollo," choreographed by George Balanchine, "Gershwin Preludes,"
choreographed by the company's director, Yves de Bouteiller, and based on
the great American composer's piano preludes.</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands Ballet, Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza's Scherr Forum,
2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Saturday at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
$22-$12. (805) 384-8558.</TE>
<TE>   Star-Struck Plaza: When Van Cliburn hit town recently, the musical
highs were one thing, but there was that added air of a special event.
Legends are like that, especially with one as concurrently down-to-earth
and elusive as Cliburn, who only performs a few times a year and hasn't
been in Southern California since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The musical turf was familiar to him, since he first caught the
world's ear and became an American hero with his award-winning
performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 at the Tchaikovsky
Piano Competition in 1958. But still, Cliburn, with his perennially
boyish charm and oversized-yet-nimble hands, attended the score's dynamic
highs and lows with freshness and passion. He's still a cool dynamo and
delivered an evening to remember.</TE>
