<HD>Jaramar's Otherworldly Singing Is Transporting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Maybe it's true. Maybe Mexican singer Jaramar has been reincarnated,
a visiting vocalist from centuries past. Her mystical performance
Thursday at the Mayan Theatre, with its fitting pre-Columbian decor,
certainly evoked the spirits of another time and place.</LD>
<LD>   Delicate and elegant, Jaramar sings in ancient tongues we don't
comprehend. One moment she's a Zapotec goddess from southern Mexico,
another a Sephardic wanderer from 15th century Spain.</LD>
<LD>   She doesn't bother to translate. She simply transports her
listeners on a sonic carpet ride. Where are we now? A mosque in the
Middle East? A temple in Tehuantepec? Or sailing a timeless ocean in
search of a seductive mermaid?</LD>
<TE>   This concert could have used a time-travel guide. Jaramar (surname
Soto) arises from an obscure school of musical specialists who
delight in researching and re-creating the songs and poems of the
Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Formerly a singer of nuevo canto
(new song), she fell into the field by chance 20 years ago and felt
she had discovered not only her calling but also her identity.</TE>
<TE>   She worked for 10 years in a group called Ars Antigua with her
husband Alfredo Sanchez, keyboardist-guitarist and artistic director.
The Guadalajara-based couple has collaborated on setting to music the
colonial-era poems of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and the pre-Hispanic
verses of Nezahualcoyotl, the poet-king of Texcoco.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez led an accomplished five-piece combo Thursday, featuring
the enchanting clarinet of Natalie Braux and the stunning percussion
of Hector Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   Looking doll-like in a flowing, lacy gown, Jaramar performed with
a stylized poise, gracefully moving her arms and hands overhead like
a flamenco dancer. She displayed exquisite control of her high
vibrato, dramatically modulated with elastic ease.</TE>
<TE>   In a welcome return to the 20th century, the second half of her
two-hour set featured Mexican favorites such as the mournful "La
Llorona" and the swaying "El Pescador," by Lorenzo Barcelata.</TE>
<TE>   Appreciative fans demanded one encore after another, refusing to
let Jaramar return to whatever worlds she came from.</TE>

<HD>Eminem CD Moved Up to Thwart Piracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vexed by Internet music pirates, Interscope Records will move up by
one week the release of Eminem's highly anticipated new album, which
has been a sensation for more than a week among online fans swapping
it illegally.</LD>
<LD>   Copies of the music from "The Eminem Show" have also been spotted
on New York streets in the hands of bootleg vendors.</LD>
<LD>   The rapper, his manager and his label, hoping to diffuse the
damage, have moved the release date up to May 28, a highly unusual
move for an album with a massive marketing plan in place and
expectations of being a contender for the best-selling album of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a giant decision," an Interscope spokesman said Friday. "To
move the date this far down the road is extremely unusual and a
decision no one took lightly."</TE>
<TE>   To lure fans into paying for music they may have already copped
from their modems, the record label will include a free DVD of music,
behind-the-scenes footage and a cartoon in the first 2 million copies
sold in the U.S. and in overseas markets.</TE>
<TE>   The date switch and bonus disc are the most high-profile examples
to date of record labels' anxiety about online fans compromising
early sales of blockbuster discs.</TE>
<TE>   Albums by Korn and System of a Down are among the other
high-interest releases that have had their retail debuts usurped by
computer-savvy fans.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have tried to combat the risk of exposure by keeping
advance copies and review copies for journalists under tight wraps,
often making music writers visit label offices to hear the guarded
material.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's last album, 2000's "The Marshall Mathers LP," sold nearly
1.8 million copies its first week in the stores. Its total U.S. sales
are now at 8.7 million.</TE>

<HD>Latin Grammys Struggle With Loss of Momentum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrique Fernandez can't stop picturing the show that never was. It
plays over and over in his head. He sees the exciting performances
and the big finale, just as the stars rehearsed it in the days before
Sept. 11, 2001, the doomed date for the second annual Latin Grammy
Awards ceremony at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences' executive director
hasn't been able to shake the sense of loss since last year's
terrorist attacks, which paralyzed the nation and forced the show's
cancellation along with numerous other events. Even as he sifts
through the list of new hopefuls for this year's Latin Grammy
ceremony, Fernandez laments the musical moments that were lost,
including the national debut of Colombian newcomer Juanes.</LD>
<LD>   "It was such a terrific show, it was going to blow everybody's
mind," says Fernandez, recalling the planned surprise finale with 25
Asturian bagpipers. "That was going to generate so much energy. I'm
still in mourning about it."</LD>
<TE>   The Latin academy hasn't recovered completely either. Last year's
cancellation caused an estimated $2 million in losses to the nascent
group's parent organization, the Santa Monica-based National Academy
of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. And it set back by at least a year
plans to make the Latin Grammys financially independent.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't just lose money, we lost impetus," says Fernandez,
whose main office is in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Latin academy has also lost its founder, president and
prime mover. Michael Greene, who cultivated the Latin Grammys as a
pet project, resigned in April after 14 years as president and chief
executive of NARAS amid questions over his personal behavior and his
leadership of the organization. The move means Greene also vacates
his post as president of the Latin academy.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's departure, however, is not expected to cause an immediate
disruption because he plans to stay on as a full-time consultant to
the Grammy organization for six months. Besides, Greene eventually
planned to step down as president of the Latin academy, ceding
control to new leadership. Events accelerated the transition.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want more than anything is for LARAS to be its own
entity, controlled by its own board and having its own destiny in its
own hands," Greene said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Greene downplayed the long-term negative effect of a jinxed 2001
that also saw the Latin Grammy show pull out of Miami at the last
minute to avoid anti-Castro protests. He said insurance offset some
of the losses of the show's cancellation, and that prospects for the
future look good.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to create a separate board of trustees for the Latin academy
are "right on target," he said. Grammy officials have made overtures
to leading industry figures, such as Miami-based producer Emilio
Estefan and Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Ruben Blades, to join
the governing body, though membership won't be revealed until it is
finalized. The new board's first meeting is expected to take place
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a volunteer position, yet it's a heavy responsibility,"
Fernandez says. "They will have the final say on anything we do."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there's a lot riding on the third annual Latin Grammy
show, scheduled to be televised internationally Sept. 18 from the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. Success could put the Latin academy in
the black and put plans to expand membership in other countries back
on track.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the main Grammy organization, the Latin academy recruits
members internationally, in Spain, Portugal and Latin America. It now
has some 4,000 members, almost half from countries outside the U.S.,
primarily Mexico, Brazil and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's problems have delayed plans to open chapters in some
of these major markets, Greene conceded. Once the academy finds its
footing again, a new drive to promote the Latin Grammys
internationally will be a top priority. Greene said the organization
is considering sponsoring showcase concerts in economically troubled
but musically rich countries such as Colombia and Argentina, where
membership is lagging.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the Latin Grammys are suffering an image problem south
of the border, according to Fernandez. Some Latin Americans,
historically wary of their powerful northern neighbor, still don't
trust the U.S.-headquartered organization, he said. Others reject
what they perceive as imposition of musical tastes by a colonial
power.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think there are five gringos in a smoke-filled room
in Los Angeles giving out the Grammys," Fernandez says.</TE>
<TE>   To combat what he calls misinformation about the complicated
Grammy rules and procedures, the Latin academy needs to recruit new
members in other countries so they can experience the voting process
firsthand. Plans call for the group to hire a full-time membership
manager.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we were set back a year by not having a show, we
refuse to be stopped," Fernandez says. "We do not want to be victims
of events."</TE>

<HD>'Cosby Show' Looks Back in Triumph</HD>
<DH>Television* One of the most popular series in history, it
portrayed a well-to-do black family and started NBC on a long
Thursday win streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL E. HILL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a month that has been awash in heavily watched TV nostalgia shows,
NBC has managed to save the best for last.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday at 9 p.m., "The Cosby Show: A Look Back," captained by the
show's star and co-creator, Bill Cosby, takes a two-hour look at the
landmark program that reinvigorated the sitcom format and the show's
network. It also gave television an African American-oriented series
against which all others are measured.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which debuted in the fall of 1984 and ran until
September 1992, featured stand-up comic Cosby and Phylicia Rashad as
the upscale parents of five children.</LD>
<TE>   The family--four girls with a boy in the middle, ages ranging from
5 to 20--offered a fountain of material reflecting Cosby's philosophy
of warm and caring child-rearing tinged with tough love.</TE>
<TE>   That it was funny, hugely successful and dominated by a black cast
left a large imprint on NBC and the television industry in general
and on the pop-culture history of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The show arrived at a time when most executives and even members
of the viewing audience were of the opinion that the sitcom had had
it, that it was no longer popular," Rashad said. "It proved to be
very popular, and many sitcoms were added to the fall schedules for
years to come, even now."</TE>
<TE>   Rashad recalled the NBC programmer who put the show on the air
when other networks had passed. "We had a great champion in Brandon
Tartikoff," she said of the much-praised executive who died in 1997.
"He saw something he liked."</TE>
<TE>   The show proved to be at the headwaters of what NBC has come to
promote as its "Must-See TV" franchise on Thursday night. For five
seasons, the show was at the top of the Nielsen viewership ratings
lists. Shows including "Cheers," "Family Ties," "Night Court" and
"L.A. Law" benefited from following "The Cosby Show" at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour retrospective, taped before an admiring audience,
offers a pastiche of clips, outtakes and audition tapes, along with
observations on the show's history and impact from people who watched
as well as those who produced the show.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad, who played Clair to Cosby's Cliff Huxtable, notes the
show's radically different approach to black family sitcom humor. The
family, headed by a doctor and a lawyer, was upscale, warm and
loving, the kids respectful toward their elders.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time we'd seen an African American family
portrayed in this light of truth," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to overestimate the popularity of "The Cosby Show." And
its popularity, coupled with its cast makeup and African American
themes, made it significant.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all," said Robert J. Thompson, who was not part of the
show, "it was arguably one of the most popular TV series ever in the
history of the medium."</TE>
<TE>   Two shows, he noted, have topped the Nielsen ratings for five
consecutive seasons: "All in the Family" from 1971 to '76 and "The
Cosby Show" from 1985 to '90. "That's something only those two shows
ever achieved."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University and director of the
school's Center for the Study of Popular Television, likened the show
to television's popular sitcoms of the 1950s and early '60s.</TE>
<TE>   "On one level, 'The Cosby Show' showed how enduring the old notion
of 'Father Knows Best,' 'The Donna Reed Show' and 'Leave It to
Beaver' really was in the American culture," said Thompson. "Even
back in the '50s when they aired, it was sort of utopian, it was
catnip for the public. Who would think that in the '80s, after
Watergate and Vietnam, that format would still have a few tricks up
its sleeve? It was that way for two orbital shows, too, 'Family Ties'
and 'Who's the Boss?'"</TE>
<TE>   The TV special focuses on the fun generated by the sitcom, in
front of and behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   The actors who played four of the Huxtable children are on hand:
Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played 14-year-old Theodore, or just Theo;
Tempestt Bledsoe, who played Vanessa at age 8; Sabrina Le Beauf, the
oldest Huxtable at 20; and Keshia Knight Pulliam, now a radiant young
woman after being so familiar as the precocious 5-year-old, Rudy.
(Also on hand: Raven-Symone, who stole hearts when she joined the
cast in 1989 as the toddler Olivia.)</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Bonet, who played teenage daughter Denise, turned down an
invitation to appear on the retrospective. "The whole experience and
energy behind it felt disingenuous and motivated by corporate
profit," the 34-year-old actress told People magazine. "I felt
devalued and disrespected."</TE>
<TE>   The show's clips and recollections generally revolve around the
humor found in family situations, the tightness of the Huxtable clan
and the sizable contributions of Rashad, who could both relate to
Cosby as a spouse and deal with the children too.</TE>

<HD>Celebrating the Dead Is No Grave Undertaking</HD>
<DH>Television* An HBO documentary tells how a group of friends
turned a bankrupt Hollywood cemetery into a spiffed-up screenland
shrine.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood Memorial Park, the final resting place of such legendary
Hollywood denizens as Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Cecil B.
DeMille, Peter Lorre and Tyrone Power, fell into bankruptcy in the
1990s, losing its license in 1994. Families were disinterring their
loved ones and moving them to operational cemeteries.</LD>
<LD>   Then in 1998, Tyler Cassity, a movie-star-handsome 31-year-old
from Kansas City, Mo., bought the 62-acre property on Santa Monica
Boulevard for $375,000. Cassity, his brother Brent and their friends
changed the cemetery's name to Hollywood Forever, renovating the
dilapidated grounds and introducing the latest in funeral-business
technology, including digital memorials and Webcast funeral services.
An in-house mini film studio, Forever Studios, produces the
multimedia "life stories" of its clients</LD>
<LD>   How Cassity and his cronies transformed the dormant cemetery into
a thriving business is the subject of the HBO "America Undercover"
documentary "The Young and the Dead," airing Sunday on the cable
network after "Six Feet Under," HBO's drama series revolving around a
family-owned L.A. funeral home.</LD>
<TE>   The husband-and-wife documentary team of Shari Springer Berman and
Robert Pulcini was looking for a follow-up to its acclaimed 1998
feature debut, "Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's," chronicling
the shuttering of the famed Beverly Hills restaurant, and thought a
documentary about the cemetery would be an interesting sequel.</TE>
<TE>   "Chasen's is about celebration," Berman said. "On the surface, it
is a place where people celebrate, get married and have anniversary
parties. But the movie itself was really about death." Though
Hollywood Forever is a cemetery, she added, "The way Tyler was
approaching it, it seemed like he was focusing on the celebration of
life. It seemed like an interesting follow-up."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers spent a year at Hollywood Forever. The documentary
chronicles the often eccentric regulars who visit the cemetery every
day, as well as the devoted fans who attend the annual Valentino
memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what interested us most was how passionate these young
people were about their new business," said Pulcini. "They were new
to Los Angeles and new to this business, and they were really
excited. They kind of had their post-college friendship going on. We
wanted to capture that feeling of how much they loved the place and
how excited they were about their ideas."</TE>
<TE>   New Owner Dresses Up the Valentino Memorial</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Forever, which shares a back wall with Paramount
Pictures, was established in 1899 and features two major mausoleums
that are the final resting places of various stars, as well as
elaborate headstones, including ones shaped like obelisks and rocket
ships.</TE>
<TE>   Jules Roth, a rather colorful and somewhat unsavory character who
spent the Great Depression in San Quentin, took over the cemetery
after his release from prison. Roth, also known as Jules Hine Roth,
was a white-collar criminal and once the right-hand man of oil stock
swindler C.C. Julian. Roth is buried at Hollywood Forever.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons why the cemetery went bankrupt was that Roth
kept the memorial park segregated. In fact, he refused to allow
Oscar-winning African American actress Hattie McDaniel to be buried
there 50 years ago. Once Cassity took over, he honored the actress by
building a monument dedicated to the "Gone With the Wind" star.</TE>
<TE>   Participating in "The Young and the Dead" was "in a strange way an
education in what we do," said Tyler Cassity, who with his brother
now owns six cemeteries. "I always thought we could learn a lot from
these professional teams documenting us, because that's what we do
with everyone else. We saw it as a learning process."</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrival, Cassity has also dressed up the Valentino
memorial--a ceremony that has been going on since the screen idol's
death in 1926. "We added historians and entertainment," he said.
"It's fun to see something that is 75 years old become more than it
was."</TE>
<TE>   In the documentary, a bust of Roth rested behind Cassity's desk,
but it has since been moved. "We started not to get along," he said,
laughing. "So he's up on the third floor. He was a real playboy.
There is a room adjacent to my office that used to be his playboy
room--with the bar and the lounge and a little TV that pops out of
the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Like Paramount, Hollywood Forever is said to be one of the most
haunted areas in Los Angeles. Valentino, for example, supposedly
walks back and forth across the wall between the studio and the
cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "Clifton Webb is supposed to get up in the middle of the night and
walk the corridors of the mausoleum," said Cassity. "I think with all
of those things your imagination has to be primed."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Forever does have a connection with HBO's "Six Feet
Under," which shoots a few blocks away at the Sunset-Gower Studios.
"At the beginning of the season we had numerous meetings with the
writers," Cassity said. "They film here, and we are their prop house.
Also, our embalmer has gone on their staff as a technical advisor."</TE>
<TE>   Berman thought doing "The Young and the Dead" would be a
depressing experience but found that it wasn't. "It was surprisingly
uplifting," she said. "I understand the appeal of the place. When we
go to L.A. ... if we have time to kill in the afternoon, a lot of the
times we will actually go there and have a coffee. It's beautiful and
very peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Young and the Dead" can be seen Sunday at 10 p.m. on HBO.</TE>

<HD>Fans Take Another Look at Pavarotti, Then and Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am saddened to see Mark Swed, who generally shows insight and
judgment in his offerings, refer to Luciano Pavarotti as "the sorry
situation of a has-been who succumbed to the excesses of stardom"
("Pavarotti's Not Going Out as a Class Act," May 13).</LD>
<LD>   Even though Pavarotti has obviously not been in the best health
for the last number of years, any singer knows he would not have
rehearsed for those performances had he not intended to perform. But
here he is: a 66-year-old man suffering from the flu, still expected,
like Offenbach's Olympia, to be wound-up and continue to please us.</LD>
<LD>   Opera singers have the courage to spend their entire lives on a
high wire, far, far above--and there is no safety net below. Now
reaching the point in his dazzling career that he can no longer do
so, we throw him onto the ever-growing heap of "has-beens," rather
than appreciating the gifts of a great artist, and understanding that
such beauty inevitably fades.</LD>
<TE>   JOHANNA DORDICK</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite an understandable frustration at Pavarotti's recent
cancellations at the Met, Swed's commentary told readers more about
the author than the subject. The combination of name dropping about
Ned Rorem and boasting of being in Covent Garden rightly suggests
that Swed is far more aware of his own social agenda than music
history.</TE>
<TE>   As he indicated, Pavarotti's voice will be regarded as one of the
finest of the 20th century, and by virtue of that fact deserves more
respect than the author afforded him.</TE>
<TE>   MARK HUMPHREY</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our problem with Pavarotti is that at one time he was truly great
and gave us a thrill a minute, and once this was gone we were no
longer happy with just very good. Knowing when and how to exit is not
hard.</TE>
<TE>   What is hard is to admit to oneself that it is time to go.</TE>
<TE>   Pavarotti was a superb opera singer and we are planning to forget
his pathetic exit and remember the thrills.</TE>

<LD>Knowing a healthy dose of "suspension of disbelief" is necessary to
accept most forms of entertainment, I have overlooked many of the
dubious plot devices and details of the Fox series "24" because I
liked the show.</LD>
<LD>   For example: A plane blew up in the first episode and was
forgotten by everyone by the end of the second episode. Kim escaped a
car wreck, a drug-bust gun battle, two (or is it three?) kidnappings
and a stint in the jail cell from hell without so much as whiplash.
Dennis Hopper's accent ... enough said.</LD>
<LD>   But when Jack made it from downtown L.A. to Saugus in 30 minutes
at 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, I gave up!</LD>

<LD>In his article "Steam Cleaning" (May 14), Patrick Goldstein accepts
without question the statement of Michael De Luca that today's young
filmmakers are not interested in sexual subject matter, and the first
two he names were the directors of "Boogie Nights" and "Spanking the
Monkey." What planet does De Luca live on? He pointedly does not
mention directors like Todd Solondz and Neil LaBute, who have created
controversy over the sexual nature of their films.</LD>
<LD>   It is plain to me that today's young filmmakers are very much
concerned with sexual matters. What they are not concerned with is
the belief in Adultery as Apocalypse, which is the concern of some of
our 60-ish directors, who grew up in a time far more repressive than
even John Ashcroft could imagine.</LD>
<LD>   The major reason more sexually provocative films do not get made
is the terminally hypocritical MPAA film board, who seem to believe
that exposure to violence is far less harmful to children than
learning about sex (unless it is found in a sniggering, adolescent
comedy). Until the MPAA gets rid of its puritan review board, we will
continue to see a lot more violent thrillers than adult depictions of
sexuality.</LD>

<LD>As a contributing artist to "Edges and Hedges," the group of
temporary public art installations along Santa Monica Boulevard in
West Hollywood, I found David Pagel's review of the project so crabby
that it was impossible to take his comments too seriously ("Taking
Blandness to the (Speed) Limit," May 11). But the nakedness of his
condescension toward the public and the concept of public art is
revealing.</LD>
<LD>   Pagel seems truly offended that on any given day more people will
see and, yes, have an experience with, the installations on Santa
Monica Boulevard than will see the art in a museum show throughout
its entire run.</LD>
<LD>   But that is exactly the point of "Edges and Hedges." Public art is
treated like the illegitimate child of the art world; as such, it has
little to lose and most everything to gain by bringing art critique,
with all its messy elitist overtones, to the streets.</LD>
<TE>   As an artist it is empowering because the work truly has a life of
its own. The interactions I have had with, or observed in passersby
seeing my work in raw, public space, have been the most rewarding
external experiences of my career as an artist. Pagel can't do a
thing about that. What he says might affect who buys the art, but
it's not there to be sold. What he says might keep a few of his
followers away from Santa Monica Boulevard, but thousands of people
will still see the work every day. He may deter people without much
vision or trust in their own responses, but those who are unafraid
have already acted.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL STUTZ</TE>
<TE>   Del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I take particular issue with Pagel's characterization of the work
being "out of touch with the vital street life it pretends to
represent."</TE>
<TE>   I personally spent a month on the boulevard creating the bamboo
site work at Plummer Park. The very material was harvested from
around the corner at the historic Schindler house. The new community
center is a beautiful public facility by Koening &amp; Eisenberg, and
landscaped by Pamela Burton (two of L.A.'s leading architectural
firms). To see it used and appreciated by hundreds of citizens every
day is a moving tribute to West Hollywood's deep human commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Pagel's choice to ignore the context in which this work was
produced does a cold disservice to the many gardeners, merchants,
laborers, police, firefighters and citizens who made these works
possible.</TE>
<TE>   He blatantly longs for gallery walls, and ironically, his review
reflects the very attitude of retail connoisseurship he purports to
despise.</TE>

<LD>It was amusing to read Nicolai Ouroussoff's critique of the new
Petersen Automotive Museum's planned redesign as being bland, after
his excited praise of the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art design
("Petersen Renovation Plan Is No Lamborghini," May 11). The
Petersen's design does not excite Ouroussoff, but why does LACMA's?
This is really a case of bland and blander.</LD>
<LD>   Almost the sole design idea driving the entire LACMA project is
the tented roof. Once we're over the rather slight novelty of this
design, what is left but space under a tent? What do we have from the
outside, except a semi-permanent big tent?</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the biggest fault of the LACMA design will be precisely
the overwhelming blandness of a sea of white tenting, gradually going
gray and dirty over the years.</LD>

<LD>I attended a 7 p.m. Saturday performance of "Spider-Man" at our local
Regal Cinema in Palos Verdes. Although the special effects made the
movie a worthwhile experience, the fact that many parents brought
their small children detracted greatly from the enjoyment I would
have expected.</LD>
<LD>   Several of the children were crying and afraid of the fight
scenes, and one little kid actually yelled out "Stop it!" when
Spider-Man was getting beaten up for the third or forth time.</LD>
<LD>   Having raised four kids myself and being a real movie buff, I have
spent plenty of time in dark movie theaters, but I always respected
the rights of others by adhering to the PG-13 rating.</LD>
<TE>   By exposing their children to this type of violence, parents are
actually giving their approval to it and, I believe, are not acting
responsibly as parents.</TE>

<LD>I sent a copy of Kenneth Turan's review of the latest "Star Wars"
film ("When We Last Saw Our Heroes ... " May 13) to my
thirtysomething daughter in Colorado. Her response makes all such
reviews seem moot:</LD>
<LD>   "There are mixed reviews everywhere.... Non-fans will never
understand. 'Star Wars' movies don't have to be Oscar-winners. They
just have to take us to the place we all know and love--a galaxy far,
far away we will never visit, but wish we had. Just entering the
movie theater takes me there."</LD>

<HD>Networks' Fall Series Lineup Clings to the Tried and True</HD>
<DH>Television* Plenty of cop and medical dramas, and revivals
of a few favorite shows from the '60s dominate the upcoming
programming schedule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first crop of prime-time programs harvested in the wake of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks indicates that television is pretty well
back to business as usual, with only vague echoes of those events in
the fall schedules assembled by the six broadcast networks.</LD>
<LD>   A quick survey of new series being added to the weekly prime-time
menu previewed this week for advertisers in New York finds there will
be plenty of cop shows, crime-fighters and crusading doctors; a
certain nostalgic flavor, including three revivals of 1960s series
and a pair of coming-of-age projects set in that decade, as well as
remarkably similar projects with a "Back to the Future"-type premise;
and a decline in alternative fare, which proliferated last year as
networks scrambled to mimic "Survivor" and "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire."</LD>
<LD>   That said, the year's most identifiable trend has more to do with
commerce than content. Of the 35 new programs scheduled by NBC, CBS,
ABC, Fox, the WB and UPN, 27 are being produced by or in conjunction
with an arm of the host network--a stark departure from a mere decade
ago, before the government phased out rules limiting network
ownership of the programs they broadcast.</LD>
<TE>   Executives insist that they put on the best programs available.
Still, many producers, writers and talent representatives say
ruefully that with each network except NBC controlled by a major
studio--and everyone mindful of the profits that can flow from owning
"Friends" or "Everybody Loves Raymond" reruns in perpetuity--business
considerations increasingly trump creative concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be interesting to see whether this is an atypical
year or if this is going to be a trend for the future," said Stephen
McPherson, president of Disney's Touchstone Television, which is
providing sister network ABC six of its seven new fall shows--no
surprise, really, given that Touchstone supplied 26 of its 30
new-series candidates, or pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Yet whatever cultural or financial forces might be at work, the
real impetus behind this year's lineups appears fixed, as always, on
imitating success, to the point of cloning or franchising it.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is running three successful versions of "Law &amp; Order," which
could become a quartet if a reality-based edition featuring actual
district attorneys, "Crime &amp; Punishment," performs well in a tryout
this summer. Small wonder, then, that next season's most eagerly
anticipated new drama will likely be "CSI: Miami," a brand extension
of CBS' most-watched show, "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite talk about the public's hunger for "comfort" programming
post-Sept. 11, this strategy is more pragmatic than sociological. In
essence, it represents the networks' way of combating an ever more
competitive television landscape, where cable channels have exhibited
the ability to introduce series that vie for the attention of viewers
and especially the media, among them HBO's "The Sopranos" and MTV's
"The Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   Revivals of 'Family Affair,' 'Twilight Zone,' 'Dragnet'</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, updates of "Family Affair" and "The Twilight
Zone" scheduled by the WB and UPN, respectively, along with ABC's
planned revival of "Dragnet" in January post-"Monday Night Football,"
speak less to nostalgia than a desire to capitalize on recognizable
formats, hoping viewers will be more inclined to give them at least a
cursory look.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the "CSI" spinoff, that show's popularity has helped spawn
a small regiment of procedural cop shows, including CBS' "Without a
Trace," starring Anthony LaPaglia as head of the FBI missing-persons
unit; and "RHD/LA," focusing on the LAPD's robbery-homicide division.
In addition, four upcoming crime series are set in Los Angeles, with
"RHD/LA" and "Dragnet" joining NBC's "Boomtown" and Fox's "Fastlane."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors remain another prime-time staple, so much so that two new
medical dramas, ABC's "Meds" and CBS' "Presidio Med" (the latter from
"ER" producer John Wells), have been scheduled opposite each other
Wednesday nights. Of course, this isn't an entirely new scenario, as
anyone who remembers the 1994 face-off between "ER" and "Chicago
Hope" will recall.</TE>
<TE>   Several other head-to-head showdowns are destined to be closely
watched, among them Fox's move of "The Bernie Mac Show" versus ABC's
"My Wife and Kids," starring Damon Wayans, placing popular family
comedies featuring African American comics in the same half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment President Gail Berman stressed that there is
"remarkably little duplication between the shows," citing research
showing that more than 80% of the "Bernie Mac" audience doesn't
currently watch "My Wife and Kids." Indeed, with four in five homes
subscribing to cable or owning a satellite dish, programmers can
argue with some justification that confining such analysis to the
major networks belies the 90 channels at the average viewer's
disposal.</TE>
<TE>   The fall also offers another example of what might be called
convergent evolution, or twin shows born to different networks.
Specifically, both ABC's "That Was Then" and the WB's "Do Over" focus
on an adult man who travels back to his high school years, knowing
now what he didn't then.</TE>
<TE>   Two New Series Set in the Cold War Era</TE>
<TE>   These concepts tie in with what might be the one programming drift
most attributable to Sept. 11, which is an interest in the past.
Although the aforementioned series revivals are all being
contemporized, NBC's "American Dreams" follows teenagers through the
1960s using "American Bandstand" as a backdrop (Dick Clark is among
the producers), while Fox's "Oliver Beene" is set in 1962, its
11-year-old protagonist growing up amid an eccentric family during
the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the quiz show--virtually absent from prime time
since the 1950s, until "Millionaire" burst on the scene--has been
sidelined, though both "Millionaire" and NBC's "Weakest Link" will
live on in syndication, with an early-evening version of
"Millionaire" premiering in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   Top-rated NBC approaches the coming TV season touting its
stability, but the network faces the daunting prospect of "Friends"
hanging up its gloves next spring with no clear replacement in its
bullpen. ABC and Fox, by contrast, will make more expansive changes
after a year in which each network struggled, as the former recovers
from its overreliance on "Millionaire" while the latter seeks to
replace "The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Nesvig, Fox's president of sales, sought to put the best face
on things this week, telling media buyers that quality programs such
as "Bernie Mac" and the serialized drama "24" create "a better
environment for your commercials."</TE>
<TE>   And that, in the final analysis, remains what TV is all about.</TE>

<LD>   Rather Worries About Patriotic Self-Censorship</LD>
<LD>   Veteran CBS News anchor Dan Rather says the post-Sept. 11 climate
of patriotism has resulted in "self-censorship" among the news media
when covering the war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Apologizing for the "obscene" analogy, Rather compared the
situation to that in South Africa when dissenters had flaming tires
put around their necks.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, the fear is that you will be necklaced here, you
will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck
... if you bore in on the tough questions so often," he said in an
interview with the BBC's "Newsnight." "And I am humbled to say I do
not exempt myself from this criticism. I worry that patriotism run
amok will trample the very values that the country seeks to defend."</TE>
<TE>   Rather also complained about hurdles placed in the way of war
correspondents "to cover the backsides of those who are in charge,"
and the acceptance of such policies by the public. "There has never
been an American war, small or large, in which [journalistic] access
has been so limited as this one," he said. "The belief runs so strong
in both the political and military leadership ... that those who
control the images will control public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Delivers for 'Friends' and NBC</TE>
<TE>   "Friends," featuring the birth of Rachel's baby, delivered its
second-biggest audience ever Thursday and the largest ever for an
episode of the show broadcast on Thursday night. The numbers were
exceeded only by an airing of "Friends" on Super Bowl Sunday in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated 34.9 million viewers who watched the program helped
to lift the season finale of "Will &amp; Grace" (23.7 million) to its
second-highest rating--although that wasn't enough to beat CBS' "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation."</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" finished the year as TV's most-watched program, while
"CSI" emerged as the most-watched drama--a title "ER" had held each
year since it premiered in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor" proved no match for "Friends," averaging just more than
19 million viewers. CBS will repeat Thursday's "Survivor" tonight in
advance of the program's finale Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   Southwest Museum OKs Pechanga Pact</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Southwest Museum Friday embraced a pact that would
send part of their collection on loan to the Pechanga Indians of
Temecula in exchange for annual payments to stabilize the Southwest
Museum's long-shaky finances.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest's end of the proposed deal, which has drawn fire
from some supporters wary of letting thousands of artifacts leave the
institution, fell into place with a 15-1 vote by the museum's
trustees, with one abstention. Museum officials said the other eight
board members didn't attend.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-page pact now depends upon a Sunday vote among the Pechanga
reservation's roughly 800 enrolled adult members. Museum officials
declined to disclose details of the deal until then. But sources
close to the agreement say the contract covers more than 10 years and
allows the Pechangas to house borrowed items in a new museum, larger
than the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum holds more than 350,000 artifacts in its
Mount Washington complex but has room to display fewer than 2% of
them.</TE>

<TE>   Once-Shunned Berlin Honors Dietrich</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after Marlene Dietrich's death, her native Berlin named
her an honorary citizen of the city she shunned for most of her life
after turning her back on Nazi Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The rare honor, awarded at City Hall on Thursday, was a late
reconciliation with the husky-voiced diva who went to Hollywood and
was viewed as a traitor by Germans for her support of the U.S. war
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Dietrich's grandson Peter Riva, accepted the honor in her name,
saying, "Marlene was angry with Berlin as only a true love can be."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Donen ("Singin' in the Rain") will make a rare foray into
legitimate theater, directing the world premiere of Elaine May's
"Adult Entertainment," a comedy about the porn industry opening
off-Broadway in the fall.... Blair Underwood and Alfre Woodard will
star in a one-night performance of "Love Letters" at the St. Regis
Monarch Beach Resort &amp; Spa in Dana Point on May 26. Proceeds go to
the Amy Biehl Foundation and Artists for a New South Africa....ABC
News Chairman Roone Arledge will be given a lifetime achievement
award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences at the
annual News and Documentary Awards on Sept. 10.</TE>

<HD>A Midweek Record for 'Clones': $30.1 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will the clones catch Spidey? That remains to be seen, but the latest
"Star Wars" installment, "Episode II Attack of the Clones," debuted
Thursday in 3,161 theaters on approximately 6,000 screens for a
record midweek total of $30.1 million, according to Bruce Snyder,
head of distribution for 20th Century Fox, averaging about $9,500 a
theater. That figure includes sold-out Wednesday midnight screenings,
which Snyder estimated contributed as much as $6 million to the
total.</LD>
<LD>   As Yoda would say, "Strong business for a Thursday, that is," even
better than the previous record $28.5-million Wednesday start for
"Episode I The Phantom Menace," exactly three years ago, although
"Phantom" was in about 200 fewer theaters and on about 500 fewer
screens.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an absolutely fantastic opening, especially for a Thursday,
which is the bottom of the rung for the box-office week," said Dan
Marks, box-office analyst for Nielsen EDI. "A $30-million debut,"
added Paul Dergarabedian of the industry tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations, "means that between 5 [million] and 6 million people went
to see a movie on a Thursday at a time when kids are still in
school."</LD>
<TE>   Ticket prices nationwide average about $5.50.</TE>
<TE>   "Clones" hit with the same impact as "Phantom," which opened in
1999 with a lavish marketing campaign after a 16-year lull in the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The selling of "Clones" has been much more measured, and
director-producer George Lucas has sought to distance his film from
comparisons with "Spider-Man," which shattered all records with its
$114.8-million debut two weeks ago. Even though die-hard followers
had been disappointed in George Lucas' first part of the prequel, the
opening-day numbers indicated the core fan base was more than willing
to give Lucas' pop-culture phenomenon the benefit of the doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the weekend, advance sales indicate a high level of
admissions for "Clones," which already has sold more than 400,000
preordered tickets just on the Internet, more than "Spider-Man,"
before its release.</TE>
<TE>   If "Clones" does as well as expected or better, it would be among
the better openings of all time. "Spider-Man" currently holds the
record, followed by the $90.3-million "Harry Potter" opening last
November. Both of those films, however, were on many more
screens--about 7,500 for "Spider-Man" and 8,000 for "Potter."</TE>
<TE>   Lucasfilm, which produced "Attack of the Clones," is opening the
film in 74 countries over the weekend as well, including most of
Europe.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Cast Hustles to Find Pep in Tepid Musical '70,
Girls, 70'</HD>
<DH>Based on a 1958 British play, this Shadow Box production at
the El Portal Theatre struggles with songs and acknowledged problems
in the script.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's say your Aunt Sadie is in town and wants to see some
celebrities before she leaves. You could offer her Carmen Electra at
the Roxy, but Sadie is 80 and has never heard of Electra.</LD>
<LD>   How about Charlotte Rae, Marni Nixon, Robert Mandan, Jane Kean and
William Schallert at El Portal?</LD>
<LD>   That's about the only reason to catch "70, Girls, 70." True, this
musical has a score by the "Cabaret" team of Fred Ebb and John
Kander. But there are plenty of legitimate reasons why it's rarely
seen. Kander and Ebb fans might be happier simply listening to the
recording of the original 1971 cast.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, Sadie might be a little insulted by the whole idea of
"70, Girls, 70." It boils down to this: Old people sure are cute,
especially when they commit crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a 1958 British play, the main story depicts a group of
New York actors in "the tea time of their careers"--a line that seems
to be repeated about 10 times. Facing eviction from their old actors'
home, they decide to steal furs to finance their own purchase of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   The version of the script at El Portal, by David Thompson and
Norman L. Martin, is one that was rewritten in 1990 for a London
production and appears to have been touched up since then with more
recent slang. Better to have started from scratch. In a program note,
director Jim Brochu acknowledges script problems but explains that he
had a personal connection to the 1971 original. So he may not have
had the heart to discard the original book, even if he could have
obtained the rights.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the fur-stealing scenario is a play within the play. The
outer play is about a bunch of old actors--who put on a play about a
bunch of old actors stealing furs. The action, such as it is, breaks
every few minutes for a vaudeville-style number from this outer play,
complete with title cards at the side of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   But this is no "Follies" (which opened just before the original
"70, Girls, 70" and no doubt stole much of its thunder, since it
covers a similar subject, about a thousand times better). A few of
the songs might serve well in a different dramatic context, but some
of them are simply lame. "Boom, Ditty, Boom," for example, is a silly
novelty number that opens the second act with a whimper, not a boom.</TE>
<TE>   For this concert-style staging, the cast retires often to chairs
and consults visible scripts, rising to their feet primarily for the
musical numbers. So some of the physical comedy that apparently was
in the original--the fur-stealing shenanigans--seems half-baked.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rae, as the ringleader, is quite a sight as she scoots
around the stage, decked out in bright red, like a human fireplug.
The rest of the cast members move nimbly enough and still have the
requisite pipes for this kind of material. Barbara Haber and Irene
Chapman--who have been seen in their own "Two Grandmas From Brooklyn"
act--bring plenty of pep to the show's most recognizable number,
"Coffee in a Cardboard Cup."</TE>
<TE>   The company behind this production, Shadow Box, took over an
already announced season from the El Portal Center for the Arts after
the center became insolvent. Shadow Box producer Stan Haberman, who
was a board member with the defunct center, is making a commendable
effort to salvage the good faith of the subscribers. But any
long-range planners for this facility are going to have to find more
exciting material.</TE>

<HD>The Cinematographer as Artist: A Way of Painting With Light</HD>
<DH>Movies* Conrad L. Hall, known for such films as 'Butch
Cassidy,' says he's had 'a love affair with the visual language.'
UCLA takes a look at his work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One way of looking at Conrad L. Hall is as an Oscar-winning
cinematographer, but another is as a master artist who uses light and
composition as his paintbrush and celluloid as his canvas. The man
responsible for the distinctive look of films ranging from the
crisply chilly black-and-white "In Cold Blood" to the surreal
suburbia of "American Beauty" has been described as a magical
realist.</LD>
<LD>   "He tries to suggest a meaning, a psychology, an atmosphere that
may not be expressed by the characters in the film but are expressed
visually," explains Chen-Sim Lim, programmer at the UCLA Film &amp;
Television Archive. "He tells us with his lighting and his
composition what the characters may not be saying themselves."</LD>
<LD>   Hall's career of more than 50 years is being feted by the UCLA
archive with a two-week retrospective, "Conrad Hall: Art of Light."
The festival opens tonight at the James Bridges Theater in the
university's Melnitz Hall with a screening of the newly restored 1972
John Huston film "Fat City." Hall supplied the hard-edged visuals for
this gritty drama about a boxer on the skids. He will participate in
a question-and-answer session after the screening.</LD>
<TE>   Other highlights of the festival include "In Cold Blood" (1967)
and "The Professionals" (1966), also newly restored; "Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid" (1969), for which Hall received his first
Oscar; "The Day of the Locust" (1975); and "Wild Seed" (1965), one of
his first feature films.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, who has received nine Oscar nominations, has also been named
Kodak cinematographer in residence at the UCLA School of Theater,
Film and Television and will conduct workshops during the spring
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The son of James Norman Hall, co-writer of the novels "Mutiny on
the Bounty" and "The Hurricane," Hall, 75, was born and raised in
Tahiti, where he now owns an island. He had decided to follow in his
father's footsteps and initially had set his sights on journalism at
USC. "I tried for a while to see whether there were any writing genes
rattling around, and I signed up for journalism my junior year," Hall
recalled in a recent interview. "I got a D-plus in creative writing.
I decided to look for something else to do."</TE>
<TE>   In search of a new major, he perused the course catalog. "It
started with A for astronomy, B for biology and C for cinema. I
thought, 'Cinema? You mean like movies? Rubbing elbows with the
stars? Making all that money?' For all the wrong reasons, I signed
up, and then had a love affair with the visual language and learned
to tell stories like my dad."</TE>
<TE>   When he switched to cinema in 1947, Hall realized he was getting
in on the ground floor of a still-young art form. "The turn of the
century is when it began, and in 1947 it was only 47 years into it,"
he said. "Now it is 102 years into it, and I've been with it for 52
years. I thought about being on the ground floor of something--that
was one of the main reasons I got into it, to have the chance, the
opportunity to be in something new."</TE>
<TE>   Just as it was kismet that he turned to cinema, it was another
serendipitous move that he became a cinematographer. After he
graduated from USC, he and two friends, Marvin Weinstein and Jack
Couffer, formed a production company and bought a short story to make
as a feature. "We all wanted to direct it," said Hall. Knowing that
was impossible, they put three strips of paper labeled producer,
director and cinematographer into a hat. Hall drew cinematographer.</TE>
<TE>   He's still trying to direct a film--a comedy he wrote about a
gigolo going through a midlife crisis--so he can have control over
the story.</TE>
<TE>   A Collaborator With Valuable Input</TE>
<TE>   Steve Zaillian, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of "Schindler's
List," also directed two films, on which he worked with Hall:
"Searching for Bobby Fischer" (1993) and "A Civil Action" (1998).
Hall received Oscar nominations for both.</TE>
<TE>   Zaillian said Hall is much more of a collaborator than most
cinematographers. "He is one of the most important storytellers in
terms of being like a writer or a director," he said. "He taught me a
lot, really, about how to direct."</TE>
<TE>   Hall broke into TV in the early '60s as a cinematographer on the
rodeo series "Stoney Burke" and the sci-fi anthology series "The
Outer Limits."</TE>
<TE>   Hall considers Richard Brooks, the director of "The Professionals"
and "In Cold Blood," his surrogate father.</TE>
<TE>   It was Brooks' decision to shoot "In Cold Blood," based on Truman
Capote's nonfiction book about the brutal murder of a Kansas family
by two small-time hoods, in black and white. "I couldn't imagine
doing it in color because it is a bleak story and it seems to me that
the colorness of it would somehow impinge on the power of the events
that took place," Hall said. "It was absolutely the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   His work on the jaunty, nostalgic western "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid" was 180 degrees removed from the starkness of "In Cold
Blood." His use of sepia and golden hues gave the Paul Newman-Robert
Redford classic a burnished glow.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did in the film was to sort of create a less rigid style
of shooting westerns than had occurred before," Hall said. His use of
zoom and long lenses in the sequences in which the posse were was
chasing Butch and Sundance were intended as a metaphor of changing
times.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the late '70s, Hall took a decade-long sabbatical to
write screenplays. "These were stories I wanted to tell," he said. "I
didn't want to become a director, but I wanted to have the
opportunity to direct a film."</TE>
<TE>   He returned to his craft in 1987 with the Bob Rafelson thriller
"Black Widow."</TE>
<TE>   "He hadn't done a movie in five years," Hall said. "I hadn't done
one in 10 years. We met in the grocery store.... He said, 'I've got
this film I want to do called "Black Widow." Would you like to shoot
it?' I decided to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Hall's latest film is "Road to Perdition," which reunites him with
"American Beauty" director Sam Mendes. The film, starring Tom Hanks
and Paul Newman, opens in July. He hasn't worked since he finished
filming the Depression-era drama last summer, noting that long hours
of filming take their toll.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, a painter doesn't have the hardships that a
cinematographer has. These incredible hours impinge on your
creativity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall is especially honored that UCLA is giving him his
retrospective, because his cinematographer son, Conrad W. Hall,
graduated from UCLA in 1980. "He just finished shooting 'Panic
Room,'" said the elder Hall. "I am such a proud father."</TE>

<HD>A New Description of Salonen: Angeleno</HD>
<DH>The colorful, energetic American premiere of 'Foreign
Bodies' shows the effect of the conductor and composer's 10 years in
Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esa-Pekka Salonen's new piece for massive orchestra, "Foreign
Bodies," is terrific. It bursts forth with energy, color and
intelligence, with the exuberance of a composer who can barely
contain himself. It was commissioned by Finnish Radio, written for
the Finnish Radio Symphony and the Finnish conductor, Jukka-Pekka
Sarasate, who premiered it in Germany last summer. It is the music of
a composer from Finland who is no longer, strictly speaking, a
Finnish composer. For its American premiere Thursday night at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Salonen conducted it as the opening of the
last program of the Los Angeles Philharmonic season. The music came
home.</LD>
<LD>   "Foreign Bodies," Salonen explained to the audience before
conducting it, comes from his fascination with the way a foreign
element can enter into a system and cause change. That is true of
machines and of living organisms. For Salonen, 10 years in Los
Angeles have infected the complex mechanisms of his music. In
"Foreign Bodies," he throws monkey wrenches into the works and
delights at the controlled chaos and surprising new elements that
result.</LD>
<TE>   There are three connected movements--"Body
Language--Language--Dance." The first is an orchestral reworking of
the "Mecanisme" movement of Salonen's recent piano piece
"Dichotomie," in which the pianistic flourishes burst out into
intense, brilliant instrumental colors. "Language"--derived from a
recent Swedish choral work "Djupt i rummet" (Deep in space/room)--is
short and slow and weird. Its gorgeous outer parts have an
otherworldly glow, as strangely tuned cellos and basses play ghostly
harmonies. The center is almost like a folk tune that very quickly
goes awry in furious scales.</TE>
<TE>   "Dance" is where all hell breaks loose. One of Salonen's metaphors
for "Foreign Bodies" is that of a computer virus and how it
insinuates itself into a machine. The virus here takes the shape of
John Adams-like chords in the horns that rhythmically throw off the
rest of the orchestra. There is resistance at first--as Salonen
resisted the influence of Minimalism when he first arrived in Los
Angeles--but finally the whole orchestra seems to shake to life in a
joyous bacchanalian explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Brilliantly played though "Foreign Bodies" was Thursday, not every
effect worked. For the addition of an organ to take the final climax
over the top, a grand instrument is required, not the puny electronic
imitation wheeled onto the pavilion stage. Some of the percussion
instruments also failed to register in this hall. A true Los Angeles
piece, "Foreign Bodies" awaits a less "foreign" acoustic, such as
what is expected from Walt Disney Concert Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen put his new work in another kind of seemingly foreign
environment, following it with two Russian works--Prokofiev's Second
Piano Concerto and Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. But, in fact,
"Foreign Bodies" seemed its own kind of virus infecting all that
followed it with a fabulous vitality. The soloist in Prokofiev's
seldom-heard concerto was Yefim Bronfman, who happened to have been
the pianist who gave the first European performances of "Dichotomie"
(it was written for Gloria Cheng, who premiered it here last season).</TE>
<TE>   As if possessed by demonic energy , Bronfman followed the "Foreign
Bodies" blowout with one of his own. There were lyrical moments of
beauty to be sure, but what will stick in memory is the sheer
enormousness of his playing of the first movement cadenza, one of the
most extravagant in all the literature, in which the bulky Russian
pianist seemed to possess as much sonic strength as the whole
orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   It was a long program, and some in the audience left, evidently
feeling that they had already had an evening's worth of excitement,
and that a Tchaikovsky warhorse symphony would be a letdown. They
were wrong. This was Tchaikovsky's Fourth as I have never heard
before. Anyone looking for Russian heart-on-sleeve sentiment might
have cause for concern. But to hear the symphony played with the same
attention to rhythmic detail, dynamics and instrumental color that
Salonen brings to Stravinsky, Ligeti and his own music was to
experience it as something new.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic's playing was extraordinary, as if, with the
experience of the Salonen sound in their ears, they, too, were
hearing it for the first time. There is much about Salonen that has
changed in his decade in Los Angeles. But the last thing that anyone
would have predicted is that this Finnish ultra-Modernist would
become not just one of America's most accessible and interesting
composers but also, of all things, a great Tchaikovsky interpreter.
Make every effort you possibly can to hear this concert.</TE>

<LD>Murder, lust, insanity, kidnapping, dead chickens--"All Around the
Town" has everything you'd expect in a murder mystery and more.</LD>
<LD>   So much more, in fact, that the movie, based on author Mary
Higgins Clark's bestseller, stumbles a bit in its white-knuckled
eagerness to hit the ground running. Stick with the story, though,
because the spooky twists and turns in the final half-hour are worth
the trip.</LD>
<LD>   The movie (airing at 9 tonight on PAX, with an encore at 9 p.m.
Sunday) gives Natassja Kinski top billing as the suspicious wife of a
hunky college professor (Kevin Jubinville), but it's really one of
the prof's lissome students who's at the center of things.</LD>
<TE>   Newcomer Kim Schraner plays Laurie Kinmount, surely the most
snake-bitten poor soul since Job. In a brief flashback to open the
movie, Laurie is kidnapped as a toddler but is returned to her
parents a couple of years later, suffering from horrendous
nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   Jumping to the present, Laurie appears to be a well-adjusted
21-year-old college student--until her parents are killed in an auto
accident. That seems to awaken the demons of her past, causing Laurie
to sprout multiple personalities. And some of those personalities
aren't too nice.</TE>
<TE>   Her sister (Andrea Roth) asks a psychiatrist pal (Michael Shanks)
to help, but it's a struggle, possibly because he talks way too fast
in the first third of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The college professor, meanwhile, begins getting some raunchy love
letters at home, and he confronts Laurie with his suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   Bad move.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie is soon in enough trouble for 10 personalities, which is
just about right. But in "All Around the Town," all is not as it
appears.</TE>

<HD>Keeping an Eye Out for Real People</HD>
<DH>Mike Leigh's goal is to create lifelike characters; Michael
Moore wants his documentaries to entertain, not anesthetize.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CANNES, France--This is a tale of one city but two Michaels, or, to
be more precise, a Michael and a Mike.</LD>
<LD>   Both are filmmakers in competition at the Festival de Cannes,
writer-directors who focus on the kinds of not necessarily glamorous
people not ordinarily found on English-speaking screens. And both are
intent as well on pushing the limits of the kinds of films they make.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Moore, whose 1989 film "Roger and Me" remains one of the
highest-grossing documentaries, is a nonfiction filmmaker who insists
on making quite serious subjects seductive for an
entertainment-seeking audience that "wants to eat popcorn, have fun
and then go home and have sex afterward."</LD>
<TE>   His new film, "Bowling for Columbine," an exploration of violence
and the culture of guns in America, is the first doc to be in the
Cannes competition in 46 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When [artistic director] Thierry Fremaux told me that, I was
like, 'Your own rules on your Web site say, "No docs."' He said, 'We
are breaking tradition.' I said, 'You're French, you can't break
tradition.' He said, 'We want to make a statement.' I said, 'What's
that, don't bring guns to Cannes?' He said, 'These days very few
American films are about something, and we wanted to be supportive of
a film of substance.'"</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Mike Leigh, very much a director of substance, has been
in competition here before, and he's done exceptionally well in it.
His "Naked" took the best actor award for David Thewlis in 1993, and
his "Secrets &amp; Lies" not only won best actress for Brenda Blethyn in
1996, it captured the Palme d'Or as well.</TE>
<TE>   His new film, the deeply emotional, uncompromisingly honest "All
or Nothing," stars Leigh veterans Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville
as a common-law husband and wife who have to handle a crisis in their
lives as well as deal with their own deteriorating relationship. Like
all of Leigh's films, dating back to 1971's "Bleak Moments," "All or
Nothing" is characterized by protagonists so insistently lifelike you
can talk about them as if they were actual individuals you know.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I was growing up, I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great to
see a film in which people are like people?' That continues to be the
motivating factor," the director says over breakfast at the Carlton
Hotel on the Croisette, the town's central thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   To get that level of reality, Leigh has over the years developed
what he calls "this organic way of collaborating with people" in
which he works intensely with the actors for months creating their
characters before forming a finished script. It's a method that's
often confused with improvisation ("I've come to the conclusion that
substantial numbers of people are never going to understand it
because they're not paying attention," he says) but one that is so
intrinsic to Leigh himself that he says, "I don't regard it as a
technique that can be taught, I don't believe in reducing it. The
thing that makes it happen comes from something personal and
intuitive. It's not like hanging wallpaper."</TE>
<TE>   Leigh's intensely collaborative way of working, especially in the
writing stage, also has the advantage of keeping him from the kind of
creative blockage that sometimes afflicts people who've won major
awards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if as a writer I manufactured my stuff by sitting down at
a typewriter, I'd suffer from the same disease," he explains. "But in
order to get one of my things to happen, I have to go through long
processes, all of which involve getting out of bed early in the a.m.
and making it happen for other people.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to work without the option to procrastinate, without being
able to say, 'Maybe today I'll take the morning off and then I'll
feel more creative.' That liberates you from gazing into your navel
and wondering if what you're doing is worthy of being a Palme d'Or
winner."</TE>
<TE>   The process Leigh goes through with his actors sometimes begins
with what he calls "the nugget of an idea. With 'Secrets &amp; Lies,' I
wanted to make a film about adoption. But with others, and 'All or
Nothing' is paramount among those, you can't report on ideas. It's
more a collection of feelings that are quite hard to describe."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, he says, "the core of it is about love and
connecting, about the way feelings become encrusted with time and
pressures. I have been through a marriage breakup and been divorced,
I've been through a lot of pain, and somewhere in that film, though
in no literal way, are expressions about those sorts of things."</TE>
<TE>   While Leigh's films invariably bring out the best in actors, he
emphasizes that being in one "is a huge act of trust" for them.
"People agreeing to take the part don't know what the film is about,
what they're going to play, how big the part is. They have to have a
certain frame of mind, a philosophy, a sense of camaraderie." The
results speak for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Also speaking for itself, though in a more haphazard way given its
director's self-described "reckless abandon way of doing it," is
Moore's "Columbine."</TE>
<TE>   The film includes everything from interviews with rocker Marilyn
Manson and "South Park's" Matt Stone to security tapes of the
Columbine High School shootings and a visit to a Michigan bank where
Moore, who turns out to be a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Assn., gets a free rifle for opening an account. It doesn't catch
fire, however, until Moore, midway through filming, hears about the
school shooting in his home town of Flint, Mich., of a 6-year-old
girl by a 6-year-old classmate.</TE>
<TE>   "There was going to be no Flint in this movie, after 'Roger and
Me' and 'The Big One.' It was enough in Michigan already, we weren't
going back to that well," says Moore in an interview at the American
Pavilion, an outdoor tent that's a gathering place at the festival.
"And then this happens."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was the shooting in Moore's hometown, it was at the very
school where he, his wife and Nike founder Phil Knight had
contributed $20,000 for a computer lab. The Flint incident galvanized
Moore in a way that galvanizes his film and led, albeit indirectly,
to its climax, an interview with NRA spokesman Charlton Heston that
came off, typically for Moore, almost by happenstance.</TE>
<TE>   The director, who says he's not sure why anyone still talks to him
("If Mike Wallace came to my house, I'd be running out the back door,
wouldn't you?"), says he'd tried to schedule an interview with Heston
for two years through regular channels and all he got was "no, no,
no, no, no." In Los Angeles on other interviews, Moore and his crew
were in a van headed down Sunset Boulevard when someone spotted a
vendor of maps of the stars' homes. A crew member said, "'Let's get a
star map and find Heston.' I said we had a plane to catch, I said the
maps were phony and outdated, but the younger people started
tormenting me, saying, 'You're chicken.'"</TE>
<TE>   Press the Buzzer and  Get the Interview</TE>
<TE>   And so, "just to humor the crew," Moore gets a map, drives to
Heston's address and (now on camera) presses the buzzer at the gate.
And, to his complete surprise, "out of the box comes the voice of
Moses," with Heston agreeing to the interview that concludes
"Columbine."</TE>
<TE>   Though it is tempting to see Moore as a political activist working
through films, the director categorically rejects that label. "First
of all, if you're a citizen in a democracy, it's redundant to say
you're a political activist. Democracy is not a spectator sport, and
being a citizen should imply that I'm active and caring."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Moore sees himself primarily as a filmmaker and a
filmgoer. "I'm a fan, I've gone to three movies a week since I was a
teenager. Because there was no place in Flint to see good films, I
ran my own art house for six years, did the projection and sold
popcorn. We were the first place to show Truffaut, Fellini, even
'Annie Hall.'" Because he's a fan, Moore is grumpy about the bad rap
most documentaries have.</TE>
<TE>   "Documentary filmmakers have become like castor oil salesmen; 'you
should watch this doc because it's good for you,'" he grouses.
"They've soured the form. I love going to the movies, and I want to
make movies I want to see."</TE>
<TE>   Yet because "in my personal life I'm a very shy person," because
even as he confronted Heston part of him felt "this is an old man,
it's early in the morning, he doesn't need this kind of hassle,"
Moore finds doing his kind of insistent interviewing increasingly
difficult. He perseveres for a specific reason: "I'm tired of waiting
around for someone else to do something.</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised in an Irish Catholic household, and I believe in
some of the lessons I was taught by my parents and the good sisters,"
the director explains, "including that we will be judged by how we
treat the least among us. If I sit back and do nothing, I'd be
complicit in injustice."</TE>
<TE>   Moore's next project is something he feels equally strongly about,
something once again "my conscience doesn't allow me to sit by about
for too long." He says it will focus on how George W. Bush "took the
good will from the American people after Sept. 11 and tried to get a
whole right-wing agenda through. There isn't a month that goes by
when John Ashcroft and Bush don't shred a piece of the Constitution
and our civil liberties."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses, both for breath and effect: "I'm calling it 'Fahrenheit
911: The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns.'"</TE>

<LD>State Farm, the nation's largest insurance company, was stripped of
is triple-A rating for credit and financial strength by Standard &amp;
Poor's because of record losses last year--an action that may
increase pressure on the company to further raise auto and homeowner
premiums to boost its sagging finances.</LD>
<LD>   State Farm already has filed to hike rates in California by about
5% on auto insurance and 6.7% on homeowner coverage, a company
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The insurer posted a net loss last year of $5 billion on rising
claims and lower investment returns.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P lowered its rating for Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm by
one notch to double-A plus, pointing to a $9.3-billion loss from its
core property- casualty businesses in 2001.</TE>

<LD>Avery Dennison Corp., which makes Hi-Liter markers and sticky labels,
plans to cut about 800 to 1,000 jobs over two years after the
purchase of Jackstadt of Germany for about $295million in cash and
debt.</LD>
<LD>   The reductions, about 5% of the companies' combined work force of
19,000, will be at both Avery Dennison and Jackstadt. The acquisition
of Jackstadt, the world's largest closely held maker of self-adhesive
materials, was completed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Avery Dennison expects restructuring costs of about $30million to
$40 million this year. Expenses related to the job cuts are expected
to be about $60million to $70 million over two years.</LD>
<TE>   The acquisition will reduce profit about 5 cents to 8 cents a
share over 12 months, excluding the costs, Pasadena-based Avery
Dennison said.</TE>

<LD>Duke Energy Corp. said it included about $1 billion of energy trades
in its financial statements over three years that had no economic
benefit and were similar to those of rivals Dynegy Inc. and Reliant
Resources Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Duke, the second-largest U.S. utility owner and a top energy
trader, said the "round-trip" trades constituted less than 1% of its
$107.4 billion in energy trading and marketing revenue from 1999 to
2001.</LD>

<TE>   Also Friday, Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson told shareholders
at the company's annual meeting that he was "very disappointed" with
bogus trades it did with CMS Energy Corp. Revelation of the trades
have rocked the industry the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp. agreed this week to terminate the $2.98-billion sale
of Oregon utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas
Co., after Enron's stock became essentially worthless after its Dec.

<DL></DL>
<LD>The judge overseeing the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case said she had
concerns about a request by nine states that she name a court officer
to resolve future disputes over the software maker's business
practices.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would let business rivals go to a so-called special
master to complain that Microsoft is not abiding by court- ordered
restrictions. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar- Kotelly said
complaints should first go to the government antitrust enforcers that
brought the lawsuit she is reviewing.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Microsoft warned that its Internet Explorer software
contains six flaws, some of which could give hackers access to--and
even potentially change--personal information about computer users.</LD>
<TE>   The company advised users of Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0
to download a patch for the software from the Microsoft Web site at
www.microsoft.com /security.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BrokerTec Global, an electronic bond brokerage owned by 14 Wall
Street banks, said Friday that the Justice Department is
investigating whether the company violated antitrust rules.</LD>
<LD>   BrokerTec confirmed it received a civil investigative demand from
the Justice Department and said it has responded to the request and
will continue to cooperate completely.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators may be looking at how BrokerTec gives dealers
incentives to trade with the company, "including reduced commissions
for higher levels of trading," said Andy Nybo, a senior analyst at
TowerGroup.</LD>
<TE>   A civil investigative demand is similar to a subpoena. The Justice
Department began investigating online trading systems in 2000 to
determine whether the biggest banks were shutting out competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the Justice Department said it is looking at
electronic currency trader FXall, owned by 17 Wall Street banks. The
probe centers on whether the largest banks are gaining a stranglehold
on electronic trading in the $1-trillion-a-day foreign-exchange
market.</TE>
<TE>   Jersey City, N.J.-based BrokerTec became one of the largest U.S.
Treasury middlemen last year, and its owners are major banks that
control most of the $3-trillion Treasury market. It matches buyers
and sellers in dealer-to-dealer trades of government bonds and
related securities.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group to Buy Specialist Firm</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will buy Walter N. Frank &amp; Co., a Wall
Street specialist firm that matches stock buyers with sellers for
transactions on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs (ticker symbol: GS) did not disclose terms of the
deal in its announcement. The transaction is subject to regulatory
approval and other closing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Goldman Sachs Group rose 45 cents to $80.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Under Investigation by 2 Grand Juries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. said Friday that it is being
investigated by two grand juries and also that it missed making
$44.7million in interest and dividend payments.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 6 U.S. cable operator said grand juries in the Southern
District of New York and the Middle District of Pennsylvania are
investigating matters related to the company. It said it is
cooperating fully with the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia, mired in a controversy over
company-guaranteed loans to partnerships controlled by its founders,
the Rigas family, is trying to avoid a delisting from Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   This would allow bondholders to force Adelphia to buy back $1.4
billion of convertible bonds for cash. The company said a hearing
with the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which regulates
Nasdaq, was held on Thursday, and that no decision has been made.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's announcement confirms everyone's worst fears," said
Harold Rivkin, president of H. Rivkin &amp; Co. in Princeton, N.J., a
brokerage that trades Adelphia bonds. "It looks like the whole thing
is unraveling. Their actions and disclosure are indicative of a
company that plans to file for bankruptcy."</TE>

<HD>Duncan Details Destroyed Enron Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Former Arthur Andersen auditor David B. Duncan testified Friday that
the files he shredded last fall as the leader of the Enron Corp.
audit team consisted of "extraneous" material, including outdated
financial records, copies and old research.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan, in his fifth and final day on the witness stand in
Andersen's obstruction of justice trial, said the documents he
destroyed amounted to a 1-foot-tall stack he turned over to his
assistant for disposal last fall. He said he also spent an hour or so
deleting Enron-related e-mail from his computer.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan's testimony under cross-examination marked the first time
he has specified the documents he destroyed after Enron notified
Andersen that it had received a letter of inquiry from the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Federal prosecutors have not indicated which
records they believe the firm destroyed or whether they were sought
by the SEC.</LD>
<TE>   In questioning Duncan, Andersen lawyer Rusty Hardin appeared to be
trying to show that Duncan didn't destroy crucial files.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is fighting an obstruction of justice charge for
shredding documents related to its audit of Enron. Duncan, 43, has
pleaded guilty to a separate obstruction charge and is cooperating
with the government's probe.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin has contended that the accountant agreed to plead guilty
because of government pressure and not because he believed he
committed a crime. But during final questioning by prosecutors
Friday, Duncan denied that he had been coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination, Duncan said he could not recall specific
information he intended to keep from the SEC. But he said he asked
his assistant to dispose of files knowing that "all of the
information in any of the documents I destroyed would not be
available."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin ended his examination of Duncan, considered the
prosecution's key witness, with a daylong effort to convince the jury
that the firm had retained a far greater number of documents than it
had destroyed. After a sometimes bitter exchange with prosecutors
outside the jury's presence, Andersen's legal team also received
permission to show the panel 21 boxes of documents they said Duncan
had preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Under the obstruction statute, the destroyed documents do not have
to be considered crucial in order to convict the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   The accountant, a 20-year Andersen veteran, also recounted the day
last fall when he directed subordinates in the firm's Houston office
to shred documents. Duncan said he called a meeting Oct. 23 of
partners and managers on the Enron audit team and instructed them to
comply with Andersen's document retention policy, which requires
executives to retain work papers needed to back up their accounting
reasoning and to destroy drafts, copies and other documents deemed
unnecessary unless there is a threat of litigation or a subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he had never before called a meeting to instruct
employees about the policy. But he said the discussion of the policy
occupied just a small part of the 30-minute meeting, which he
characterized as a "pep talk" for Andersen auditors who felt
discouraged by the intensifying meltdown of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he told his team that "we believed we had done
everything appropriately" in dealing with Enron's accounting and told
them not to do "anything more or less than comply" with the policy's
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also said he was not thinking about Andersen's past audit
failures when he decided to order the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have contended that the firm's previous run-ins with
the SEC served as a motive to keep Enron records from regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan earlier testified that he had been prompted to destroy
records in part by an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen lawyer Nancy
Temple. But Duncan said he initially didn't act on the e-mail, acting
instead after listening to an analyst conference call in which
criticism of Enron intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, tensions remained from a shouting match that erupted
Thursday between Hardin and U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon.</TE>
<TE>   After Harmon sustained one in a string of objections from
prosecutors, Hardin started to complain. The judge asked him and
prosecutors to convene at the bench to discuss the legal point.
Hardin hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing good ever happens up there," he remarked before joining
in the whispered conversation.</TE>
<TE>   When the lawyers finished their questions, Harmon told Duncan he
could leave the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   "For good?" asked the accountant, who is the subject of dozens of
Enron-related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "For this trial," Harmon replied.</TE>

<HD>Fed Unveils Proposed Change in Its Lending</HD>
<DH>Finance: Switch should smooth out volatility in short-term
borrowing between banks. Consumer rates not expected to be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve on Friday unveiled a major shift in the way it
lends money to the nation's banks, proposing to charge them more for
the privilege but making it easier to get loans.</LD>
<LD>   Private economists predicted the change would have no effect on
consumer or business borrowing rates but should help smooth out
volatility in the massive $60-billion daily market for short-term
lending between banks. Fed officials also said the move did not
involve a change in the central bank's monetary policy.</LD>
<LD>   Banks that currently go to the Fed's so-called discount window are
able to get loans that are about half a percentage point below the
Fed's target for the federal funds rate--the interest commercial
banks charge one another for loans and the rate the central bank
tinkers with in an effort to influence the health of the national
economy.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the Fed would remove that break and instead
charge banks using the discount window at a rate one full percentage
point above the federal funds rate.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed has set the funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%, while
the Fed's discount rate is set at 1.25%. Under this proposal, the
discount rate would be set initially at 2.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the switch may not make much difference on the rates
banks charge on consumer and business loans because discount-window
borrowing amounts to only about $100 million daily, a tiny fraction
of the $55 billion to $60 billion in loans extended among banks in
the federal funds market.</TE>
<TE>   Fed officials said the higher discount rate would bring Fed
operations more in line with how other nations' central banks handle
direct bank lending.</TE>
<TE>   Private economists generally applauded the move as a good way to
streamline lending processes.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the American Bankers Assn. said the group needed
more time to study the proposal before commenting in detail.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the Fed's history, the discount window has helped the
Fed act as a lender of last resort to troubled banks.</TE>
<TE>   But Fed officials emphasized that in normal times such loans make
up only a small part of discount window borrowing, with the vast bulk
of the loans going to banks that face a one-day cash crunch for
unexpected reasons. The Fed currently has no loans to banks that
can't obtain financing through regular channels.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed switch would mark the biggest change in Fed borrowing
operations in about two decades. The Fed proposal could be revised
before the central bank decides whether to implement the proposed
changes after a 90-day comment period.</TE>

<HD>Hungary's New Reality</HD>
<DH>The country is at a crossroads in its journey from
communism to a free-market economy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARVAR, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Istvanne Adam used to spend her days gutting chickens in a frigid
Communist-era poultry processor until she was offered a job in a
modern plant assembling Microsoft Corp.'s state-of-the-art Xbox video
game console.</LD>
<LD>   The ebbs and flows of the global free market were far from her
mind, although her Xbox job was a result of forces far beyond her
hometown. To Adam, it was simply a good job.</LD>
<LD>   This week, though, the 50-year-old mother of three got a blunt
lesson in global economics when Microsoft announced it is
transferring Xbox manufacturing to southern China, where its costs
will be substantially lower.</LD>
<TE>   In the grand scheme of international trade, it is a minor shift.
But for Adam and her neighbors in the town of Sarvar, it is a
reminder that, in capitalism, the perils of change come with the
promise of wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Adam and her two sons, who also work at the plant, were offered
jobs making printers instead of consoles. Some of their colleagues
were not. Unnerved by the Microsoft decision, Adam and her family
expressed nostalgia for the simpler, more predictable era of
communism.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not so much uncertainty then," said Adam's husband,
Istvan.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you can work your eight-hour shift and have a second job
farming. We used to raise pigs and rabbits, buying inexpensive animal
feed from the state cooperative and selling our animals back to the
cooperative. The market was assured. Now, the demand is for much
higher volumes, and it's no longer feasible for us to operate our
small farm. So we just raise pigs for ourselves, and we are just
happy to have jobs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From pigs to consoles to printers, the economic journey of the
Adam family mirrors the larger ups and downs of a country the size of
Indiana as it grapples with its transformation from a communist
command economy to a manufacturing force.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the change more apparent than the Varkerulet traffic
circle in the heart of Sarvar, where trucks packed with live turkeys
share the same road as semis bearing newly assembled cars bound for
Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The trucks are visible reminders that Hungary sits at a
crossroads. Lying just east of Austria, Hungary has shaped itself
into a desirable location for companies wanting to manufacture goods
for Europe. But most of Hungary's 10million inhabitants, whose
average monthly after-tax income is $288, are scarcely able to afford
the products their factories produce.</TE>
<TE>   In short, Hungary is the European equivalent of Mexico with its
abundance of relatively cheap labor, good roads, low tariffs and
proximity to wealthy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Sarvar, however, lacks the crowding, pollution and squalor that
has marked Mexico's border region. Instead, this quiet town seems
suspended in time. Its 16,000 inhabitants bicycle around a leafy,
well-kept town center, shop at Sarvar's only supermarket and quietly
chat at one of the town's two bars.</TE>
<TE>   Step into the factory on the eastern edge of town, and a different
world emerges. Spotless, efficient and modern, the plant employs
4,000 permanent workers and hundreds of contract workers who march in
and out depending on what's being produced.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Flextronics International Ltd., the plant is a shiny
example of cutting-edge manufacturing. Dozens of machine molds apply
hundreds of tons of pressure to stamp out plastic casings. Workers in
white gloves and smocks assemble electronic gear, scanning bar-coded
components so every part can be traced to the employees who worked on
it.</TE>
<TE>   The rhythms of Sarvar are governed by the eight-hour shifts of its
factories. Roads teem with cyclists starting at 2 p.m. as people
leave work and head to the town center anchored by a medieval castle,
parts of which have been turned into a community center.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to Vienna than to Budapest, Sarvar is just 44 miles from
the Austrian border.</TE>
<TE>   This was important to Microsoft, which wanted to rapidly make
1.5million Xboxes within six months for the console's European debut.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft wanted to simplify logistics and produce the right
amount of products and deliver them at the right time. And this was
the best place to do that," said Gyula Knizs, the factory's program
manager for Flextronics.</TE>
<TE>   No longer. Now that Microsoft has plenty of boxes on store shelves
in Europe, it is shutting down production in Sarvar.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the boxes will be made in Doumen, China, where the cost
of buying and shipping parts for the console will be far less. Once
the console was launched, consumer demand became more predictable,
and having production nearby to quickly feed surges in demand becomes
secondary to cutting costs.</TE>
<TE>   For workers such as Adam and her two sons, Tamas, 22, and Peter,
24, that means coping with jobs that come and go.</TE>
<TE>   By Western European standards, the Adams are not wealthy. Each
makes little more than 70,000 Hungarian forints a month, or roughly
$260, at the Flextronics plant. That's not even enough to purchase an
Xbox, which retails for around $269 in Europe. Adam lives with her
husband and Tamas in a two-room house in Kenyeri, a village of 1,000
residents 15 miles west of Sarvar. Peter lives in Sarvar in a
150-square-foot apartment his family bought for him.</TE>
<TE>   But the Adams aren't complaining. Instead, Istvanne Adam talks
about how life is so much better than when she worked in the poultry
plant, where she had to fork over nearly one-sixth of her earnings
for the bus fare to get to work. Now, a Flextronics-sponsored bus
picks her up at exactly 1:02 p.m. and brings her home by 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As unsettling as the changes have been, Hungarians know there's no
going back to communism.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1980s, trade meant selling two dead dogs for one dead
cat," said Vilmos Skuleti, head of the government's ministry of
International Trade and Development, which recently opened an office
in Los Angeles to help attract more U.S. investments.</TE>
<TE>   When the Soviets left, Hungarians rejoiced at their independence.
Once the euphoria wore off, the country realized how much work lay
ahead in stitching together a true economy without benefit of Soviet
subsidies. From 1990 to 1993, much of the country was thrown into
economic chaos. Unemployment and inflation soared.</TE>
<TE>   Within five years, Hungary leveraged its ties with former allies
Germany and Austria to lure capital. Later came other Western
European investments, followed by U.S. and Asian capital. Today,
Hungary is host to factories that that turn out products ranging from
engines for the Audi TT sports car to the Xbox. Unemployment is less
than 6%, inflation declined to 7%. Before 1990, 90% of Hungary's
exports went to Russia. Today, 80% of Hungary's exports are bound for
Western Europe, the United States and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "Among the Central European countries, Hungary has been among the
most successful, along with Poland" in adjusting to a free market,
said Romain Wacziarg, associate professor of economics at Stanford
University's Graduate School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   In Sarvar, unemployment has fallen from more than 10% in 1994 to
less than 3% today, primarily due to the Flextronics plant, which
opened in 1995. Since then, numerous contract jobs have floated
through the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fluctuations, annual local tax receipts from
Flextronics and other, smaller industrial companies in the district
soared fourteenfold since 1994 to more than $3.6 million last year.
The revenue increase helped the city to finance a new spa to attract
Austrian tourists who come in droves to Hungary each year for the
country's thermal springs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sarvar is strong financially," said Tibor Denes, the city's
mayor. "But this is recent. In the last 40 years, all of Hungary was
left behind by the West. Now we have to work hard to catch up."</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Holds On to Week's Big Gains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street ended a big week on a quiet but encouraging note Friday
as modest stock gains lifted the Nasdaq composite index to its first
five-session winning streak in seven months and biggest weekly gain
in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the market's ability to hold steady, rather than
fall sharply on profit taking or fears that the week's big advance
would fizzle, suggests investor confidence is slowly recovering.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a good way to end the week. We've hung on to most of the
gains, and the market's overall tone is better, and the news appears
to be improving," said Rafael Tamargo, director of equity research at
Wilmington Trust.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 63.87 points, or 0.6%,
at 10,353.08. The Dow, which enjoyed two triple-digit advances this
week, had its highest finish since April 10, when it stood at
10,381.73.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The tech-focused
Nasdaq composite gained 10.95 points, or 0.6%, to 1,741.39. Its last
five-session gain was in early October.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 8.36 points, or 0.8%, to
1,106.59.</TE>
<TE>   The indexes' weekly performances also were solid. The Dow gained
4.2%, Nasdaq rose 8.8%, and the S&amp;P climbed 4.9%. Nasdaq's gain was
its biggest since the week ended April 20, 2001, when it surged
10.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers Friday by a narrow 6-5 margin in moderate
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Dell rose 10 cents to $27.95 on earnings that beat expectations
despite a slight drop in first-quarter profit. The company also
raised its forecast for second-quarter profit.</TE>
<TE>   A University of Michigan report showing consumer sentiment rose to
a 11/2-year high last month was welcome news but had little effect on
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But bonds slumped on fears the surge in consumer sentiment
increases the odds the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in
August. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped to
5.25% from 5.17% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar fell, hitting a five-month low against the Japanese
yen, as concerns about the U.S. economy lingered despite the upbeat
consumer data.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strength of the market this week, analysts remained
cautious. They noted that Wall Street has had a recent history of
rallying unsustainably as investors lose confidence that business is
improving.</TE>
<TE>   They also said much of this week's buying came in stocks that had
fallen sharply in previous weeks on disappointing earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The tone of the market in the last week or so has changed. We're
getting better earnings reports from important companies. There is
the potential to move higher, but it's going to happen slowly," said
Mike Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Utility and energy stocks fell as worries persisted that
companies recorded phantom trades to inflate volumes. Duke Energy
fell $1.18 to $33.52, while Dynegy shed 63 cents to $7.02.</TE>
<TE>   * Crude oil for June delivery closed 23 cents higher at $28.18 a
barrel in New York as traders shrugged off bearish news that Russia
will lift its oil export curbs at the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailer Gap dropped 59 cents to $16.30 on first-quarter
earnings that beat expectations but still showed weak sales.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann OKs New Napster Deal</HD>
<DH>Media: Latest agreement to buy the file-sharing firm would
leave investors empty-handed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global media conglomerate Bertelsmann struck a deal with Napster Inc.
on Friday to buy the company after Napster emerges from bankruptcy,
paying creditors $8million but leaving investors in the pioneering
song-sharing service empty-handed.</LD>
<LD>   Among the creditors are the major record labels and music
publishers that sued Napster for copyright infringement, saying
Napster users made millions of unauthorized copies of their songs for
free. But their claims may take a back seat to the $12 million to
$13million in debts the company reportedly owes for products and
services.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which also calls for Bertelsmann to waive the $85
million in loans it made to Napster, brings founder Shawn Fanning,
Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers and other top executives back to the
fold. But it doesn't solve Napster's biggest problem: It still can't
offer songs from the major record companies through the new,
copyright-protecting service it has developed.</LD>
<TE>   "The only thing Napster really has to offer at this point is its
brand," said analyst Stacey Herron of Jupiter Research, a technology
research and consulting firm. "Surprisingly, Napster still does have
a really strong brand name, not only in the digital music community
but with consumers overall.... [But] the more that time passes, the
more Napster continues to bury itself in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments capped a roller-coaster month for Redwood
City, Calif.-based Napster. Amid negotiations between Bertelsmann and
Napster's board, dissident board member John Fanning, uncle of Shawn
Fanning, sued to wrest control of the company from its major
investor, venture capital firm Hummer Winblad.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Bertelsmann withdrew its offer to buy the shares held
by Hummer Winblad, John Fanning and other investors. Instead, it
offered to pay creditors $5million for Napster's assets as part of a
bankruptcy proceeding, with no money for Hummer Winblad and other
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Bertelsmann withdrew that offer as well,
prompting the company's top executives to resign and most of its
employees to be laid off. Having fended off the Fanning lawsuit, the
board made a new overture to Bertelsmann on Wednesday, which resulted
in Friday's deal.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Hummer Winblad, investors had poured more than $15million
into Napster to help it grow from a college dorm-room project into a
hugely popular song-sharing network. But the major record companies
and music publishers sued for copyright infringement, and a series of
federal court rulings effectively shut down the company's free
service.</TE>
<TE>   According to Jupiter, Napster attracted more than 13.5 million
users during its peak month, February 2001. But those users quickly
switched to other file-sharing networks online as Napster blocked
users from downloading a growing number of copyrighted songs.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing, expected next week, not only will wipe out
Napster's debts and its shareholders' investments, but it also will
end the labels' and publishers' claims for damages, according to
several officials involved in the deal. But Napster still may have to
compensate the labels and publishers for the infringements in order
to distribute their artists' songs.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm, said labels and publishers are certain to extract
some compensation before letting Napster resurface. "If they don't,
they send the message that that kind of piracy is acceptable," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Napster has spent months trying in vain to obtain licenses from
the labels on terms that would support its vision--and
Bertelsmann's--of a service that consumers would be willing to pay
for. Friday's deal "is an indication that Bertelsmann believes it can
happen," McNealy said.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the negotiations said Bertelsmann is committed
to file sharing and plans to make Napster the flagship of its digital
distribution strategy. "This has never been a short-time or one-time
opportunity," said the source, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Pichinson, president of consulting firm Sherwood Partners,
said the big losers in the process are music fans, artists, investors
and Napster itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good name, but you've got to rebuild it. I don't think
[Bertelsmann] can do it," Pichinson said. "They've lost the
community. The people have moved away from the village."</TE>

<HD>Network Associates Restates Its Results</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The firm says employee made intentional errors
for 1998 through 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Network Associates Inc., maker of the popular McAfee anti-virus
software, said Friday that it restated financial results for the
years 1998 through 2000 to correct accounting errors the computer
security firm attributed to one employee.</LD>
<LD>   The company, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for its financial reporting in 2000, said the restated
results correct intentional errors made in accounting entries on the
company's books. Executives said that the employee, who wasn't
identified, was fired this year and that no motive has been
established.</LD>
<LD>   The errors involved improperly moving money through tax and other
internal accounts and was part of what analysts called sloppy
bookkeeping practices that led to the departure of top managers in
December 2000. No one profited from the errors, and none of the
errors affected current operations, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts hailed Network's quick action, which came three weeks
after the firm revealed that it had found accounting inaccuracies and
that the SEC had turned a yearlong inquiry into an investigation. At
the time, Network Associates also withdrew a $225-million bid for the
rest of McAfee.com Corp. It already owns 75% of McAfee.</TE>
<TE>   "I take full responsibility for cleaning up these past events and
putting procedures in place to prevent this from ever happening
again," said George Samenuk, brought in as chairman and chief
executive in January 2001 to restore credibility in the company's
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Network's stock rose $1.33, or 7%, to close at $21.62 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Jittery investors, fearing another in a series
of accounting debacles that have spread since Enron Corp.'s collapse,
breathed a sigh of relief that the restated results weren't as
damaging as feared and don't affect the company's cash flow or
operations last year or this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good news. From an investor's perspective, what is
important is that there are no accounting issues since new management
took over," said Israel Hernandez, a Lehman Bros. analyst in San
Francisco. "We knew there were some financial shenanigans under the
prior management team. The fear was that it would spread into last
year and this year."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Christopher S. Russ said in a research report for Wachovia
Corp.'s First Union Securities Inc. that the SEC investigation still
hangs over Network, but that the restatement "should go a long way
toward expediting the SEC investigation" and placing the blame on
previous managers.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC began looking into the company's accounting practices
after Network Associates disclosed in December 2000 that it would
report a steep loss for the quarter and the year and that its top
three officers, including Bill Larson, its chairman and chief
executive, were quitting.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, after the agency notified the company that it was
starting a formal investigation, Samenuk launched an internal review.
The board's audit committee found that inaccurate entries in various
accounts led to understated costs and expenses and overstated
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Restated results reduce 1998 income by 3 cents a share, to
$32.4million from $36.4 million; reduce 1999's net loss by 2 cents a
share, to $156.9 million from $159.9million; and increase the 2000
net loss by 16 cents a share, to $123.9million from $102.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the company applied new mandatory accounting
rules for the last four years. The rules reclassify certain marketing
costs as reductions in sales, which have an overall effect of
reducing reported net revenue.</TE>

<HD>Schering to Pay a Fine of $500 Million</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The FDA levies a record penalty against
the drug maker for quality control issues and places it under strict
terms in a consent decree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressing the drug industry to pay more attention to manufacturing
quality, the Food and Drug Administration on Friday levied a record
$500-million fine against Schering-Plough Corp. for repeatedly
failing plant inspections. The FDA also set strict quality control
terms on four Schering-Plough facilities in a consent decree that
will last through 2005.</LD>
<LD>   Larger federal government fines have been levied against drug
companies, most notably the $875-million fine against TAP
Pharmaceuticals in October for Medicaid fraud, but Friday's fine was
the biggest yet from the FDA.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's penalties for pharmaceutical company quality control
deficiencies have grown increasingly severe since it gained the right
to levy fines through a federal appeals court decision in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "This action is another clear sign that the FDA will continue to
enforce the rules and regulations requiring companies to carefully
control and monitor their processes used to make pharmaceuticals and
other products," FDA Deputy Commissioner Lester M. Crawford said.
"Manufacturers who choose to wait until FDA investigators find
violations rather than policing themselves will find that they have
made a poor and costly decision."</TE>
<TE>   Other companies under FDA scrutiny include Abbott Laboratories,
which announced Wednesday that federal regulators declared that one
of its plants has failed to comply with quality standards. Abbott
paid a $100-million fine in 1999 to settle accusations that it failed
to meet quality standards in the production of medical test kits.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the FDA announced that Paris-based drug maker
Roussel Uclaf had been fined $33 million for deliberately failing to
disclose all of the locations where the antibiotic Cefaclor was being
manufactured. And Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Corona was placed
under an FDA consent decree May 3 based on manufacturing practices,
but the company was not fined and there were no product recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough said it won't meet 2002 earnings estimates because
the consent decree will add to production costs and may delay some
shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The company had been expected to earn 46 cents a share in the
second quarter and $1.74 for 2002, the average estimate of analysts
polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. Second-quarter profit may not
exceed last year's 43 cents a share, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, several Wall Street analysts, who had been waiting
for this shoe to drop since late last year, considered the fine and
consent decree good news for the company and investors.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough's stock rose more than 5.5% in Friday trading, up
$1.37 to $26.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's news is simply a confirmation of what we already knew.
The company had already set aside $500 million for the fine, and now
we know what it has to do to comply with the FDA," Morningstar
analyst Todd Lebor said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock took a tumble Wednesday on the news that the FDA's
Office of Criminal Investigations in Puerto Rico had launched a
criminal probe on one or more of Schering-Plough's products.</TE>
<TE>   That occurred amid speculation that production of the company's
newest allergy drug, Clarinex, might be shut down. Clarinex
production had already been delayed by the quality control dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives some clarity that we are not looking at any major
disruption in the availability of Schering-Plough's key strategic
products, which could have done irreparable harm to the company,"
said analyst Richard R. Stover of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.</TE>
<TE>   Four Schering-Plough plants in New Jersey and Puerto Rico are
covered by the decree, which must still be approved by a federal
judge.</TE>
<TE>   But they can continue to produce the company's most promising and
best-selling drugs, such as Clarinex, Claritin and Rebetol, as well
as asthma inhalers and dermatology products. Production of some
veterinary products will cease at one Puerto Rico plant until
upgrades can be made.</TE>
<TE>   The decree requires Schering-Plough to submit to extra reviews and
reports. The company also will have to hire outside experts to ensure
that manufacturing methods, procedures and controls meet FDA quality
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Schering-Plough might have to pay as much as $175 million in
additional fines if it doesn't meet the deadlines in the consent
decree, the FDA said.</TE>

<HD>Trade Gap Narrows Slightly in March</HD>
<DH>Economy: First-quarter exports are still down 15% from a
year earlier despite improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in March as sales of American-made
products abroad grew faster than imports, the Commerce Department
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   An uptick in foreign demand for U.S. planes, cars and computers
helped shrink the trade deficit to $31.6billion in March, a slight
improvement from February when the gap hit a 10-month high of
$31.8billion. The unexpected drop in the trade deficit pleased some
analysts, who viewed the boost in demand for capital goods as sign of
an improving global economy.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the modest improvement in March figures couldn't salvage
what has been a rough first quarter for U.S. exporters, which have
been hit with a double whammy of a weak global economy and a
relatively strong dollar.</LD>
<TE>   "Manufacturers continue to face a daunting challenge," said Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the Washington-based National Assn. of
Manufacturers. "There is no sign of significant export growth."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. exports of goods totaled $166.5billion in the first three
months of the year, down 15% from the same quarter in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The drop was much more severe in California, where first-quarter
exports tumbled 26% to $22.5billion. The state's top three export
sectors--computers and electrical equipment, machinery and
transportation equipment--posted major declines.</TE>
<TE>   "Industries in California are much more tied into the global
supply chain," said Sacramento trade analyst Jock O'Connell. "It's a
major reason why California is doing more poorly than the nation as a
whole."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some observers say the March trade figures may signal that
the worst is over. California's March exports totaled nearly
$8.4billion. That's down more than 20% compared with the same month a
year ago. But it represents the highest monthly export tally since
the September terrorist attacks, said Lon Hatamiya, secretary of the
California Technology, Trade and Commerce agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see an upward trend, not a downward one," Hatamiya
said. "That bodes well for the rest of this year."</TE>
<TE>   Cenatek Inc., based in the Silicon Valley city of Morgan Hill,
said it's seeing an increase in demand for its hardware and software
from buyers in Germany, Japan and Korea. The company makes technology
that allows businesses such as credit card companies to process
transactions faster.</TE>
<TE>   With the rest of the world looking to the U.S. to lead the global
recovery, economists predict many U.S. firms will see their domestic
revenues increase ahead of foreign sales. But Dustin Bogue, executive
vice president of Cenatek, said his company's experience is just the
opposite. He said many American customers are so gripped by profit
pressure that they are reluctant to invest in any new technology.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't increase their bottom line immediately, they don't
want it," Bogue said.</TE>
<TE>   California's $100-billion-plus export sector is a critical piece
of the Golden State's economy, representing nearly 8% of the state's
$1.4-trillion gross state product.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts don't expect a major strengthening in the sector
until global demand for high-tech products and business equipment
rebounds, perhaps not until late 2002 or early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But a more immediate threat is the prospect of a strike by West
Coast dockworkers that could shut down the ports of Los Angeles, Long
Beach, Oakland and Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions are running high between the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
shippers and cargo distributors. The longshore workers' contract
expires June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Potential trouble at the ports "couldn't come at a worse time,
with the economy just beginning to recover," said Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "It's
definitely a major concern."</TE>
<TE>   America's trade deficit with Mexico, the nation's second-biggest
trading partner, surged 27.2% in March to a record $3.5billion. The
deficit with Canada, America's northern partner in the North American
Free Trade Agreement, declined just over 1% to $3.9billion.</TE>
<TE>   The gap with Japan was unchanged at $5.7billion, while the
shortfall with China narrowed to $5.6billion from $6.5billion in
February.</TE>
<TE>   For the third straight month, the U.S. increased its consumption
of imports, which were driven higher by the biggest one-month jump in
crude oil prices in nearly 12 years. The U.S. imported 267.3million
barrels of oil in March, up from 243.5 million a month earlier. With
average prices rising $2.62 a barrel to $19.18, America's oil tab
reached $16.8 billion in March.</TE>
<TE>   In other economic news released Friday, the University of
Michigan's index of consumer confidence rose to its highest level
since December 2000.</TE>

<LD>Census data--The headline on Wednesday's Section A story reporting
the 2000 census data on lower household income in Southern California
incorrectly referred to the amount as an average. The $42,200 figure
used was, as the text of the story stated correctly, not an average
but a median, meaning that half of all households made more than that
amount and half made less.</LD>

<HD>When Punishment Becomes Child Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL BREZENOFF</AU>
<BD>Dan Brezenoff is a mental health social worker in Long
Beach.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a common misconception about raising children. You may have
heard it in the expression "spare the rod, spoil the child." The
belief is basically this: Criminals are created when parents fail to
punish their children swiftly and strictly, and the solution to any
problem is harsher punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Tolerance and compassion are viewed as breeding grounds for bad
behavior. Children must learn right from wrong by being hit hard for
the latter, and the younger we start, the better. Thus drug addicts
go to prison for years and 11-year-olds are tried as adults.</LD>
<LD>   Having worked with severely emotionally disturbed children and
their families for the past decade, I am painfully aware of a chasm
between good behavioral research and popular beliefs. I know beyond a
shadow of a doubt that criminals are raised, not born, and that what
makes children into criminals--particularly the violent ones--is not
leniency or tolerance but neglect and abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Not a single empirical study contradicts this conclusion. It is
love and understanding that delinquent children often lack, not an
iron fist. Certainly, a total lack of structure in a child's home is
a common predecessor to petty crimes, truancy and drug abuse. The
truly dangerous adolescent is almost always the product of a
neglectful or abusive family--one in which the adults ignore the
child's needs or the child is subject to physical and emotional harm.</TE>
<TE>   I am not talking about the occasional spanking. Appropriate
physical discipline, while in no way necessary, does not appear to
traumatize children. But physical punishment that endangers a child's
health, requires medical attention or causes a child to be terrified
of his or her parents is abuse, and it harms, not helps, a child's
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Abuse is usually a product of parental anger and frustration, not
a desire to teach youngsters right from wrong. With this in mind, it
was with outrage and great sadness that I learned of a recent
decision by Orange County Superior Court Judge James Perez. Perez
presided over the trial and sentencing of Wellington Soto, an Anaheim
father who admitted burning his son's hand on a gas stove after the
boy stole from a store.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, in a ruling that is utterly opposed to the truths of child
development and insulting to true proponents of multiculturalism,
fined Soto $100 and allowed the boy to remain in his parents'
custody, citing "customs and habits" and stating that "hopefully, the
child has learned a lesson." Perez reminded the courtroom that all
the kids in Juvenile Hall "started with little things."</TE>
<TE>   Soto's son is 5 years old; he stole a pack of gum. Perez has no
business ever hearing a child abuse case again unless he educates
himself about matters of child development. The only lessons this boy
has learned are that his father is dangerous and unforgiving and that
the U.S. justice system is more concerned with protecting the
property of candy-store owners than with keeping children safe.</TE>

<AU>SAUL C. JANSON</AU>
<BD>Saul C. Janson is a screenwriter and part-time lawyer.
E-mail: SJVenice@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 2002: My limited stock holdings have plummeted, my income is
stagnant and my financial prospects are not all that rosy. And worst
of all, I think my house is worth too much.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, when I bought my house, I became one of the zeitgeist
statistics of the day. I joined the largest percentage of Americans
ever to own their own home and was one of a record number of
first-time buyers.</LD>
<LD>   I felt a patriotic rush knowing the economists and politicians
were talking about me when they blathered on about the robust economy
and the historic levels of homeownership.</LD>
<TE>   Never mind that a friend lent me most of the down payment and
co-signed the loan. Or that I had bought a house so in need of repair
that a movie location scout came by after my purchase wanting my new
home to stand in as a crack house. I happily applied the $500
location fee toward a new roof.</TE>
<TE>   My street was in a somewhat mixed, middle-class neighborhood in
Venice. My house's previous owner, who had recently died, bought the
house new with her husband in 1946. Thanks to the hassles of a
probate sale and the lingering effects of the riots and the
earthquake, I was able to buy it for less than $170,000--a pittance
for Southern California real estate a mile from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   I did not, however, send pictures to my family in Philadelphia.
They would have thought I had lost my marbles paying so much for so
little. But I saw the potential and was willing to live amid the
wreckage to stake my claim to the American dream.</TE>
<TE>   As I spent many hours and dollars slowly rehabbing my hovel, my
street gentrified around me. Real estate prices climbed. In short
order, I became another trumpeted statistic. I got thousands of
dollars out of my equity to repay my friend and remodel the kitchen
and with interest rates diving even lowered my monthly payment.</TE>
<TE>   I recently read that houses in my Venice ZIP Code now have the
second-highest value per square foot in all of Los Angeles County. My
two-bedroom, one-bath home is probably worth more than $400,000. The
recession and the events of Sept. 11 seem to have done nothing to
shake the market. I should be thrilled. But when informed that a
similar but unimproved house up the street just sold, in days, for
more than twice what I paid, I found myself half-wishing the house
had languished on the market and sold for tens of thousands less.</TE>
<TE>   I chose Venice on purpose. I liked its mix of rich and poor and
in-between, of people who didn't all look like me. Artists could
afford to live here. But now, the artist and teacher across the
street couldn't come close to affording the house they bought three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I'm fond of the lawyer who owns a home a few houses away, but I
also enjoy living near the librarian and the masseuse in the
dilapidated rental bungalows on the other side of him. And the aging
rockers who have rented down the street for years. I like that the
gardener owns a house on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Two absentee owners have recently sold--evicting longtime
tenants--to net hundreds of thousands of never-dreamt-of dollars.
Sure, it's comforting to come home to this huge asset every day, but
I'm not planning to go anywhere. Does it really matter that my house
is worth so much? If I sold, I wouldn't be able to buy anything close
by. I also fear for the scale and spirit of my street.</TE>
<TE>   I've accrued financial gain through good timing, hard work, a
generous friend and a willingness to live in a "crack house" for a
few years. In Venice, those days are over. I'm grateful I "got in"
when I did and glad to live in a house worth more, not less, than I
paid for it. But lost in the feel-good housing statistics is the
value of living here.</TE>
<TE>   I'm starting to think my house would be worth a lot more to me if
it just wasn't worth so much.</TE>

<LD>Judas is the New Testament's dark angel. The Gospel of John puts him
in the shadows, an appropriate place for a figure who's a smudge of
dirt on the luminous story of the New Testament. He's also a bundle
of contradictions: Fierce and menacing, he sent his savior off to
execution with a kiss, so willing was he to trade reward in the
hereafter for cash in the here and now. Yet no single depiction
explains who Judas was or why he betrayed his teacher, though people
have long been seeking an answer.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps he was a patriot seeking to throw off Roman control, which
Nikos Kazantzakis depicted in "The Last Temptation of Christ"; or he
was in love with a woman, maybe even Mary Magdalene, which weakened
his loyalty to Jesus; or perhaps Judas was a necessary part of God's
plan for salvation, as an early Gnostic Christian sect believed.</LD>
<LD>   "Judas fascinated the authors of the Gospels," Kim Paffenroth
writes in "Judas: Images of the Lost Disciple." "And he has continued
to captivate authors, artists, composers and filmmakers throughout 20
centuries of Christianity."</LD>
<TE>   The choices are endless because so little is known about him and
so much is left up to our imaginations. Paffenroth has compiled many
of the myths, legends and stories (albeit with some important
omissions) that have gathered around this sulky figure as he has
wandered through the centuries. Some students of the Bible are sure
to object to Paffenroth's approach, arguing that, in fact, we do know
much about Judas. After all, the Gospels tell us about the 30 pieces
of silver, the kiss and how he bought a piece of land with the money
and died there.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Paffenroth reminds us, the evangelists were as heavily
engaged in storytelling as Kazantzakis. In Matthew's account of his
death, for example, a remorseful Judas hangs himself; in Luke, an
unrepentant Judas dies in a field after his guts swell and burst.
Mark and John, on the other hand, are silent about his death. What
really happened?</TE>
<TE>   Paffenroth cites numerous inconsistencies and biblical allusions,
all to show how the evangelists manipulated and invented the material
of their stories. And the Apostle Paul, he points out, whose letters
are the church's earliest documents, never even mentions Judas,
leaving some doubts about his actual existence.</TE>
<TE>   "[A]ll the details of his life had been lost, or, more accurately,
they had yet to be created," Paffenroth explains. "Later storytellers
looked at Judas ... shaping him into the kind of man or monster that
their individual stories needed."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving aside the perennial debates over fact versus fiction in
the Gospels, what's more fascinating about Paffenroth's study is his
presentation of how storytellers have shaped and invented new
versions of Judas through time. The behaviors and social mores of a
writer's era stick to Judas like iron fibers to a magnet, telling us
much about our past and about the highs and lows of human invention.</TE>
<TE>   As the world moved into the medieval period, passion plays
highlighted Judas' villainy as a money-handler and Christ-killer, an
image that thrived in a growing atmosphere of European anti-Semitism.
Late-medieval stories portray him in a more heroic light, fated to
betray Christ like a figure in Greek tragedy. Such stories,
Paffenroth explains, "caused their audiences to sympathize with him
deeply and invited them to see the fatefulness of his life reflected
in all of ours."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as Judas moves into the 19th and 20th centuries, one
finds more sympathetic portraits. He is certainly not exonerated
(anti-Semitic portrayals still persist), but more complexity is added
to his actions. In these, Judas seems more practical and even, to a
small degree, justified. By betraying Jesus, the 19th century
essayist Thomas De Quincey wrote, Judas prods him out of his
Hamlet-like hesitation and forces Jesus to become a man of action.</TE>
<TE>   To other artists, Judas is responding to some type of tyranny. In
Robinson Jeffers' poem "Dear Judas," Jesus is too proud and imperious
in his ministry, causing Judas to turn against him. More recently,
"The Knifeman," a novel by William Rayner, presents a Cold War
scenario in which a secret policeman forces Judas to inform on Jesus
by threatening to harm his loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   As this study shows, more modern attempts to give Judas deeper
motivations for his crime seem similar to the efforts of attorneys,
psychotherapists and other experts to find the parental abuse, the
broken home or the gene that turned someone into a murderer. Betray
the Son of God? There has to be a better reason, they seem to argue,
than 30 silver pieces or the cliche that "the devil made him do it."</TE>
<TE>   In gathering his materials, however, Paffenroth overlooks the work
of important novelists such as Reynolds Price, Sholem Asch, Jose
Saramago and Norman Mailer, which makes his book feel incomplete. And
elsewhere, his selection of subjects seems a bit odd: Why discuss the
movie version of "The Last Temptation of Christ," as he does, but not
the book?</TE>
<TE>   Yet Paffenroth still manages to show how modern stories of Judas
bring him closer to us. These stories provoke our sympathy and even
prick our conscience. Aren't we all a little like Judas? Haven't we
all sometimes betrayed our beliefs to pursue the status or wealth
that we don't have?</TE>
<TE>   This makes Judas an apt figure for our gossipy age. His weakness,
more than the doubts and denials of the other Apostles, strikes a
modern nerve. Judas is a haunting reminder of the dark potential in
all people to reject what's truly good for them. That may be why his
story has persisted in the imagination for centuries, and perhaps why
it always will.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Secession Red Flag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energy deregulation was such a complex issue that when it passed the
California Legislature in 1998, few members could claim to understand
how it would work. Must be a good idea anyway, they said. Three years
later, rolling blackouts, skyrocketing utility bills and
price-gouging power pirates hit the state. The lawmakers wished
they'd never voted.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn is trying to keep
secession--another complex undertaking no one really
understands--from becoming this year's budget-buster sequel. This
week, he challenged the numbers being used to decide whether carving
the San Fernando Valley from the rest of the city should go to a vote
in November. Valley secession advocates accused him of trying to
thwart the will of the people. Not true. Hahn is looking after the
interests of the people who elected him.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission long ago stopped trying to
hide its glee at the chance to cut up big, bad Los Angeles. The
nine-member panel is a hodgepodge of elected officials and appointed
retirees from throughout Los Angeles County, some of them leaders of
a fizzled Valley secession effort in the 1970s, others from smaller
cities tired of living in the shadow of their giant neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday provided one more example of their breakup boosterism.
Members of the commission scoffed at Hahn's argument, which was
backed by an independent audit, that the breakup would cost Los
Angeles far more than the commission estimated. But commissioners
welcomed their own staff's attempt to rejigger the numbers to salvage
a harbor area secession plan deemed dead by their own consultant and
by a state audit. They are so determined to get all three secession
measures, including one for Hollywood, on the November ballot that
they might as well have skipped the required studies and saved
taxpayers $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's concern is that, should voters agree to the largest
municipal divorce in U.S. history, it not lead to deregulation-size
consequences. On Thursday, a leading bond firm cited secession in
downgrading its forecast for Los Angeles' credit standing from stable
to negative. The commission ignores these warnings at the people's
peril.</TE>

<HD>City Parks Need Help Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By Sunday evening, the trash cans around Mar Vista Park often
overflow. After the usual round of weekend birthday parties and
family barbecues, the pickup basketball games, league softball play
and the dozens of kids swinging and skateboarding, the wide bare
spots in the outfield grass have grown even wider and the rusty old
bleachers squeak and sway a bit more.</LD>
<LD>   Even in the best of economic times, maintenance has been an
on-again, off-again thing at many city parks. As one of the larger
parks on the Westside, Mar Vista, with committed staff and dedicated
neighbors, has fared better than many others. But the to-do list is
long and expensive: The asphalt cracks and buckles, the park lacks
play equipment for toddlers, the clubroom and kitchen are ancient and
worn, and the restrooms have the chain-link charm of a prison camp.
That's on top of the plagues common to so many urban parks: graffiti,
vandalism, beer bottles in the grass and homeless men hanging out in
the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Need one more explanation for the secessionist drumbeat in the San
Fernando Valley and other parts of town? Look no further than our
worn-out parks, where, because of a citywide hiring freeze, there is
a shrinking pool of gardeners, electricians and janitors chasing a
growing number of repair calls.</LD>
<TE>   The city's financial crunch is not as dire as that of the state,
but the hiring freeze combined with early retirements and
resignations has left 11% of citywide slots for maintenance workers
unfilled. The state of Los Angeles' parks affects residents' quality
of life, influencing how they feel about their neighborhoods and city
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, Mayor
James K. Hahn seems to understand that connection. He plans to add 53
new staff positions, upgrade seven more parks and open 43 new
facilities, including skate parks, swimming pools, child-care centers
and parks accessible to children with disabilities. Hahn also has
lent his support to the Trust for Public Land's newly announced
Greenprinting Los Angeles initiative, designed to identify potential
park sites in the poorer, denser parts of town.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is debating Hahn's budget request. But the mayor
and the Department of Recreation and Parks can't wait for the new
cash before acting to improve maintenance. If they delay, the
increases will all go to repair damage wrought this year.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's appointment of Manuel Mollinedo as the new department head
is a promising step. Mollinedo was a manager in the parks department
before he left to successfully lead the Los Angeles Zoo out of the
doldrums. Mollinedo will take over July 1; to succeed he'll need
freedom to reorganize the parks department's widely dispersed staff
to become much more responsive.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Mollinedo should look to the network of park
advisory boards created under his predecessor, Ellen Oppenheim, for
help. These groups of involved neighbors already raise funds, plant
trees and coach sports teams at their local parks in communities both
prosperous and decidedly not. Many of them stand willing to do more
in these pinched times. Mollinedo should make them feel welcome.</TE>

<HD>Be Flexible on Welfare Rules</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Congress should not ignore the lessons learned from the steep drop in
the number of parents on public assistance since Washington made
welfare a temporary benefit nearly six years ago. The federal
government set reasonable goals and gave states the resources and
flexibility needed to get millions of recipients, largely single
mothers, off welfare and into jobs. As Congress prepares to
reauthorize and amend the 1996 welfare reforms, the goal remains to
put more recipients to work without harming their children.</LD>
<LD>   A bipartisan compromise that sticks to those simple aims is
brewing in the Senate Finance Committee. The measure, one of two
Senate bills introduced, would protect the flexibility that states
need while stiffening work rules, increasing day-care subsidies and
restoring benefits to legal immigrants, many of whom live in
California. The Senate is repeating the bipartisan cooperation that
transformed the old, dead-end Aid to Families With Dependent Children
into the more effective Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of the adults who were on welfare when welfare
reform became law are off today. State welfare programs and a booming
economy that created jobs at a record pace powered that exodus. The
shrinking numbers prove that states know what they are doing.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration, working through the Republican majority
in the House, wants to toughen the rules without providing enough
help for the states. More poor parents would have to go to work, and
for longer hours. Child-care subsidies would not keep pace. The White
House also would fund two dubious proposals for experiments promoting
marriage and advocating sexual abstinence. A House bill approved
Thursday would increase the work requirement from 30 to 40 hours a
week. If some recipients couldn't find jobs, which is all too likely
in a stagnant economy, states would have to set up--and pay
for--community work programs. The last thing governors need is
another unfunded federal mandate, especially when 46 states face
budget shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would increase to 70% the percentage of people
required to work while still receiving welfare. Some states can't
meet even the current 50% goal because many recipients lack skills
that would make them attractive to employers. States need flexibility
in defining "work" to allow some recipients to attend school, learn
English or take training so they can get hired.</TE>
<TE>   The White House proposed no new money for day care. Republican
women members added $2 billion over five years to the House bill. A
Senate bill counters with an $11-billion increase favored by
Democrats. No child should become worse off because his mother left
welfare and went to work.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare reform is working. Congress should leave the states alone
and let them do the job.</TE>

<LD>The recent failed attempt by North Koreans seeking asylum in China,
as reflected in the horror of a little girl's face ("Tape of Failed
Defection Touches a Nerve in Asia," May 14), brings to mind the scope
of the atrocities committed in this world and the will of people to
escape them. The family arrested by Chinese officials last week
wanted to come to the U.S. And who can blame them? This country has
emerged as a haven for all the world's meek and weak, the huddled
masses yearning to be free. As a mother, it breaks my heart to see
children oppressed, their right to a decent existence and their very
hope destroyed at such an early age. Unfortunately, this is done
every day by autocratic or fanatically religious regimes all over the
world.</LD>
<LD>   However, the problem with being a "safe haven" is that we allow
people to escape from their problems in their native land. These
problems do not just go away. The oppressors become stronger as their
population of oppressed becomes weaker: Those with strong wills and,
perhaps, strong voices find a way to leave and end up here.</LD>
<TE>   The only way we can crush oppression throughout the world is to
close our borders. This will force citizens of oppressive nations to
actually rise up and make a change. People need a reason to rise up.
If we give everyone in the world a haven--a way to escape their
problems--we will never move forward. More important, we who are true
citizens by birthright become oppressed by the burden of losing our
"American" language and culture.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re energy deregulation: There are two fundamental aspects of the
electric power situation that are practically never even mentioned.
First, and perhaps foremost, is the concept of the obligation to
serve. It was the effort to meet this obligation that drove PG&amp;E and
Edison into insolvency. None of the re-regulation schemes covered in
James Flanigan's May 12 column (Business) address this issue, which
is eloquently addressed by John Balzar in his column (Commentary, May
12). If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is successful in
splitting the U.S. electric industry into three independent
parts--generation, transmission and distribution--the obligation to
serve cannot be met.</LD>
<LD>   No single part could do it by itself, but the FERC is pursuing
this objective with a fanatical zeal. Commissioners simply believe
the free market will provide.</LD>
<LD>   The other issue is the technical complexity of electric power
systems, which must be designed and operated to function as a whole.
The three parts have to fit together. As an example, the concept of
independent power producers is an oxymoron. Generators must come on
line to meet the system requirements, not to serve the special
interests of the producer. Last winter's blackouts are examples of
what can happen.</LD>
<TE>   A reliable electric power network is the product of competent
engineering and skilled and dedicated personnel. While it has to be
cost-effective, it is not amenable to standard supply-and-demand
economics.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth O. Cartwright</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balzar dismisses electric power deregulation as a "scam." While
our California version is badly flawed, deregulation in general has
produced some remarkable benefits. A bit of history points this out.</TE>
<TE>   Deregulation in the electrical generating business began with the
federal Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978. Among other
things, that law deregulated the electric generating business to the
extent that small power producers were allowed to produce and sell
power. Suddenly, new players were entering the market, and they
needed relatively low-cost, reliable ways of producing electric
power. This resulted in a whole new industry--the manufacture and use
of gas turbines (essentially jet airplane engines) to generate
electricity at much lower costs than traditional facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Without "deregulation" of small power producers, this never would
have happened. The traditional "rate of return" approach to setting
the price of electricity sold by utilities (they were allowed a
"reasonable rate of return" on their capital investment) encouraged
the construction of large, expensive steam-generation plants. Let's
not abandon deregulation. Let's fix it.</TE>
<TE>   Edward S. Renwick</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enron and other energy companies deliberately manipulated the
energy market to drive up prices and turn minor power shortages into
critical ones. Their greed and arrogance caused them to fail, and
they deserve no sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, deregulation was flawed; yes, California is short of power
plants due to NIMBYism; yes, Gov. Gray Davis was slow to react; and
yes, the Public Utilities Commission acted like a group of amateurs.
But that does not excuse the flagrant breakdown in corporate ethics
and the top managers who displayed an utter disregard for the public
health and safety of Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Reliable electricity, natural gas and gasoline supplies are not
commodities like wheat and corn. Because of the high capital
requirements of the energy market, there are only a few major players
and thus there is vulnerability to monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   While deregulation looks wonderful in principle, it failed
miserably in this instance. The FERC refused to act and appeared to
be motivated more by politics than accepting its legal
responsibility. The FERC and the Bush administration chose to blame
California for creating the problem. What hubris.</TE>
<TE>   Our nation's energy markets, not just in California, are too
important to function without strong regulatory oversight. Like it or
not, the ability to exert market power and behave unethically is in
the hands of too few companies. Until that is changed we should not
risk being held hostage by those who have failed to play by the
rules.</TE>

<TE>   Isn't it time to rewrite criminal law? Enron executives are
responsible for California blackouts and accompanying hardships,
including risks to human life. They are responsible for swindling
stockholders, putting workers out on the street and influencing
public policy to benefit their industry. They have exhibited a total
disregard for the well-being of others in the name of their own
greed.</TE>

<HD>PBS: Above the Network Fray</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Network Mastery Has Gone to Pieces,'' May 12: As someone who
has worked in commercial television as a writer and producer for over
40 years, I hate to see the Public Broadcasting System compared with
the "competition." It has no competitors. To say "the median age of
its viewers is a demographically unappealing 55" is an irrelevancy,
since PBS is not selling merchandise. The concept of
"counter-programming" implies that PBS has to be in the ratings race.
It doesn't.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial TV sells products. Pay TV charges subscribers. PBS is
in a different business: The individual stations need only satisfy
the wishes of their audience, their community and their private and
public sources of funding.</LD>
<LD>   PBS was "branded" long before the term became popular. Despite
"better funded copycats," PBS remains the only network that
consistently presents classical music, opera, ballet, musical
theater, jazz and traditional pop music as well as programs on the
arts.</LD>
<TE>   If PBS averages a 1.7 rating, that is as good as or better than
most cable channels. The autonomy of PBS stations is in the great
tradition of grass-roots America, "rooted in a local ethic and model
unlike anything we have in American broadcasting."</TE>
<TE>   I have always thought of PBS as being like the BBC--above the
fray. It should remain that way.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Chambers</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PBS needs to make some definite changes if it expects to continue
to exist. One thing that many people I know who watch PBS from time
to time say is that the best programming is only during the pledge
drives. Much of the rest of the time we see programs that are, at
times, five or more years old. A lot of the money from the pledges is
going not to programming but to administration--which isn't any
different than many other charities.</TE>
<TE>   Its attempts at getting a younger audience by taking on canceled
regular-broadcast programming failed to consider that there were
reasons for the cancellations. If PBS wants to get a younger
demographic, then there is programming that can get the younger
audience. Try more music specials or films from the Sundance Film
Festival or what worked in the past, such as programs similar to Carl
Sagan's on his view of the universe. If "Roswell" has been canceled,
it may be a better program to take on for the younger audience. The
only thing is, be careful about the time and day it is shown.</TE>

<TE>   I'm not surprised that PBS is on the verge of becoming irrelevant.
Not because PBS is some "leftist" network. On the contrary. PBS will
fade into oblivion because--with few exceptions--the right-wingers
have succeeded in their goal, and PBS turns somersaults to prove its
"mainstream" credentials.</TE>
<TE>   PBS offers the same kind of corporate news programming that
corporate television feeds us. The airwaves do not need more
"McLaughlin" discussions or Wall Street reports, more white male
talking heads with conservative points of view. We need alternative
media that are brought to us independent of business and political
interests, not by "journalists" who move through the revolving door
from Washington and Wall Street to infomercials that pose as
newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of PBS can't realistically be surprised by its demise,
either. Many inside the network refer to it as the Petroleum
Broadcasting System.</TE>

<TE>   My wife and I are in that "demographically unappealing" age group
mentioned in the article. We have cut off our support of KCET since
it has decided to pursue the younger age groups and copy the other TV
stations with programs that are uninspired and sloppily researched.
We see programs that only show the "politically correct" position on
logging, oil exploration, abortion and homosexuality. PBS has lost
its direction and purpose. It should be pursuing the age group that
pays its bills no matter how unappealing that age group.</TE>

<HD>Carter's Visit Draws a Bioweapons Charge</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "El Jefe Basks in Carter's Light," by Laura Ingraham, Commentary,
May 15: Let's be realistic. The only reason President Bush is making
Fidel Castro an issue right now is for the extremely important Cuban
American voting bloc in Florida--the same Florida where his brother,
Jeb, is facing reelection this year and the same Florida that was
razor-thin close in the previous presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   The charge by Undersecretary of State John Bolton that Cuba has
developed the capacity to produce biological weapons is absolutely
laughable. An eighth-grade science laboratory has the capacity to
develop biological weapons. Any nation that has the capacity to make
any sort of medicine has the capacity to develop biological weapons.
With the likes of Otto Reich (the Reagan-era advisor who still is
convinced the Cold War is running hot) advising the president on
Latin America, we can expect more hubbub about the threat from Cuba,
more coup attempts in governments we don't like and the constant
threat of communists around every corner.</LD>

<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Will we never be rid of these former presidents and their
officious meddling in current administration policies? Now former
President Carter has "challenged" conservatives to prove that Cuba
has developed biological weapons technology and shared it with Iran.
This apologist for Castro is the man who let loose the genie of
Muslim fundamentalism on the West. The destruction of Iran, the
cornerstone of peace in the Middle East, was one of the greatest
foreign policy disasters of the 20th century, precipitating the
Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the continuing crisis in Central
Asia. Carter also gave away the Panama Canal to the Red Chinese, an
act of incompetence yet to be paid for in American blood. And don't
forget the destruction of the Somoza regime and the subsequent
takeover of Nicaragua by the Sandinistas.</TE>
<TE>   Does Communist Cuba have the ability to manufacture bioterror
weapons? Yes, it does. Is Cuba building a biotech plant in Iran? Yes,
indeed. Is there a biotechnology-sharing agreement with Iran? Yes,
there is. Is there just the remotest chance that this Cuban "Center
for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology" and its clone in Iran
could be used for further international mayhem? Whose answer will the
American people believe? Carter's? Or the current administration's?</TE>
<TE>   Joseph A. Lea</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kudos to Carter for challenging Bolton's remark that "the U.S.
believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological weapon
research and development effort" and that it has exported the
technology to rogue states. Experts in the State Department assured
Carter that there was no evidence that Cuba had been involved in
sharing technology with any nation that could be used for terrorist
activity. It was refreshing to see Carter challenge the
administration's lies about Cuba's link to terrorism. Now if only a
champion would stand up and challenge the lies that Enron had no
direct policy ties to the Bush/Cheney team.</TE>

<TE>   Bush can meet with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and
Carter puts his foot in his mouth by meeting Castro? Give me a break.
The U.S. has supported more two-bit dictators than I can count.
Saddam Hussein, Ferdinand Marcos, Augusto Pinochet and even Bin
Laden, to name a few--after 43 years we need less of the same. U.S.
policy concerning Cuba has been a total failure because politicians
here would rather be elected than be right. Carter's move is only a
small step in the right direction.</TE>

still trust the government officials in Washington?</TE>

<LD>Re "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," Commentary, May 13: Denise Hamilton's
dig at the Valley as "an arid valley of broad, flat boulevards and
tract homes" and Karen Grigsby Bates' very-pleased-with-herself
listing of art, cultural and other institutions south of Mulholland
are notable.</LD>
<LD>   The assertion that there is no worthy cultural architecture in the
Valley is precisely the Valley's point. Downtown takes Valley money
to spend on huge projects over the hill, then snobbishly makes fun of
the Valley for not having any great stuff. Hellooo? Try not to be so
contemptuous of the people paying for the very things over which you
gloat.</LD>

<TE>   Secession won't lessen Los Angeles' political clout; L.A.-area
cities form coalitions all the time to make their point in Washington
or Sacramento. Secession won't impact tourism; people come to "L.A."
whether they are going to Disneyland, Malibu or Hollywood. It is all
Los Angeles to the non-Southern Californian. Anti-secessionists care
only about (the loss of) two things: money and power. Valley
residents are tired of paying taxes for services they don't get. If
the Valley secedes, there will be less money for Mayor James Hahn and
others to spend. With less money, leaders lose some of their personal
power. If Los Angeles breaks up, those in districts that will then be
in seceded sections will lose their jobs and their power.</TE>
<TE>   So keep your eyes open, L.A., especially when you read articles in
The Times, a player in the money and power game. As those in power in
Los Angeles begin to seriously think that parts of the city will be
able to secede, they will aggressively play any card, from race to
fear of public-service curtailment, not because they really believe
that L.A. as a metropolitan area will be diminished but because they
want to stay in power, with control of your money.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Boroughs Pitched as Middle Ground," May 13:</TE>
<TE>   Council members Janice Hahn, Tom LaBonge and Wendy Greuel have
come up with the best solution to the Valley voter's never-ending
woes: create boroughs. New York City's five boroughs offer a wide
variety of educational resources and major recreational attractions.
While Chicago does not have boroughs, everyone refers to North, South
and West Chicago. Secession is risky. Boroughs have been proven and
work in other cities.</TE>

<TE>   Back in the '40s when Ventura Boulevard was the only way to get to
the San Fernando Valley, it seemed reasonable for the Valley to be
part of the city of Los Angeles, but as the years went by and the
Valley burgeoned, it became a daunting task for Los Angeles to keep
the issues and people in hand.</TE>

<LD>Re "Kids or Cash: Why Force Women to Choose?" Opinion, May 12: I can
understand in-house day-care centers, maternity leave, etc. They're
in a company's interest. But why should a company make an exception
for childbearing? What about employees who aren't interested in
childbearing or day care? What's in it for them? Many would say
childbearing--and rearing--is a privilege, not a right.</LD>
<LD>   I think those who ask these things of a company have never
themselves met a payroll. Someone has to pay for the worker's
absence. Would Ann Crittenden, if she ran a small business, willingly
pay for someone's pregnancy and formative-year absence? Should she be
forced to pay? I believe we each have to make choices; it can't be
more simple than that.</LD>

<LD>From May 8 to 10, our class of 18 special-needs high school students
had the "trip of a lifetime," going to Disneyland and California
Adventure. Most of the students had never been out of our local area,
let alone flown in an airplane and stayed at a hotel. The people we
came in contact with on this trip were great. The weather was
perfect. The kids thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Our staff on the
trip made sure of this.</LD>
<LD>   I did make a mistake, however. I left my carry-on bag by the
swimming pool of the hotel where we were staying, after we had
watched the kids enjoying an evening swim. This was right when the
pool closed, and everyone had left the pool area. Inside the bag was
quite a large sum of cash. When the bag was eventually found, in the
hotel lost-and-found, all the cash was gone.</LD>
<LD>   That money was what the kids had earned for the past three years
doing fund-raisers so they could take a trip of this magnitude. They
sold chocolate, pizza, popcorn and granitas. None of the money was
mine personally. It belonged to the kids. It would have been so easy
for the person who stole the money to return everything intact, as
there was identification in the bag.</LD>
<TE>   I hope the person who made the decision that he needed the money
more than our kids will spend it on his children. Take them to
Disneyland a few times or buy them a year pass. If the person has
grandchildren, take them. I'm sure the kids will never be told the
money was stolen from a group of special-needs students. We plan to
continue earning money and hope to have enough to take another group
of our kids to Disneyland in 2005. The actions of one person will not
dampen our enthusiasm for taking less-privileged kids to the
"happiest place on Earth."</TE>

<LD>For those who only cursorily read The Times, the headline "U.S.,
Russia to Cut Nuclear Arms" (May 14) appears to report a diplomatic
breakthrough. It does not. The same weapons were declared cut in 1993
when the START II treaty was signed. And the new treaty fails in what
the START and SALT treaties realized--the permanent destruction of
these thermonuclear nightmares. The prospect of thousands of
ill-secured nukes in Russia doesn't make me feel any safer.</LD>
<LD>   But here's the main question: If Russia is now a friend, an ally
and a trading partner, why still train 1,700 long-range missiles on
it? (President Vladimir V. Putin wanted to reduce that number but the
Pentagon declined.) And why keep these weapons on a high state of
alert when their use could spell life's end on Earth?</LD>
<LD>   We need deeper, permanent cuts, and soon.</LD>

<LD>I would like to make an addition to the list of annoying catch
phrases that have spread among the general population, particularly
in the service industry (letters, May 15). It is the use of "no
problem" as a response to "thank you." Since when is thanking someone
commensurate with asking them if they had a problem with the task for
which they are being shown appreciation (e.g., giving back change,
handing one his purchase, etc.)? I think the next time I'm in that
situation, instead of saying thanks, I'll ask, "Do you have a problem
with this"? I can only imagine the confused stammering that will
result as I walk away.</LD>

<TE>   The most hackneyed word used by TV guests in response to a
question or comment isn't "well," it's "look." This patronizing snub
assumes that the partner in the dialogue is either blind or stupid
and reveals an uppityness that should preclude the host from ever
inviting the snob back on the show.</TE>

<HD>3 Die as Driver Runs Red Light at South-Central
Intersection</HD>
<DH>Accident: Police say the man was speeding when his minivan
struck a pickup truck, killing himself and two others.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A driver who ran a red light was one of three people killed when his
minivan struck a pickup truck carrying two people early Friday at a
South-Central Los Angeles intersection, police said.</LD>
<LD>   German Gonzalez-Lopez, 40, allegedly was driving a Ford Aerostar
above the speed limit north on Avalon Boulevard when he struck a Ford
Ranger as he ran the light at Florence Avenue about 12:50 a.m.,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Harold Devaughn Powers Jr., 26, of Inglewood, and his 23-year-old
girlfriend, Seira Taumateine, died at the scene. Gonzalez-Lopez died
later at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Police said county sheriff's deputies who were in the area
observed Gonzalez-Lopez, a South-Central resident, speeding on Avalon
Boulevard, but were not pursuing him at the time of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Powers recently graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a
sociology degree, his parents said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Elaine, 55, said he and Taumateine, of New Zealand,
were on their way to a 24-hour post office to mail a job application.
He wanted to meet a May 25 application deadline for a county
Probation Department job, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Harold wanted so much out of life," his mother said Friday
afternoon at her Inglewood home.</TE>
<TE>   "He always felt that so much of our people--black people--were in
jail, and he thought that he could do something to help.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be a lawyer someday. He thought maybe if he got a
job at the Probation Department, that could be his start."</TE>
<TE>   Powers' father, Harold, said: "I keep standing here waiting for
his truck to pull up. I need someone to just tell me that this is a
dream, that this is not true."</TE>

<HD>Power Plant Seeks to Remake Huntington Council Into a More
Friendly Audience</HD>
<DH>Politics: AES teams with former lawmaker in an effort to
reduce the size of the council and the way it's elected. Surf City
officials vow to fight the measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energy giant AES is backing an effort to radically reshape Huntington
Beach government, which would give it an edge in a series of battles
with City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   AES has contributed $7,500 to a campaign by former Assemblyman
Scott Baugh that would reduce the City Council to five members from
seven and switch from citywide to district elections. Baugh, who
works for a law firm that represents AES, hopes to place the measure
on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The energy company said it's frustrated with repeated clashes with
the City Council, most notably over a proposal to tax the natural gas
used by the company's Huntington Beach power complex, which voters
rejected in March. Changing the way the council is elected might
prove beneficial to the firm, company officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We were thinking of ways to get around this thing, and this
ballot initiative would perhaps change the whole thought process in
the city," said Ed Blackford, a senior project manager for AES.
District elections "have worked well elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach officials said they will oppose the measure,
calling it an attempt at political payback from a wealthy company
that wants to get its way.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the first company to try to influence local
politics," Mayor Debbie Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be upset if people support this initiative," she said.
"It would really show how out of touch people are with local
government."</TE>
<TE>   AES and the city have had a rocky relationship for several years.
During last year's energy crisis, the state gave AES fast-track
approval to restart two Huntington Beach generators that had been
idle since 1995. But the City Council unsuccessfully fought the move,
saying the generators would cause excessive pollution and noise.</TE>
<TE>   The city then proposed a ballot measure that would require AES to
pay an estimated $2.3-million municipal utility tax for its power
plants. The ballot measure contained the line: "The AES plant is
ugly, pollutes our air, and our ocean." The company sued to strike
the ballot language, which it says was unfair and inaccurate.
Compromise language was eventually worked out, but the measure failed
at the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   Baugh contends that the current council system, in which the seven
members are elected at-large, has favored coastal and environmental
issues at the expense of inland concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The council has long ignored the city's aging sewer system and
other pressing issues, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The result, he said, has been a "billion-dollar infrastructure
problem related to sewers and roads. We're the only city in the
county that can't fix our infrastructure to the tune of a billion
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   His solution would be to have five council members elected by
districts instead of seven elected citywide.</TE>
<TE>   District representation would make council members more
accountable to residents and reduce the cost of running for office,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   It would also ensure that all sections of the city are represented
at City Hall, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are trying to accomplish here is to create a structure
where the City Council is focusing on what their primary duties are:
sewers, roads, water, police and fire," Baugh said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tapping into the feelings of people throughout the
neighborhoods of Huntington Beach who don't like the structure of the
council."</TE>
<TE>   Baugh expects to spend $100,000 on the campaign. Volunteers and
paid workers are circulating petitions at malls and supermarkets to
collect the 16,000 signatures of registered voters needed by June to
qualify for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Cook and other Huntington Beach officials reject Baugh's
criticism, saying they suspect the real motive is to produce a City
Council more friendly to AES and other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "To get that amount of signatures, you have to pay for it, and
where's the money going to come from?" Councilman Ralph Bauer said.
"It's gotta come from someplace."</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles federal judge declared a mistrial Friday in a damage
suit brought by seven professional surfers against Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch over the retailer's use of their photograph in a catalog, a
company lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real accused one of the plaintiffs,
George Downing, of Hawaii, of violating his order not to discuss the
case with the news media, according to Joel McCabe Smith, attorney
for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</LD>
<LD>   Downing's comments appeared Friday in the City of Angles column in
The Times' Southern California Living section.</LD>
<TE>   The surfers contend their photo was used without permission to
promote the sale of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch T-shirts.</TE>

<LD>A 30-year-old North Hills man was shot and killed early Friday
morning in what detectives said may have been a drug deal that went
bad.</LD>
<LD>   Adalberto Moreno was gunned down at 2:15 a.m. in an alley in the
15200 block of Gresham Street, just a few blocks from his home, said
Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Oppelt of the Devonshire Division.</LD>
<LD>   Oppelt said investigators believe drugs were involved because,
among other evidence, which he would not specify, there have been
many problems with narcotics in the area.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Engine damage apparently caused the shaking that prompted the crew of
an Alaska Airlines jet to return to Los Angeles International Airport
earlier this week, the airline said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Evans, a spokesman for the airline, said an examination of
the plane revealed compressor blade damage in one of the MD-80's two
engines.</LD>
<LD>   What caused the damage has not yet been determined, Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   Flight 212 was en route from Los Angeles to Mazatlan, Mexico,
Wednesday with 88 people on board when "a series of shudders" shook
the MD-80 shortly after the plane crossed the border into Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The jetliner returned to LAX without incident, and the passengers
were transferred to other flights. The damaged engine has been
replaced, and the plane has been returned to service, Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline initially had reported erroneously that Flight 212 had
originated in Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>George Cates, 90; Welk's Musical Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Cates, the composer, arranger, conductor and record producer
who began playing tenor sax in various bands and later became musical
director of "The Lawrence Welk Show," has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Cates, musical director of the show for three decades, died May 10
in Los Angeles of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Welk's theme song, "Champagne Time," was composed by Cates, who
expected nothing more than to make a record or two when he met Welk
in 1951.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Cates became an integral part of the Welk professional
family, appearing regularly on the show and later conducting the Welk
band on camera.</TE>
<TE>   With his own orchestra, Cates also hit the top 40 charts with his
1955 recording of "Moonglow" and "Theme From 'Picnic.'"</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Cates collected five gold records for his top-selling
recordings of motion picture themes and other arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Included on such discs were "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" (Que Sera,
Sera), sung by Doris Day in the film "The Man Who Knew Too Much," and
the title song from the movie "Friendly Persuasion."</TE>
<TE>   Cates provided the accompaniment for Steve Allen's successful 1955
piano recording of "Autumn Leaves."</TE>
<TE>   He also arranged music for such recording artists as Bing Crosby,
Danny Kaye, the Andrews Sisters and Teresa Brewer.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cates mirrored Welk in creating straightforward,
danceable music, he occasionally veered from type to good effect, as
with his 1961 Dot Records album "Polynesian Percussion."</TE>
<TE>   It featured highly praised instrumental work by his
brothers-in-law Alvino Rey and Buddy Cole on console guitar and
electric organ, backed by more than 15 unusual percussion
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Cates was encouraged by his parents to
study law. He chose music instead and, after graduating from New York
University, went to work for the comedy team of Olsen and Johnson
arranging music for their revue "Hellzapoppin'."</TE>
<TE>   Cates played tenor saxophone and arranged music for such bands as
those of Henry Busse, Dick Stabile and Russ Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in the Navy, teaching music and
organizing bands for the military.</TE>
<TE>   He settled in Los Angeles after the war, and worked as a producer
for the Coral and Dot record companies until he joined Welk's
organization in the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1973 by the death of his wife of 25 years, Ruth Rubin,
Cates married Miriam Bregman, who survives. He is also survived by
one son and two stepchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles or to the American Heart
Assn.</TE>

<CX>   Cates obituary--An obituary of composer and conductor George Cates on
May 18 identified "Champagne Time" as the theme song of "The Lawrence
Welk Show." The song, a Cates composition, actually was titled
"Champagne Fanfare" and was the show's theme after 1971. "Bubbles in
the Wine," written by Welk, Frank Loesser and Bob Calame, served as
the show's theme from 1955 to 1970.</CX>

<HD>Analyzing the Unchurched</HD>
<DH>Surveys: The proportion of Americans claiming no religion
doubled in the 1990s. Many moderate and liberal Christians became
alienated, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The alienation of moderates and liberals from conservative Christian
political positions is a key reason why the percentage of Americans
who claim no religion doubled during the 1990s, two UC Berkeley
sociologists say.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Hout and Claude Fischer analyzed data from annual public
opinion surveys on religion taken by numerous organizations to reach
their conclusion, published as an article in the American
Sociological Review.</LD>
<LD>   The surveys showed that the proportion of Americans who said they
have "no religious preference" rose from about 7% in 1990 to about
14% by the end of the decade--a significant change after remaining
stable for most of the previous two decades.</LD>
<TE>   However, the increase does not necessarily signal a decrease in
faith, the researchers said. The majority of those who claim no
religious affiliation continue to hold conventional religious
beliefs. Most of the increase in people with no religious preference
in the 1990s was composed of believers, not atheists or agnostics.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the points we're trying to make is that most people who
have no church still are likely to say things like 'God is real.
Heaven and hell are real. Me and my kids will go there when we're
dead,'" Hout said.</TE>
<TE>   Though blacks and Latinos are more likely to claim a religious
affiliation than the wider population, they too saw the same
statistical doubling of people with no religious preference. The only
exception to the trend was people of Jewish ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers' principal data came from analysis of the General
Social Survey, taken since 1972 by the National Opinion Research
Center, a nonprofit group affiliated with the University of Chicago.
That survey included the question: "What is your religious
preference? Is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, some other religion
or no religion?"</TE>
<TE>   Hout and Fischer also analyzed data from the National Election
Study, affiliated with the University of Michigan, which conducts
national surveys of the American electorate in presidential and
mid-term election years.</TE>
<TE>   Hout and Fischer said they considered three possible explanations
for the growing numbers of self-styled believers with no formal
religious affiliation: demographic changes, religious skepticism and
the mixture of politics and religion, the latter of which played an
increasingly influential role in American society during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Religiousness typically follows a family life cycle: People often
leave organized religion when they leave the family they grew up in,
then return about the time they begin a family of their own, Hout and
Fischer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The extended schooling and delayed family formation of more recent
years may have contributed to the growth of the "no preference"
category. Also, recent generations are more likely to have been
raised with no religion; people who became adults after 1973
expressed much less attachment to organized religion than those who
reached adulthood before then, Hout said.</TE>
<TE>   The two sociologists discount suggestions that new-age influences
and America's secular culture weaken ties to organized religion. They
note survey data indicating that piety persists even among people who
claim no religion.</TE>
<TE>   For example, 93% of the people avoiding organized religion
continue to pray on occasion--and one-fifth of those pray daily.
Also, the percentage of people with no religious preference who
agreed with the statement that "God is concerned about people"
actually rose from 22% to 32%.</TE>
<TE>   It was against this background that the researchers decided that
the rise in people with no formal religious affiliation was most
strongly linked to the influence of religion in politics.</TE>
<TE>   An institutionalized connection between religion and political
party is relatively new to the U.S., and one of two key political
shifts in the past half century, Hout and Fischer say. A similar one,
according to Indiana University sociologist Clem Brooks, occurred
with the dramatic liberalizing of attitudes regarding civil rights of
African Americans, women and, more recently, gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   In the civil rights era, race became a determinant for political
party: Liberals and moderates who supported an end to segregation
tended to be Democrats, and conservatives less supportive of federal
legislation found a home among Republicans, Brooks said. Race
polarized politics, and feminism began to have the same effect in the
1980s, reflected in the political "gender gap."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Hout and Fischer article does not address specific
controversies behind the rejection of organized religion, issues such
as abortion and gay and lesbian civil rights are the likely subtext
to the shift, said Fischer, who is editor of Contexts magazine, a new
social sciences publication.</TE>
<TE>   Answers to several survey questions illustrate not just apathy
toward organized religion, but antipathy, Fischer and Hout said.</TE>
<TE>   They cited a 1998 General Survey Study that asks people whether
they agree with three statements: (1) "Looking around the world,
religions bring more conflict than peace; (2) People with very strong
religious belief are often too intolerant of others; and (3) the U.S.
would be a better country if religion had less influence." Those with
no religious preference were more than twice as likely as others to
agree with the items.</TE>
<TE>   These people leaving organized religion, Hout said, "is the story
of somebody who is of slightly below-average level of devotion who
goes from Holyville to Secularville and raises the level of belief in
both places. They leave behind the most devout and raise the level of
spirituality in the new group."</TE>
<TE>   Even those who do claim a specific religion express
dissatisfaction with churches and church leaders. Fewer than half of
those surveyed expressed a "great deal" of confidence in church
leaders and their organizations, and that number dropped to about 10%
among those with no religious preference.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of faith in religious leaders, Hout and Fischer point
out, does not take into account the current molestation scandal
engulfing the Catholic Church and its possible long-term effects.
Although one of the most dramatic fall-offs in the last generation
was largely among Catholics (church attendance sagged from 1950 to
1970) the root cause then was disaffection with the Vatican. It is
too early to tell what if any effect the current scandals will have,
but Hout doubts that there will be much. "The scandal for Catholics
is in the cover-up, not the crime. The crime is something they've
been aware of for 15 years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer also cautions against inferring too much spiritual
sophistication from the number of people who believe in God but do
not affiliate with a religion. Though some may have developed
philosophies by which they live, others in the "no religious
preference" category may simply not know enough about religion to
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these people are unsophisticated about the differences
between Catholics and Protestants ... and maybe say, 'Oh, to heck
with it,'" Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Sociologists have long taken exception to the notion that the U.S.
was founded with deeply religious sensibilities. "There were an awful
lot of settlers and farmers in Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York
who had very little interest in the practice of religion," Hout said.
"They weren't anti-religion, but they weren't interested. Levels of
interest on the American frontier were particularly low."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Chaves, a University of Arizona sociologist, sees American
religiousness as historically broad, rather than deep. An independent
streak has always run through it, with Americans being less apt to
strictly adhere to doctrine or submit to firm leadership. If a
generalized belief in God has not diminished over the years, the
nature of that belief has altered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in 1963, two-thirds of Americans said the Bible is
the actual word of God, to be taken literally. Today fewer than
one-third say that. Also, though 80% say the Bible is the inspired
word of God, only about half can name its first book and only a third
know who gave the Sermon on the Mount.</TE>
<TE>   Chaves cautions against viewing matters of faith through an
intellectual lens. "It is a mistake to think of participation in
religion as a cognitive exercise," he said. "It's an exercise in
identity and cultural expression and socializing that has a cognitive
component."</TE>

<HD>San Bernardino Wins $6.3-Million Award</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Three former county officials settle charges they
defrauded the public in kickback scheme. Taxpayers lost at least $20
million on bad deals, investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three central figures in a wave of corruption that plagued San
Bernardino County, including the former top bureaucrat at the crux of
the scandal, have reached a $6.3-million settlement of allegations
that they defrauded the public, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement is the latest step in a campaign to recoup millions
of dollars lost over the past decade to fraud, kickbacks and
back-room deals--scams that were once considered part of doing
business in San Bernardino County. Just as important, perhaps, the
county hopes to recapture the public's trust.</LD>
<LD>   Friday, county officials said that three former officeholders in
the county--ex-Investment Officer Sol Levin, ex-Treasurer Tom
O'Donnell and ex-Chief Administrative Officer James Hlawek--have
settled a lawsuit that alleged a far-reaching kickback scheme.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys representing the three men, who have previously pleaded
guilty to related criminal charges that they accepted improper gifts
in exchange for favorable treatment, did not return phone calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, brought by the county in August 2000, charged that
the three men signed off on a scheme that sank millions of tax
dollars into risky investments.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contended that the investments brought inflated
commissions to brokers working for two financial companies, including
the securities and investment giant Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   From 1992 to 1998, Salomon Smith Barney and another financial
group, the New England Adjustable Rate Government Fund, were given
contracts to invest more than $7.5 billion in public funds. One
broker, authorities say, was making $12,000 a month from his San
Bernardino County contract alone.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, investigators charge, businessmen lavished gifts on
O'Donnell, Levin and Hlawek. One broker gave Levin, O'Donnell and
their wives an all-expenses-paid trip to Costa Rica in 1995, the
lawsuit charges. Additionally, the suit asserts that the three men
were given free vacations in France and Greece as well as family
outings at Sea World and Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   County officials have estimated that taxpayers lost at least $20
million on the investments. Salomon Smith Barney reached a deal in
February that settled its part of the lawsuit for $7.75 million,
which covered its broker, Peter Morrison. The investment firm that
now owns the New England fund settled the case for $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   The deals, said San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert, "were
intended more to produce commissions for Mr. Morrison than they were
to provide the investment pool with the maximum return."</TE>
<TE>   "And everyone's obligation here was to provide the investment pool
with the maximum return," Wert said. "There were commissions paid
that the county was not obligated to pay. These gentlemen had them
paid nonetheless."</TE>
<TE>   Even as county officials were touting Friday's deal as another
step in their campaign to recover from corruption--a reform effort
that has already recovered more than $15 million--they acknowledged
the settlement won't likely bring cash to the county coffers anytime
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the three men have no assets beyond those that are
exempt from legal action--their retirement earnings and their homes.
The settlement, officials said, will effectively be a lien on any
future earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is just not comfortable counting this as money in the
bank," Wert said. "It's going to take some work to get it."</TE>
<TE>   County officials, who have spent two years and $3.5 million in
legal fees on their reform effort, decided that it wasn't worth
continuing to pay lawyers to push the case if there wasn't any money
available from the three men. "This is the best possible resolution
for the taxpayers of San Bernardino County," said Board of
Supervisors Chairman Fred Aguiar. "The defendants have acknowledged
their crimes, the taxpayers won't have to incur any further legal
expenses and the county has a legal right to collect the judgments."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit that led to Friday's settlements grows out of a series
of kickback and bribery scandals in the county. The county also filed
a lawsuit in June 2000 against 22 former county officials and
businessmen in connection with the corruption probe, resulting in
several separate settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Criminal cases also have been brought against several former
officials and businessmen. O'Donnell, Levin and Hlawek have all
pleaded guilty in criminal cases related to the kickback scandals.
Last year, Levin and O'Donnell were sentenced to spend a year and a
day in halfway houses. Hlawek, who has admitted receiving cash or
in-kind payments worth as much as $70,000 in the mid-1990s, has
pleaded guilty to corruption-related charges and is expected to be
sentenced later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, in a loosely related case, federal prosecutors
brought a round of charges against San Bernardino County Supervisor
Jerry Eaves and an Orange County businessman accused in a bribery
scheme that led to the construction of giant billboards at the
intersection of Interstates 10 and 215.</TE>
<TE>   Eaves, his relatives and his aides accepted gifts, including trips
to the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, from the businessman, prosecutors
charge. He has attributed the charges to sloppy bookkeeping, not
criminal acts.</TE>

<HD>Cal State Campus Halfway to Goal</HD>
<DH>Education: Aiming for 750 students in its first year,
Channel Islands has accepted 372 applicants. An expanded recruiting
effort has begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months before the official opening of Cal State Channel
Islands, Ventura County's first four-year public college has admitted
half the students it needs to fill its inaugural classes and is
ramping up efforts to attract more.</LD>
<LD>   Because not all the students who are admitted will ultimately
attend the school, CSUCI is actually further from meeting its
enrollment target than the number of acceptance letters suggests, an
official said. If Channel Islands enrolls 70% of the students it
admits, a figure that is fairly typical for a Cal State campus, that
means it has so far filled only about 260 of the available slots,
said Greg Sawyer, vice president for student affairs.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no doubt that we are not where we want to be at this
point," said Sawyer, who likened the situation to a track meet. "The
runner to watch isn't the first one to get the baton, but the one who
closes the distance during the last leg of the race."</LD>
<TE>   Although CSUCI is not scheduled to welcome its first freshmen
until fall 2003, 372 upper-division students--the vast majority of
them transfers from the county's three community colleges--have been
accepted for next term. The new university is set up to accommodate
750 students this fall, said Linda MacMichael, director of admissions
and records.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sawyer, Channel Islands faculty and staff members
will hold recruitment drives at the community colleges and local
shopping malls. The university is also running ads in movie theaters
throughout Ventura and Santa Barbara counties to remind prospective
enrollees that the campus is getting off the ground, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an institution, we are hitting it and we are hitting it hard,"
he said. "We are trying to sell a vision, and sometimes it's hard to
sell a new idea."</TE>
<TE>   University officials also will open a phone bank Monday in an
effort to retain students who have expressed interest in CSUCI. Both
students who have already been admitted and another 360 or so who
applied but are missing transcripts or other vital information will
be called and given orientation information and offers of help,
Sawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the phone center and the recruitment drives could help the
university reel in some eligible students who may be assuming it is
too late to apply for the fall. The application deadline has already
passed for some other Cal State campuses, including Cal State
Northridge and Cal State Long Beach, and Channel Islands has asked
those schools to refer any disappointed callers its way.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 97% of the students who have been accepted by Channel
Islands would be transfers from community colleges: about 175 from
Ventura College, about 125 from Moorpark College and about 60 from
Oxnard College, MacMichael said.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia Menchaca, who directs the transfer center at Oxnard
College, said the new university may be having trouble attracting
students because it is still offering only eight majors plus a
teaching credential program. Menchaca said she recently counseled a
student who was interested in attending Channel Islands because it
was close to home, but decided against it because the school will not
initially offer an accounting program.</TE>
<TE>   "I think students are excited they are going to have a new campus
in their backyard, but it may not be meeting their needs right now,"
she said. "It's just going to take some time for our new state campus
to blossom."</TE>
<TE>   Asneth Cota, director of Ventura College's transfer center, said
outreach events such as an "instant admissions day" that Channel
Islands plans to host at Ventura College on May 28 could pay off.
"Some of these kids may have applied elsewhere and gotten turned
down, so we'll be reaching them at a very good time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer said that until recently Channel Islands did not have the
staff to do extensive outreach. He dismissed the notion that the new
university is getting a late start in its recruitment efforts. The
kind of students Channel Islands hopes to attract--community college
transfers and nontraditional students such as working mothers--often
do not decide on the next step in their academic careers until late
spring or summer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The very traditional way of recruiting, where everyone puts on
the gas real quick at the beginning of the year, doesn't work when
students are making those kinds of decisions later on," he said,
adding that there is no possibility that classes will be reduced. "If
we maintain the kind of progress we have had over the last two weeks,
we will be at our numbers [by the fall] or very, very close."</TE>
<TE>   The experience of Cal State Monterey Bay, which opened in 1995,
could be useful in gauging what will happen to Channel Islands.
During its first semester in operation, Monterey Bay had an
enrollment of 654. By its second year, it enrolled 1,256 students.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the first crop of Channel Islands students will
remain outnumbered on their 670-acre campus by about 1,500 Cal State
Northridge students who are attending CSUN's Ventura County satellite
school. That situation is expected to change in the next few years as
Northridge phases out its course offerings, said Dan Wakelee,
associate director of admissions at CSUN's Channel Islands site.</TE>
<TE>   For the fall semester, for example, CSUN stopped admitting new
students in its most popular majors--business, liberal studies and
teaching credential programs--since Channel Islands will be offering
them. In all, Northridge expects to admit about 140 to 150 new
students to its Channel Islands satellite in the fall, Wakelee said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Channel Islands is using its low enrollment as a
marketing tool. In a message to prospective students on its Web site
(www.csuci.edu), the school is touted as feeling "like a private
university, with smaller class sizes and accessible faculty."</TE>

<HD>Spain Arrests Fugitive in Molestation Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Former Internet company founder Marc Collins-Rector
fled the U.S. in 2000 amid charges of abusing young employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities in Spain arrested the founder of the once-hot Internet
start-up Digital Entertainment Network on Thursday, capping a
21-month international hunt for the accused child molester.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Collins-Rector fled the U.S. in 2000 amid allegations that he
pursued teenage employees at the Santa Monica company, which was
backed by NBC, Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. The company later
filed for bankruptcy liquidation after burning through more than $60
million in two years.</LD>
<LD>   "We're obviously happy that he's been arrested," said Michael
Drewniak, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J.
Prosecutors in that office secretly indicted Collins-Rector in August
2000, and that indictment was unsealed for the international arrest
warrant used to hold him.</LD>
<TE>   Collins-Rector was apprehended in the Spanish beach resort of
Marbella and U.S. officials are seeking his extradition. Drewniak
said he didn't know whether Collins-Rector had a lawyer or when a
hearing will be held.Ronald Palmieri, a civil lawyer for
Collins-Rector, said he hadn't spoken to his client in more than a
year. "I am shocked at the indictment and the arrest," Palmieri said.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment accuses Collins-Rector of five counts of
transporting a minor across state lines for illegal sexual activity.
The maximum penalty for each count is 15 years in prison; such
sentences usually are served concurrently.</TE>
<TE>   The victim in the case was a 13-year-old boy who worked from his
New Jersey home for Concentric Networks, an Internet service provider
that Collins-Rector founded and later sold, making millions before
moving to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The boy eventually told his parents that Collins-Rector had
seduced him, and a tape recording was made of a conversation between
the boy and Collins-Rector, sources said. The boy sued, and
Collins-Rector was served with the legal papers just before the
company's planned stock offering in the fall of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Collins-Rector and his two housemates left the company and it was
regrouping two years ago when other teenage employees told The Times
that they had been pursued as well. An article on the company's
history reinvigorated the FBI probe and prompted the three company
officials to leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   After the company filed for bankruptcy, still more minors came
forward, suing Collins-Rector, company directors and others over
alleged abuse. The directors said they hadn't known what was
happening.</TE>
<TE>   The victim in the New Jersey case, who is 22, said Friday that he
was glad that his tape-recorded conversation helped prosecutors win
the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "It appeared that the activity and the behavior continued and got
much worse. This will prevent anyone else from having to go through
this," said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he had been afraid to come forward after he realized
that what had been happening was wrong. "Any fear that I had along
the way was always unfounded. Everybody has been totally supportive,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many workers at the company said they had suspicions about
then-Chairman Collins-Rector and discussed them internally before the
New Jersey lawsuit. "There was something not right," a former
executive said Friday. "There were too many little boys. People were
willing to look the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Welch, a Los Angeles writer who briefly consulted for the
company, said its collapse "would have been one of the textbook
classic dot-com flameouts even without this. It was a bad idea, at a
bad time, done by bad people.... I wouldn't say there was an
atmosphere of criminal behavior, you just felt the decadence."</TE>
<TE>   Collins-Rector, who is in his early 40s, shared a palatial Encino
estate with longtime partner Chad Shackley, 24, and with Brock
Pierce, a child Disney movie star who moved in when he was 17 and was
paid a $250,000 salary by the company. Shackley and Pierce were
executive vice presidents of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The three were described as co-founders of the company, which
filmed short episodes on a number of teenage themes for playback over
the Internet and at one time boasted more than 300 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The company secured big advertisers but failed to generate a
significant audience or keep its expenses in check. The company's
audience remained limited, in part because of the lack of high-speed
Internet connections needed to stream entertainment videos.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company was at the forefront of developing
entertainment for the Internet, its competitors were soon drawing
greater traffic while paying little or nothing for video content.</TE>
<TE>   It spent freely on its productions and facilities and paid
salaries that exceeded $1 million, unusually high figures for a
start-up. In June 1999, the company was burning up $3 million a month
when it had no revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have filed lawsuits are four former employees,
including one hired and allegedly abused before the age of 16 and
another hired at 15 and abused at 16.</TE>
<TE>   A suit by one of the teenagers was settled, but its terms were not
disclosed. A suit filed by three of the teenagers resulted in a
default judgment of $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The suits accused Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce of rape,
assault and death threats. Shackley and Pierce have not been charged
criminally.</TE>

the bombing but Bari died of breast cancer in 1997.</CP>

<HD>Santa Barbara Paper Picks Editor From S.F.</HD>
<DH>Journalism: Chronicle veteran Jerry Roberts takes the helm
at News-Press.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Barbara News-Press named a new executive editor Friday,
choosing respected journalist Jerry Roberts to take charge of the
newsroom at the 146-year-old daily.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of Roberts, 53, who resigned as managing editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle in February, was announced to the staff
in a meeting Friday morning.</LD>
<LD>   "As a locally owned and operated newspaper, everyone at the Santa
Barbara News-Press has a personal and community stake in journalistic
excellence," said Joseph L. Cole, the publisher.</LD>
<TE>   "We're therefore delighted that a journalist of Jerry Roberts'
caliber and experience is joining the News-Press to lead our
newsroom."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts worked at the Chronicle, San Francisco's leading
newspaper, for 25 years. He previously served as political editor,
editorial page editor and city editor. During his five years as
managing editor, said Cole, the paper expanded local news and
business coverage and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I am delighted and honored to have the opportunity to lead the
talented editorial staff of a terrific, independent newspaper,"
Roberts said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Central Coast is a region of extraordinary natural beauty,
with some of the most sophisticated and intelligent readers in the
nation, and a host of fascinating environmental, economic, political
and social issues. For a newspaperman, it doesn't get much better
than that."</TE>
<TE>   The position had been vacant since the departure of Tom Bolton
nearly a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 44,000-circulation News-Press is a fraction of the size of the
Chronicle, as is its newsroom of 55. But the News-Press has developed
a solid reputation for local news reporting, winning a Pulitzer in
1962 for editorials exposing the activities of the John Birch
Society. The paper was purchased from the New York Times Co. 19
months ago by local billionaire Wendy McCaw's Ampersand Publishing.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts left the Chronicle after its purchase by the Hearst Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a graduate of Harvard University, is the author of a
biography of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, "Never Let Them See You
Cry."</TE>

<HD>El Segundo Wants In on El Toro Fight</HD>
<DH>Land use: The city, which lobbied heavily for an airport at
the base, is considering employing law firm to bolster suit over
Measure W.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Segundo is considering entering the legal fight over the Orange
County ballot measure that scuttled plans for an airport at the
closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The city, which had lobbied for an El Toro regional airport to
siphon air traffic from Los Angeles International Airport, would
spend $50,000 to have the San Francisco law firm of Shute, Mihaly &amp;
Weinberger represent its position in the fight over Measure W, which
passed overwhelmingly in March. The ballot initiative zoned the base
for parks and compatible uses.</LD>
<LD>   Although El Segundo wouldn't formally join the lawsuit, filed by
two pro-airport groups in Orange County, city officials want to
ensure that attorneys arguing against Measure W understand their
position, Mayor Mike Gordon said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a regional issue that has tremendous ... implications
with regard to aviation and the impacts on communities around [Los
Angeles International] and Ontario [airports]," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an Assembly committee met Friday in Santa Ana to
discuss redevelopment of the 4,700-acre El Toro base in the wake of
the March vote. A bill signed in 1999 allows the state to monitor
plans for closed bases.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, 29 California bases have closed, resulting in
a loss of $9 billion to the state's economy and 100,000 jobs, state
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the hearing, organized by Assemblyman Lou Correa
(D-Anaheim), touched on plans for about 800 houses on the northern
portion of El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine, which wants to annex the land, proposes turning over the
homes to UC Irvine for faculty housing.</TE>
<TE>   University spokeswoman Liz Toomey said the houses would be sold at
affordable prices to faculty and staff at UC Irvine and Cal State
Fullerton, which wants to build a satellite campus at El Toro. UCI is
applying to buy the property at "favorable terms" through the federal
Department of Education, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Toomey acknowledged on questioning from Assemblywoman Gloria
Negrete-McLeod that restricting the sale of the housing to faculty
and university workers wouldn't address Orange County's overall lack
of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the university's need, but if you use your
affordable housing with only one [group], what's left for anyone
else?" asked Negrete-McLeod, a Democrat from Chino.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Supervisor Chuck Smith said he wants the houses
available to anyone whose income qualifies.</TE>
<TE>   Art Montez, a longtime activist with the League of United Latin
American Citizens, echoed Smith's request, adding that oil, mineral
and water rights on the property should be conveyed to a public trust
to develop housing and a 250-acre site for educational training for
working families.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran outlined the city's hopes for the base,
acknowledging that the Navy has announced it will sell the property
to the highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants to develop sports fields, golf courses and riparian
waterways through the center of the base and hopes to reach a deal
for the property.</TE>
<TE>   One speaker asked state officials to urge the Marines to relocate
the San Diego Recruit Depot to El Toro, a proposal still under
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   The county's retired and active military members also support
reopening a commissary at the base, which closed in 1999, and
creating a national cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to see the Marines back in Orange County," Correa
said.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro's fate has been tussled over for nine years, ever since
the base was targeted for closure.</TE>
<TE>   The local groups suing over Measure W contend that the fate of
surplus federal property is an issue beyond the control of local
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit claims that Measure W usurped the sole authority of
the Board of Supervisors to plan base reuse under federal and state
law.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by the Airport
Working Group, Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, the city of Garden
Grove and the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, a coalition
of 15 North County cities.</TE>
<TE>   The suit will be defended by the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority,
a 10-city coalition opposed to a new airport.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm that El Segundo is considering hiring has worked for
decades with Newport Beach on noise and size restrictions at John
Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach City Atty. Bob Burnham said he has no immediate
concerns about the firm doing work for El Segundo, though he is
unhappy with comments made by Gordon indicating that John Wayne
Airport should be expanded if El Toro isn't built.</TE>
<TE>   Should the expansion of John Wayne Airport become El Segundo's
official position, one of the two cities would have to find another
law firm, Burnham said Friday.</TE>

<HD>Working Toward Greater Unity</HD>
<DH>Ecumenism: Catholics, evangelical and mainline Protestants
look to form broad Christian group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN ECKSTROM</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the modern ecumenical movement took root 50 years ago, the
two largest Christian groups in the United States--Roman Catholics
and evangelical Protestants--have been missing from the table.</LD>
<LD>   That may change after a recent high-level meeting in Chicago at
which Catholic, evangelical and mainline Protestant leaders formed
what is being called Christian Churches Together in the USA and
agreed to work for greater unity among major U.S. Christian churches.</LD>
<LD>   The 23 groups represented ranged from the Episcopalians and United
Church of Christ on the theological left, to the Roman Catholics and
the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the center, to the
Salvation Army and the Korean Presbyterian Church on the right.</LD>
<TE>   "We celebrate the unique traditions, gifts and charisms of our
respective faith communities," said a joint statement adopted at last
month's meeting. "We also acknowledge that when our differences
create unnecessary divisions, our witness to the Gospel of Jesus
Christ is distorted."</TE>
<TE>   If the 23 groups can agree to establish a new organization, it
will signal a seismic shift in American church relations. Most
leaders said a "new something" could emerge within five years,
perhaps sooner.</TE>
<TE>   For years, evangelicals and Catholics have been suspicious of the
liberal-leaning National Council of Churches, and groups belonging to
the council have felt their influence to be diminished by the growing
clout of Catholics and evangelicals.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bob Edgar, the council's general secretary, began the
discussions two years ago and made it clear that he was willing to
sacrifice the venerable council in order to attract Catholics and
evangelicals to a bigger ecumenical table. An initial meeting was
held last September in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   At the Chicago meeting, which was intentionally kept quiet, Edgar
said all sides agreed that the time had come to bury past grudges and
work together on common issues of concern, such as poverty, saving
the environment and fighting pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Russians and the Americans can live and work together in
outer space, why can't Christians find a way to work together down
here?" Edgar asked.</TE>
<TE>   Under the loose framework of an initial mission statement, the new
body would be bound by traditional Christian beliefs in the Trinity,
salvation through Jesus Christ, "common prayer, speaking to society
with a common voice" and "promoting the common good of society."</TE>
<TE>   Previous attempts to speak with a common voice, however, have been
problematic. In 2000, a planned statement on marriage involving the
National Council of Churches, Southern Baptist Convention, Catholic
bishops and the National Assn. of Evangelicals was shelved when Edgar
withdrew his support for fear that it could be used against gays and
lesbians. This time, he said, the groups are focusing on areas of
agreement, not disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Tod Brown of the Diocese of Orange and the lead ecumenical
liaison for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the need
for a wider ecumenical table is clear: "There is no broad-based
Christian churches voice in this country, and I think we [Catholics]
have our voice, and the [National Council of Churches] has a voice,
and sometimes there are some evangelical voices. But there isn't any
gathering that represents most or all of those groups."</TE>
<TE>   With Brown's and Baltimore Cardinal William Keeler's
participation, the Catholics are clearly on board. The evangelicals,
however, may be harder fish to catch.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner John Busby, the national commander for the Salvation
Army, is a negotiator trying to bring the traditionally conservative
evangelicals on board.</TE>
<TE>   He said initial reactions have been positive, although some groups
"certainly have reservations."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers also hope to include fast-growing Pentecostal churches
and "parachurch" ministries such as Habitat for Humanity and umbrella
groups representing independent megachurches.</TE>
<TE>   Busby said everything in the new organization is tentative, in an
effort to make it accessible to other churches that have not signed
on yet. "The safest thing for us to do," he said, "is take it one
meeting at a time and look at concerns as new people join us, and try
to deal with those one at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders, however, are decidedly optimistic and feel a sense
of momentum.</TE>

<HD>News About Fine Putting Simon on the Defensive</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. was thrown on the
defensive Friday over a $10,000 fine assessed against his family's
municipal bond firm as part of a New Jersey pay-to-play scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The fine, levied by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, grew
out of the Simon firm's 1991 dealings with Armacon Securities Inc., a
company at the center of the kickback scam.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to questions about the fine, the candidate said he was
part owner of the family's bond firm but played no role in its
management.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosure of the NASD action came on the same day that Simon
unveiled a package of ethics proposals to clean up state government
by strengthening laws against conflicts of interest and other abuses
by public officials and businesses seeking government work.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals were part of Simon's effort to capitalize on a rash
of new disclosures about the aggressive fund-raising practices of
Gov. Gray Davis. Simon accused the Democratic incumbent of fostering
a "pay-to-play governing culture."</TE>
<TE>   "The example that Gov. Davis has set has made it clear to me that
secrecy in government has got to stop," Simon told a convention of
newspaper editors in Anaheim. "Let the sunshine of truth pierce the
dark clouds of corruption, conflict and denial."</TE>
<TE>   But in a speech to the same crowd a few hours later, the governor
raised new questions about Simon's ethics, saying William E. Simon &amp;
Sons Municipal Securities Inc. had been fined and censured for
breaking securities rules. The now-defunct firm, named after the
candidate's father, was owned by the Simon family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the kettle calling the pot black, criticizing my
activities," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his aides sought to minimize the significance of the
fines, saying they involved only "paperwork" violations.</TE>
<TE>   But disclosure of the Simon firm's troubles with securities
regulators still threatened to undermine the Republican candidate's
recent onslaught of attacks on the governor's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, the main issue is the $10,000 fine, disclosed Friday by
the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   The violations occurred in 1991. At the time, the Simon firm was
new to the fiercely competitive municipal bond business and was
wooing elected officials in New Jersey for the opportunity to sell
public debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street giants and smaller local brokers already on the
scene had long been major campaign donors to many of the officials,
including then-Gov. Jim Florio.</TE>
<TE>   The central figure in the pay-to-play bond scandal--which led to
sharp restrictions on campaign donations by bond brokers--was
Florio's chief of staff, Joseph Salema. He pleaded guilty to
securities fraud in 1995 for concealing bond kickbacks that were
unrelated to the Simon firm.</TE>
<TE>   NASD records show that the Simon firm in 1991 paid a $10,000 fee
to Armacon Securities, a company partly owned by Salema. The Simon
firm paid the fee "in the hope of developing a business relationship
with Armacon," the records say.</TE>
<TE>   But the Simon firm inaccurately recorded the payment as a
"management fee" for Armacon's work on an Old Bridge Township bond
issue. In fact, Armacon "did not provide management services or other
services in connection with the Old Bridge transaction," according to
a settlement statement approved by the NASD and the Simon firm.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD found that the Simon firm had violated the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act by "inaccurately" reporting the nature of its
payment to Armacon. The firm agreed to be censured and pay the
$10,000 fine, but would neither admit nor deny the alleged
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Schotz, head of Santa Monica investment bank Saybrook Capital,
said there remain unanswered questions about the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't write a check to a company like Armacon for $10,000 and
not have the expectation of something coming back," said Schotz, who
has experience in the municipal bond field.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his campaign aides struggled to explain the matter
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech to the newspaper editors at a Disneyland hotel,
Simon walked briskly past television and newspaper reporters posing
questions about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not involved with that," he said as he ducked into the back
seat of a black sport utility vehicle with tinted windows.</TE>
<TE>   Simon referred questions to an aide, Jeff Flint.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff will give you all the facts, " Simon told reporters before
Flint slammed the car door. "See you later."</TE>
<TE>   Flint, though, could not explain why the Simon firm paid $10,000
to a company owned by a top aide to New Jersey's governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand the municipal bond business, so I can't tell
you exactly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At a campaign stop a few hours later in Lakeview Terrace, Simon
was confronted with more questions about the Armacon payment after
touring the Phoenix Academy with U.S. drug czar John Walters.</TE>
<TE>   Simon declined to explain why his family's firm had paid Armacon.
He said that misreporting the payment was simply a technical error
and that he was not responsible. He added that he never met Salema,
and that the NASD never questioned him during its investigation of
the payment to Armacon.</TE>
<TE>   "That instance was merely a books and records violation," Simon
said. "I was not part of the firm. I was a shareholder in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "They took a look at it, and there was no conclusion it was pay to
play," he said. "We'll see if they conclude the same thing of Gray
Davis."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis also questioned donations by Simon and
executives of his firm to Democrats in a position to steer public
business to them. Simon is a conservative Republican, Davis said, but
gave money to California state Treasurer Phil Angelides, former
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and New York state Comptroller Carl
McCall--all Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I learned a long time ago: Don't criticize someone else
for something that you may be doing yourself," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon later responded that he made the contributions at friends'
requests. He said his $250 contribution to Gray Davis' reelection
campaign came under similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Although Simon spent much of his day on the defensive over the
fine, Davis too continued struggling with the controversy over his
fund-raising. He acknowledged that he has canceled fund-raisers over
the last week to avoid the appearance of wrongdoing. He declined to
provide details.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of the excess of caution, we decided to cancel a couple of
events, only because of a perception problem, not because there was
any impropriety involved," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hit-Run Kills 'Our Gang' Child Actor</HD>
<DH>Accident: Darwood Smith, 72, who played Waldo, left acting
for preaching as a teenager.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darwood Kenneth Smith, who played Waldo in the "Our Gang" series, was
killed by a hit-and-run driver Wednesday morning as he was taking a
stroll through his Riverside neighborhood, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 72, a part-time pastor at La Sierra University Seventh-day
Adventist Church, was walking along Arlington Avenue when a small,
tan truck drove onto the sidewalk and hit him. Smith was taken to
Riverside Community Hospital, where he died of head injuries, said
Riverside County coroner's officials. No arrests have been made.</LD>
<LD>   As a child actor, Smith was known as Darwood Kaye. He appeared in
21 of the "Our Gang" comedies from the age of 7 to 11. Fans of the
series will remember Waldo as the skinny boy with glasses who rivaled
Alfalfa for Darla's affections.</LD>
<TE>   "'Priggish' is a good adjective to describe Waldo," said film
critic and historian Leonard Maltin, co-author of "The Little
Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang." "He was very good at that
part because you believed him."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was not a member of the original 1922 cast, but the shorts
he appeared in have become classics, Maltin said.</TE>
<TE>   The series is a "genuine phenomenon in both show-biz history and I
think pop culture in our country," Maltin said. "There aren't many
films of the 1930s that still capture children of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   While some of the "Our Gang" cast members grew up to have troubled
adulthoods--most recently Robert Blake--Smith found great success and
accomplishment after he left the series, Maltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith quit acting in his teens, converted to the Seventh-day
Adventist faith and began a long career in the ministry. He and his
family spent 17 years as missionaries in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   After he returned to the United States, he was a pastor at
churches throughout California. He retired in 1995 but worked
part-time at La Sierra University Seventh-day Adventist Church
alongside his son, senior pastor Dan Smith, 49. Smith's four sons are
pastors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously people of faith and we're thankful for ... the
years that we had him," Smith said. "It's really hard to imagine not
working side by side with him anymore. It's not much fun this way,
but we'll see him again."</TE>

<HD>L.A. County Plan Would Lay Off More Than 5,000 Health
Workers</HD>
<DH>Budget: State, federal cuts force department to cut staff.
Two or more hospitals could close.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRET THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a deficit expected to reach $688 million in three years, the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services next month will
recommend laying off more than 5,000 employees, director Dr. Thomas
Garthwaite said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with state and federal cutbacks, the department must
eliminate at least that many jobs and possibly even double the number
within several years, spokesman John Wallace said.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs would begin in October and would hit the "direct
patient care staff, administrative care staff, probably the whole
gamut of the work force," Wallace said. The department has 22,000
employees.</LD>
<TE>   The plan will be presented to the county Board of Supervisors on
June 18, and Garthwaite will ask that the supervisors begin
implementing his proposal in October, Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see any alternatives than to engage in this
process," said Supervisor Gloria Molina's chief of staff, Miguel
Santana. "If we don't make the cuts now, they will be larger later."</TE>
<TE>   It is still early in the county's budget process, and numbers
floated at this stage have a tendency to change later. But officials
are preparing to do without additional funds from the state and
federal governments that would be needed to avoid the layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In a trip to Washington last week, supervisors tried to persuade
Congress and Bush administration officials to delay or reduce certain
funding cuts. But they were told "there is no money" in the federal
budget, said David E. Janssen, the county's chief administrative
officer.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the county's largest union, learning of the layoff
proposals late Friday, said the numbers were worse than he had
imagined, and that officials weren't doing enough to secure money
from state and federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be an intensive effort to win additional funding,"
said Mark Tarnawsky, a spokesman for Service Employees International
Union Local 660.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed layoffs are "simply an exercise in cutting services,
vital services, rather than making an aggressive all-fronts effort to
fund services," Tarnawsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Santana, who joined Molina on her trip to Washington, said "the
prospects do not look good in funding from the state and federal
government.... Mr. Garthwaite is doing the right thing by putting
together a plan instead of pretending there is a savior."</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with health officials Friday, Garthwaite acknowledged
that the cuts mean his department will not meet the needs of the
county's 10 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't think anyone in this room would say we are meeting
those needs even today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other aspects of Garthwaite's proposal to the supervisors include:</TE>
<TE>   * The complete or partial closure of at least two hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   * Major changes at all remaining hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   * Major reductions in trauma and emergency care capacity.</TE>
<TE>   * A lower level of affiliation with medical schools in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Though some details of the proposal are still in flux, officials
are considering converting High Desert Hospital in the Antelope
Valley and possibly one more hospital into outpatient facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Another option is privatizing the county's Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center, a rehabilitation center in Downey, so that it would
become self-supporting.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard OKs 24 Apartments for Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>Housing: Project is the first in city earmarked for field
laborers. More may follow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oxnard Planning Commission has approved construction of a 24-unit
apartment complex for low-income farm workers, a project backers say
will help revitalize downtown while housing the city's poorest
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. was approved to build the two-
and three-story townhouses on the northwest corner of Meta and 6th
streets in the central business district. Construction on the
$5.7-million project could begin in about six months, Jesse Ornelas,
Cabrillo's senior project manager, said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first project with preference given to farm workers
to be built in Oxnard," Oxnard housing director Sal Gonzales said.</LD>
<TE>   The apartments, which did not need City Council approval, will be
built on a vacant lot that was earmarked for affordable housing by
the city in 1995, Gonzales said. The city sold the 1.15-acre site to
Cabrillo for $295,000, Ornelas said.</TE>
<TE>   The complex is designed for families and will include 18
three-bedroom units and six four-bedroom units. Rents will range from
$304 to $980, with some subsidies available from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Ornelas said. The amount of subsidies will vary for
each family, with none paying more than 30% of their income on rent,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments will include frontyards, a courtyard, a children's
play area and a two-car garage per unit, as well as guest parking on
the street. Cabrillo is financing nearly $2 million of the
construction through grants and loans from city, state and federal
agencies and plans to apply for the remaining funds from the
California Equity Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Planning commissioners on Thursday questioned the safety of the
area, citing a nearby pool hall and an alley known to be a site for
drug deals. But overwhelming community and city support for the
housing project helped ease fears, Planning Commissioner Michael
Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Voicing support for the project were farm workers, Oxnard police
representatives, county Supervisor John Flynn, Oxnard residents and
community organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a billion-dollar industry and we need to provide housing
for our farm workers," said Maricela Morales, representing the
nonprofit housing group Central Coast Alliance United for a
Sustainable Economy.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments also fit into the city's downtown master plan,
which calls for increased affordable housing as well as commercial
development, Curtis Cannon, community development director, said.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments may soon be followed by other Cabrillo developments
that target farm workers, said Karen Flock, the agency's housing
development director.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrillo plans to go before the Planning Commission June 20 with a
proposal for a farm worker housing development of 52 apartment units
and six single-family homes on Hueneme Road, to be called Villa Cesar
Chavez. On July 11, the Planning Commission is scheduled to hear a
request to build 26 affordable single-family homes at 7th and Meta
streets. Also, 54 apartment units, at least half for farm workers,
are in the predevelopment stage for Victoria Boulevard north of
Gonzales Road.</TE>
<TE>   Some families told the commission they have been waiting years to
find affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "I work day and night, but we've lived in a trailer park for 17
years," said farm worker Victor Renteria, 48, who could qualify to
live in the new apartments. Together with his wife and five children,
Renteria said he has lived in cramped conditions because he cannot
afford anything better.</TE>
<TE>   Renteria said he works 80 to 90 hours a week irrigating fields to
earn about $25,000 a year, while his wife earns $7,000 to $8,000 a
year picking strawberries. "There are a lot of people like us, or in
worse conditions," Renteria said.</TE>

<HD>KOCE Seeking Partner or Buyer</HD>
<DH>Media: Public TV station can't afford $8.5-million cost of
federal order to switch to digital signals.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Under orders to go digital by 2006, Orange County's public television
station said this week it is seeking a merger partner or buyer.</LD>
<LD>   KOCE-TV officials said a merger or sale might lead to a change in
the station's programming and studio location.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been in discussions for the last five years about the
future of KOCE-TV, and it looks expensive," said Mel Rogers,
president and general manager.</LD>
<TE>   Coast Community College District holds the broadcast license for
the station, which broadcasts from Golden West College in Huntington
Beach. The station's five-member board said it is seeking a
partnership with another nonprofit organization that could help KOCE
offset the $8.5 million cost of switching from an analog to a digital
format.</TE>
<TE>   Public TV stations nationwide are under a federal mandate to
convert to digital transmission. KOCE has raised $3 million to
install the new transmitter on Mt. Wilson, but that is only part of
the required upgrades. Other equipment, such as the master control
system, editing suites and studios, also must be made digital, Rogers
said.</TE>
<TE>   By going digital, the station could expand its range to include
the San Fernando and Coachella valleys and increase its viewership to
about 7 million. It now reaches an estimated 5 million viewers in Los
Angeles and Orange counties. Viewers also would be able to watch at
least four channels at once on a split screen.</TE>
<TE>   Several groups have expressed interest in buying or merging with
KOCE, which is a member of the national Public Broadcasting Service.
One prospect is Chapman University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The private university, which plans to expand its school of film
and television, wants a public-TV station to enhance that program. It
is considering an acquisition, a long-term partnership or a
short-term joint venture with KOCE, Chapman President James Doti said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Doti said he would envision KOCE as the county's primary source
for news, information and cultural arts, keeping such programs as
"Real Orange," a half-hour news show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to know which options we will choose," Doti said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Chapman offered to buy KOCE but was rejected, Doti said.
At the time, an appraisal for the college district estimated its
value at $26 million to $39 million. Cal Poly Pomona and USC also
expressed interest at that time.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the right time then to sell, but now it seems that it's
the right time," Doti said.</TE>
<TE>   If Chapman buys KOCE-TV, the programming would change, Doti said.
"We need that kind of visibility to create a greater Orange County
identity because it's the only large metropolis without its own TV
station."</TE>
<TE>   KOCE-TV's Rogers said the station operates in the black with a
$7.2-million annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times when someone is looking for an owner, they're
doing it because the institution is floundering," he said. "But this
is an institution with a great future potential, and this decision
will help achieve its goals."</TE>
<TE>   One member of the station's board, however, expressed concern over
the prospect of relinquishing control of the station and said the
decision to seek bidders is premature. "We're jumping the gun," said
the board's vice president, Paul G. Berger. "We would not have full
control of all our programs."</TE>

<HD>Buy Wetlands, Group Urges State</HD>
<DH>Resources: Activists and Occidental Petroleum have their
eyes on marshes near Oxnard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental activists, local officials, a Chumash spiritual leader
and actor Beau Bridges issued a plea to the state Friday from the
sandy fringe of a wetland area near Oxnard: To save this land, buy
it.</LD>
<LD>   The group's news conference at Ormond Beach came less than a week
before the state Coastal Conservancy is to decide whether to acquire
265 acres being sought by Occidental Petroleum Corp. for the West
Coast's first liquefied natural gas receiving terminal.</LD>
<LD>   "This wetland extended for miles," said Bridges, president of a
group called Ventura CoastKeeper. "It would really be a shame to lose
what little we have left."</LD>
<TE>   The race to buy the wetlands pits the need for energy against the
need for preservation in a state whose environmental resources seem
under constant siege.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal Conservancy staff members side with the preservationists.
On Friday, the agency's staff recommended that board members approve
the $9.7-million purchase from Southern California Edison, said
senior project manager Peter Brand, the conservancy's point man in
Ventura County. Negotiations involving 500 acres nearby are
continuing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wetlands experts have told us this is the most important
preservation opportunity in Southern California," Brand said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, environmental agencies have studied the possibility of
preserving a 4,000-acre swath of wetlands extending from Port Hueneme
to the Mugu Lagoon. Ormond Beach, a marshy expanse dotted with a
power plant and a number of long-standing industrial installations,
would be a key part of the plan, and Occidental's proposed
$250-million facility would not.</TE>
<TE>   To drive home their claim that the Occidental plant would be
unsafe, Bridges' group and the Santa Barbara Coast Keeper, played a
radio commercial that will air locally before the Coastal
Conservancy's hearing Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Ormond Beach in California," the narrator intones. "Come here and
there's a good chance you'll see an endangered plant or animal." On
the other hand, he says, there's also "the horrific fireball you'd
see if things went terribly wrong at a natural gas receiving
terminal."</TE>
<TE>   The ad was later denounced by the company. "It's irresponsible to
use scare tactics to kill a project before it's had an opportunity to
be heard in fair and open public hearings," Occidental spokeswoman
Jan Sieving said.</TE>
<TE>   Three similar facilities are on the East Coast and one is on the
Gulf Coast, she said. In the 45 years since such facilities have
operated worldwide, "there has never been a significant incident,"
Sieving said.</TE>
<TE>   Sieving said she knows of no recourse for Occidental if the state
approves the site's purchase. The conservancy has a contract with
Edison allowing it "the right of first refusal," or the first crack
at purchasing the property.</TE>
<TE>   With 14 power plants under construction in California,
Occidental's plant would provide some of the natural gas that runs
the machinery producing the state's electricity. Liquefied natural
gas would be shipped by tanker to a dock off the Port of Hueneme,
pumped through a pipeline to Occidental's plant, converted back into
a gas and then distributed statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "This site offers unique benefits," Sieving said, citing the
proximity of the port, high-voltage lines from the adjacent Reliant
Energy power plant and an existing web of underground pipes.</TE>
<TE>   But such advantages were not persuasive to the 50 opponents at
Friday's news conference, who contended the plant would degrade a
fragile environment that over the years has suffered enough.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Vows to Open Files to Authorities</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Under threat of grand jury probe, he says
documents will be available. Meanwhile, Vatican discourages
disclosure of abuse allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after being threatened with a grand jury investigation,
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony pledged Friday to make the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese's files on priestly abuse available to the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony said in an interview Friday he would turn over documents
that could include letters, notes of meetings and other
correspondence. He said they also would be made available to local
law enforcement agencies if they require them.</LD>
<LD>   "We want every single thing out, open and dealt with, period,"
Mahony said. "The last thing I want is this going on for months and
months."</LD>
<TE>   Mahony said he has given the Los Angeles Police Department, the
county Sheriff's Department and other agencies the names, addresses
and other information that they have requested regarding priests
alleged to have abused minors. Copies of that information will be
provided to the district attorney, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Mahony said he would work with the district
attorney's office to ask priests accused of abusing minors for
authorization to release their confidential medical and psychological
records.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley sent the cardinal a letter
saying that law enforcement authorities need written documentation of
abuse cases and that their investigations had been hampered without
it. Moreover, Cooley warned the cardinal that he could face a grand
jury investigation over his failure to make those documents
available.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a development that underscored philosophical
differences on priestly abuse between the Vatican and American
Catholics, a Vatican official said in an article to be published
today that bishops should avoid telling congregations their parish
priests sexually abused someone if the bishops believe the priests
will not abuse again.</TE>
<TE>   In an article in the influential Jesuit magazine Civilta
Cattolica, which often reflects Vatican thinking, the Rev. Gianfranco
Ghirlanda, a Vatican appeals court judge, also said church leaders
have no legal or moral responsibilities if such abuse does occur.</TE>
<TE>   Ghirlanda insisted that church leaders must protect the "good
name" of their priests and that only a guilty cleric truly is
responsible for his actions. "From a canon law perspective, the
bishop and the superior are neither morally nor judicially
responsible for the acts committed by one of their clergy," said
Ghirlanda, dean of canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University
in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Cooley released a written statement Friday saying
he was encouraged by Mahony's promise of cooperation in turning over
documents. But he appeared to take note of a sticking point between
the district attorney and the cardinal. Cooley says the archdiocese
must report suspected abuse to the law enforcement agency where the
alleged crime occurred, while Mahony has worked primarily with Los
Angeles Police Department detectives. Those LAPD investigators have
been the liaison between Mahony and other law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's statement said, "We urge Cardinal Mahony and his
advisors" to follow the district attorney's "direction as to how the
requested information should be provided to the appropriate law
enforcement agency."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Scott, Cooley's director of communications, said, "If he sends
a truck [of documents] down here, we're not going to open the boxes;
we're going to send them to the appropriate law enforcement agency as
the district attorney's May 16 letter made elaborately clear."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the LAPD's role as liaison between the church and
other agencies has worked well, particularly in cases where the
archdiocese does not know exactly where an alleged crime occurred.
But he said he would cooperate with law enforcement authorities and
that he has directed "all representatives and personnel of the
archdiocese to continue to cooperate fully" with all civil
authorities. He said he would send backup copies to Cooley's office.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Gary Brennan confirmed Thursday that some archdiocesan
documentation has been provided to the LAPD. County Sheriff Lee Baca
said he was unsure whether the archdiocese is cooperating fully with
his detectives.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know" if detectives are getting all the information
from the church files, Baca said. "People could say on one hand they
are providing all the information they have," but detectives don't
know "until perhaps face to face, investigator to source ... when
they say: 'May I inspect your files?'"</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has said his staff decided last week to urge the cardinal
to provide written materials to police agencies, but a Times story on
former priest Michael Baker stepped up that request.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported Thursday that Baker told Mahony in 1986 that he
molested young boys, but the cardinal reassigned him to parishes
where he allegedly continued his sexual abuse of minors for more than
a decade. Mahony in 2000 approved a secret $1.3-million payment to
alleged victims and arranged for Baker to quietly retire from the
archdiocese. Mahony earlier this week faxed a letter to 1,200 priests
in the archdiocese stating that he mishandled the Baker case and that
he assumed full responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is one of more than 30 current or former archdiocesan
priests under investigation by local law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he has files containing one or two pages and others
that are far more detailed, including cases such as those of Baker
and Michael Wempe, a former chaplain at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
who was forced to resign by Mahony because of prior abuse
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "We told [the LAPD detectives] whatever they wanted, they could
have" in the Baker case, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Mahony and the archdiocese were sued under a federal
racketeering law typically used to dismantle organized crime
operations. In two lawsuits, attorneys alleged Mahony protected
abusive priests as head of the archdiocese, a pattern of behavior
that the lawyers said constitutes a criminal enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's letter earlier this week is the toughest yet from local
law enforcement. Prosecutors in two states have impaneled grand
juries while others have made similar demands for documents. Victims
rights groups and attorneys representing victims say they believe
each diocese maintains considerable files on suspect priests.</TE>

<HD>Many Accused Priests Were Once Abuse Victims Themselves,
Experts Say</HD>
<DH>Pedophilia: Clinicians estimate two-thirds of clergy
suspected of sex offenses were molested as youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ZOLL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clinicians and other experts say a key pattern has been overlooked in
the clergy sex abuse crisis: A significant number of the Roman
Catholic priests accused of abusing children were molested
themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Stephen Rossetti, a psychologist and sex abuse consultant
to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said about two-thirds of
the errant priests whose counseling he has monitored were abuse
victims as youths.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a vicious cycle, and it's a cycle we're trying to break,"
Rossetti said this week.</LD>
<TE>   His observations are consistent with what the Rev. Thomas Doyle
has seen.</TE>
<TE>   A canon lawyer who has testified for plaintiffs in hundreds of
abuse claims against the church, Doyle said it is not unusual for
abusive priests to have been molested.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti said in his 10 years of treating abusive clergy, the ones
who said they had been victimized had almost always been assaulted by
someone unconnected to the church.</TE>
<TE>   But A.W. Richard Sipe, a former priest and psychotherapist who
studies sexuality in the church, concluded that many errant priests
were molested by clergy.</TE>
<TE>   Father Paul Shanley, who is charged with raping a boy in
Massachusetts and has become a central figure in the nationwide abuse
scandal, wrote in 1995 to a Boston Archdiocese administrator that he
had been abused "as a teen-ager, and later as a seminarian by a
priest, a faculty member, a pastor."</TE>
<TE>   Father Kevin Clohessy was publicly accused last month of molesting
a male college student in Missouri nearly a decade ago. His brother,
David, national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests, said he and Kevin were molested as boys by the same priest.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Clohessy has not commented publicly on the allegations
against him or his history. Shanley has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Fred Berlin, a sexual disorders expert at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, said most boys who are molested do not
grow up to become abusers.</TE>
<TE>   However, among sex offenders, a significant percentage--no one's
sure exactly how many--were molested as youths.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a risk factor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Miller, a University of Colorado expert on sex
offenders who also serves as an expert witness at criminal trials,
said the pattern is important for treating perpetrators, but is
rarely successful as a legal defense--and rightly so, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Judges often will only consider it as a factor in sentencing, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty generally accepted that it has an impact, but there's
a difference between explaining and excusing," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin said it is rare for sex offenders to fabricate a history of
being abused themselves to win sympathy or a less severe criminal
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "Males who have been abused have a very difficult time talking
about it. Most of the patients don't even reveal they had been abused
around the time of treatment or sentencing when it would have been
advantageous for them to do so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Often you have to encourage them to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti said many priests he's seen in treatment don't recognize
they were victimized, and only come to understand what happened to
them after undergoing counseling.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's important that, even though we condemn child sex
abuse, we do not necessarily condemn the person who commits abuse,
but the behavior," Rossetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists who screen candidates for the priesthood often ask
men whether they have been sexually abused, but each seminary hires
its own counselor and there is no uniform set of questions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin said Catholic leaders-- and the public--need to understand
the pattern to develop effective ways to prevent child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to recognize pedophilia is a public health
problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People discover they're afflicted with a sexual orientation
toward children and that can't be legislated away or punished away."</TE>

<HD>Sharon Monsky, 48; Health Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharon Monsky, who was diagnosed with the little-known
life-threatening disease scleroderma and spent 16 years raising
millions of dollars to fund research to find a cure, has died. She
was 48.</LD>
<LD>   Monsky died of scleroderma--which afflicts 300,000 Americans, most
of them women in the prime of their lives--May 11 in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Diagnosed with the disease, which hardens the skin and compromises
the internal organs, in the early 1980s, Monsky decided to fight back
and launched the Scleroderma Research Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara-based Foundation is the only organization in the
nation dedicated exclusively to finding a cure for the degenerative
disease.</TE>
<TE>   As the illness continued to take its toll, Monsky traveled to
research labs and to the halls of Congress, rallying allies,
including Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   She also found support from entertainment figures such as
comedians Robin Williams and Bob Saget, who have appeared at her
annual fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon put the disease on the map," said Charles Spaulding, vice
president of the foundation. "If it weren't for her, then the
research would not be where it is today."</TE>
<TE>   Through Monsky's efforts, the foundation has become the major
private health and research organization dedicated to finding a cure
for scleroderma and has raised more than $14 million for research.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation funds two research centers, the San Francisco Bay
Area Scleroderma Center at UC San Francisco and the East Coast
Scleroderma Research Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon has made a momentous difference, both to science and to
all who were fortunate to touch her life," Dr. Bruce Alberts,
president of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "When first diagnosed with scleroderma, she quickly and
effectively recruited some of the nation's best scientists to create
a unique and collaborative research program that has made many
important insights into this mysterious disease," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Omaha, Monsky was a nationally ranked figure skater as
a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   She graduated at the top of her class at Pitzer College in
Claremont with a bachelor's degree in economics.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1980s, she had earned an MBA from Stanford University
and was a rising star at McKinsey &amp; Co., an international
management-consulting firm in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1981, she began feeling chronically tired. Then her joints
began to ache. When she finally went to the doctor, she could barely
grasp a pen or bend over to tie her shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Scleroderma is often misdiagnosed and Monsky spent 18 months
visiting numerous doctors before she received the correct diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   "One doctor, obviously knowing little of the disease, told me I
had only 'a handful of months' to live," she told the Chicago Tribune
in 1993. "I decided right there and then that I was not going to
place my life in the hands of someone who was saying that I was not
going to make it, but didn't know why.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to give it my best effort to beat this disease and
make a contribution in my lifetime that might help others to not
suffer."</TE>
<TE>   By 1985, her worsening condition forced her to resign from
McKinsey &amp; Co. By then, she was severely arthritic, had only 50% lung
capacity and was covered with open sores on most of her body.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, using a borrowed conference room in San Francisco,
she and a group of family and friends conducted the first meeting of
the Scleroderma Research Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, determined to make Congress aware of scleroderma and the
need for funding of research at the government level, Monsky began
lobbying lawmakers in Washington and testifying before congressional
committees.</TE>
<TE>   She was appointed to an advisory board of the National Institutes
of Health.</TE>
<TE>   She took her cause to Hollywood celebrities. "Cool Comedy--Hot
Cuisine," the foundation's annual fund-raiser, has featured Garry
Shandling, Lily Tomlin and many other top comedians, and has raised
more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Monsky had a cameo role as herself in "For Hope," a 1996 TV movie
on ABC about scleroderma directed by actor-comedian Saget, whose
sister, Gay, died of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the disease had assaulted all of Monsky's vital organs.
The skin on her face had tightened so much that she could not close
her lips and had difficulty enunciating words.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon is the person who singularly decided that the only way to
cure this disease is to raise money to do just that," said Saget, who
met Monsky about 12 years ago when he performed in the "Cool Comedy"
benefit for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he said, Monsky "became a sister to me."</TE>
<TE>   "She's the most beautiful person, the most beautiful spirit, I've
ever seen. Her spirit is what drove this organization."</TE>
<TE>   Monsky is survived by her husband, Mark Scher; a son, Max; two
daughters, Samantha and Montana; her mother, Ramelle Monsky of Palm
Desert; a sister, Robin of Chicago; and a brother, Henry Monsky of
Omaha.</TE>

Onramp Shenanigans</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Isn't there already enough hissing among commuters on the freeways?
KNX radio trafficmeister Jim Thornton reported that a pair of
rattlesnakes were spotted Friday morning on an onramp of the San
Bernardino Freeway in Yucaipa.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess they were sunning themselves," Thornton said, "or doing
whatever reptiles do on onramps."</LD>
<LD>   Skating through life: Chatting about other unusual sights on the
freeways, Thornton told me about the time a truck had overturned on
the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim Hills, bringing everything to a
halt.</LD>
<TE>   A motorist who was caught in the SigAlert behind the truck
apparently didn't have much farther to go to reach his destination.
But he had to get there in a hurry. So, he just pulled over to the
shoulder of the freeway, parked his car, pulled a skateboard out of
his trunk, and rode away, briefcase in hand.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing that Thornton had mentioned the incident that day,
the skater/driver phoned and gave a simple explanation for
temporarily ditching his car. "He said he knew he wasn't going
anywhere for a couple of hours," Thornton recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to X-rated freeway fare ... : Claudia Penny Dufau of
Corona was on the Riverside Freeway when she passed a large tour bus
bound for Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "I glanced up, and lo and behold, there--on not one, but two,
three, four different screens in the bus--was a video of a couple in
the altogether doing something altogether inappropriate for a GP
freeway audience," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought to myself, 'Who are these people?' Of course, I was
referring to the passengers on the bus, not the pair on the screen."</TE>
<TE>   She passed the bus, but several minutes later the bus caught up
and passed her. She noticed that a tamer movie was playing. Perhaps,
she figured, the driver had speeded up because his eyes were back on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sex ... : A South Pasadena theater marquee with a
surprising announcement caught the eye of Bingham Cherrie (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Hair-raising drama: Some unusual 911 calls to the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department, as recorded in the department publication "Star
News":</TE>
<TE>   * Caller "has a strange hairdo and mother won't let her in the
house."</TE>
<TE>   * Caller told deputies he wanted "microchips from vocal larynx box
and head removed."</TE>
<TE>   * Male was reported "directing traffic inside [Starbucks] store"
even though "that store is not a drive-thru."</TE>
<TE>   * Woman complained "her relatives came for a visit and now are
refusing to leave."</TE>
<TE>   * Customer reported "stamp machine in post office is broken and
giving unlimited books of stamps." And the customer was complaining?</TE>
<TE>   Escape from Southern California: On a visit to the Australian
island of Tasmania, Lance and Becky Larsen of Irvine saw evidence
that koalas can be potty-trained (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: For you weekend gardeners, Alex Morrison of L.A. saw
an ad from a specialist who vows to keep your lawn brown (see
accompanying). I guess I discovered that formula years ago.</TE>

1994, when the program started, to 5,200 for the new school term.
Applications for fall will be available beginning Monday at all
district campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Many parents hoping to transfer children into better-performing
schools will likely be disappointed because 85% of the district's
schools have no openings after enrolling neighborhood children from
their boundary areas. Lotteries will probably decide who gets many of
the available spots.</LD>
<TE>   The state Legislature enacted the open-enrollment program in 1993
as a way to derail the voucher movement and efforts to break up the
Los Angeles school district. At the time, enrollment was declining
statewide and the program was seen as a way to give parents a choice
in where their children are schooled. It became popular in the huge
Los Angeles system.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, yearly surges in enrollment in L.A. Unified have taken
up many of the seats that might be available through open enrollment
at the district's 791 elementary, middle and senior high schools,
said Esther Wong, district assistant superintendent of planning and
research.</TE>
<TE>   According to school district figures, for each of the last six
years, student population has increased about 10,000, to the current
figure of 737,000. The number of open-enrollment seats declined
steadily for five years until 2000, when there were 5,000 at 116
schools. Last year, there were 6,000 spots at 120 schools because
enrollment did not increase as much as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Wong said the continued general decline in open-enrollment seats
probably won't change until construction of new schools is finished
several years from now.</TE>
<TE>   The open-enrollment system will give at least 5,200 people an
opportunity to enroll in the school of their choice, Wong said. But
because most schools are not accepting applications, many parents are
shut out of the process from the start. Officials could not estimate
how many applications will be filed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Annette Volk, president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. of Riverside
Drive Elementary School in Sherman Oaks, said although most parents
are "very happy" with her school, shortages in the open-enrollment
system rankle many other parents in the district</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, absolutely, there is discontent," Volk said. "Parents like
to feel that they have those choices, and I feel we are much more
limited than we are led to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Parents want to get their children into curricula offered only on
certain campuses, such as the Schools for Advanced Studies program
for gifted students, but find no seats available through open
enrollment, she said. Separate and earlier applications must be made
to the magnet school program.</TE>
<TE>   "The open-enrollment system is better than nothing, but there
should be various types of permits available at every school," Volk
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents seek to transfer students for reasons other than
academics, said Myra Fullerton, principal of Taft High School in
Woodland Hills, which has 275 openings. They may work nearby and find
it easier to drop off their children or have a relative in the
neighborhood who can care for the child after school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the district's most sought-after schools, El Camino Real
High in Woodland Hills, has 175 slots available for fall. In past
years applications have often outnumbered openings by 4 to 1, said
Principal Ron Bauer. He said he regularly has to tell parents from
other schools that there's no room but no one has ever become irate.</TE>
<TE>   Also high on parents' lists are Granada Hills High, with 50
openings; North Hollywood High, with 100; and Palms Elementary near
Mar Vista, with 10.</TE>
<TE>   Schools receiving more applications than they have seats available
will hold a lottery. Officials said the random drawings, held in
public, put all applicants on an equal footing. No extra points are
given for high academic standing or being first in line.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, North Hollywood High had about 80 openings but fewer
applications, so all comers were taken, Assistant Principal Diane
Pokarney said.</TE>
<TE>   But some well-regarded schools that have no available spaces for
the fall are John Marshall High in the Los Feliz area, Susan Miller
Dorsey High in the Crenshaw District, John H. Francis Polytechnic
High in Sun Valley and Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary in Sherman
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we don't want to have students come here from other
schools, it's that we don't have the room," said Dixie Canyon
Principal Bennett Blum, who gets frequent inquiries from hopeful
parents. "What I tell them is that our first commitment is to the
local community. I also tell them to check back in August, and, if we
have room, we'll take them."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall High hasn't had openings in four years. The school once
had 200 spaces, with long lines of people seeking them. Dorsey High
has no room for outsiders and is so crowded that some students are
being bused to other schools, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being disappointed that their kids have to attend a
neighborhood school, parents should work to improve it, said Karimu
McNeal, vice president of the Dorsey High parent group. "Sit in the
classrooms. Get to know the teachers, counselors and administrators.
Just get in there and get involved. Make sure your child is getting
what they need."</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for open-enrollment applications is June 5 at the
school the student wishes to attend. Applications to more than one
school are permitted.</TE>

<KH>OUT THERE  / SIERRA NEVADA</KH>
<HD>Carving Out Steep Thrills in Bowl of Ice</HD>
<DH>Back-country skiers flock to the Sierra Nevada's vertical
granite peaks in a challenge to both mind and body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMETT BERG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We were looking for spring snow and a chance to ski one last time
before summer. A friend, Seth Miller, and I drove toward the Sierra
Nevada, figuring it would have the conditions we were looking for.
Driving toward the mountains, however, it became clear that the only
skiing would be around the tallest peaks, and getting to them could
require too much time and effort.</LD>
<LD>   In Mammoth Lakes, a retired forest ranger, John Ellsworth, told us
that part of the Tioga Pass road toward Yosemite National Park was
open to traffic. We could drive straight to the pass at 9,945 feet
above sea level and quickly be on slopes as high as 13,000 feet. Best
of all, the road west of the pass into Yosemite was still closed, and
we would have the mountains largely to ourselves. There was plenty of
snow, Ellsworth assured us.</LD>
<LD>   From Tioga Pass, skiable slopes rise almost directly on both sides
of the roadway. The inclines range from rounded, treeless hillsides
to concave bowls and rocky couloirs--steep gorges with strips of
skiable snow barely wider than elevator shafts.</LD>
<TE>   Our spirits rose as we drove toward the pass before sundown to
scout out the Ellery Bowl, one of the most popular ski areas in the
region. Back-country skiers have descended Sierra Nevada peaks by
countless routes, attracted by the usually generous snowpack, the
solitude and the technical challenge of skiing around steep granite
peaks. Most people simply trudge up a slope with a moderate grade and
then ski down it. Others lower themselves with ropes into nearly
sheer couloirs where skiing can involve a lot of jumping and twisting
in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Our plan for the next day was to spend a few hours hiking up the
bowl, relax a while at the top and then ski directly down to our car.</TE>
<TE>   I fretted about the Ellery Bowl late into the night. There was a
wind-driven wave of ice and snow cresting from a rocky ridgeline
known as a cornice. Skiing underneath it could be dangerous.
Truck-sized chunks of ice have been known to break loose and sweep
away any skiers below it. I looked at a photograph of the bowl and
traced escape routes should a snowslide occur. I also worried about
altitude sickness. Just walking around Tioga Pass, I'd felt a bit
lightheaded.</TE>
<TE>   But my anxieties evaporated with the crisp, sunny morning. We
arrived at the foot of the bowl at 8:30. My friend and I are both
telemark skiers, favoring a style of cross-country skiing developed
in Norway that resembles a series of deep knee bends.</TE>
<TE>   Gauging the terrain above us, we decided to strap our skis to our
packs and kick steps into the snow with our plastic ski boots. Other
skiers behind took advantage of our trailblazing and ascended the
stair steps we had notched.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't realize at first I was struggling. During our first hour
of hiking, I was enthralled by the immensity of the jagged crest of
mountains all around. What forces of nature could shape all this?</TE>
<TE>   I felt like laughing. But instead I began wheezing. My heartbeat
was rapid. My stomach churned and my throat forecast a retch.</TE>
<TE>   Other skiers and snowboarders trudged past me with kind words, but
even so I was angry. My legs felt fine but I could barely stand on
them. I was taking a breath every step as if I were climbing Mt.
Everest. But soon even that wasn't enough. I ended up sprawled on a
sunny rock with a 13-year-old dog at my side. Old Kiwi couldn't make
it up to join her master and whined in annoyance. I hear you, dog.</TE>
<TE>   At 11,000 feet, there is a third less oxygen in the air than at
sea level. If your body isn't acclimated, nausea, dizziness and
serious fatigue can set in. The remedy is simple. Go down. Left
untended, so-called high altitude pulmonary edema can be fatal. My
symptoms were relatively mild, but I wasn't going any higher that
day. I needed to rest and drink water.</TE>
<TE>   My companion and a half-dozen others, mostly local skiers,
continued hiking above me and soon had reached the ridge top at
11,600 feet. I knew what must be happening above me: food and water
consumption and excited conversation about distant routes visible
from the ridgeline.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the skiers would get down to the business of picking a
line--planning their descent into the Ellery Bowl. Picking a line is
of value in snow sports generally but especially so when skiing down
steep terrain. A "line" is the route you visualize that links your
first, second and succeeding turns. A good line allows you to avoid
hasty turns that may lead to dangerous obstacles such as exposed
rocks or cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   After 45 minutes, I heard the echo of whoops as the first skier
launched off a gap in the cornice, slicing his skis into snow that
was ice-like in the morning but in full sun resembled wet cement. All
watched as the first skier completed his run. Skiers can set off
avalanches, so by descending one at a time, the risk of danger is
minimized. The next skier fell near the top and lost equipment as she
tumbled, gaining speed. She came to a stop 30 yards downhill from her
fall, avoiding injury but sending a tremor through the group
remaining on the ridgeline, skiers said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The Mono County search and rescue squad has to evacuate a handful
of skiers every year from the Tioga Pass area. There have been fatal
falls down rocky chutes, skiers buried in avalanches and backs broken
high in alpine country.</TE>
<TE>   At last my partner skied down to where I had abandoned the hike.
He was winded and struggling to maintain his form. I still wasn't
feeling great but felt strong enough to strap on my own skis and join
the fun.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the snow conditions fell short of the famous Sierra
Nevada "corn" that Ellsworth likened to "a baby's bottom." Corn snow
develops over time through a daily cycle of snowmelt and refreezing.
Snowfall, which happened the week before we arrived, actually messes
up the cycle. For us the snow was icy, then gluey, then slippery,
then crusty and fast in the shadow of a tree.</TE>
<TE>   I was gasping again but no longer despondent. I crouched low into
the turns and tried to stay balanced. My regret at not reaching the
top fell away with each successful turn. Ultimately I had traveled
more than 1,000 miles for this single run. It was worth it. I'm
already picking my line for next time.</TE>

<HD>Xavier Montsalvatge, 90; Composer, Key Spanish Music Figure</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xavier Montsalvatge, 90, an eclectic composer who was considered one
of the leading figures of 20th century Spanish music, died May 7 of
emphysema at his home in Barcelona.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a family of bankers, Montsalvatge began studying music
as a child and turned to composition as a young man.</LD>
<LD>   His most famous works include a set of vocal pieces with piano
accompaniment--"Cinco Canciones Negras" (Five Black Songs). They are
about Cuba, and feature an exotic rhythm that reflects Montsalvatge's
fondness for the sounds of the West Indies. Written in 1945, they
earned Montsalvatge international fame.</LD>
<TE>   For all the music he created--he wrote more than 100
songs--Montsalvatge believed that his role as a composer was
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   "In music, the performer is more important than the author," the
newspaper El Mundo quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the advice I always give young people. If they want their
music to be played, as they write they should think about the
performers. If there is no performer, music is just writing on
paper."</TE>

<LD>Warren Jones, 65, who led the Australia II syndicate that snapped the
United States' 132-year winning streak in the America's Cup yachting
competition, died Friday in Perth, Australia, of complications from a
stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Jones was the director of the Alan Bond-backed campaign that won
the Cup from the New York Yacht Club in 1983, when skipper John
Bertrand beat American Dennis Conner in the deciding race at Newport,
R.I.</LD>
<LD>   Bertrand said Australia would not have won the world's oldest
sporting trophy without Jones' tenacity in dealing with the New York
Yacht Club.</LD>
<TE>   "Warren was instrumental in the America's Cup win in that he
brought so much knowledge and focus to the table," Bertrand said. "It

<LD>Jose Lutzemberger, 75, who was a pioneering environmentalist in
Brazil and former environment minister, died Tuesday in Porte Alegre
of a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   An agricultural engineer from Rio Grande do Sul state,
Lutzemberger worked 15 years for a German firm selling farm
chemicals. He left that business after an encounter with an apple
farmer who declared that he wasn't concerned about the health aspects
of his crop because he wouldn't be eating the chemically treated
apples.</LD>
<LD>   Lutzemberger founded Brazil's first nonprofit environmental

from the University of Idaho. He was recalled to military duty during
the Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   He moved to California in the early 1950s, first working as a band
teacher at a school in El Cajon. In the late 1950s, he took a job as
principal of the high school in Davis, Calif., which he held for
eight years before becoming superintendent of what is now the Placer
Union High School District.</LD>
<TE>   He became chief deputy to state schools Supt. Wilson Riles in 1973
and held that post for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, McKinley was one of five finalists for Los Angeles County
superintendent of schools.</TE>

<HD>Polanco Takes Aim at Prison Guards' Pay</HD>
<DH>Labor: As he opens a hearing to examine lucrative pact, the
state senator accuses Gov. Davis of giving union a sweetheart deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) charged Friday that
taxpayers and state services for senior citizens and children are
threatened by a giveaway contract negotiated by the Davis
administration and California's prison guards union.</LD>
<LD>   Polanco, who has sparred with the union before, criticized the
agreement at the outset of a hearing on Gov. Gray Davis' proposed
budget for the Department of Corrections, whose current spending is
$277 million in the red.</LD>
<LD>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. is one of Davis'
biggest campaign donors, having contributed more than $2.5 million to
him in recent years. It also makes major contributions to
legislators. Davis administration officials defended the contract;
union leaders did not respond to requests for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Polanco identified what he said were costly contract provisions
and argued that they should be reviewed because legislators and the
governor are being forced to cut programs and increase taxes to
overcome a $23.6-billion deficit from the state budget that takes
effect July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco criticized potentially costly provisions in the five-year
agreement, including shortened work hours, additional vacation time,
extra compensation for keeping physically fit and the ability of
guards to retire at 90% of their salary at the age of 50 starting in
2006. The contract also links guards' salaries to those of the
California Highway Patrol and big-city law enforcement departments,
another provision with which Polanco took issue.</TE>
<TE>   "What does the taxpayer get out of this agreement, or is this just
a one-sided giveaway?" Polanco asked.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the agreement, Marty Morgenstern, director of the state
Department of Personnel Administration, said that some figures and
contract provisions cited by Polanco were inaccurate or had long been
routine policies for agreements with state employee unions.</TE>
<TE>   He bristled at Polanco describing the pact as a sweetheart
agreement with the union. "Rather than a sweetheart deal, we spent
seven months in negotiations. They often were acrimonious and rarely
pretty," Morgenstern said.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, however, demanded that Morgenstern and Edward Alameida,
director of the Department of Corrections, identify specific costs of
each area covered in the contract. The two officials often failed to
provide them and occasionally disagreed over what the costs might be.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement between the state and the prison guards union was
negotiated a few months ago and quickly ratified by the Legislature,
few of whose members knew its details.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, long a foe of the association and an opponent of the
contract when it was ratified, said no one in the Legislature knows
how much the contract will cost in overtime payments that would occur
as a result of a shortened workday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sweet, sweet sweetheart deal that is ... going to cost,
cost taxpayers a lot of money," Polanco told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, he said, "This union has tremendous influence.
We know it. They put fear into people. [Legislators] will do ...
whatever [the union] wants for fear it will come after them in an
election year. They play hardball."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco was the target of a campaign by the union last year to
deny him a seat on the Los Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   He abandoned the race shortly before election day as union leaders
pressed their campaign against him.</TE>
<TE>   He is a supporter of private prisons, which the union opposes.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have defended the agreement, noting that
prison guards work in a hostile and violent environment.</TE>
<TE>   In March, two months before he signed the ratification bill, Davis
received $251,000 in campaign donations from the union.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco said he doubted that the contract could be rescinded, but
that legislators should know how much it will cost, particularly
because Davis' proposed budget would cut deeply into health care
programs for the poor as well as child-care services and assistance
to senior citizens.</TE>

<HD>The Prom Is WHEN????</HD>
<DH>Schools: Garfield High in East L.A. goes into a tizzy after
a mix-up means the special night is in two weeks, not tonight. After
booing, there's mobilization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attention Garfield High seniors: Your prom is not tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the $62 prom ticket says May 18. Never mind that
you've rented a tux or scheduled your hair and nails, arranged for a
$400-a-night limo and--this was the hard part--gotten the night off
work.</LD>
<LD>   Your prom is actually in two weeks, June 1.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Peter Luevano, whose duties include overseeing
school activities, accepts half the blame for the mix-up, which was
discovered only this week. He signed the contract with the Long Beach
Hilton, which states that the prom will be held June 1, not May 18,
as students have believed all year.</TE>
<TE>   Luevano says he called the Hilton shortly after the contract was
signed in August to see whether the date could be changed to May 18.
According to Luevano, a hotel official agreed to the change.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel's director of catering, Ross Gagnon, says the hotel
doesn't have a record of any such conversation. "The bottom line is
we've had a signed contract from Garfield from August of 2001 stating
that June 1 is the date of their prom. That's what we've planned
for," says Gagnon.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he adds, no hotel staffer would have agreed to such a
change because May 18 has been booked for a year--for Bell Gardens
High School's prom.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess after we made the change, there was this confusion," says
Luevano, who is now helping students adjust to the new date at the
Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Garfield prom snafu seems to be a case of nearly
yearlong confusion. As recently as a month ago, Garfield
administrators, students and a photographer sat through a meeting at
the Hilton thinking they were picking out tablecloths and place
settings for a May 18 prom while the hotel caterers were planning a
June 1 prom.</TE>
<TE>   It was only by accident that Luevano discovered just days before
this weekend that the hotel was expecting Garfield's seniors and
guests--possibly as many as 690 of them--on June 1. He had called
Monday afternoon to find out if school police officers, who would
provide security at the prom, could wear their sidearms. When he
mentioned May 18, the hotel staffer said the prom was June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sad this happened," says Luevano, "but I'm glad we called."</TE>
<TE>   Garfield students had been planning for the prom since last
summer, voting on both the hotel and the date.</TE>
<TE>   So when word trickled out Tuesday morning--the first hint being
the new date hastily scrawled on prom tickets sold that
morning--students were furious. The regularly scheduled senior class
meeting, which usually has an anemic attendance of about 50,
mushroomed to nearly 300 students that Tuesday afternoon. As Luevano
and senior class officers entered the auditorium, students booed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a peasant uprising," says senior Sylvia Torres, 17,
who starred as Dolly in the school's recent production of "Hello,
Dolly." "They were all talking at the same time. Someone was saying,
'Just get another place and go Saturday.' But you can't do that,
unless you want to go to Shakey's."</TE>
<TE>   There was even some resentment that Bell Gardens had the May 18
date. "We were arguing about it in the meeting--'It's because we're
from East L.A.,'" says Susan Garcia, a 17-year-old senior.</TE>
<TE>   But the brunt of their enmity was the assistant principal.</TE>
<TE>   Peppered With Questions</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was asking so many questions: 'Didn't you read the
contract? Why would you sign it?'" recalls Ginelle Gomez, the senior
class president. "He couldn't reply because they were so rowdy. But
his explanation was he recalls signing the contract and then calling
them back and asking if May 18th was available and they said yes."</TE>
<TE>   Luevano says it was Kimberly Smith-Woodbury, the Long Beach
Hilton's catering manager, who OKd the date change to May 18.
Smith-Woodbury was also at the meeting held at the hotel about a
month ago with Garfield administrators and students to discuss
decorations and numbers of tables.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking to the lady and we kept saying May 18--and she
said May 18th as well," recalls Gomez, who was at that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Photographer Gary Roberts, a veteran of proms, was also at that
meeting and says the date may not have been prominently discussed. "I
think it was assumed that we knew the date," says Roberts, who with
his wife owns the Anthony Loya Studio. But Roberts said he did
mention the May 18 date when he called the catering manager last week
and left her a voice mail.</TE>
<TE>   Smith-Woodbury did not return phone calls, but the Hilton's Gagnon
says of the meeting, "It could have been they were making reference
to a date and it didn't throw up a marker to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Anger in the school quickly turned into a frantic scramble to
reschedule hair appointments, tuxedo and limo rentals--and dates.
Fliers announcing the change have been posted all over school, and
Gomez made an automated phone call alerting all seniors. Garfield
students are notorious for hanging up on the automated calls that
come from school, so Gomez's message begins "Please don't hang up!
This is an urgent message.... "</TE>
<TE>   School administrators have phoned limo companies and tuxedo rental
shops to alert them to the changes. "No one has refused to hold the
rentals," says Assistant Principal Richard Bin. Any students having
trouble with rentals have been told to ask the school for help.</TE>
<TE>   For Some, Actually an Advantage</TE>
<TE>   Anger has subsided for some, who are grateful they found out
before prom night. "I'm really glad Mr. Luevano called. Otherwise, we
would have all showed up in our dresses," says Beatris Hernandez, 17.</TE>
<TE>   Some seniors are actually happy about the extra two weeks, so they
can save more money or work off detention hours--which must be served
before a student may attend the prom.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of several who are relieved," says Silvia Ramos, 18. "My
dress isn't even done yet."</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of procrastinated with the tuxedo, so this gives me more
time," says David Castillo, 18. Garfield High seniors graduate June
27 at East Los Angeles College.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless they change it on us," says Jeanette Avalos, 17.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Heads for Record Dry Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forecasters say it could rain Monday night or Tuesday morning. Not a
lot, but enough to remind us of what we've been missing this year.</LD>
<LD>   Thus far, this is shaping up as the driest rainfall season in the
history of Los Angeles. Only 4.36 inches of rain have fallen at the
Civic Center since July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the National Weather
Service, said state officials aren't calling this a drought--that
term is reserved for years when water supplies are short, and no one
is calling for rationing yet.</LD>
<TE>   "But it certainly is abnormally dry, at least here in Southern
California," Seto said.</TE>
<TE>   If another 0.49 of an inch of rain doesn't fall by June 30--and
forecasters consider that unlikely--this will be the driest season
since officials started keeping records in Los Angeles in 1877. The
existing record, set in 1960-61, is 4.85 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Seto said a cool, wet storm from off the coast of Alaska is
expected to start moving into the northern part of the state over the
weekend, dropping substantial rain in the San Joaquin Valley and
several inches of snow in the High Sierra by Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   He said the storm should continue moving south Monday morning,
with a 30% chance of light rain in the Los Angeles Basin on Monday
night and Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Light snow could fall in the Tehachapi, San Gabriel and San
Bernardino mountains above 6,000 feet, Seto said. "It's like a
late-winter storm, pretty unusual for this time of year," he said.
"But whatever precipitation there is shouldn't be that heavy."</TE>
<TE>   The weekend weather in Los Angeles before the rain arrives should
be pretty nice, with mostly clear afternoons and evenings after some
morning clouds and fog.</TE>
<TE>   High temperatures should range from the 60s along the coast to
near 80 in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>

<HD>Copycats Blamed in Park Hazards</HD>
<DH>Crime: Orange County detectives doubt the authenticity of a
letter in Laguna Beach that claims responsibility for hiding sharp
objects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detectives said Friday that they don't see a link connecting all five
incidents of sharp objects placed at parks in south Orange County,
saying most of the incidents were probably the work of copycats.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came the same day authorities found a letter with
a nail punched through it at a Laguna Beach park.</LD>
<LD>   The letter claimed responsibility for the incidents and threatened
more of them.</LD>
<TE>   A homeless man discovered the folded letter Friday morning at the
Main Beach playground, where razors were found three weeks ago
strategically placed around slides and swings.</TE>
<TE>   Police found three photocopies of the letter elsewhere in the
park.</TE>
<TE>   They would not release the full letter but described it as "long
and rambling."</TE>
<TE>   The writer "indicated in the letter [that] there's a group, that
there's more than one person carrying out these activities," said
Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Jason Kravetz. He added that the writer used
the words "I" and "we" interchangeably.</TE>
<TE>   Police were analyzing the one-page, typed letter to determine if
there is a way to trace it back to the author. The writer threatened
to strike again but did not specify when or where that will occur.</TE>
<TE>   But detectives doubt the authenticity of the letter.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation so far has found that only two of the five
attacks appear related--ones this month in Laguna Niguel and Mission
Viejo. The rest, they believe, were done by different people. One
incident in Santa Ana this week involved nails that officials said
could have been left to harm people or simply discarded.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's someone looking for attention," said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course contents of the letter will be taken seriously and
we're thoroughly investigating," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time, there's nothing that allows us to confirm that
there are any connections."</TE>
<TE>   After the letter was discovered, officers combed the sand and
playground equipment at Main Beach with rakes and metal detectors
before reopening it for public use. No other sharp objects were
found.</TE>
<TE>   But the episode left some park-goers concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "We were getting ready to get in the sand, but a parent told me
what's been happening so I decided to [stay] out in the water," said
Emma Entwistle, 28, of Kansas, who was lying in the sun with her
4-year-old son, Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to take chances."</TE>

<HD>Bills Would Let Churches Be More Politically Active</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CURT ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Religious groups are divided over legislation pushed by House
Republicans to allow them to be more politically active without
imperiling their tax-exempt status.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the bills include conservative groups such as the
Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, Americans for Tax
Reform and the Assn. of Christian Schools International. On the other
side are many Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
Jews, Muslims and Buddhists.</LD>
<LD>   The measures would lift the Internal Revenue Service's effective
ban on political activity at America's churches, synagogues and
mosques. Both measures are aimed at allowing religious leaders the
right to free political speech, giving them the ability to endorse
candidates who agree with their moral teachings.</LD>
<TE>   "The appropriate level, if any, of political speech should be
decided by the church and its parishioners, not the Internal Revenue
Service," Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) told the House Ways and Means
Committee oversight panel this week.</TE>
<TE>   The prohibition on political activity was imposed in 1954 by
Congress on all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations under an amendment
offered by then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson (D-Texas). Before that, religious
leaders were freely involved in political debate.</TE>
<TE>   Religious groups and the government have locked horns frequently
over the years when it comes to politics and the Constitution's
guarantees of both free speech and freedom of religion. After a
decade-long battle, the IRS concluded in 1999 that the Christian
Coalition should not be tax-exempt because of its distribution of
voter guides in churches.</TE>
<TE>   Yet examples abound of politicians appearing before congregations
in none-too-subtle endorsements by religious leaders. The law now
allows tax-exempt religious groups to sponsor debates, conduct voter
registration drives, and speak out and lobby on issues.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Miller, director of the IRS exempt organizations division,
said religious groups cross a legal line when they take a position on
politicians or political initiatives. In the last 25 years, he said,
only two churches and five religious organizations have lost their
tax-exempt status over political issues. Some said that could be
because of the law's current muzzling effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you would have another player in the political arena" if
the legislation were to be passed, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The bills, sponsored by Jones and Rep. Phil Crane (R-Ill.), may
get no further than Tuesday's subcommittee hearing in this session of
Congress. Still, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said he
would "probably" schedule a floor vote if it is approved by the Ways
and Means Committee.</TE>

<HD>Charles Rick, 87; Plant Geneticist Was Expert on Tomato
Biology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He waded through Colombian swamps, trekked across the high Andes in
Peru and Chile, and once sailed to the Galapagos Islands in a leaky
"wooden tub" that lost its propeller. All in pursuit of the wild
tomato.</LD>
<LD>   Charles M. Rick, a world-renowned plant geneticist and botanist
who was widely considered to be the leading authority on the biology
of the tomato, died May 5 from multiple health problems in a
retirement home in Davis. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   For much of his more than 60 years as a professor in the
department of vegetable crops at UC Davis, Rick traveled extensively
to collect hundreds of wild tomato species that contained a wide
range of genetic variation that was absent from the modern domestic
tomato.</LD>
<TE>   Rick made landmark contributions in the areas of plant genetics,
evolution, genome mapping and archiving the seeds of tomatoes and
related plant species.</TE>
<TE>   "He is really one of the world's leading plant geneticists," said
UC Davis professor John Yoder, chairman of the department of
vegetable crops. "He did a lot to make the tomato a real vegetable
commodity, to make it as popular as it is today."</TE>
<TE>   But equally important, Yoder added, "were his contributions to
just basic plant genetics in plant biology: He did more than just
develop the tomato as a commodity crop; he really used the tomato to
ask fundamental questions about plant biology."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Rick was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
It's one of the highest honors awarded to research scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "He is Mr. Tomato," former Secretary of Agriculture Clayton
Yeutter said of Rick in 1997 when Rick received the first $200,000
Filippo Maseri Florio world prize for agriculture research for his
work on the tomato.</TE>
<TE>   "Among people who have had an influence on a particular
commodity," Yeutter said, "his work on the tomato will be felt by
many generations."</TE>
<TE>   "My career has just been a succession of exciting discoveries,"
Rick said at the time. "I am the last person who needs to be honored.
I'm the one who has had all the fun."</TE>
<TE>   Born and reared in Reading, Pa., Rick's lifelong interest in
plants was sparked by working in orchards as a boy and participating
in nature studies with the Boy Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his bachelor's degree in horticulture in 1937 from
Pennsylvania State University and a doctoral degree in genetics from
Harvard University in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   Rick and his wife, Martha, moved to Davis in 1940, when he joined
the faculty of the university's vegetable crops department.</TE>
<TE>   He began his research on the tomato the same year when a senior
faculty member suggested that Rick investigate what was wrong with
"bull" tomato plants, which seemed to pour all their energy into
vegetative growth without producing fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Rick went on to discover many genetic conditions in the sterile
tomato plants, and was able to identify the genetic causes for flower
infertility and define several single-gene mutants that are now used
to provide commercial hybrid tomato seed.</TE>
<TE>   His studies led him to begin his pioneering effort to map the
tomato's entire collection of genes, now known as its genome.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage tomato researchers to communicate their findings and
exchange information, Rick co-founded the Tomato Genetics Cooperative
in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   About that time, he also founded and served as curator for the
Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis, the largest known
collection of tomato seeds in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many primitive varieties and wild species that were collected and
maintained at the center are now extinct in their native habitats,
according to the university's scientists.</TE>
<TE>   And many of the unique mutant tomato stocks developed by
researchers throughout the world would have been lost without Rick's
efforts to archive them.</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of his efforts, the center was renamed the Charles
M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he was inducted into the American Society of
Horticultural Sciences Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Until he retired for health reasons at 85, Rick continued to ride
his bicycle to the university every morning as a professor emeritus,
and he worked summers in a 3-acre tomato field in Yolo County.</TE>
<TE>   "He clearly did the work because of his love of biology and his
love of discovery," said Yoder. "The other remarkable thing with him
was his ability to share that love of scientific discovery, and he
was a real role model for a number of people."</TE>
<TE>   His wife died in 1983. He is survived by his daughter, Susan
Baldi, of Santa Rosa; his son, John, of Menlo Park; three
grandchildren; and a great-grandson.</TE>
<TE>   A scholarship fund is being established in Rick's memory that will
help support South American students and scholars interested in
promoting biodiversity in the Andes. Contributions should be made
payable to the Charles Rick Scholarship Fund and sent in care of
Professor John Yoder, Department of Vegetable Crops, University of
California, 1 Shields Ave., Davis, CA 95616-8687.</TE>

<HD>Priest's Abuse Case Dates to '67</HD>
<DH>Molestation: L.A. Archdiocese did not remove Father G.
Neville Rucker until April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Archdiocese knew for three decades about 1967 child
abuse accusations against Father G. Neville Rucker, a retired priest
living at Corpus Christi church in Pacific Palisades until his April
23 removal.</LD>
<LD>   Rucker was ordered to move from the Corpus Christi rectory and
permanently leave the ministry as Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and other
prelates met last month at the Vatican to discuss the growing sex
abuse crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Rucker is last of the seven Los Angeles Archdiocese priests forced
out of the ministry this year after Mahony began enforcing a
zero-tolerance policy for clerics accused of sexual abuse. The policy
was included in a $5.2-million lawsuit settlement last year involving
the Orange and Los Angeles dioceses.</LD>
<TE>   The 82-year-old priest was accused of molesting two 9-year-old
girls at St. Anthony parish in El Segundo during the 1960s, according
to a police report and court records. Rucker at the time denied any
misconduct at the church, where he served as associate pastor from
1962 to 1967. He did not respond to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker's forced departure from Corpus Christi came 35 years after
Mahony's predecessor, then-Bishop Timothy Manning, persuaded the
mother of one of the El Segundo girls not to press criminal charges.
Manning asked the woman to let the church deal with Rucker, according
to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese moved Rucker to four other parishes before he was
made pastor at Corpus Christi in 1979. He was allowed to live there
and continue to live there after his retirement in 1987. Corpus
Christi, like St. Anthony and three of the other parishes where he
worked, operates its own elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuit Filed Against Archdiocese in 1993</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim whose mother was persuaded against pursuing
criminal charges against Rucker filed a lawsuit against the
archdiocese in 1993, alleging childhood sexual abuse and negligence.
Two years later, the priest settled the lawsuit with a confidential
$20,000 payment.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, now 44, is angry that parishioners of the Pacific
Palisades church were never told of the accusations or the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "I put the archdiocese on notice that he was living at a parish
with a school," said the woman, who lives in Northern California. The
Times does not identify victims of alleged sexual abuse without their
permission.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone at that parish should have been told," the woman said.
She filed the lawsuit, she said, after archdiocese officials "told me
to keep my mouth shut" when she asked that church members be warned
about Rucker.</TE>
<TE>   "I was incensed," the woman said.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman, confirmed the 1967 police
investigation of Rucker. "There were no allegations in years
following that investigation. He was living in retirement at Corpus
Christi when he left," Tamberg said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker now lives at Nazareth House, an assisted-living facility
for priests in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of five retired priests ousted from the ministry by
Mahony since February. The cardinal also removed two active priests,
the Rev. Michael Wempe, who was working as the chaplain at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and the Rev. Carl Sutphin, associate
pastor of the new downtown Los Angeles cathedral. Wempe also lived at
a parish that operates a school.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Rucker are contained in a 1967 El Segundo
police report. Rucker told police he did nothing wrong, the report
said, and the girl denied being molested.</TE>
<TE>   But days later, the girl's mother said her daughter told her,
"Father Rucker has been touching me where he should not," according
to the police report.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than press charges against Rucker, the mother told police
she had spoken to Bishop Manning, who later became Los Angeles'
cardinal, and "he would like the church to take care of the matter,
and he would see that it was done properly," the police report said.</TE>
<TE>   The police report includes the woman's signed refusal to file
charges. "I just want the father helped and feel the church can best
do it," the mother wrote.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified parent in the same 1967 police report alleged that
a daughter of hers was molested by Rucker. That second girl told
detectives that Rucker "looks away and talks about things as if he is
not doing it," according to the police report.</TE>
<TE>   That girl also told police she saw another youngster
molested--identifying the girl who years later sued the priest. Two
other girls told police the second girl was prone to "to make up
stories," the report said. El Segundo police said they cannot
determine the outcome of the other allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after police closed the case, the archdiocese
transferred Rucker to St. Teresa of Avila in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He was transferred seven months later to Holy Trinity in Los
Angeles and then to Holy Cross church in September 1968. He went on
to St. Agatha church in Los Angeles in July 1970. In 1979, the Iowa
native became pastor at Corpus Christi.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Cited Statute of Limitations</TE>
<TE>   Rucker was known among members of the wealthy Pacific Palisades
parish for his love of music. He helped persuade a donor to buy an
expensive church organ.</TE>
<TE>   He was sued, along with the archdiocese, in 1993 by the woman who
alleged that he had molested her between June 1966 and May 1967. In
the lawsuit, she said her memory of events had been suppressed until
1991, when another alleged victim of Rucker told her of a similar
experience.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's attorney in a court filing warned the archdiocese that
Rucker was living a parish with a school. A Los Angeles Superior
Court judge dismissed the case against the archdiocese in July 1994,
citing the statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker's attorney denied the allegations and argued that the woman
was suffering from false memories created by a therapist. Rucker
later settled his part of the lawsuit in October 1994, paying $20,000
without acknowledging any misconduct, according to those familiar
with the settlement.</TE>

<HD>Miramar Developer Revises Building Plans</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miramar Hotel developer Ian Schrager has revised his rebuilding
plans, deciding to reconstruct the coastal landmark in stages rather
than all at once.</LD>
<LD>   "In many ways, we would rather wait, follow our original plan and
build the entire Miramar project all at once," the New York-based
hotelier said in a statement. "Yet we listened to the community and
the message was loud and clear ... to get started on this project."</LD>
<LD>   During a meeting in late February, he faced an unforgiving crowd
of about 150 people who called the half-demolished hotel an
embarrassing eyesore and demanded it be rebuilt as quickly as
possible.</LD>
<TE>   Schrager is proposing initially to renovate all of the Miramar
cottages and guest buildings and to landscape the entire 17-acre
site. During that first phase, the hotel's new restaurant, pool area,
beachside bar and tennis courts also would be built. Construction of
the spa, lobby, banquet hall and parking structure would be delayed
until the second phase of the project.</TE>

<LD>A four-alarm predawn blaze destroyed 18 townhouses under construction
and damaged City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The fire broke out at the construction site at 2:15 a.m. Thursday.
The cause is under investigation, but officials suspect arson.</LD>
<LD>   Heat from the blaze shattered windows and damaged equipment inside
some City Hall offices, including fire administration and fire
prevention.</LD>
<TE>   The flames were controlled by about 3:30 a.m., but smoke belched
from the charred ruins for hours.</TE>
<TE>   The fire caused at least $1.5 million damage to the townhouses and
$500,000 damage to City Hall, said Fire Marshal Dean Montevago.</TE>

<LD>When surfer Rhyn Noll takes to the street, he takes up a lot of
street. That's because Noll has built what may be the longest
skateboard on record.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-foot-long monster is being considered for inclusion in the
Guinness Book of World Records.</LD>
<LD>   The obvious question: Dude, why'd you do it?</LD>
<TE>   "Just for the heck of it," Noll said.</TE>
<TE>   Official judges, including Mayor Herb Kolodner, measured every
aspect of the board, even the amount of flex when the 200-pound Noll
stood on the unsupported middle. The panel will submit its findings
to Guinness.</TE>

<LD>Monterey County Supervisor Dave Potter has been reappointed to the
California Coastal Commission.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the panel since 1997, Potter mounted a heavy push to
keep the seat controlled by new Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Los
Angeles).</LD>
<LD>   The speaker appoints four of the 12 commissioners, including one
county supervisor or City Council member from the Central Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Potter said he was concerned the new speaker would give the seat
to an official from Santa Cruz or San Mateo counties. Wesson also
reappointed La Jolla businessman Patrick Kruer to the coastal panel,
and named Half Moon Bay City Councilwoman Deborah Ruddock as Potter's
alternate.</TE>

<LD>A Tijuana police officer was arrested this week, accused of trying to
smuggle 5 kilos of methamphetamine into the United States, officials
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Francisco Garcia Peralta was detained by U.S. Customs
officials at the San Ysidro port of entry Wednesday afternoon after a
drug-sniffing dog alerted agents to the narcotics hidden in the
police officer's van, said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the San
Diego office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The
INS said inspectors also found $27,000 hidden inside the vehicle's
hood.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia, a patrol officer for the Tijuana Police Department's
tourist division, has been on the force for five years. He remains in
custody in San Diego and is scheduled to enter a plea May 30.</LD>

<HD>Panel Asked to Study Credit Costs of Breakup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council on Friday asked the commission studying San Fernando
Valley secession to determine whether a breakup would lower Los
Angeles' bond rating and drive up its debt costs.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted unanimously to request that the Local Agency
Formation Commission respond to concerns raised by a bond-rating firm
about the effect of secession on Los Angeles' credit standing.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch Ratings issued a report Thursday that warned investors of a
possible downgrading in Los Angeles' bond rating if the Valley breaks
off.</LD>
<TE>   "LAFCO said they talked to bond-rating agencies and they said
there would be no effect," said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. "This
refutes that analysis."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine said he will conduct any
further analysis the commission requests but that the proposed terms
of a Valley secession ensure that it would not weaken Los Angeles'
ability to pay its bond debt.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is set to decide Wednesday whether to place Valley
secession on the November ballot. It is also reviewing secession
plans for the harbor area and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   City Administrative Officer William Fujioka said Fitch Ratings has
indicated that a Valley city's credit standing would be uncertain, at
least at first. That's because it is unknown what sort of policies
such a city would adopt, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Valley VOTE's bond advisors have concluded that a Valley
city's assets would allow it to borrow money if necessary, said Jeff
Brain, president of the pro-secession group. Brain said two other
bond-rating companies have not offered negative forecasts related to
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Another secession leader, Richard Close, questioned the
objectivity of the Fitch report, noting that Los Angeles has paid the
firm in the past to evaluate bonds. But Hahn said the city neither
requested nor paid for Fitch's forecast on secession.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hahn said LAFCO has no legal authority to set aside
bond debt to make the harbor cityhood plan work.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine is studying whether relieving a harbor city of its
estimated share of Los Angeles' bond debt would make the proposed
municipality financially viable. LAFCO says it has the discretion to
excuse such liabilities.</TE>

<LD>Two men were arrested Thursday in connection with the alleged theft
of 15 Toyota Camrys last week in the Santa Clarita Valley,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Gordon, 25, and Jonathan Robert Gautreaux, 19, both of Santa
Clarita, were apprehended as they allegedly tried to steal a 16th car
at a Canyon Country shopping center, said Lt. Larry Gump of the Santa
Clarita sheriff's station. Another suspect is still at large.</LD>
<LD>   At least eight cars were stolen between Sunday and Tuesday, Gump
said, adding that investigators believe other people are involved in
the car theft ring that targeted vehicles in Newhall and Canyon
Country. Four of the Camrys--one of the most frequently stolen cars
in the nation--have been recovered.</LD>

<DH>Schools: Teacher sees educational value in using five 'Star
Wars' movies as basis for lessons in literature, math, social
studies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As movie critics and theatergoers argue over the aesthetic values of
the newest "Star Wars" film, one group of Los Angeles first-graders
is debating the series' ethical values.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the curriculum in teacher Ellen Brown's classroom orbits
around math, literature and social studies lessons that she said are
shaped by George Lucas' five space movies.</LD>
<LD>   So while fans line up for tickets to "Star Wars: Episode
II--Attack of the Clones," her 6- and 7-year-olds at the Mirman
School in Bel-Air clamor to answer game show-style quiz questions
about personal values and moral themes depicted in the movies.
"Values for 5," shouts out Alex Wissmann, 7, who sits beneath "Star
Wars" posters and a wall covered with pupil-written essays based on
the film. A boom box plays the familiar John Williams score to help
set the mood.</LD>
<TE>   With a flourish, Brown pulls a card numbered "5" that is taped to
the blackboard. "The rebels had to work together to be successful,"
she reads from the back of the card.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows cooperation!" Alex answers.</TE>
<TE>   "Responsibility!" chimes in 7-year-old Natalie Rawson.</TE>
<TE>   "Courage!" pipes up Revel Rosa, also 7.</TE>
<TE>   "That works for me," Brown shoots back. "The movie shows us that
it is a lot easier to go along, but the rebels said the Empire is
doing things that hurt people, so they did something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a slight and 40ish Van Nuys resident who resembles the
children's book figure "Miss Frizzle," looks like she should be
stepping off "The Magic School Bus" instead of a Nebulon-B Light
Cruiser starship.</TE>
<TE>   She has taught parts of her classes around a "Star Wars"
curriculum since 1981, when she and a friend, sixth-grade teacher
Anita Russell, devised the intergalactic study plan. Russell uses the
movie curriculum to teach literature and language at Fairfield School
in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's class is made up of high achievers capable of working at
up to the third-grade level. That makes them prime pupils for
arithmetic problems based on galactic light-year measurements and
droid robot-bolt numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Jedi Knight characters illustrate social studies lessons with
"light-side traits" such as perseverance, forgiveness and kindness
and "dark-side traits" that include self-doubt, revenge and anger,
said Brown, who shows "Star Wars" movie tapes to her students.</TE>
<TE>   Parents sometimes roll their eyes when they first hear of the
movie-themed lesson plans. "But before it's over, they're saying,
'May the Force be with you,'" Brown joked.</TE>
<TE>   Encino parent Susan Wolf is a believer. Her 12-year-old son,
Brandon, was in Brown's class five years ago. "It's stayed with him.
It's a real thought-provoking experience," Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Ziff, a Cal State Los Angeles education professor who has
worked with Brown in the past, said the "Star Wars" lessons encourage
bright students to become risk-takers, something they need "to make
the most of opportunities that are available to them."</TE>
<TE>   Recess ends Brown's "Star Wars" lesson. Instead of light-saber
sword fights, there is a spirited playground handball game. Still,
the kids have "Star Wars" on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Six-year-old Tom Roush visualizes himself as Luke Skywalker. So
does Adam Zucker, 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned that good is stronger than evil," Tom said.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes there can be close calls, Adam added. "My heart was
beating so fast in 'Return of the Jedi' when the Empire was throwing
lightning bolts at Luke. But Darth Vader saved him just in time."</TE>

<HD>2 Merchants Sue Ojai Over Remodeling</HD>
<DH>Courts: Owners say the project is hurting business. They
want to prevent the city from blocking access to stores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two downtown business owners have sued the city of Ojai over an
ongoing remodeling project that they allege is driving away business
and making it difficult for them to stay afloat in the
tourism-dependent town.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of Busy Babes Beauty Supply and Salon and luggage store
Studio Sauvageau are seeking a court order to prevent the city from
closing or blocking their businesses during the Arcade Plaza
remodeling project. They contend that the work, which began April 29,
has severely restricted access to their storefronts.</LD>
<LD>   An amended version of the lawsuit was filed Monday in Ventura
County Superior Court by Lisa Clark, owner of Busy Babes, and Lisa
Sauvageau, who owns the high-end luggage shop.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a big fence blocking the door," said their attorney,
David Jones, referring to Clark's shop. "There's bulldozers,
port-a-potties and dirt and rubble that people have to walk by. It's
very imposing."</TE>
<TE>   He said they filed suit after the city rejected a settlement offer
that would have compensated Clark $350 a day each time she was forced
to close her store. The city said Clark should seek reimbursement
after the damages occur.</TE>
<TE>   The shops front the Arcade Plaza between Matilija Street and Ojai
Avenue, which is undergoing a $1.6-million renovation, including the
planting of 30 new trees and the installation of brick sidewalks,
restrooms, chairs and benches and a fountain that will serve as the
plaza's centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   But some downtown merchants are concerned that the noise, dust and
barricades are driving away customers during the area's busiest
season after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost our local trade pretty much," said Melony Vance, owner
of Local Hero Books, which is not party to the suit. "Parking is too
difficult, driving around is too difficult and access is too
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Monte Widders said the lawsuit will be referred to the
city's insurance adjustor, which likely will seek to have it
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly understand that small businesses have to struggle
through this kind of construction and that it can be disruptive,"
said City Manager Dan Singer. "But I feel this is an exemplary
project as far as our outreach to businesses and the community."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that the city opened a Web site devoted to news and
updates on the project, paid for signs and advertising for the
affected businesses and hired a liaison to work with the merchants
and the public.</TE>
<TE>   The final results of the project, which is scheduled for
completion in November, should be worth the trade-off, said Vance,
whose independent bookstore and cafe uses the now-closed patio area
for readings and other events during the spring and summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impacted all of us," she said, referring to the two dozen
businesses around the plaza.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A flood of last-minute suggestions about how to make television news
gathering safer may slow implementation of the nation's first safety
rules for TV trucks, state officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 people submitted testimony to state Occupational
Safety and Health Standards Board members who met Thursday to hammer
out safety requirements for microwave vans used for news show "live
shots."</LD>
<LD>   The Cal-OSHA action was prompted by the near-electrocution of
KABC-TV reporter Adrienne Alpert two years ago. She lost her lower
right leg, left forearm, part of her left foot and several fingers on
her right hand when the antenna mast on her news van struck
high-voltage electric lines.</LD>
<TE>   New safety equipment for vans and special training for news crews
have been demanded by local members of the National Assn. of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians-Communications Workers of
America, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the
International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees.</TE>
<TE>   They contend the public is endangered by potential electric shock
from TV trucks because some mast-raising safety switches have been
tampered with to enable news crews to work faster.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcast companies protested the unions' proposal for quarterly
inspections of vans, however, suggesting that yearly checks of the
mast safety equipment is sufficient.</TE>

<LD>Two children in Oxnard have contracted a rare form of salmonella by
eating contaminated Mexican cantaloupe, Ventura County public health
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The children, both under 5 and from separate families, are
recovering at home after being diagnosed with the illness in late
April, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The type of salmonella, called poona, has been traced to
cantaloupe sold under the Susie brand, officials said. The company
has voluntarily recalled 25,000 boxes of the fruit. No deaths have
been reported. Symptoms include fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.</LD>

<HD>New Quake Warning System Is Discussed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Research is underway into an earthquake early warning system that
would allow buildings to be "stiffened" to cope with violent quakes
just seconds before they occur, a Caltech seismologist said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, the weak primary waves that begin a quake would be
analyzed by instruments, which would send an electronic signal to
flex a building for the violent secondary waves that would hit
seconds later.</LD>
<LD>   Hiroo Kanamori, one of the nation's leading earthquake authorities
and a member of an international panel of scientists studying the
idea, sketched out the proposed system Friday at a session of the
Caltech Earthquake Research Affiliates, a group organized by the
Caltech Seismological Laboratory. It was attended by dozens of
Southern California disaster officials, both in the public and
private sectors.</LD>
<TE>   The early warning system would work differently than current ones,
which detect shaking that starts far from an urban area and signals
that the temblor will reach the city in a minute or two.</TE>
<TE>   Such a system is in effect in Mexico City, which is often jolted
by quakes that strike 200 miles away on the Pacific coast. With that
system, sirens sound and residents are supposed to take cover, stop
elevators, shut off the gas and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   But in the system outlined by Kanamori, the warnings probably
would be "site specific," or designed for a single building, which
would be fitted with instruments to analyze the primary waves within
three seconds. Characteristics of those waves would reveal whether a
major quake is underway.</TE>
<TE>   The system would then prepare the building by adjusting dampers
designed to cushion the shock and by initiating magnetic systems--to
be developed in the future--that would protect the building. It would
also shut down utility lines and sound a warning.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Goltz, an official with the state Office of Emergency
Services, told the group that California might be prepared to fund a
pilot project that would test the system in a high-rise building.</TE>
<TE>   Goltz said the state and federally funded Trinet system of seismic
recording stations has conducted a survey that indicated potential
public interest, but also found that the state could face liability
lawsuits should things go wrong. It might prove legally touchy if the
state installed the system in some buildings, but not in others.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, if a system similar to Mexico's were installed
in Southern California, it could warn Los Angeles officials of, say,
a quake beginning in the Imperial Valley, said Egill Hauksson, a
Caltech seismologist. Such a system is close to fruition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kanamori cautioned that a building-specific system could take a
century to fully develop.</TE>

<LD>Colombian soldiers and investigators reached the site of an intense
clash between rebels and an outlawed paramilitary group and found
about 50 corpses.</LD>
<LD>   Near the village of Alto de Minas in northwestern Colombia, they
counted 47 dead men and one dead woman in uniforms of the United
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, an anti-guerrilla militia. The
guerrillas were believed to have carried their dead away.</LD>
<LD>   Rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
apparently launched a surprise attack Tuesday on the paramilitary
fighters as they camped outside Alto de Minas, 190 miles northwest of
Bogota, the capital.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Germany's Parliament passed legislation allowing about 50,000 gay men
prosecuted by the Nazis because of their sexuality to be pardoned,
even posthumously.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation also amended a 1998 law to make it easier to quash
convictions against deserters from the German army between 1933 and
1945.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-gay measures passed in 1935 formed part of a Nazi philosophy
that deemed homosexuals alien to the state's aim to create a
"super-race." Those convicted faced up to 10 years in prison or
concentration camps, where thousands died.</LD>

<LD>German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder won a court ruling designed to
end speculation that he dyes his full mane of dark hair--and boost
his credibility four months before elections.</LD>
<LD>   A Hamburg state court ordered German news agency DDP not to repeat
a report that he dyes his hair, saying the agency failed to properly
research its story. The ruling applies just to DDP but serves as a
warning to other German media.</LD>
<LD>   With a struggling economy and a strong conservative challenger,
the image-conscious Schroeder faced enough problems even before the
color of his hair became entangled in politics and questions about
his credibility.</LD>

<LD>Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was poised for victory in
parliamentary elections his party was odds-on favorite to win.</LD>
<LD>   As polls closed, state broadcaster RTE estimated voter turnout as
high as 70% in some of Ireland's 42 constituencies, despite stormy
weather in much of the country. About 3million people were eligible
to vote.</LD>
<LD>   The only questions were whether Ahern's Fianna Fail would be the
first party to take an overall majority in the 166-seat Parliament
since 1977 and how many seats would go to hard-line Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army.</LD>

<HD>Carter Hopes His Cuba Visit Fosters Ties</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: As he ends his trip, the former president says
he will brief the White House before Bush's planned policy address.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Calling for closer ties between the U.S. and Cuba in everything from
policing bio-terrorism to curing AIDS, former President Carter ended
a five-day visit here Friday saying he will brief the White House
before President Bush delivers a major Cuban policy address Monday.</LD>
<LD>   After an exhausting visit that included hours of talks with
President Fidel Castro, visits to biotech research centers and food
markets, a live televised address to the Cuban people and detailed
discussions with dissidents, Carter expressed hope that he had sowed
some seeds for change.</LD>
<LD>   "After 43 years of misunderstanding and animosity, I realize one
brief visit cannot change the basic relations between our people,"
Carter told reporters shortly before leaving Havana. "But our hope is
that in some small way our visit will improve that situation."</LD>
<TE>   Carter aide Robert A. Pastor said, "I think President Carter
injected a very powerful idea into two body politics.... No one any
longer can ignore the power of the idea that there is an alternative
to trading insults."</TE>
<TE>   As a first step, Carter said he will fax recommendations to Bush
today. The president, who rejected Carter's appeal this week to lift
the four-decade embargo on the island, is expected to announce an
even tougher line toward this Communist-run nation next week while
campaigning in Florida for his brother. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush is
up for reelection, and Florida has a strong voting bloc of Cuban
Americans, many of whom oppose Castro's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Another Carter initiative outlined here Friday by his aides takes
a far longer view. The delegation turned over to the Cubans a
foot-thick volume of newly declassified documents covering secret
U.S. negotiations with the Castro government during Carter's 1977-81
presidential term. The talks, aimed at restoring normal relations
between the two countries, ultimately failed.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor, who served as national security advisor on Latin America
during Carter's term, said the delegation requested similar documents
this week from the Cubans. He said he hopes both governments can
study them and learn lessons "that may be of use if we decide to try
it again."</TE>
<TE>   Carter indicated that jump-starting such an effort was not among
his mission's objectives, which he described as holding extensive
conversations with Castro, government officials, dissidents and other
Cubans and then sharing what he learned with the White House, the
State Department and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   While renewing his appeal to end the embargo, which he called "an
imposition on the human rights of American citizens" because it
denies them free travel to and trade with Cuba, Carter also used his
news conference Friday to share some of the messages he'll deliver to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Carter quoted the approximately two dozen Cuban dissidents--many
of them former political prisoners--he met with privately Thursday as
strongly urging the Bush administration not to fund their
pro-democracy projects and causes. To do so, they said, would be
undermine their struggle for the very ideals of freedom Bush says he
hopes to promote in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban government casts the dissidents as paid American agents
and calls the ambitious Varela Project an American import. The
project's leaders spent a year gathering 11,020 signatures on
petitions calling for a referendum on greater freedom. They delivered
the petitions to Cuba's National Assembly last week.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, who defended the Varela Project during his television
address as a home-grown Cuban effort, noted that tens of millions of
people here learned of the effort from his speech.</TE>
<TE>   The former president praised Castro for allowing him to speak
uncensored to the Cuban people and for publishing a verbatim
transcript of the address in Granma, the Communist Party's daily
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   But Carter stopped short of predicting that the airing either
augured a new opening by the regime or might lead to a backlash of
repression after he leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "What the effect will be, I have no way to ascertain," Carter
said. "It's too early to assess the final reaction of the Cuban
government to this unprecedented ability to exchange ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Carter said he had "long discussions" with Castro about the Varela
Project and believes that Cuba has yet to decide how to deal with the
dissident effort.</TE>
<TE>   On the bio-terrorism issue that had opened his visit and sent the
biggest ripples back to Washington, Carter acknowledged that Cuba's
technology could be used to manufacture and wage germ warfare and
that Havana had shared that technology with about two dozen nations.</TE>
<TE>   He had caused controversy Monday when he raised doubts about the
contention of U.S. administration conservatives that Cuba was
exporting technology that could be used to make biological weapons,
saying the White House, State Department and intelligence officials
who briefed him for the trip never raised such allegations.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Carter encouraged the Bush administration and Castro's
government to reach agreements permitting the joint monitoring of any
such projects and manufacturing plants abroad in which Cuba played a
role.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when asked whether he feared that Castro had gained more
than he had from the trip, the former president flashed a trademark
grin and said: "No. I don't have any fear of about whether President
Castro looks better after my visit or whether I look better."</TE>
<TE>   That is not, he added, why he came.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Surfers See More of Net</HD>
<DH>Asia: The government lifts restrictions on some major
foreign Web sites. But it's unclear what prompted the change, or
whether it's permanent.</DH>

<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>

<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government has lifted--at least temporarily--its
restrictions on access to the Web sites of some major foreign media
outlets, including The Times and the Washington Post.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning earlier this week, Internet users in Beijing and
Shanghai were able to log on to such sites directly, without
resorting to the tricks--such as using proxy servers--they have had
to employ to get around the Communist government's electronic
firewalls.</LD>
<LD>   Censors here have long blocked the Web sites of many Western news
organizations on the grounds that the content might prove harmful or
subversive to Chinese society. On Friday, some sites, such as Voice
of America and a few overseas Chinese-language news agencies,
remained off-limits.</LD>
<TE>   But other previously taboo sites, including those of CNN, Reuters
and Associated Press, were accessible.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how long the liberalization would last--or whether
it was an accident, an experiment or a quiet shift in policy.
Requests for information Friday went unanswered by public security
officials and the Ministry of Information Industry.</TE>
<TE>   The government has lifted its Internet blackout on foreign media
before, most recently in October when President Bush came to China
for a summit of Pacific Rim leaders. But such moves are usually
short-lived and have been seen more as an exercise in public
relations than a commitment to greater openness. Controls are usually
reimposed a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, no major Western leaders are in town,
prompting speculation over what led to the loosening of controls.</TE>
<TE>   One intriguing explanation centers on behind-the-scenes infighting
and factionalism among China's top leaders, who are jockeying for
position as they prepare for a major Communist Party reshuffle this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   According to this theory, members of the party's liberal wing have
been irritated by President Jiang Zemin's widely assumed efforts to
cling to power, despite expectations that he will step down as
general secretary of the party this fall and as president next year.
Jiang is believed to want to stay on as chairman of the country's
Central Military Commission, the body that ultimately determines who
wields power.</TE>
<TE>   By agreeing to relax controls on the Internet, Jiang can throw "a
sop to the liberals" who advocate greater openness and who want to
see a total shift to a new generation of leaders this fall, said a
Western analyst here who closely follows the Internet in China.</TE>
<TE>   He added that such a move is relatively painless, because plenty
of China's 36 million Internet users are savvy enough to find ways to
access forbidden Web sites. And those who are sufficiently fluent in
English to check out sites such as The Times' are relatively few.</TE>
<TE>   Others speculate that the government has opened access to some
sites because it wants to attract foreign investors to its
telecommunications industry, which is about to lift a long-standing
ban against such investment. Easing restrictions on the Internet
could make the industry appear more modern and inviting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another explanation is that Beijing can now afford to relax
its ban because it has greater capability to track who is visiting
sensitive sites--and therefore compile dossiers on such users.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, officers who monitor the Internet have become fixtures on
the police forces of most, if not all, of China's big cities.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of the durability of the latest liberalization could
come in a few weeks. June 4 marks the 13th anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square massacre, during which hundreds and perhaps
thousands of democracy demonstrators were killed by security forces.
The state usually tightens controls on speech around that date to
discourage any show of dissent or remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   "June 4 will be the real test," the Western analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   China has struggled to strike a balance between controlling
information and encouraging Internet development as a key to
prospering in the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has prosecuted a high-profile campaign to weed out
pornography from Chinese cyberspace. It also has cracked down on
unregistered Internet cafes, shutting down hundreds in the nation.</TE>

<HD>British-Led Coalition Strike Leaves 2 Enemy Fighters Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Amid the incessant roar of C-130 troop transports and Apache
helicopter gunships, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the anti-terrorism
coalition deployed Friday to the mountains of eastern Afghanistan in
a powerful show of force against Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters who
had ambushed two Australian patrols.</LD>
<LD>   The first confrontation with enemy forces in weeks left at least a
couple of the suspected terrorists dead and others surrounded by
British Royal Marines leading Operation Condor, a swiftly
orchestrated mission to quell "a substantial enemy force" maneuvering
at the 8,000-foot level of pine-covered mountains in Paktia province.</LD>
<LD>   "They shot at us," U.S. Army spokesman Maj. Bryan Hilferty said by
way of explaining the decisive response that brought to an abrupt end
a spate of low-key missions that did not encounter any Taliban or Al
Qaeda operatives.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the troops dispatched in dozens of predawn sorties were
Royal Marines who had returned only three days earlier from the
16-day Operation Snipe, which sought out and destroyed weapons caches
of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   No combat casualties or face-to-face encounters with the enemy
occurred in Operation Snipe, as was the case with a four-day
Canadian-led sweep of the Tora Bora region this month and a three-day
search by U.S. Special Forces of mountains overlooking Khowst
airport, where American troops have been repeatedly fired at by
unidentified forces.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid response after the two Australian special services
patrols, operating about four miles apart, were fired on Thursday by
heavy machine guns demonstrated the need to maintain major battle
readiness, Hilferty noted.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't send an entire infantry battalion into the field if you
don't have that on hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the three recent missions failed to see much fighting, there
had been hints--particularly from the British ranks of the U.S.-led
coalition--that it might be time to wind down the fight against
terrorism in this country that six months ago was ruled by Taliban
allies of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition troops have orders to "close with the enemy and destroy
them," British Brig. Roger Lane told reporters, adding that the
region to which his troops deployed is known to have been a Taliban
stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Mission to Continue for Several Days</TE>
<TE>   "I can confirm the coalition has made contact with the enemy; some
have been killed," said Lane, who commands the 1,700 British forces
in the coalition. "The situation is fluid. I imagine the operation
will continue for [several] days."</TE>
<TE>   He and others declined to say later whether further casualties
were inflicted or suffered.</TE>
<TE>   The large deployment from this wind-battered airfield 30 miles
north of the capital, Kabul, was ordered after the Australian troops
reported that they had been ambushed while patrolling an area that
Lane said was north of Khowst but relatively distant from the
Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty, who declined to be specific, citing reasons of mission
security, said the firefight took place between 12 and 30 miles from
the porous border, across which most surviving Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces were thought to have fled in March after Operation Anaconda, a
major battle in eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck, commander of the 17,000
coalition troops and special forces in Afghanistan, had warned a week
ago that it was too early to talk of scaling back capabilities here
because the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, though on the run, remain a
credible and well-organized threat.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we try to do is be unpredictable," Hilferty
said of the overnight buildup. "We want to get inside the enemy's
decision cycles so they don't know what to expect. Right now
Afghanistan has no safe havens for terrorists, because if they try to
get a little group together to have a convention, we're going to be
the uninvited guests."</TE>
<TE>   Royal Marines made up the bulk of the mission because they are
based here and were therefore closer to the battleground than U.S.
troops, most of whom are stationed near the city of Kandahar in the
south. U.S. forces, however, flew troops to the region and provided
air support with Apache helicopters, B-52 bombers, an array of
fighter jets and AWACS surveillance planes, and A-10 Warthog
tank-busting aircraft, Hilferty said.</TE>
<TE>   Incessant air operations continued through the day despite howling
winds that kicked up dust, obscuring visibility and complicating
helicopter operations.</TE>
<TE>   The latest mission in the 7-month-old military campaign against Al
Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan came together with precision
despite the spread of a mysterious illness that has now stricken 40
British soldiers, at least eight of whom were airlifted to hospitals
in Europe. One soldier was so ill that the medical evacuation
aircraft diverted to Ramstein Air Base in Germany rather than fly an
additional 90 minutes to Britain.</TE>
<TE>   22 More British Soldiers Reported With Illness</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen British soldiers, all assigned to a field hospital
detachment here, had been diagnosed with "meningitis-like" symptoms
Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, an order to examine all British
forces turned up 22 more cases of soldiers suffering fever, vomiting,
dehydration and diarrhea. One of the more recently afflicted was an
anesthesiologist flown in from Britain to help treat the first wave
of sufferers. He has been placed in isolation since returning to
Britain and reporting similar symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Two experts in communicable diseases were being brought into
Bagram to examine the remaining patients and 334 more under
quarantine at Camp Gibraltar, the British sector of the base here.
Cause of the intestinal disorder has yet to be determined, but Lt.
Col. Ben Curry, a Royal Marines spokesman here, said enemy sabotage
had all but been ruled out. None of those afflicted had taken part in
recent missions, and food provided to the British troops came from
outside Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,500 coalition troops are stationed at Bagram, but so far
the illness has afflicted only British soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working very closely with the British to contain the
infection and are of course keeping a close watch on our troops,"
said Hilferty, the Army spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Cites a Condition for Palestinian Poll</HD>
<DH>Elections: Israeli army must pull back, he says. Advisors
say timetable is still within six months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A day after promising elections within six months, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat said Friday that voting would not
take place until Israel withdrew from the occupied territories.</LD>
<LD>   Asked by reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah when polling
would take place, the Palestinian leader responded: "As soon as [the
Israelis] finish this occupation from our land."</LD>
<LD>   His statement came even as Israeli soldiers continued their
strikes against West Bank targets.</LD>
<TE>   Aides and advisors Friday sought to downplay suggestions that
Arafat was introducing new conditions in order to put off a
referendum on his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking to run the election within six months," said
Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, adding that the Palestinians were
saying Israeli forces should first withdraw to positions held before
the current Palestinian uprising began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see any big difference between the position of various
people about when elections will be held," said Marwan Kanafani, an
Arafat advisor. "We have to give the president the benefit of the
doubt until he makes himself clear."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Arafat has come under intense pressure at home
and abroad to hold elections, reform his Palestinian Authority, stamp
out corruption, make institutions more democratic and overhaul the
government's judiciary and security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat issued a vague pledge Wednesday to hold elections, leading
to calls by Palestinian legislators for balloting to be held within
six months. He committed to that timetable Thursday, but he has a
history of failing to deliver on reform promises that threaten to
undermine his power as sole decision-maker.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the 72-year-old leader appeared to be introducing a new
condition, Israeli soldiers were on the offensive in the West Bank
city of Jenin, killing one Palestinian and arresting 24 others,
including two on Israel's wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   The army moved into the adjacent Jenin refugee camp--the site of
the fiercest fighting during Israel's recent five-week offensive--
before dawn as part of a sweep for suspected Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   In other violence, a 7-year-old boy was shot to death by Israeli
soldiers near Nablus on his way to prayers with his father, the
Palestinian Red Crescent Society said. The army said it would
investigate, as several hundred people marched with the boy's body
resting on a makeshift stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military also said Friday that it shot and killed an
armed Palestinian in the Gaza Strip after he approached a fence
surrounding the Jewish settlement of Dugit and threw grenades at
soldiers. The radical Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade later identified the
man as a member.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Israeli forces have shifted their strategy away
from large-scale incursions in favor of faster, limited attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel has no intention whatsoever to reoccupy the city of Jenin
or the refugee camp," said Gideon Meir, a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
adding that Friday's action was a pinpoint attack against suspects
who reentered the camp after soldiers pulled out last month.</TE>
<TE>   As the body count mounted, Israel vowed to maintain its tough
stance. At the same time, the radical Islamic movement Hamas said it
would continue attacks against Israel pending the creation of a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   A key question amid all the election speculation is whether
radical Palestinian groups such as Hamas would participate.</TE>
<TE>   Kanafani said most people within the Palestinian Authority want
full participation to ensure that the outcome is as representative as
possible and that radical groups won't act as spoilers. But the
decision is ultimately up to those organizations, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil Shikaki, a pollster and political analyst, said it's
unlikely that Arafat would garner as much popular support in any
upcoming election as he did in 1996, when he won 88% of the vote.
Still, Arafat is the only obvious candidate for president and is not
expected to face any serious challenger, Shikaki said.</TE>

<HD>Officials Reveal Bin Laden Plan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Terror leader hoped to create Islamic empire. Rebel's
slaying seen as step toward goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG PYES, JOSH MEYER and WILLIAM C. REMPEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The assassination of an Afghan rebel leader 48 hours before the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks was part of a strategic plan by Osama bin Laden
to expand his influence into Central Asia, according to American and
Afghan government sources.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts initially believed that the killing of Ahmed Shah Masoud,
head of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, was part of Bin Laden's
preparations for Sept. 11--a move to deprive the U.S. of a potential
ally on the ground when it retaliated for the suicide hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   Government officials now say Masoud's assassination was part of a
more ambitious design: to establish a caliphate, or religious state,
encompassing Afghanistan and parts of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
Chechnya and the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang region of northwestern
China.</LD>
<TE>   "Their plan was to capture [northern] Afghanistan in one week
after the assassination and--maybe two to three weeks later--capture
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan,'' said Mohammad Arif, chairman of the
National Security Directorate in the interim Afghan government.</TE>
<TE>   As Masoud's chief of intelligence, Arif ran spy networks inside
the Taliban and received reports from interrogations of Taliban and
other Islamic militants captured by the Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials confirmed what they called "Bin Laden's grand plan"
to expand militarily and politically into Central Asia. American
policy advisors were extremely unsettled by the plan well before
Sept. 11, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was of great concern, absolutely," said a senior Bush
administration official. "That is one reason we wanted to get rid of
him. He wanted to knock off other governments. They were training
terrorists, creating front organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. officials were less certain than Arif that Bin Laden's
Al Qaeda and the Taliban had a timetable for advancing into Central
Asia, they regarded the Masoud assassination as a key step toward
that goal.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to take over the whole country ... [and then] they
wanted to expand the caliphate,'' said the senior U.S. official, who
noted that Masoud and his resistance force were the last obstacle to
Taliban and Al Qaeda control of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's foreign minister, Abdullah, said in an interview,
"Osama believed that by getting rid of Commander Masoud, the
resistance would be over."</TE>
<TE>   The former Masoud advisor conceded that Bin Laden's judgment was
sound. "It was only Masoud's own qualities which kept the resistance
alive."</TE>
<TE>   The two Al Qaeda assassins, armed with letters of introduction and
booby-trapped television cameras, spent nearly a month inside
Masoud's compound and entourage, awaiting an interview promised by
the rebel leader. On Sept.9, the men--Tunisians trained in an Al
Qaeda camp--were ushered into a room with Masoud. A few moments
later, a bomb blast riddled Masoud's body with shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Taliban's so-called final offensive against
the Northern Alliance pressed hard on three fronts. One rebel general
had reported that his troops were on the verge of collapse. But the
lines held.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden expected Masoud's killing to demoralize the resistance.
But rebel fighters did not learn of their leader's death for several
days--until after Al Qaeda hijackers had flown jetliners into the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   When massive U.S. reprisals began, the Afghan resistance was still
intact and Taliban troops had retreated to defensive positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The group around Osama ... thought up different scenarios. They
imagined a Bill Clinton-type response," said a Kabul intelligence
official, referring to a 1998 cruise missile strike in Afghanistan
that President Clinton ordered after the bombings of two U.S.
Embassies in East Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "They could never imagine the response that took place" after
Sept. 11, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Western intelligence had begun getting increased reports
that Bin Laden was talking openly about creating an Islamic
caliphate. The reports coincided with an increase in Bin Laden's
influence over his Taliban hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden lavished praise on the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed
Omar. He declared the barely literate mullah "the new caliph" and
pledged Al Qaeda's loyalty to the "emir-ul-momineen," or "commander
of the faithful." He urged all Muslims to "support his jihad against
the enemies of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 2001--when the plots to assassinate Masoud and
launch the Sept. 11 hijackings were underway--Al Qaeda influence
within the Taliban advanced further. Bin Laden and some of his
associates were invited into the Taliban decision-making council.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda was integrated into the Taliban military structure,
according to European intelligence officials. Juma Namangani, the
reclusive chief of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, was given a
command position with the northern military units opposing Masoud's
forces.</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat who monitors the Taliban from neighboring
Pakistan said intelligence reports at the end of 2000 indicated that
Taliban leaders were discussing how to exploit an anticipated victory
over Masoud and his forces. Indications were, the diplomat said, that
Omar and the Taliban wanted to project their power into Central Asia
"to maintain the purity of the jihad."</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban decision-making corps dwindled with the death from
cancer of Omar's prime minister, Mullah Mohammed Rabbani, a year ago.
The diplomat said Bin Laden filled the vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   A former Clinton administration official said some Al Qaeda
figures held "this global vision of spreading an Islamic state all
through Islamic lands and that [Afghanistan] was going to be sort of
the base for that." The official said he never considered the goal
realistic.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan military and intelligence officials said Taliban and Al
Qaeda-backed fighters planned to infiltrate rapidly across the
northern borders once Masoud was killed and his troops dispersed. The
Afghan and Arab militants were to join forces in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan with local groups of fundamentalist guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, Bin Laden had funded and supervised the training
of thousands of Uzbeks, Tajiks and other tribal fighters,
specifically for purposes of military expansion, said a second Bush
administration official.</TE>
<TE>   Besides training terrorists in Afghan camps, Bin Laden was
grooming a highly trained and disciplined fighting force for the
Masoud front--a sort of Arab foreign legion called Brigade 055.
Estimates of its size range from 1,000 to 2,500. The fighters were
recruited from around the world and had pledged to fight to the
death.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the only major military organization [Al Qaeda] had in
Afghanistan," said the Kabul intelligence officer, who asked not to
be identified. "The others were small units."</TE>
<TE>   Assisting Brigade 055 was a battle-hardened force of 700 to 1,000
Central Asian fighters headed by Namangani, the Islamic leader from
Uzbekistan. Namangani was considered a major terrorist threat by the
Clinton and Bush administrations after he organized cells in
Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, officials said. He was
reported killed in a U.S. bombing raid in November.</TE>
<TE>   Such non-Afghan military units were increasingly important to the
Taliban, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Northern Alliance commanders said 2,500 to 3,000
foreign troops were facing them at the front last summer. The number
grew to more than 5,000 around the time Masoud was killed. That
likely explains the large number of foreign Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters who were taken prisoner in northern Afghanistan after the
U.S. military campaign began, the Afghan officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Arif said foreign fighters were poised to surround Masoud's
stronghold in the Panjshir Valley and to expand into Tajikistan to
disrupt Masoud supply lines and try to capture a rebel air base.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the growing numbers of Arab recruits swelling the Taliban's
military ranks, small communities of foreigners began to sprout
around Afghanistan. Part of Al Qaeda's strategic plan was to
establish Arab enclaves throughout regions under Taliban
control--what Afghan government officials now disparage as "the
Arabization of Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to establish Arab colonies all over Afghanistan,"
said the Kabul intelligence officer. "They were working to create an
armed force in Afghanistan dominated by Arabs. They had succeeded to
a large extent. Afghanistan was a colony in the hands of terrorists."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Underscoring the importance of the U.S. military
alliance with Europe, Congress sent President Bush a bill he wanted
Friday that endorses an expansion of NATO and authorizes security
assistance for seven nations that hope to join.</LD>
<LD>   "The Cold War may be over, but the security and welfare of America
and Europe are very closely linked," said Sen. Richard G. Lugar
(R-Ind.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate approved the bill Friday, 85 to 6. The House passed it
in November, 372 to 46.</LD>
<TE>   The vote occurred as Bush met with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek at the White House. Slovenia, formerly part of Yugoslavia,
will receive money from the legislation. Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia will as well.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush and Drnovsek
discussed the November NATO summit in Prague, where the alliance will
decide whether to admit new members.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill will help NATO extend the zone of stability eastward
and southward on the continent so that sometime in the next decade
we'll be able to say ... that we have a Europe whole and free," said
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The legislatures of the 19 NATO members would be needed to ratify
inclusion of new members.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) criticized what she considered
a failure to reevaluate NATO's role given the new U.S.-Russia
friendship, exemplified by a recent agreement to cut nuclear weapons
on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a defensive alliance to protect the democracies of
Western Europe from the Communist threat of the East," said
Hutchison, who voted for the measure. "That threat has evaporated."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), the Armed Services Committee's top
Republican, who voted against the bill, said its rhetoric might make
the seven nations think they have the U.S. vote for admission, and
expanding NATO might hurt the alliance and impose more costs on the
United States.</TE>

<LD>Osama bin Laden is alive and the future of the United States in
Afghanistan is "fire and hell and total defeat," fugitive Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar was quoted as saying by a pan-Arab
newspaper Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't consider the battle has ended in Afghanistan.... The
battle has begun, and its fires are picking up. These fires will
reach the White House, because it is the center of injustice and
tyranny," Omar was quoted as saying by the London-based Al Asharq al
Awsat.</LD>
<LD>   "As for the United States' future in Afghanistan, it will be fire
and hell and total defeat, God willing, as it was for their
predecessors--the Soviets and, before them, the British," Omar
reportedly said.</LD>
<TE>   "The sheik [Bin Laden] is, thank God, still alive and this hurts
[President] Bush, who promised to his people to kill Osama," Omar
reportedly asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahman Rashed, editor of the paper, said Omar answered
questions delivered by reporter Badie Qorhani to Omar's media advisor
in northern Pakistan. Omar's responses were recorded on tape and
returned to the reporter, the editor said.</TE>
<TE>   Rashed said his newspaper ran the story only after a Taliban
official confirmed the tape's authenticity in an e-mail.</TE>

<HD>Pearl's Family Told Remains Are Probably His</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>American officials notified the widow and parents of journalist
Daniel Pearl on Friday that a torso and a severed head recovered from
a shallow grave by Pakistani police were almost certainly his.</LD>
<LD>   The remains were found in a garden nursery next to a small
building where Pearl had apparently been held hostage on the
outskirts of the southern port city of Karachi.</LD>
<LD>   The police chief of Sindh province, of which Karachi is the
capital, said the body was significantly decomposed. "It cannot be
identified," he said.</LD>
<TE>   To confirm the identity of the corpse, Pakistani police doctors
and two U.S. officials took hair samples for DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   Mariane Pearl, who had attempted to reason with the kidnappers in
a flurry of interviews before her husband's killing was made known in
a grisly videotape, received the news in Paris. She is due to deliver
their first child any day.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police were directed to the grave by a man who said he
killed Pearl five to six days after abducting him Jan. 23 outside a
restaurant, police sources said. The journalist expected to meet a
militant there for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   A senior police official said they had found the room where Pearl
was believed to have been held hostage inside the nursery.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a small one-roomed building inside the compound, and that
room has matched the room where the Daniel Pearl photographs were
taken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will conduct tests on the hair, skull and teeth to cement our
belief."</TE>
<TE>   Manzoor Mughal, senior superintendent of police in charge of the
investigation, said the face was not identifiable.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anything because his face is not clear. We have taken
parts of the body for DNA tests."</TE>

<HD>A Nation in Waiting Seeks Reconciliation</HD>
<DH>Asia: East Timor, after a bloody independence struggle,
seeks unity as it prepares for statehood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DILI, East Timor</DL>
<LD>The way Domingues da Costa tells it, the only bad thing he did was
dump a body down a well. He swears that he didn't kill anybody or
steal anything.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the feared Aitarak militia that destroyed much of this
capital in 1999, he returned home last week to face his neighbors for
the first time in nearly three years. He hopes that they will forgive
him for opposing independence for East Timor.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to come back because this is my homeland," he said. "I'm
ready to confess. I'm ready to account for what I did."</LD>
<TE>   Da Costa's return to East Timor, and the return of thousands of
anti-independence refugees like him, is a vital part of this former
Indonesian province's drive to build a peaceful new nation from the
rubble of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the United Nations will hand power to a new civilian
government, and East Timor will become the world's 192nd country.</TE>
<TE>   President-elect Jose Alexandre Gusmao, a former guerrilla leader
popularly known as Xanana, has made it one of his highest priorities
to bring together opposing factions, curb popular demand for revenge
and forgive those who committed lesser crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have reconciliation for the Timorese to build national
unity, to build peace in the hearts of their community," he said this
week at a ceremony to swear in 30 members of a new regional truth and
reconciliation commission. "If there is no reconciliation, there can
be no justice."</TE>
<TE>   A former Portuguese colony, East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in
1975 and forcibly annexed a year later with the tacit support of the
United States. When the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for
independence in 1999, militias organized by the Indonesian army ran
amok, killing about 1,000 people, destroying 70% of the territory's
buildings and forcing 260,000 people--nearly one-third of the
population--to flee across the border into the Indonesian province of
West Timor.</TE>
<TE>   "No departing colonial power ever wrecked so much of a country,"
said Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta, East Timor's foreign
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, this land has been under the protection of the United
Nations, which sent thousands of peacekeeping troops to secure the
border with Indonesia and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
begin rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, East Timor's transitional government has begun
prosecuting some of the worst militia offenders and has sentenced 10
to prison, including one for 33 years. But without forgiveness,
Gusmao says, the new nation will become mired in the quest for
revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "My priority is social justice," said Gusmao, who spent 17 years
fighting in the jungle for East Timor's independence and seven years
in an Indonesian prison. "We fought, we suffered, we died for what?
To try other people or to receive benefits from independence?"</TE>
<TE>   The obstacles facing East Timor are great. When it takes its place
among the nations of the world, it will rank as the poorest country
in Asia and one of the poorest in the world. Half the people are
illiterate, and nearly half live below the poverty level of 55 cents
a day.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.N., whose record of aiding war-torn nations is mixed,
the rebuilding of East Timor has been one of its greatest successes.</TE>
<TE>   The territory has held two national elections, each with
overwhelming turnout, as the East Timorese have embraced democracy.
The new National Assembly has drafted a constitution and will become
the country's parliament on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The transitional government, made up of U.N. and East Timorese
officials, has begun building police and defense forces, a civil
service, a judiciary and a banking system. It has constructed
schools, set up television and radio stations and adopted the U.S.
dollar as the national currency.</TE>
<TE>   In Dili, hundreds of buildings have been rebuilt and others are
under construction. Many small shops, restaurants and hotels have
opened, in part to cater to the thousands of U.N. workers and
peacekeepers here.</TE>
<TE>   Under the leadership of U.N. administrator Sergio Vieira de Mello,
the transitional government has signed an agreement with Australia
that is expected to provide East Timor with $7 billion over 30 years
from gas and oil deposits in the Timor Sea. The money, however, will
not start rolling in until 2005 at the earliest, and East Timor will
have to rely on foreign assistance for at least three more years.</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling country's financial problems will be compounded by
the departure of many U.N. staff members after independence is
formally declared, although 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers and 1,250
international police officers will remain.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of Independence Day, thousands of refugees have
returned from camps in West Timor in recent weeks, bringing to
207,000 the number who have come home. Many were inspired by Gusmao,
who visited the camps in April and urged the refugees to return, even
if they took part in the militia rampage.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his many years of hardship and imprisonment under
Indonesian rule, Gusmao has been preaching forgiveness for months.
Punishment, he says, is only one aspect of justice. Spending the new
country's limited resources to lock up large numbers of militia
members, he argues, will not improve the lives of the people.</TE>
<TE>   In January, East Timor created the Reception, Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to establish the facts of human rights
violations that occurred between 1974 and 1999--including those
committed by pro-independence rebels--and to try to reintegrate
former combatants into their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the commission's auspices, wrongdoers will be called upon to
apologize to their victims. Lesser offenders may be required to atone
for their crimes by performing community service, such as building
houses to replace those they torched.</TE>
<TE>   Some former militia members who return to East Timor, however,
face the risk that their cases will end up in the hands of General
Prosecutor Longuinhos Monteiro, who is investigating major human
rights violations. So far, 101 suspects are in custody and 220 more
have been identified in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest offenders will face trial and imprisonment, Gusmao
says, but first they should apologize to the community so their
neighbors will accept them after they have served their time.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want is to build a society in which people love each
other, tolerate each other, accept each other," he explained to
reporters Friday. "We should do our best to eradicate all sentiment
of hatred, all feelings of revenge. It is our thinking about how to
build the future of East Timor, as human beings, as dignified
people."</TE>
<TE>   Some question whether the reconciliation process will appease East
Timorese who lost their loved ones, homes and possessions. They worry
that there will be an explosion of violence after the international
forces depart.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the public has been patient. Officials said the number
of cases of retribution has been small--three slayings and about 30
assaults, most of them in 2000 before the transitional government was
well-established.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. administrator De Mello, a Brazilian who has worked for the
world body in trouble spots around the globe, said the willingness of
the East Timorese to forgive is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to my experience in many other places--Africa, the
Balkans--I have found no hatred here," he said. "They have
demonstrated in the past 21/2 years an incredible degree of patience,
resilience and tolerance toward one another."</TE>
<TE>   The reconciliation process began informally last year. One of the
first to face his former neighbors was Joao Mendonca de Araujo, 47, a
former top government official in the town of Suai and a leader of a
pro-Indonesia political organization.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors believe that he bears part of the responsibility for a
militia's September 1999 massacre of at least 100 people who took
refuge in a church in Suai. They contend that he must have known
about the plan in advance because, as chief of the subdistrict, the
militia reported to him.</TE>
<TE>   De Araujo, however, says he learned of the attack only when he
heard the shooting begin. He says that he was scared for his own life
because the militia was "uncontrollable" and that he fled across the
border the same day.</TE>
<TE>   He and his family found life in the West Timor refugee camps
difficult and decided to return home in March 2001. Five hours after
he crossed the border, East Timor's police chief, Paulo Martins,
personally arrested him. De Araujo spent more than a month in jail
before he was released. He is living in Dili, but the investigation
into his case continues.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Gusmao convened a meeting of 500 people near Suai and
called on De Araujo to speak. The former official said he cried as he
repented for his role in the events. "I had to apologize for what
happened in Suai," De Araujo recounted. "I told them I am ready to
take responsibility by law for what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Today, De Araujo cannot find work and is living off the generosity
of relatives. But he is adjusting to the reality of an independent
East Timor. On Monday, his teenage daughter will participate in the
Independence Day ceremony by helping to form a giant human East
Timorese flag.</TE>
<TE>   "During the 1999 election, a lot of people voted for
independence," he said. "We have to respect that."</TE>
<TE>   Da Costa, 29, said he decided to return from West Timor after
Gusmao visited his squalid refugee camp and spoke of reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is now sorry he opposed independence. He is surprised
to see that Dili is a bustling city with roads full of traffic and
buildings under construction.</TE>
<TE>   "East Timor will be better than before," he said. "I feel bad, and
I feel guilty."</TE>

<HD>New Cuba Travel Limits Expected</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Bush's plan to tighten policy could run afoul of
lawmakers and Cuban American voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Under the law, Americans who violate their country's restrictions on
travel to Cuba can be socked with a stiff $55,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   But illegal travelers often bargain their fines down to $500. Some
people have figured out that by filing appeals, they can delay their
penalties indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   And as many as 60,000 Americans escape detection each year,
according to estimates.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush is expected to announce Monday a tougher policy
toward Cuba. He has declared several times since the 2000
presidential campaign that he intends to tighten the travel
restrictions, as well as increase aid to dissidents inside Cuba and
for the dissemination of U.S. opinions on the island.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the 4-decade-old limits on travel say these
inconsistencies reveal a system that is fundamentally unenforceable.
Some observers also say the expected new crackdown is not really
designed to choke off visits but to make a political gesture that
will strengthen support for Bush among Cuban American voters in South
Florida--and for his brother and fellow Republican, Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush, who is running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is "playing to the political gallery here,"
said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), a member of a growing bipartisan
group of lawmakers who have been challenging the travel restrictions
and trade embargo against Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the new policy is the toughening of the travel
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The existing regulations are intended to expose Cubans to American
viewpoints and help foster democratic values, without economically
boosting the regime of President Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   The rules allow limited travel among various categories of
Americans. Cuban Americans, for example, can go once a year to see
their families and typically are able to get approval to visit for
family emergencies. Journalists, academics and members of political,
charitable or other nongovernmental organizations are routinely
admitted.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the rules seek to sharply limit tourism by penalizing
average visitors if they spend money on the island, a measure
designed to deprive the Cuban government of hard currency.</TE>
<TE>   But many illegal travelers fly to Cuba via third countries, such
as Canada, Mexico, Jamaica or the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   When they fly back to the United States, they are supposed to
disclose which countries they have visited. But if they don't
voluntarily disclose that they've been to Cuba, and they aren't
caught with telltale contraband, such as Cuban cigars or rum, the
visits often go undetected.</TE>
<TE>   There were about 176,000 legal trips to Cuba last year and an
estimated 30,000 to 60,000 illegal ones.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration tried to step up enforcement in the last
year, with 766 fines assessed for illegal visits, compared with 188
in the last full year of the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   But this effort has overwhelmed a tiny enforcement staff. The
Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control has seven
people assigned to enforcing the travel rules, or about 5% of its 129
members, officials testified to Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   The same office is charged with other missions, including tracking
down the assets of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told Congress in February that restricting
travel to Cuba was not his top priority for the office.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its limited resources, the office has been unable to
hire administrative judges who could handle appeals of fines. So when
travelers have filed written challenges, their cases have been added
to a big backlog and held up indefinitely, according to congressional
aides.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials are expected to announce next week
that they intend to deploy more staff, watch the travel routes more
closely and give the Cuba mission higher priority.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say the administration faces two risks.</TE>
<TE>   One is that the crackdown could backfire politically if it limits
the travel of Cuban Americans to their homeland. Experts say many of
the illegal trips are made by Cuban Americans who visit the island
more often than allowed.</TE>
<TE>   They often travel from Miami, Los Angeles and New York via
chartered flights that are not closely watched by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   And the administration's new effort might well be shut down
abruptly by Congress, which has been increasingly hostile to the
travel restrictions and the trade embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the travel limits has come from a heterogeneous
group that includes liberals and farm state lawmakers of both
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, an amendment sponsored by Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to
halt government spending to enforce the restrictions passed the House
by a 240-186 vote. It died in conference because of the Sept. 11
attacks, which made Congress reluctant to challenge the president.</TE>
<TE>   But some advocates are expecting a different outcome this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Grooms Cowal, president of the anti-embargo Cuba Policy
Foundation, said the proposal could succeed in both houses, perhaps
by veto-proof margins.</TE>
<TE>   And with no effective restrictions, annual travel to Cuba could
surge "to a half-million in a matter of months," she predicted.</TE>

<HD>Can Energy Watchdog Show Bite?</HD>
<DH>Regulation: New chief has won over some critics of FERC,
agency under fire in California's crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The warning that California's deregulated energy market could be
manipulated came in a technocrat's research paper, not a confidential
corporate memo.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Stoft--then an economist for the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission--used mathematical equations to make his case. But his
1998 paper summed up the vulnerability in plain English:</LD>
<LD>   "Generators can significantly increase their profitability by
causing ... congestion and then bidding to alleviate it," Stoft
wrote. His paper was publicly circulated shortly before the state's
new power market was to open that April Fools' Day.</LD>
<TE>   Stoft's warning went unheeded. Now that Enron Corp. memos have
revealed that its traders were using such schemes to exploit the
California market, FERC is facing renewed questions about its own
role in the power debacle and whether it can shape up as an effective
watchdog.</TE>
<TE>   The answer may determine whether California succeeds in its
efforts to recoup $9 billion for alleged electricity overcharges and
change the terms on $42 billion in contracts for future electricity.</TE>
<TE>   FERC came under withering political attack at the height of
California's energy crisis for refusing to impose price controls on
wholesale power in the West. The Bush administration cast blame for
the power shortages on California's policies that it said had blocked
power plant construction.</TE>
<TE>   But FERC, operating under a new chairman, is gradually gaining a
reputation as a different kind of agency, though it's unclear whether
it can be a tough cop on the energy beat.</TE>
<TE>   FERC is pushing an aggressive investigation of the very price
manipulation by energy traders that its leadership dismissed against
the advice of the agency's staff two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In August, President Bush named Patrick H. Wood III, a Texas
utilities commission chairman when Bush was governor, to lead FERC
amid controversy over the agency's handling of the energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Wood, 39, is a policy whiz with small-business roots in east Texas
and a Harvard law degree. His stated goal is to restore
respectability to electricity deregulation, and his track record
shows he doesn't mind stepping on corporate toes if he thinks it will
help.</TE>
<TE>   It was Wood's decision to post the Enron memos on the Internet,
FERC staffers said.</TE>
<TE>   Wood on May 8 approved FERC's order requiring all sellers of
electricity in the California market to state under oath whether they
engaged in the manipulative tactics described in the documents.</TE>
<TE>   That action sent a shudder through the industry, conjuring visions
of tobacco executives lined up before hostile congressional
committees.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, press secretary for Gov. Gray Davis, said a sea
change has come over FERC since Wood took over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's shocking, considering that most observers would have thought
that anybody appointed by Bush would be ... more hostile," Maviglio
said. "Wood is far more pragmatic. The governor gets a sense every
time he talks to him that he's a can-do kind of guy."</TE>
<TE>   A market monitoring and enforcement division created by Wood is in
its infancy, although a director has been hired. The office would
bring together about 80 economists, lawyers, engineers, auditors,
policy analysts and former traders to watch the markets for emerging
trouble spots.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has yet to act on legislation that would broaden FERC's
powers by increasing fines for violations of the Federal Power Act
from $5,000 to $1 million and increasing prison terms from two years
to five.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, stepped-up enforcement by the regulator may not provide
enough of a deterrent when a slick move can net millions for traders.
The answer is to design future energy markets with price limits and
rules that resist tampering, a leading consumer advocate said.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to an honest market is that people have to recognize that
their chances of succeeding in a manipulation are very, very small,"
said Mark Cooper, an energy policy analyst with the Consumer
Federation of America. "Once you are in the realm of 'I know I can
beat this market; the question is can I beat the cop?' then order has
broken down."</TE>
<TE>   Although California officials applaud the changes at FERC, the
industry has voiced concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Assn.,
which represents traders, said FERC has let politics set policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of political heat on FERC," Goodman said.
"California regulations were so flawed that it [provided an
incentive] for the behavior at issue."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the Electric Power Supply Assn., said
high prices are not an indicator of misbehavior.</TE>
<TE>   "You need something more than high prices before you go putting
out subpoenas for documents of every market participant," Stultz
said. "Does the existence of high prices ... equate to probable cause
for bad behavior? The answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   Yet to many observers, the Enron memos seem to have provided just
that. They do constitute probable cause, said former FERC
commissioner Matthew Holden Jr., now a professor of politics at the
University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "The total collapse of Enron has caused people on all sides of the
political spectrum to believe that there was massive misbehavior,"
Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   As California braced for blackouts last summer, Enron was at the
peak of its power as the most successful of a new breed of
energy-trading companies called marketers.</TE>
<TE>   The fleet-footed middlemen often had better information
technology, sharper long-term weather forecasts and a more
comprehensive grasp of the market than regulators--and in the case of
Enron, according to the memos, market manipulation strategies that
its traders dubbed Death Star, Fat Boy and Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   Stoft, the economist who warned of weaknesses in California's
market design, also predicted that Enron and other traders had the
potential to distort the course of electricity deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 paper, Stoft called them "the most crucial, yet most
overlooked group of players" in deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said lawmakers and regulators at all levels of government
failed to recognize that marketers were more than facilitators, that
they had their own economic interests and would pursue them
zealously.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, when blackouts rolled across the state, Vice
President Dick Cheney took the lead in casting the blame squarely on
California.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happened in California," he said, "is they've taken the
route of saying, 'Well, we can conserve our way out of the
problem.... We don't have to produce any more power. So they haven't
built any electric power plants in the last 10 years in California,
and today they've got rolling blackouts."</TE>
<TE>   Stoft, now a senior researcher at the University of California
Energy Institute in Berkeley, said he believes that FERC officials
must have suspected that traders were taking advantage of loopholes
in California's byzantine market rules during the height of the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Two current FERC staffers confirmed that, saying the Enron memos
released last week disclosed nothing really startling.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of us, this was not a surprise," said one senior
staffer, who asked not to be identified. "If you had asked me before
we got those memos whether Enron was doing this, I would have said,
'Probably.'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Stoft: "The California market monitors were writing to FERC
and complaining. But [FERC] did not want to look. I don't want to
blame it all on FERC, though. It was California that invented these
stupid markets."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Enron strategies violated any laws remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   FERC, which functions like a national utilities commission, had
the statutory authority to intervene in California to guarantee "just
and reasonable" rates.</TE>
<TE>   But during 2000 and the first half of 2001, the agency's governing
board was reluctant to act, partly because of strong free- market
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   California officials and members of the state's congressional
delegation clamored for relief.</TE>
<TE>   Within FERC, Commissioner William L. Massey complained that the
agency was abandoning its legal duty to consumers. But Curtis L.
Hebert Jr., President Bush's first appointee as chairman, maintained
that the solution was in California's own hands, saying the state
needed to approve new power plants and stop shielding consumers from
higher electric bills.</TE>
<TE>   There were legitimate explanations for soaring prices as well,
such as California's dependence on out-of-state power, a boost in
demand from the strong economy and a long stretch of atypical weather
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   With rolling blackouts in California and growing political
pressure in Washington, Hebert agreed in June to wholesale price
limits on electricity throughout the West. Prices stabilized, and the
blackouts ceased. Conservation by Californians and new power plants
coming online also helped turn the market around.</TE>
<TE>   But by August, Hebert had left FERC.</TE>

<HD>Class-Size Reduction Initiatives Faltering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cash-strapped school districts and states across the country are
backing away from reductions in class size, a reform touted in recent
years as a magic bullet for improving ailing public schools.</LD>
<LD>   In many districts in California and elsewhere, class sizes are
swelling--particularly in middle and high schools--and class-size
reduction initiatives aimed at primary grades are being rolled back.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the shift is a result of severe budget cuts and mixed
findings on whether smaller classes truly result in improved
learning.</LD>
<TE>   "[Class-size reduction] has got this silver-bullet kind of
mythology surrounding it," said Eugene Hickok, undersecretary of the
U.S. Department of Education. "[But] as states confront tough choices
on budgets ... what should guide the decision-making should be what
works ... as opposed to just spending money on things that sound like
they make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has far less faith in the concept than
that of President Clinton. Under the "No Child Left Behind" education
plan, the administration recently eliminated a Clinton-initiated,
$1.6-billion fund devoted exclusively to class-size reduction.</TE>
<TE>   At the state level, Massachusetts is expected to kill its
$18-million program to limit class size in kindergarten through third
grades in low-income schools. Washington state recently slashed
funding for smaller classes, primarily in kindergarten through fourth
grades, by $24.5 million. Large districts in Oregon and Utah are
boosting maximum class sizes across the board to save money.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in Tennessee, where promising research on smaller
classes first drew national attention, tight budgets are expected to
push class sizes up in all grades. And in Florida, a proposed ballot
initiative to constitutionally limit class sizes is running into
fierce opposition from skeptical Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   California Initiative Ambitious, Expensive</TE>
<TE>   Even in California, where a class-size reduction program in
primary grades was introduced with great fanfare by Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson in 1996, several districts are cutting back and many are
considering it. The state program, which to date has cost $8 billion,
gave school districts money to hire enough teachers to reduce
kindergarten through third-grade classes to a maximum of 20.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, fueled by an economic boom, was one of the most
expensive and ambitious changes in education policies in the state's
history. It was closely watched by other states and proved enormously
popular with parents, teachers and politicians. Lawmakers jumped on
the idea after the state's fourth-graders finished dead last on
national reading tests.</TE>
<TE>   But the haste with which it was implemented--it was approved by
the Legislature only two months before the start of classes--may have
undercut its success. Classrooms had to be found and teachers hired
even as a nationwide teacher shortage was worsening. Many of the new
hires lacked credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a clear link between the speed with which this
was done ... and the decline in the qualifications of teachers," said
Brian Stecher, a senior scientist at the Rand Corp. who has studied
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, the state didn't see the gains in
test scores that were supposed to come about in smaller classes,
especially among low-performing students.</TE>
<TE>   Studies by the American Institutes for Research, as well as Rand,
have found that smaller classes have not demonstrably improved
academic performance among California's schoolchildren. Similarly,
the Heritage Foundation, which analyzed reading test scores of
fourth-graders and eighth-graders in 39 states, found no evidence of
gains for students in smaller classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Show me the data. Where has it made the impact?" said Carl Wong,
superintendent-elect of Sonoma County schools, which has 40 districts
and 73,000 students. Wong, who personally believes smaller classes
have advantages, said many of his districts are considering
increasing enrollments.</TE>
<TE>   Appeal Lessens With Downturn in Economy</TE>
<TE>   With the downturn in the economy, class-size reduction now has
less appeal to many Republican leaders nationwide, who argue it is
expensive, hasn't proved effective and erodes school districts'
control over local policy. Democrats, who often are more aligned with
teachers unions, tend to be more supportive.</TE>
<TE>   The state's school districts, meanwhile, have found it
increasingly difficult to support the nearly 30,000 new teachers they
hired in such a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   The effects are showing up in the classroom. In Riverside, two
districts short on money and space have already cut back programs for
their younger pupils. Riverside Unified School District trustees
recently voted to increase the limit on class size in third grade by
10 students. The Val Verde Unified School District raised the limit
in the first grade by an equal amount. Before this year, that
district already had boosted the levels in the other primary grades.</TE>
<TE>   "More students means less time for those who need the most help,"
said Val Verde Elementary teacher Naomi Chism, who has 28 students
this year and, with all their desks and backpacks, not much room to
walk around. "It hinders all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "When budget cuts call for things like this, the kids end up
paying for it. Ultimately, society will end up paying the price."</TE>
<TE>   At the same school, Terry Makeig's roughly 20 first-graders fit
comfortably on a blue rug in the corner of the classroom as she read
stories about caterpillars and penguins. But she's worried about next
year, when her class could balloon to 30 students.</TE>
<TE>   "First-graders are still learning how to behave in school," she
said. "To maintain order I'll have to become this strict, mean drill
sergeant rather than a teacher. I won't be myself anymore."</TE>
<TE>   For parent Denise Moore, part of the allure of Val Verde
Elementary was its small classes. Now, the mother with one child in
preschool and a fourth-grader at the school is angry.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's just too many kids, there's no way the teacher can get
to all of them," she said. " We're fighting to preserve our smaller
enrollment."</TE>
<TE>   Budget difficulties and class-size reductions focused on
the primary grades also have added to crowding in upper
grades--especially in middle and high school classes.</TE>
<TE>   While preserving its kindergarten through third-grade class-size
limits, the 737,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District
recently voted to increase average class size in fourth through 12th
grades by one or two students. That brings some high school classes
to 40 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Fontana Unified School District in the
Inland Empire and the San Juan Unified School District in Sacramento voted
to eliminate class-size reduction programs for some ninth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a function of logistics, really. Where could you do
the least harm in making the cuts?" said Mike Bement, director of
communications for Fontana Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Older students feel the pinch. At Los Angeles Unified's North
Hollywood High School, 33 students--with five absent--packed into a
biology class. Backpacks cluttered the 2-foot-wide walkway between
desks. Students who couldn't get good seats shared tables at the very
back of the room, where they had to twist their chairs around to see
the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was ever an emergency, I mean, can you imagine all the
students trying to get out of that very narrow opening?" said teacher
Tim Brady.</TE>
<TE>   Conducting classroom lab experiments is even more trying than
finding a desk. There are only seven workstations, so half the class
works on experiments one day, the other half the next. For Brady,
it's tough attending to every student who has a question.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just more work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, parents have rallied to stave off cuts to
class-size reduction programs.</TE>
<TE>   In the Cabrillo Unified School District in Santa Cruz, parents
raised $71,000 to keep the program alive. In the Irvine Unified
School District, parents and educators raised $1.3 million. And after
parents protested, the Livermore Unified School District backed down
on its plans for cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum Grew After 1980s Study in Tennessee</TE>
<TE>   "Parents don't understand that if you continue to let a program
like class-size reduction encroach on general funds, it affects
funding for ... other programs," said Donald Gatti, the district's
assistant superintendent for business services. "And there's still no
real evidence that class-size reduction works."</TE>
<TE>   The class-size reduction movement gained significant momentum with
a 1980s study in Tennessee. It found that students learn best in
classes of 13 to 17 students, particularly in primary grades. It also
found that low-income and minority students reap the greatest gains.
A study out of Wisconsin found similar results.</TE>
<TE>   "The best evidence we have suggests that class-size reduction does
work for those students who are at most risk," said George
Bohrnstedt, who co-wrote the recent Rand report on class-size
reduction. "But in California, because of the way class-size
reduction was implemented, we don't know what might have been had we
designed a program that was really aimed at helping those students."</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee findings were narrow in scope. But California
applied the concept broadly. The maximum class size was set at 20
instead of 17, and every elementary school in the state was eligible.
Teachers were supposed to be trained in how to take advantage of
smaller classes. But the state paid for only very limited training
and did not specify what teachers should do differently.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, more than 20 states have launched class-size
initiatives of their own. But some educators say its promise is
destined to fade.</TE>
<TE>   "People are disenchanted with it," said Eric Hanushek, a Stanford
University professor who believes the money has better uses and the
research is not persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   "Previous movements to reduce class size across the board without
consideration for where it was done or for whom it was done was just
wasteful."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration apparently agrees, favoring teacher
training as a more pressing reform. Under its plan, states and local
districts will be given the flexibility to use federal funding, once
earmarked only for smaller classes, for such training or to hire more
teachers. In return, states will be held accountable for improving
the quality of teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some experts say the popularity of class-size reduction
among voters and legislators will make it tough to root out.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not going to go away quite as fast as some people would
like because every teacher and every parent wants it," said Jeremy
Finn, a professor of education at the State University of New York in
Buffalo. "You can't just phase this out.... It has become
institutionalized."</TE>

<HD>Agent Who Wrote Memo Praised for His Expertise</HD>
<DH>FBI: Former colleagues say Kenneth Williams, who warned of
Muslim extremists at flight schools, had a gift for counterterrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH CONNELL and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Federal law enforcement sources said Friday that the FBI agent who
wrote the intelligence memo warning about Islamic extremists in U.S.
flight schools is a mild-mannered 10-year veteran with a gift for
counterterrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The Phoenix-based agent, Kenneth Williams, could not be reached
for comment Friday about the July 2001 warning. And FBI spokesmen in
Phoenix and Washington, D.C., would not confirm that Williams wrote
the memo.</LD>
<LD>   But former FBI colleagues said Friday that Williams' knowledge of
terrorism alone should have been enough for superiors to immediately
act on his suspicions.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody listened to him," said one top former FBI official who
learned about the memo several weeks before its existence surfaced
publicly, creating a firestorm in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Other former colleagues of Williams, who refused to discuss the
memo, offered high praise for the agent's work in the Phoenix
counterterrorism unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone in FBI management who wouldn't take what Ken Williams said
seriously is a fool," said Ronald Myers, who served 31 years in the
FBI before retiring in 2000. "If Ken says something, it's true."</TE>
<TE>   Added Williams' former FBI SWAT team leader Roger Browning: "On a
scale of 1 to 10, he's a 10. Maybe an 11."</TE>
<TE>   The now-famous memo warned that possible terrorists were seeking
access to flight training schools and other U.S. aviation facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Phoenix believes that the FBI should accumulate a listing of
civil aviation universities/colleges around the country," the memo
says in part, urging officials in Washington to relay the bureau's
"suspicions" of terrorist infiltration with "other elements of the
U.S. intelligence community."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has stressed that none of those identified
in the memo were linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. The memo, which reportedly was sent to FBI
terrorism experts for further analysis, did not reach senior levels
of the bureau before Sept. 11, FBI officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 41, a former San Diego police officer who for a time was
assigned to a border crimes task force, joined the FBI's Phoenix
office a little more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he was a SWAT team leader who--during one
search--braved pneumonia while leading agents in a successful hunt in
mountainous terrain for a father and son wanted for killing a police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   But it was in counterterrorism that Williams really made his mark,
several former colleagues said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of the sharpest agents I ever met," said Myers, who is
now a court constable in Maricopa County, Ariz. "Of all the people I
knew and worked with in the Phoenix office, I'd put him in the top
three or four."</TE>
<TE>   Added a former partner of Williams: "He is simply one of the best
agents in the FBI and one of the best international terrorism agents
in the world."</TE>
<TE>   One official in Washington described Williams as "pretty
strait-laced and not a whistle-blower type."</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman for the Phoenix FBI office, Special Agent Manuel
Johnson, would say only that Williams "is an experienced agent" who
"continues to be assigned to the Phoenix division."</TE>
<TE>   Although Williams' memo has only recently drawn public attention,
records and interviews show that as early as 1998, FBI agents in
Phoenix were attempting to tap the city's Muslim community for
information about potential terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, Williams has played key roles in the FBI's
Arizona investigation of associates of the Sept. 11 hijackers,
particularly Hani Hanjour, the young Saudi suspected of piloting the
commercial airliner that struck the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Williams testified in the trial earlier this year of another Saudi
living in Arizona, Faisal Al Salmi, who was convicted of lying about
having known Hanjour.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also was among the agents who interrogated Malek Seif, a
Middle Eastern man who was an acquaintance of Hanjour's and left the
U.S. shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Seif's
attorney, Thomas Hoidal.</TE>
<TE>   Seif was later lured back to Phoenix as part of the terrorism
investigation and charged with making false statements to obtain a
Social Security card and lying on an immigration asylum application.
Seif recently pleaded guilty, was sentenced to time served and has
returned to France.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier inquiries by the Phoenix FBI bureau into the activities of
flight school students appear to reflect the concerns expressed in
the summer 2001 warning to FBI headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   More than a year before the memo was written, FBI agents in
Phoenix were monitoring Mideast-born residents, including a Lebanese
student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Zakaria Soubra, who endorsed a radical Islamic doctrine of Muslim
world rule, told The Times that agents showed up at his apartment in
early 2000 to question him. The agents were concerned, Soubra said,
about his visit to a shooting range with another Muslim, who was a
veteran of various Islamic jihads in the Balkans and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   And within hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, agents returned to
Prescott to question Soubra and several fellow Muslim students at
Embry-Riddle.</TE>
<TE>   Soubra was not charged with any crimes and is now a senior at the
campus.</TE>

<HD>Entering the Court of Last Retort</HD>
<DH>Sports: Lakers versus Kings transcends basketball.
Residents of Sacramento see the series as a way to show they're
players as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>What are the top 100 reasons you hate L.A.? That's the cheeky
question posed this week to listeners of Sports Talk 1140, the radio
home of this city's beloved basketball Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Loathing poured forth with the sharp-elbowed enthusiasm of a
playground pickup game: O.J. lived there ... Valley girls ...
Televised freeway chases ... They steal our water ... Stupid giant
stars on sidewalks ... No change of seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Insults aside, more than mere basketball seems at stake these days
in this realm of Kings and cowbells.</LD>
<TE>   For residents of California's often overlooked capital, today's
National Basketball Assn. showdown with the world champion Lakers for
the Western Conference title is a rare chance to step outside the
Shaq-sized shadow cast by the nation's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Up here, trash talk isn't just about the big guys in purple and
gold. It's about the perception of civilization south of the
Grapevine as bawdy and brain-dead. It's about Los Angeles as the
unruly megalopolis. It's about what Sacramento doesn't want to
become.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good against evil, it's David against Goliath," said Mark
Friedman, a Sacramento developer whose in-town building projects are
the antithesis of Southland sprawl. "It's a frank disgust with what
Los Angeles is--and a fear that if we continue to spread and grow,
we'll look as bad as they do."</TE>
<TE>   The best-of-seven series also marks a chance for Sacramento--and
the cosmopolitan mix of 1.8 million residents in the greater
metropolitan region--to puff its chest and show the world that Los
Angeles isn't California's only important place.</TE>
<TE>   Like other smaller capital cities--think Albany, N.Y., and
Springfield, Ill.--Sacramento suffers from inevitable comparisons to
the state's more famous destinations. In a universe of heavyweights
that includes San Francisco and San Diego, Sacramento has always felt
like the 98-pound weakling--at best ignored, at worst disrespected.</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry Goes Beyond Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Kings versus Lakers "goes well beyond the court," suggested Tyler
Bleszinski, a 30-year-old refugee of the Bay Area dot-com bust who
has unabashedly embraced Sacramento. "The confrontation will pit a
mid-sized, growing region against a mammoth city of glitz, glamour
and a blase, nihilistic attitude about everything that's not
beautiful on the outside."</TE>
<TE>   Such zingers sting Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, though he's
heard it all before. While attending a year of law school in the
north, Hahn discovered that his beloved hometown is perceived as a
loathsome menace.</TE>
<TE>   "They live and breathe this hatred--it gives some kind of meaning
to their existence," Hahn said, resignation in his voice. But, among
Angelenos, "I don't think the feeling is mutual at all. We've come to
the conclusion it's got to be jealousy."</TE>
<TE>   Although any self-respecting King fan will happily lapse into
La-La-Land diatribes, Sacramento has itself been cursed by its own
municipal image problem--that of a sweltering cow-town. It's a
stereotype the region struggles to overcome, despite a dramatic
change in the economy, populace and array of attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, Laker coach and the NBA's Zen master of the head
game, best summed up such thinking two years ago, dubbing
cowbell-clanging fans in Sacramento's Arco Arena "semicivilized,"
just a bunch of newfangled "rednecks."</TE>
<TE>   The characterization clanked like a Shaquille O'Neal free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramentans don't practice civic pride as religiously as San
Franciscans. But a King conquest would most certainly exact a
delicious element of revenge, said Howard Dickstein, a local
attorney. "It would be great to make Phil Jackson eat his words."</TE>
<TE>   As if basketball weren't enough, the capital's civic leaders hope
the world will pause awhile to learn a few things about their leafy
hometown this time around:</TE>
<TE>   * Sacramento finished 18th on Forbes magazine's list of best
places for business. Los Angeles was 100th.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles has Hollywood glamour, but America Online ranked
Sacramento the nation's best place for singles.</TE>
<TE>   * Runner's World magazine rated it one of the top four cities for
a jog.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaved by two scenic rivers, Sacramento boasts what it bills as
the world's largest traditional jazz festival, and is reportedly
second only to Paris in per capita tree coverage. "Sacramento is a
great place to raise a family," said Doug Elmets, a public relations
consultant who has lived in both cities. "Los Angeles has smog, high
crime and lousy schools."</TE>
<TE>   Cow-Town Image Hard to Lose</TE>
<TE>   Though farm fields are gradually succumbing to housing tracts, the
nickname "Sacra-tomato" sticks like thick spaghetti sauce. But
high-tech is the cash crop. Intel has as many employees in Sacramento
County as it does in Silicon Valley. The town has a bigger percentage
of business executives and professionals than Los Angeles, and faster
job growth. Meanwhile, the price of a home in Sacramento is half that
of L.A. The cost of living is 21% less.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not get carried away here. Sizing up Sacramento and Los
Angeles is in most instances like comparing a tomato with a
watermelon.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento has the Crocker Art Museum; Los Angeles boasts the
Getty, Norton Simon and the County Museum of Art's 150,000-piece
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento International Airport is just now living up to its
name, finally getting a foreign nonstop flight (to Guadalajara
starting July 1); at LAX, you can fly to nearly any spot on the globe
(though getting to the airport is another matter entirely).</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento has 15 Starbucks coffeehouses; Los Angeles boasts 56.
Did we mention the weather? In a typical summer, Sacramento has 77
days above 90 degrees. Los Angeles averages five.</TE>
<TE>   To many Angelenos, Sacramento is merely a place to send state
lawmakers, a summer pit stop on the road to Tahoe, air conditioner
cranked. The town has a civic inferiority complex, they say, and is
worthy of no more than a yawn.</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't L.A.," said Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles),
who has spent many a sweltering summer in Sacramento. "If it's not
100 or something degrees, then there's a flood. And if there's not a
flood, then it's tule fog."</TE>
<TE>   Even the conciliatory Hahn can't resist dishing a little smack.
Without the Kings, he said, "all they'd have for entertainment up
there is the Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has engaged Sacramento Mayor Heather Fargo in the traditional
wager on the outcome, putting up 34 jumbo tacos from East Los
Angeles' King Taco chain. "It seems only fitting," he said in a
letter to Fargo, "to send the number our star center Shaquille O'Neal
wears on his jersey, since we already sent you your center, [former
Laker] Vlade Divac."</TE>
<TE>   Fargo countered with several cases of Sacramento River bottled
water, a bow to the rapacious thirst of the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles wants our water so bad," she quipped, "I'm a little
afraid this may make them want to lose."</TE>

<HD>Pentagon to Cut Back Anthrax Vaccinations</HD>
<DH>Military: A new policy would limit shots to soldiers at
highest risk of being attacked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon wants to abandon its policy of anthrax vaccinations for
all troops and limit shots to those with the highest risk, officials
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   An announcement of the new policy two weeks ago was delayed
because of questions about how much vaccine American civilians might
need in case of a bioterrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   In attempting to rebuild a program hobbled for two years by a drug
shortage, officials are considering such issues as intelligence
assessments, dosing requirements and other national security
considerations, said Jim Turner, Pentagon spokesman on health issues.</LD>
<TE>   The program was started in 1998 to vaccinate all 2.4 million
members of the active and reserve military but was radically reduced
after factory violations by the nation's sole anthrax vaccine
manufacturer left the Pentagon with a dwindling supply.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some soldiers were very reluctant to take the shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration cleared Lansing, Mich.-based
BioPort's manufacturing plant in January to produce the vaccine and
release 500,000 doses already made.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-month study on how to rebuild the program, Secretary
of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld last month approved a plan to set aside
the original policy of vaccinating the whole force, according to
officials who have seen it.</TE>
<TE>   The plan now is to vaccinate only those at risk--and not disclose
who they would be for security reasons, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As for American civilians, health officials have said there's no
need for them to have the anthrax vaccine unless there is an attack.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's Homeland Security Office is trying to figure out
how much vaccine might be needed for police, firefighters, rescue
squads and others who would be "first responders" to any attack in
America.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon postponed its announcement on the military program
after homeland security officials said there wasn't enough known
about the needs of this group, estimated at 2 million, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon shared vaccine with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention last fall, when five people died and 13 were sickened
by anthrax-laced letters.</TE>
<TE>   Postal workers and Senate employees received protective
antibiotics in case they had been exposed to anthrax. After 60 days
of that, medical experts offered them choices of continuing

<HD>Beach Policy Goes Against the Grain</HD>
<DH>Access: An expensive, long-running battle waged by
Greenwich, Conn., to keep outsiders off its shoreline may serve as a
cautionary tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GREENWICH, Conn.</DL>
<LD>This tiny beach on Long Island Sound, a haven for America's
wealthiest community, is not really much of a beach at all.</LD>
<LD>   It is a cramped half-moon of gritty sand set in a cove that
stifles the waves. The shoreline is so small there is not room to do
much more than lie down and be quiet. Which is about all they allow
here anyway. No kite flying, no Wiffle ball, no loud radios.</LD>
<LD>   But the locals barred out-of-towners from using Greenwich Point
Park--and two other beaches in town--and spent six years fighting
challenges all the way to the state Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   They lost last summer but then drew another line in their sand,
deciding to charge nonresidents who want to enjoy a day at the beach
$10 a head--plus $20 for parking.</TE>
<TE>   From Maine to Malibu, public beaches have been adopting ever more
draconian restrictions, and increasingly they are facing
challenges--in court and in town halls.</TE>
<TE>   In Greenwich, the constant carping from homeowners associations,
the endless tit for tat among selectmen, the steady stream of angry
letters to the editor, the competing "save our shores" groups and the
costly lawsuit all may serve as a cautionary tale to governments and
private citizens who try to wall off their beaches.</TE>
<TE>   On the wide shores of Malibu, for example, the struggle for
decades has been to get the government to do something about rich and
powerful residents who block public easements. The property owners
have found creative ways--such as putting up chain-link fences that
jut into the water--to further the impression that they, not the
public, own the beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwich's courtroom defeat may be a bad sign for those in no
mood to make room for more towels and chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "What it comes down to is that there are more people and limited
beaches and thus more challenges," said David Bower, a University of
North Carolina professor of coastal management. And with values on
beachfront property soaring, the stakes are high.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwich got itself in trouble in the spring of 1994 when it
picked on the wrong jogger. Stamford, Conn., law student Brenden
Leydon was stopped at the gate as he tried to jog through Greenwich
Point Park on a sunny morning during spring break. The town custom
had been that only residents could use the park and its
half-mile-long beach.</TE>
<TE>   That fall, Leydon was studying a case on public trust doctrine and
decided to take on Greenwich.</TE>
<TE>   "It is remarkable how deeply angry Greenwich is about letting in
people who aren't paying their high taxes," said Leydon, now 33 and a
partner in a small law firm in Stamford.</TE>
<TE>   The case took many twists and turns over the years, but ended in
July with the state Supreme Court justices ruling unanimously that
excluding nonresidents would violate their 1st Amendment rights to
free expression and association.</TE>
<TE>   "The town lawfully cannot bar [Leydon] from Greenwich Point due
solely to the fact he is a nonresident, because the park is a public
forum," Justice Richard N. Palmer wrote for the majority.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenwich, a town of about 58,000, argued before the court
that beaches are for suntan lotion and swimming and not "public
forums" in the traditional or legal sense. Although the town tried to
get other communities along Connecticut's coastline with similar
restrictions--there are at least 10--to join the case, it ended up
going it alone and spending $110,000 on lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "These towns all expected Greenwich to be successful and did not
want the bad publicity or expense of being involved," said 1st
Selectman Richard Bergstresser, a Democrat in a town dominated since
the late 1800s by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the protective citizens of Greenwich ended up looking
like a bunch of uppity East Coast snobs.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, we should have settled all this a long time ago,"
Bergstresser added. "But politically, any selectman who would have
settled would have lost the next election. The right thing was
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   As the weather heated up this spring, the town board of selectmen
finally came up with a plan to allow outsiders to use the
beaches--but at a cost of $308 for a seasonal pass and $20 for a day
pass. And just for good measure, they figured nonresidents also
should have to hold permits to use the public parks.</TE>
<TE>   None of this played well outside Town Hall. The next day, the
local paper gasped that a visitor without a day pass could get
arrested for lolling about Greenwich Common, a swath of grass in the
center of town with a playground donated by the Junior League. Even
residents who had backed the lawsuit were appalled.</TE>
<TE>   Policing the common seemed anathema to what New England towns are
all about--and Greenwich was the laughingstock of the evening news.</TE>
<TE>   The three selectmen--stunned by widespread news reports that
emphasized the wealth in the community, where the median family
income is $82,900--immediately reversed themselves and agreed to
eliminate the common fee and lower the cost of a daily beach pass to
$10. Season passes cost $100 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the board continues to debate proposals aimed at getting
around the court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks ago, a neighborhood association demanded that
admission tickets and parking passes for one of Greenwich's three
beaches no longer be sold at its entrance. The board voted, 2 to 1,
to sell them exclusively at Town Hall and a civic center a few miles
from the beach--making it a little harder for folks to get there.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Helbig, 79, piped up at a recent meeting that the policy
welcoming nonresidents was "authoritarian."</TE>
<TE>   He complained: "I just think it's outrageous, almost to a point
where we're reaching a socialistic point of view!"</TE>
<TE>   The most vocal forces behind the no-outsiders policy have been
neighbors who fear that on hot summer weekends they'll be overrun by
New Yorkers swarming from the south and Stamford residents from the
north.</TE>
<TE>   And while the median sales price of a house in Greenwich is
$660,000, the beaches are probably the most democratic part of town.
They are mostly used by those who can't afford their own swimming
pools or membership in one of Greenwich's 17 private yacht and
country clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Sanger, a 21-year-old with a nose ring who had come from
White Plains, N.Y., on an unseasonably warm spring day, said she
thought having to spend $30 for the day at the beach was too much;
she left early "because there's no music and no boys." Even so, she
vowed to be back this summer: "This is nicer than anything we have in
my town."</TE>
<TE>   As she slathered suntan lotion on around her blue flowered bikini,
Betsy Scalter said she has objected to the less-restrictive policy
not because "I'm some kind of elitist" but because she doesn't want a
place she has come to since childhood ruined.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that simple. More people means more cars, more garbage, more
traffic jams," she said. "It's a peaceful place to come and I'm
afraid it will change."</TE>

<HD>Bush Defends Handling of Hijack Threat</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: White House takes to task critics of the
president's pre-Sept. 11 response. Democrats say the issue is
information and not partisanship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Friday dismissed as "second-guessing"
the mounting questions about his administration's response to
information in August that Osama bin Laden's associates might be
planning airline hijackings, as the political harmony surrounding the
anti-terrorism war all but shattered.</LD>
<LD>   In his first public comments on the controversy over the August
briefing, Bush also felt compelled to defend his actions before Sept.
11, saying he did not know "the enemy was going to use airplanes to
kill on that fateful morning."</LD>
<LD>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer questioned the
motivations of the president's critics, singling out Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) as a prime offender.</LD>
<TE>   Fleischer also said that any insinuation that the administration
may have possessed advance knowledge of the attacks "crosses the
lines" of legitimate political comment.</TE>
<TE>   First Lady Laura Bush chimed in from Europe. "It's sad to play
upon the emotions of people--as if there were something we could have
done to stop it, because that's just not the case," she told
reporters in Budapest, Hungary, her latest stop on a goodwill trip to
the continent.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, details emerged about an analysis commissioned by the
CIA in 1999 warning that operatives of Bin Laden might hijack a plane
and crash it into the White House or the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis included a photograph of the World Trade Center and
predicted that Bin Laden would "retaliate in a spectacular way" for
U.S. missile strikes in 1998 on Al Qaeda-linked compounds.</TE>
<TE>   The burst of partisan acrimony threatened to cloud planned
congressional investigations into the workings of the U.S.
intelligence community before Sept. 11 and the status of America's
domestic security since then.</TE>
<TE>   And as Republicans and Democrats fiercely wooed public opinion,
the furor raised questions about what is fair criticism and what is
the proper scope of congressional oversight, post-Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It also signaled a serious breach--and perhaps the end--to the
near unanimity with which Democrats have backed the administration's
handling of the terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   "The half-year-plus of national unity is officially over and the
election season has begun in earnest," said Larry J. Sabato, a
University of Virginia political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The political firestorm stems from the disclosure earlier this
week that senior intelligence officials had warned Bush on Aug. 6
that Bin Laden's Al Qaeda supporters might try to hijack American
airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials, including National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice, have sought to play down that report, insisting
that Bush had received only general information about such a threat.</TE>
<TE>   But such explanations have done little to quell demands for
investigations by lawmakers, including Sen. Richard C. Shelby of
Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate intelligence committee.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby, like others, questioned why the administration had not
previously disclosed the general warning of a possible hijacking
plot.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they've waited this long to get it out is
troubling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, took umbrage to the heated White Houe
response to their call for more information about the August briefing
and concerns they expressed about how the warning was handled.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nation is not well served when the charge of 'partisan
politics' is leveled at those who simply seek information the
American people need and deserve to know," said House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Cracks in the bipartisanship that had marked the response to Sept.
11 actually had begun to surface earlier this week amid publicity
over a Republican fund-raising technique. The party's Senate and
House campaign committees offered for $150 a series of three
photographs of Bush that includes one of him talking on the telephone
with Vice President Dick Cheney just hours after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats blasted the use of the photo as an attempt to capitalize
on the national tragedy; the GOP defended it as simply part of a
depiction of the president at work.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the White House effort Friday to defuse the flap over
the August briefing, Bush addressed the issue head-on during a Rose
Garden ceremony honoring the Air Force Academy football team.</TE>
<TE>   After a few introductory pleasantries, Bush said, "I want the
troops here to know that I take my job as the commander in chief very
seriously, that my most important job is to protect America and to
protect her homeland."</TE>
<TE>   The comment was a clear reference to any suggestion that the
administration had failed to give proper weight to the hijack
warning.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to turn the tables on those who have raised that
possibility, he said, ''You know what is interesting about
Washington? It's a town, unfortunately ... where second-guessing has
become second nature."</TE>
<TE>   He then added, enunciating slowly and carefully: "Had I known that
the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill on that fateful morning,
I would have done everything in my power to protect the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   The language was significant because, in the scores of speeches
Bush has made since Sept. 11, he never considered it necessary to
even broach that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer, at a White House briefing with reporters, suggested
that, even before Sept. 11, worries about possible terrorist strikes
were widespread, including on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   He recited remarks by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on CNN in
July 2001, in which she cited "a major probability of a terrorist
incident within the next three months."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer added: "If Sen. Feinstein, a Democrat on the
intelligence committee, was aware of this, the question arises, what
did the Democrats know and why weren't they talking to each other?"</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein responded that she had "no specific data" and was merely
expressing her doubts about whether "our house was in order to
prevent a terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "Despite repeated efforts by myself and my staff, the
White House did not address my request."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer had even harsher words for Sen. Clinton, saying that in
remarks Thursday she had spoken without bothering to learn the facts.</TE>
<TE>   In a Senate speech following disclosure of the August briefing,
Clinton said questions raised by it were "worthy of [congressional]
exploration." She called on Bush to "answer the questions so many New
Yorkers and Americans are asking."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer charged that Clinton's comments were in the same vein as
the New York Post front-page headline Thursday: "9/11 Bombshell: Bush
Knew."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Clinton "immediately went to the floor of the
Senate, and I'm sorry to say that she followed that headline" and
sought to divide the country.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City on Friday, Sen. Clinton said, "I am only seeking
answers and information. I am not looking to point fingers or place
blame on anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Other Democrats continued to call for a congressional inquiry into
questions raised by the August briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) disputed Bush's
"second-guessing" characterization. "We're simply trying to ensure
that [Sept. 11] never happens again."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the White House supports a congressional
investigation "so long as it was done in a responsible way." He added
that the administration would seek to avoid "a fishing expedition or
another endless waste of taxpayer money in an open-ended
congressional investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The bickering is unlikely to abate soon, said Sabato, the
political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "The shift was inevitable and may actually be healthy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Presidents and vice presidents are not royalty, and they are not
supposed to be insulated from sharp criticism, especially about
legitimate and important topics," Sabato added.</TE>

<HD>Army Agency Backpedals on Its Promise to Kill Water
Projects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Less than three weeks after the Army Corps of Engineers
said it would suspend about 150 of its congressionally approved water
projects in response to criticism of the agency's economic analyses,
the agency has already cleared most of them to proceed.</LD>
<LD>   The corps said Friday that it had reviewed 172 projects since
April 30, when Maj. Gen. Robert H. Griffin, its civil works director,
ordered an unprecedented agencywide "pause" in levee building, port
dredging and beach restoration projects justified by outdated or
questionable analyses. Griffin said 54 of those projects were still
being reevaluated, but only eight "as a result of this exercise." The
other 118 have been approved to continue.</LD>
<LD>   Corps critics on Capitol Hill, as well as environmentalists and
taxpayer advocates, immediately denounced the agency's
well-publicized self-examination as a farce. The same corps officials
who oversaw the original analyses were responsible for the reviews,
and several Bush administration officials with corps responsibilities
said they never were consulted.</LD>
<TE>   None of the corps projects that have been singled out for
criticism by the Office of Management and Budget, the General
Accounting Office or the National Academy of Sciences were among the
eight marked for further review as a result of Griffin's order.</TE>
<TE>   "What was promised to be a comprehensive review appears only to be
cheap window dressing," said Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), who has
introduced legislation to overhaul the corps but hailed the April 30
order as a "long overdue" step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more clear than ever that it is going to take congressional
action to fix the problems at the corps."</TE>
<TE>   In a memo accompanying his April 30 order, Griffin said it was
prompted by "serious questions in regard to the accuracy and currency
... and the rigor of the review process for some of the projects."
But in a news conference the next day, Griffin said he was unaware of
any specific problems with corps analyses; he just wanted to make
sure projects had updated studies before construction began.</TE>
<TE>   Friday he emphasized in a news release that the corps still plans
rigorous reviews of 54 projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned after calling for the pause that many of the projects
were already under review," Griffin said in the statement. "We must
be careful to ensure that all our projects constitute a sound
investment for our nation and are environmentally sustainable."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Rosie O'Donnell, ending the program that bears her name next week,
leaves with a six-year Daytime Emmy winning streak as best talk show
host.</LD>
<LD>   The farewell edition of "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" is Wednesday,
as the host leaves to raise a family and do other things.</LD>
<LD>   O'Donnell was named best talk show host every year she was
nominated, sharing the award with Oprah Winfrey in 1998 and Regis
Philbin in 2001. She called it "the best six years of my life."</LD>
<TE>   "It sounds trite to say, but seriously,the amount of grace I've
been able to experience through this job has been life-altering, and
I thank you for the privileg."</TE>
<TE>   "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" was named best talk show for the sixth
year in a row. Winfrey stopped submitting her show for Emmys after
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Sesame Street" was named outstanding preschool children's series
at the 29th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, held in Madison Square
Garden. The PBS children's show has won a staggering 79 Daytime
Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "One Life to Live," which has been on the air since 1968,
was named best daytime drama for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Bergman of "The Young and the Restless" won best actor in a
daytime drama, and Susan Flannery of "The Bold and the Beautiful" won
best actress.</TE>
<TE>   Due to a goof on the CBS telecast, the camera initially cut to
Susan Lucci and it was unclear which Susan won. Instead, Lucci lost
for the 20th time (she's won once).</TE>

<HD>A Wet Midwest Watches, Waits</HD>
<DH>Floods: Eight deaths in Missouri are blamed on weather. But
the worst seems over in some areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BATH, Ill.</DL>
<LD>As a daylong drizzle fell Friday, residents along the Illinois River
closely watched water levels and hoped the extra rain wouldn't worsen
flooding.</LD>
<LD>   At Betty Hamm's riverfront home in Bath, muddy, swirling flood
waters concealed the bright blooms in her flower garden. Hamm had
planned to stay put, but she decided to flee Friday after her gas was
cut off.</LD>
<LD>   "When it gets this high, it starts to scare me," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Other states also were hit by flooding. Flood watches continued
Friday over southern Indiana, and rain continued in Missouri. Floods
this month have been blamed for eight deaths in Missouri and, on
Thursday, contributed to an 8-year-old boy's drowning in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, some river communities saw improvement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have calmed down quite a bit," said Alden Taylor, a state
emergency management spokesman. "The rain we had last night really
didn't cause any problems."</TE>
<TE>   He said most rivers in the state were receding or holding steady.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.) urged President Bush to act quickly on
Gov. Bob Holden's request for emergency assistance for flooded
communities in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The Mississippi River appeared to have crested at Crystal City,
despite sometimes heavy rain Thursday and Friday. City officials,
neighbors and volunteers had piled thousands of sandbags to protect
their property.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody just digs in and helps out in this community," resident
Ron Sparks said. "We've never asked for help; people just show up.
That's why I live here."</TE>
<TE>   In Chandlerville, just south of Bath, flood waters began to recede
after the nearby Sangamon River crested at a record high late
Thursday. The agricultural town of about 700 came within
feet--possibly inches--of being inundated.</TE>
<TE>   Water covered almost a mile of farmland between Chandlerville and
the river, but the flood stopped at the elevated and sandbagged
roadbed of Highway 78.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers began filling sandbags May 8 in Chandlerville, and the
efforts continued Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "People thought we had a screw loose for being too cautious,"
Mayor Tim Richard said. "The worst thing you could do when something
like this might come is sit back and wonder if it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   During the last month, as much as 10 inches of rain has fallen
along the Illinois and Sangamon rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Tamminga, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency, said the Illinois River from Grafton to Lacon likely will
remain closed to boat traffic until flood waters begin receding. The
crest in some towns is not expected until Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Versed in Traffic Control</HD>
<DH>Rude noises of cars. Push Web designer to prose. And
lobbing some eggs. Or, how one Brooklyn man twisted haiku to calm his
nerves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Aaron Naparstek knows the exact moment when the car horns pushed him
over the edge and turned him into a vigilante poet.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just the constant noise outside his Brooklyn apartment
window when he was trying to work from home. It wasn't just the sonic
blasts from tractor-trailers that set off car alarms up and down the
block. It was the sheer futility of it--that New Yorkers believe
beeping their horns actually can dissolve a traffic jam, the way some
people think that the more times they push an elevator button, the
sooner the car will arrive.</LD>
<LD>   While working on his health-care Web site--which includes, among
other things, meditations for stress relief--the noise made him
irritable. He couldn't concentrate. He got to the point where he
could distinguish different taxi models just by the sounds of their
horns. Then, one day, a guy in a blue sedan just made him snap.</LD>
<TE>   "He was leaning on his horn," Naparstek said. "It wasn't just,
'Toot, toot.' It was: 'Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.'"</TE>
<TE>   Naparstek decided that, if the sedan was still honking by the time
he got to the refrigerator and back to the window, it deserved an egg
on the windshield. The first one hit the trunk. The second hit the
roof. "Clearly, I'd gone insane," Naparstek said. "But I was
thinking, 'I want windshield.'"</TE>
<TE>   As the egg splattered right on target, the honker got out of his
car and ranted at Naparstek, threatening to come back and kill him
while he slept. And while the driver made his death threats, the line
of cars that were stacked up for blocks all started to honk their
horns.</TE>
<TE>   Naparstek realized that, while fleetingly cathartic, the
egg-throwing had added to the problem. So he tried a nonviolent
approach. Prompted by his Zen meditation training, Naparstek wrote a
flurry of haiku--three-line stanzas in the classic Japanese 5-7-5
syllable form--and taped them on lampposts along Clinton Street. He
dubbed them "honku."</TE>
<TE>   You from New Jersey</TE>
<TE>   Honking in front of my house</TE>
<TE>   In your SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking cigarettes</TE>
<TE>   Blasting Hot97</TE>
<TE>   Futilely honking.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers couldn't read his poetry from the street, so Naparstek
wasn't expecting much of a response. But then other honku started to
appear--ones he hadn't written. Soon the lampposts were papered with
17-syllable verses, some printed out, some scrawled spontaneously
under his.</TE>
<TE>   We walk happily</TE>
<TE>   You honk in snarled traffic</TE>
<TE>   Who gets there first? Us!!</TE>
<TE>   Gazing at windows</TE>
<TE>   I think of the children's sleep</TE>
<TE>   Broken by the noise.</TE>
<TE>   From 17 syllables, a community movement was born. In the
tree-lined neighborhood of million-dollar brownstones, dog-walkers
and mothers pushing strollers could be seen wandering away from the
lampposts, counting syllables on their fingers as they composed their
own honku. Over the weeks, emboldened pedestrians began to chastise
ill-mannered drivers. Neighbors clustered at corners and shared
strategies. By the end of April, the honku-generated buzz brought
five police officers to Clinton Street to hand out $125 tickets for
noise violations. The local councilman deputized Naparstek as an
official "traffic calmer."</TE>
<TE>   "It may be," mused Naparstek, "the country's only example where
police and politicians responded to poetry."</TE>
<TE>   Honku and other issue-oriented haiku have migrated to the light
poles of nearby neighborhoods and Naparstek has created a virtual
lamppost, www.honku.org, attracting verse from Canada and Sweden.
There was even one from Los Angeles bemoaning its lack of honking:</TE>
<TE>   LA: no one honks</TE>
<TE>   Porsche guy on phone cuts me off</TE>
<TE>   I give him stink eye.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that there is a fine line between citizen activist and
curmudgeon, the 31-year-old Web designer just can't stay away from
the street. To truly understand the honking, Naparstek spends his
afternoons analyzing its origins--from the technical (the traffic
lights are not synchronized) to the psychosocial.</TE>
<TE>   And he has several theories about why drivers honk so much in New
York, especially on the single-lane shortcut to the Brooklyn Bridge
where he lives. Most people behind the wheel here are professional
drivers--cabbies, limo drivers and truckers stuck all day in
gridlock, he said. "They view their vehicle as their world, and
everything else is just in the way of their world." So, he says,
they're the quickest to hit the horn out of habit.</TE>
<TE>   Others honk because they're stuck behind the garbage truck
blocking the whole street at rush hour. They honk because someone's
tying up traffic trying to parallel park. And they honk because
people expect them to.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes drivers can't see the light and depend on the guy
behind them to let them know when to go." Naparstek raised an
eyebrow. "You know you're a New Yorker when you get mad at the person
behind you for not honking when the light turns green."</TE>
<TE>   Why did his honku strike such a chord? "I think people realized
that they weren't the only ones being driven crazy," Naparstek said.
It was a way to communicate without being confrontational. And trying
to boil sentiments down to 17 syllables made it a kind of
neighborhood game.</TE>
<TE>   Annie-B Parson, a choreographer who spent a recent weekend posting
honku with her daughter, has her own theory. "It's counterintuitive.
It's absurd. The people you're actually addressing, the drivers in
their cars, can't even see it. But it's emotional, and people respond
to it."</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the honking seems to have abated since the honku
began appearing, especially when the police were doling out fines,
but still the daily cacophony continues. So that drivers could get
the message too, Naparstek said, he has thought about making
"honkards": posters with the honku printed on tear-off strips so
pedestrians could present them to offending drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think, actually, that's pretty dangerous. Drivers get
really aggressive when you approach their space." He knows that from
the time he stuck his head in the open window of a beeping vehicle
and yelled at the driver, "Hoooooooooooooooonk!" He nearly didn't get
his head back. Perhaps the solution, he said, is one giant verse per
lamppost, like the old Burma Shave roadside signs.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody loves the honku. The last few rounds of verse were
scraped off the poles almost as fast as Naparstek and friends put
them up. (He thinks it's real estate agents, concerned that the
otherwise bucolic neighborhood is getting a bad reputation.) And,
this being New York, a few anti-honku haiku have appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Your thoughts are petty</TE>
<TE>   I think of children who are</TE>
<TE>   Starving, dying, scared.</TE>
<TE>   Naparstek, delighted that the opposition had adopted the form and
the forum, replied:</TE>
<TE>   We care about kids</TE>
<TE>   Why don't you write some starve-ku</TE>
<TE>   We're working on honks.</TE>
<TE>   On nice days, Naparstek can be found sitting on the stoop in front
of his brownstone, orchestrating traffic and practicing honk
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "Move up," he yelled to a green Toyota that left a full car length
of space ahead of it--a definite honk incitement. It moved up.</TE>
<TE>   "Sssssh." He caught the eye of a limousine driver honking at the
red light and put his fingers to his lips. The driver shrugged--but
didn't honk again.</TE>
<TE>   "I see the whole complexity of the system from up here," he said,
waving his arm over the avenue.</TE>
<TE>   But he won't be there to see it much longer.</TE>
<TE>   The poet of Clinton Street is moving to another neighborhood this
summer. He bought a house on a road that is under construction.
"That's the one thing that makes me really nervous. I don't know what
the traffic is like."</TE>

<HD>Relative of Defendant Testifies in Bomb Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A granddaughter of the former Klansman on trial in a 1963 church
bombing that killed four black girls testified Friday that he had
once crudely boasted about the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Teresa Stacy of Keller, Texas, took the stand as prosecutors
neared the end of their murder case against Bobby Frank Cherry, 71.
The defense will begin presenting its case today.</LD>
<LD>   Cherry is accused of helping plant the bomb that exploded outside
the 16th Street Baptist Church in the deadliest attack against the
civil rights movement.</LD>
<TE>   Stacy testified that Cherry bragged about the bombing one day
while sitting on the porch of his home in East Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he helped blow up a bunch of niggers back in Birmingham,"
said Stacy, who said she was between 9 and 11 at the time and is now
in her late 40s. "He seemed rather jovial, braggish."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry stared at Stacy as she took the stand. He described her as
a "dope head" and prostitute in a 1999 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Mickey Johnson tried to damage the credibility of
Stacy, who admitted on cross-examination that she started doing drugs
at age 12 and was in rehabilitation by age 13.</TE>
<TE>   "Cocaine was my drug of choice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy said she also is a recovering alcoholic and confirmed that
she threatened to quit assisting the FBI unless agents helped secure
a reduced prison sentence for her brother, who is behind bars for an
undisclosed reason.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy is the daughter of Tom Cherry, who has publicly contradicted
one of his father's alibis for the bombing. It was unclear whether
Tom Cherry will testify.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Frank Cherry is accused of being part of a group of Ku Klux
Klansmen who detonated a bomb outside the church on a Sunday morning
the weekend after Birmingham's public schools were racially
integrated for the first time.</TE>

<HD>Lieberman Warns White House</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The senator threatens legal action to get
information on staff links to Enron officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said Friday he'll try to subpoena
the White House for information on staff contacts with Enron Corp.
officials unless the administration promises to provide the material
by the end of the month.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the first subpoena to the Bush White House, though the
General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, already has
sued Vice President Dick Cheney to force release of the names of
Enron and other industry figures who met last year with his energy
task force.</LD>
<LD>   White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales said Friday that the
administration was cooperating and would continue to cooperate with
the inquiry of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is
headed by Lieberman.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm still optimistic that we can avoid" a subpoena, Gonzales told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the White House cannot commit to providing
everything the panel is seeking because it doesn't fully understand
the scope and details of its request.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 people work in President Bush's executive office, and
most of them do not hold positions that would involve contact with
Enron executives, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ken Lay's going to call the White House, he's going to call
someone pretty senior," he said, referring to the former Enron
chairman who was one of Bush's biggest campaign contributors.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Lieberman's request, Gonzales on April 29 asked 204
White House staffers to fill out a questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   A White House official said Friday evening that the staff had
offered to give the questionnaire to a wider group of people if that
would settle the matter. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman has been in a push-and-pull with the White House since
requesting the information in late March as part of the panel's Enron
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Gonzales, Lieberman wrote, "More than seven weeks
have passed ... and the committee has received virtually no
information from you."</TE>
<TE>   He said the only material the White House had provided was copies
of letters responding to other congressional inquiries and a
transcript of a Bush news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Lieberman said, the federal agencies from which the
committee had asked for information--including the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
Labor Department--had provided "detailed responses" within three to
four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said he would ask his committee on Wednesday to vote on
authorizing a subpoena unless Gonzales assures the panel he will take
steps to broaden the search for information and to provide the
material by the end of May.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said he was surprised and disappointed by Lieberman's
subpoena threat.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that we have been responsive. We are working to be
responsive," he said at the White House. He said his office would be
"as cooperative as we feel we can be."</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron was among Bush's biggest campaign
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   The administration disclosed in January that Lay made a series of
telephone calls to members of the Bush Cabinet, including Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, as the
company spiraled toward collapse last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The energy-trading company entered the biggest corporate
bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate panel has been looking into why federal regulators did
not raise warning flags about Enron's questionable business practices
and intervene.</TE>

<HD>Ill, Orphaned Orca May Be Diabetic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Blood tests on an orphaned orca that's been making her home in nearby
waters show she has no genetic disorder affecting her metabolism, the
National Marine Fisheries Service said.</LD>
<LD>   That's good news for the killer whale. The only way to treat a
genetic disorder would have been to regulate her diet, which would
have meant a lifetime of captivity.</LD>
<LD>   But now scientists are perplexed about what is causing the young
whale's most puzzling symptom: ketosis--breath that smells like paint
thinner.</LD>
<TE>   Ketosis also occurs in humans and has three known causes: the
genetic disorder scientists checked for, starvation and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   The young orca doesn't have the disorder and has been eating well,
fisheries service spokeswoman Janet Sears said Thursday night. That
leaves diabetes, which scientists didn't think orcas could have.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have to go back and reassess the diabetes, which people
didn't think possible," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The fisheries service plans to reconvene a panel of scientists
Monday to evaluate the blood test results.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) also weighed in on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This orca needs a decision and an action plan," she said in a
letter to Bob Lohn, regional director for the fisheries service. "We
cannot afford to let indecision on timing determine this orphaned
orca's fate."</TE>
<TE>   The whale was orphaned last year and separated from her family.
She wandered into Puget Sound and has spent the last four months near
the Vashon Island ferry dock. She's thinner than she should be, but
has been successfully hunting steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver Aquarium in British Columbia has offered to help
care for the whale and possibly return her to her family, which
spends the summer in waters off Vancouver Island, but was pressing
the fisheries service for a decision on whether to try to capture
her. Aquarium officials had said they needed a decision on any
intervention effort by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But with the blood test results in, the aquarium has become more
flexible, Sears said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working with them informally on that," she said.
"We'll be looking at all of that and trying to sort it out next
week."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Is Granted Bail in Shooting of Priest</HD>
<DH>Crime: Judge, in a rare step, puts the defendant under
house arrest. Cardinal in Baltimore apologizes to the alleged sexual
abuse victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>In 1993, when Dontee Stokes accused a beloved parish priest of having
molested him for three years, it seemed to some observers that the
whole world was ganging up on the distraught 17-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, as a judge was deciding whether Stokes could be
released from jail after he allegedly shot and wounded the priest
earlier this week, the world seemed to have rallied around what they
saw as a victim turned vigilante.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal William Keeler, who had reinstated the priest a decade
ago despite the credibility of Stokes' claim, apologized to Stokes
from the pulpit of the Basilica. A Roman Catholic school principal,
herself a nun, was among those who testified on his behalf. And,
perhaps most remarkably, the state's attorney's office said it would
support Stokes' release on bail, a rare step in a first-degree
attempted murder case.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, District Judge H. Gary Bass set a $150,000 bail and
ordered Stokes released to privately monitored house arrest at the
home of an aunt--a resolution both prosecutors and defense attorneys
said they had never before seen.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments in the Stokes case marked a rare turn in the
sexual abuse scandal that is roiling the Roman Catholic Church, most
notably the church's public stand with the abused and vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced by developments since Wednesday's initial bail hearing
that Stokes would not try to flee the area or kill himself, Bass said
Friday that his final concern was that Stokes not be in a position to
hurt Father Maurice Blackwell, who is expected to survive his wounds,
or anyone in Blackwell's family.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's shooting of Blackwell "happened out of the blue," Bass
said. Given the circumstances, Bass said, "who's to say it wouldn't
happen again?"</TE>
<TE>   Stokes will stay with an aunt in an area "nowhere near" the
Reservoir Street home Blackwell shares with his mother, or the house
just two blocks away where Stokes lives. The 26-year-old barber will
not be allowed to work and will wear an electronic ankle bracelet
programmed to set off an alarm if he leaves the house for more than
59 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The background of Stokes' case generated considerable public
sympathy for him. After Stokes first reported the alleged abuse to
authorities in 1993, he passed two polygraph tests, and investigators
were convinced his claim was credible. "He did everything right," one
law enforcement official said this week.</TE>
<TE>   But Blackwell denied the accusations and no charges were filed.
Church authorities allowed Blackwell to return as pastor of St.
Edward Catholic Church in West Baltimore, where he stayed until 1998.
Church authorities forced him out of the ministry after he confessed
to a two-decade-old affair with a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes' lead attorney, Thomas McNicholas, said his law firm had
received numerous offers to contribute to or set up a legal defense
fund. The family, which has received calls of support from around the
country, has opened a post office box to receive contributions and to
encourage other abuse victims to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday was the first time that Cardinal Keeler publicly
acknowledged Stokes' anguish and apologized to him and others
sexually abused by Catholic priests.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that there have been painful breaches of trust, and have
dedicated ourselves to seeking solace for victims and fair punishment
for perpetrators," Keeler wrote in the Baltimore Sun.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Keeler's remarks, delivered from the pulpit of the
city's grandest cathedral at a midday Mass for the archdiocese's
youth ministers, that most directly addressed his own actions
regarding Stokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I take this occasion to apologize to Mr. Stokes, who has suffered
immensely," Keeler said. "I express my sympathy to him and his family
members."</TE>
<TE>   Across town, meanwhile, about 100 of Stokes' family members,
co-workers and friends left no empty space in District Courtroom 4.</TE>
<TE>   When Stokes, wearing handcuffs and a black jumpsuit, appeared on a
closed-circuit monitor from the jail, his fiancee, Tiffani Taft,
began wailing and was briefly escorted outside before regaining her
composure and returning.</TE>
<TE>   His 20-month-old daughter, Tenay, in a light blue dress, white
stockings and white shoes, pointed at the monitor and said, "Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Stokes' father, Chinor Coleman, came from his home in
Fayetteville, N.C. "That's my son," Coleman said proudly when
psychiatrist Steve Siebert testified that Stokes was "praying for
[Blackwell's] recovery, and he is remorseful for his actions."</TE>
<TE>   In the courthouse parking lot, more openly jubilant family members
managed to reach Stokes by cell phone. "We love you," they took turns
shouting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosecution's support for the unusual outcome in the
hearing, assistant state's attorney Sylvester Cox said his office
intends to fully prosecute the case.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Stokes Sr., Dontee's grandfather and the old-fashioned
patriarch of a family that includes 47 grandchildren, tried to temper
his happiness with realism.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just phase one," he said after the hearing. "Don't kid
yourself. You can pray all you want, but an act of violence was
committed."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "Dontee has already served his time: nine years in
hell. I hope the judge will see it that way."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: The plan was to sink the Spiegel Grove, a retired
Navy ship, to create an artificial reef off Key Largo, Fla., to
attract marine life and for use by recreational divers. But the
510-foot vessel flipped after taking on too much water as crews
prepared to scuttle the 46-year-old cargo boat. Workers were able to
scramble aboard nearby tugboats as the hulk went down, upside down,
in about 160 feet of water six miles off the coast. Officials were
studying how to right the ship on the seabed.</CP>

<HD>Jealousy Motive Is Cited in Skakel Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: Ex-classmate says the defendant felt his brother had
stolen Moxley's affections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel felt his brother had stolen the
affections of neighbor Martha Moxley, a former classmate testified
Friday, offering a possible motive for the 1975 slaying of the
15-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, a 41-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel,
is charged with bludgeoning Moxley to death with a golf club in their
wealthy Greenwich neighborhood in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel and Moxley were both 15 at the time.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors Friday also read into the record testimony from
Gregory Coleman, who died after using heroin last year. Coleman
claimed Skakel once told him: "I'm gonna get away with murder. I'm a
Kennedy."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have said both Michael and his older brother,
Thomas, were romantically interested in Moxley.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Arnold, a classmate of Michael Skakel's during the 1970s
at the Elan School, a substance abuse treatment center in Maine for
young people, testified that Skakel said he thought his brother
"stole his girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   "He said they didn't really have sex, but they were fooling
around," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold said the issue came up in a small-group discussion at Elan,
when classmates asked Skakel about the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he didn't know what happened that night, he was very
drunk and had some sort of blackout, and he had done it or his
brother had done it," Arnold said.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination by defense attorney Michael Sherman, Arnold
acknowledged that she had not mentioned the comments when she
testified before a one-judge grand jury that investigated the case.</TE>
<TE>   She also acknowledged that she recalled the comments after reading
a book about the Moxley case by former Los Angeles police Det. Mark
Fuhrman that speculates about a jealousy motive.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold and another former student, Alice Dunn, described an
intense meeting at Elan that Arnold said occurred a few days before
the small-group session. At the session, Arnold said, Skakel was put
in a boxing ring with other residents and was "brutalized."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said Skakel was dragged into a room full of classmates and
Elan staff. School director Joseph Ricci brought up the murder
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel "said for at least a half an hour, 'I didn't do it.' Every
time he said he didn't do it, he was put into a boxing ring," Dunn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Dunn said, Skakel said he didn't know whether he had
killed Moxley.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination, she said the beatings would stop when
Skakel changed his responses from denial to "I don't know."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Had Plan for Covert Afghan Options Before 9/11</HD>
<DH>Military: The proposal was awaiting Bush's approval Sept.
10, White House says. Aid for Northern Alliance had been hammered
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Moving to stem the criticism of its actions leading up to the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, the White House said Friday that it was on the
verge of approving a $200-million covert military program to aid
beleaguered anti-Taliban guerrillas in Afghanistan last summer.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, developed after repeated CIA attempts to capture or
kill Osama bin Laden had come to naught, was finalized Sept. 10 and
was awaiting President Bush's approval when the suicide skyjackers
crashed commercial airliners into the Pentagon and World Trade
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the plan, known as a national security presidential
directive, was viewed as an extension of secret CIA operations
already underway in and around Afghanistan, rather than a first-time
effort to attack Bin Laden.</LD>
<TE>   But the plan also reflected intense frustration among
policymakers. The Clinton administration had tried both diplomacy and
arms sanctions in an unsuccessful campaign to convince the Taliban
ruling elite to surrender Bin Laden and his top lieutenants.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials said Bush's senior national security
team--including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Secretary of
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice--had agreed at a Sept. 4 "principals committee" meeting to try
another tack by backing Northern Alliance guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   The White House described the plan, parts of which were previously
reported, as congressional critics stepped up their demands for an
independent investigation into whether the Bush administration
ignored clues that might have averted the attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The furor was sparked when news reports this week revealed that
the CIA had advised Bush on Aug. 6 at his regular morning briefing
that Al Qaeda might seek to hijack a commercial jet.</TE>
<TE>   Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said Friday that the
title of the president's intelligence brief that day was "Bin Laden
Determined to Strike the United States."</TE>
<TE>   It was because of such threats, Fleischer said, that the proposed
covert aid program was "a comprehensive, multi-front plan to
dismantle the Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   He said it included directions for the Pentagon "to develop
military options" as well as efforts to "dry up" the group's
financial sources.</TE>
<TE>   But other officials said the plan did not propose using U.S.
airstrikes or American ground troops, which later played a crucial
role in driving the Taliban from power.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Clarke, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Central Command
never received orders to move forces or military assets in
preparation for a campaign in Afghanistan before Sept. 11. "It was
not a Pentagon battle plan at all," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan had special urgency, however, because U.S. intelligence
agencies, as well as other governments' spy services, were picking up
a crescendo of threats of possible terrorist strikes last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The chatter level went way off the charts," Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, recalled
recently, "and had been for several months."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA had opened a special unit at headquarters to track the
Saudi terrorist after he moved to Afghanistan in 1996 and was able to
intercept conversations on his American-made satellite phone until he
changed phones, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1998, a month after Al Qaeda operatives bombed two
U.S. embassies in East Africa, the Clinton administration fired 70
missiles at an Al Qaeda training camp in eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The target was chosen, intelligence officials said, because an
electronic intercept had indicated Bin Laden would be present. He
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said the agency later began training and
arming proxy forces in Pakistan, Uzbekistan and inside Afghanistan,
hoping they would capture or kill Bin Laden. They didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Other CIA operatives used remote-controlled Predator drone
aircraft, then armed only with cameras, to search for Bin Laden. And
covert teams of CIA paramilitary officers entered the country at
least once in hopes of grabbing Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people who had been in and out of Afghanistan," said a
senior intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent speech, Jim Pavitt, head of the CIA clandestine
service, said the agency's covert operations inside Afghanistan paved
the way for last fall's rout of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew who to approach on the ground, which operations, which
warlord to support, what information to collect," he said. "Quite
simply, we were there before the 11th of September."</TE>
<TE>   Northern Alliance commanders, in particular, had pleaded for
American support in meetings with the CIA and other officials. They
sent emissaries armed with maps and other intelligence to Washington,
and met U.S. diplomats in Europe and Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   But some U.S. policy planners warned that the ethnic minorities in
the group, and the groups' political ambitions to rule in
Afghanistan, could draw the United States into a new round of the
factional fighting that had ravaged the country for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument was it was politically untenable--that it could
create a civil war," one official recalled of the debate within the
State Department. "But there were other people who said, 'Who
cares?'"</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official in the Clinton administration said the
proposal to arm the Northern Alliance was discussed "the whole year
of 2000," especially after the U.S. destroyer Cole was attacked by
suicide bombers in a small boat in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   But no decision was made because President Clinton left office
before the FBI concluded that it was Al Qaeda that attacked the Cole,
the former official said.</TE>
<TE>   Before its term ended, the Clinton administration successfully
fought at the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on the
Taliban, beating back moves to extend the ban to other armed groups
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Northern Alliance was getting assistance from
Russia and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to punish the Taliban, and we made it very specifically
clear we were not going to cut off the Northern Alliance," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue was how do you take out Al Qaeda?" he added. "Do you do
the full mass invasion, which was really not an option prior to 9/11?</TE>
<TE>   "No one seriously considered that. The only other option ... was
to support the Northern Alliance in varying degrees."</TE>

<HD>'99 Report Warned About Plot Like 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A 1999 analysis commissioned by the CIA warned that Osama bin Laden
loyalists might crash a plane into the Pentagon or the White House,
adding to the controversy Friday over the Bush administration's
insistence that it had no way of predicting the Sept. 11 hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   The report's warnings, coupled with new details about the FBI's
failure to pass on suspicions about flight schools from its Phoenix
office, further inflamed members of Congress who believe authorities
missed key opportunities to head off the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The report to the CIA, prepared by government researchers in
September 1999, included a picture of the World Trade Center towers
and warned the CIA that Bin Laden "most likely will retaliate in a
spectacular way" for U.S. missile strikes a year earlier on Al
Qaeda-linked compounds.</LD>
<TE>   "Suicide bomber(s) belonging to Al Qaida's Martyrdom Battalion
could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives ... into the
Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
or the White House," the analysis concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The detailed warning was not included in a classified briefing
that the CIA gave President Bush in August about the prospect of Al
Qaeda hijackings--a briefing that Bush administration officials said
was too vague to warrant concrete action. And White House officials
did not see the report until Friday morning, spokesman Ari Fleischer
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is seeking to determine why the report was
never relayed to the White House or other national security personnel
who might have included it in their pre-Sept. 11 analyses of how the
U.S. should respond to the terrorist threat, according to a
department official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at any clues ... that might have better informed
our understanding of what Al Qaeda was planning," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Friday that, because the document was primarily a
psychological profile of terrorists rather than a traditional
intelligence report, it "did not raise alarms" and never reached the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the report's existence capped a bruising week for
the White House in which Bush administration officials were forced to
fend off questions about whether they gave short shrift to possible
warning signs before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said the
Bush administration never had a specific warning on which to act.
"Had this president known of something more specific, or that a plane
was going to be used as a missile, he would have acted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at the White House on Friday, Bush bemoaned the
widespread "second-guessing" in Washington and declared: "Had I known
that the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill on that fateful
morning, I would have done everything in my power to protect the
American people."</TE>
<TE>   John Gannon, who was director of the CIA's intelligence branch at
the time the document was published, said the 1999 report challenges
the notion that a Sept. 11-style attack was all but inconceivable
before it happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody I know at the time would have ruled this out as an
option," Gannon said. "This document very much thought this was an
option."</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 document was commissioned by Gannon as material for a
broader report on the global trends and threats envisioned through
2015. Unlike Bush's August briefing by the CIA, which was based on
classified information, the more detailed, 138-page report in 1999
was culled from publicly available sources by the Federal Research
Division, a branch of the Library of Congress, and it was posted last
December on its www.loc.gov Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The report's reference to a possible hijacking plot was largely
drawn from the comments of Ramzi Yousef, who lighted the fuse of the
bomb that exploded beneath the World Trade Center in 1993, said a
U.S. intelligence official.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Rice's assertions, the possibility of terrorists using
aircraft to strike other targets "had been thought of a lot," the
official said. But it was never considered as likely as other methods
of attack, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the intelligence community was far more concerned
about Al Qaeda obtaining biological or chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to rack and stack a list of most likely threats, or
the ones people were most worried about, hijacking would have been
lower than car bombs and truck bombs," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   However, national security experts say the threat of terrorists
using a hijacked plane as a weapon dates at least to 1973, when the
Israelis said they had received reports that Arab terrorists were
planning to crash a civilian plane laden with explosives into Tel
Aviv or other cities in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The political firestorm in Washington over what the White House
knew has intensified in part because of the administration's refusal
to publicly release a memo written by an FBI agent in Phoenix last
summer recommending that the bureau canvass flight schools to look
for suspicious Middle Eastern students.</TE>
<TE>   A number of lawmakers called again Friday for the administration
to turn over to the Senate and House intelligence committees the
CIA's Aug. 6 briefing memo to Bush and the Phoenix memo.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI is holding its ground on the Phoenix memo. "It's
classified. It hasn't been released, and I don't think there are any
immediate plans to do so," an FBI official said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The memo recommends that "the FBI should accumulate a listing of
civil aviation universities/colleges around the country" to
investigate the agent's suspicions that Middle Easterners might be
using flight schools as terrorist training grounds, according to a
government official.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA, which had never seen the Phoenix memo before Sept. 11,
recently obtained a copy for the first time and found its contents
"remarkable," a senior U.S. intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly would have set off additional inquiries and work"
within the agency had the CIA been aware of its contents, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that at the time the memo was written none of
the names contained in it would have set off alarms at the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have those names connected with Al Qaeda at that time,"
the official said. But two of the names in the memo have since been
linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials have become increasingly frustrated by
this week's tempest because many believe that even knowing what they
did before Sept. 11 about the tremendous threat that Bin Laden posed,
they had little recourse in heading off a possible attack.</TE>
<TE>   "If the FBI sought to undertake what the Phoenix memo suggested,
it would have opened up a powder keg of protests from the Arab
American community and civil liberties groups," a federal law
enforcement official said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 report to the CIA, while informative, "was just a
hypothesis. Similar hypotheses come into FBI field offices every day.
The only thing different about this one is that it was somewhat
prophetic," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Clinton said he also discounted the report's
analysis on Bin Laden. "That has nothing to do with intelligence," he
said Friday night. "It basically says he's a dangerous guy that might
do a lot of things."</TE>
<TE>   But Robert David Steele, a national security author who has pushed
for years for the U.S. intelligence agencies to make better use of
publicly available material, said the episode points out the
shortcomings in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether from open sources or from classified sources, the sorry
reality is that the existing U.S. intelligence community process is
unable to connect the dots because the dots never come together in
any one place," Steele said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) demanded Friday that the CIA
inspector general look into how the 1999 report was handled.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee, and the other ranking members of the intelligence panels
are scheduled to meet with Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft on Tuesday to
discuss concern among investigators that they are being denied access
to documents and witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to maintain the bipartisan, bicameral effort," Goss
said. "But it's hard because we're getting pushed by colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "My colleagues are outraged that somebody would attack the
president. And there is an uproar on the other side by people saying
[the White House] hasn't come clean."</TE>

<HD>Kings May Be Ready for Their Big Growth Spurt</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Driving around here during the opening weekend of the NCAA
tournament, before USC and Pepperdine got bounced, I had the feeling
we'd be back.</LD>
<LD>   It's the Sacramento Kings' time. Not necessarily their time to win
a championship, but this group has come of age. They've earned this
chance.</LD>
<LD>   Great NBA teams aren't like those NFL bolts of lightning that
flash into the Super Bowl; they're more like waves that you can see
building off the shore.</LD>
<TE>   Two key events last summer, the re-signing of free agent Chris
Webber and the trade of Jason Williams for Mike Bibby, allowed the
wave, four years in the making, to keep rolling. The circus has left
town and a basketball team now occupies Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to say that the Kings are all grown up. But they're
well past puberty, past most of the childish antics, past the
outbreaks of turnovers that plagued them like acne.</TE>
<TE>   They're still colorful: See Scot Pollard's whitewashed 'do and the
frosted tips on the head of Hedo Turkoglu, who has been dubbed
"Justin Timberlake" by his teammates since he put the highlights in
before the Dallas series.</TE>
<TE>   Just don't expect anyone to break out a Harry Caray imitation, the
way Pollard did in a national TV interview after a playoff victory
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm closing into a shell right now," Pollard said. "I'm waiting
for the summertime to bust out and be all my glorious self that I can
be. This series is the very boring, vanilla-flavored Scot."</TE>
<TE>   And the very serious, legitimate Kings.</TE>
<TE>   They're in their final year of college now. One last stretch
without repercussions before they deal with the responsibilities of
jobs and bills and car payments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been four years," said Vlade Divac, sounding like a wistful
senior. "We grew up as a team a lot. The friendship that we built
here, this is the best team I've ever played [on] my entire career.
It's fun. Every time I wake up, I'm looking forward to practice,
because I want to see those guys. That makes it much easier on the
floor, because you can trust guys."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Kings come in as the higher seeded team, no one
will be surprised if the Lakers beat them. Was anyone shocked that
the Yankees took out the Mariners last year after Seattle's wondrous
regular season? Did anyone call the Mariners chokers? Nope.</TE>
<TE>   Same deal for the Kings. But no more free passes after this. If
they can't do it this year, then any and all subsequent losses to the
Lakers have to be considered failures, signs that they just can't get
over the hump.</TE>
<TE>   But lately the Kings have been so good at answering questions,
even Anne Robinson, the host of "The Weakest Link," would have a hard
time mocking them.</TE>
<TE>   How would they do when Chris Webber had to sit out the first 20
games of the regular season because of a sprained ankle? A 15-5 start
allowed them to hang with L.A. during the Lakers' best month and was
the first sign that they were on to something.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Lakers beat them here March 24 to turn up the heat in
the Pacific Division race? The Kings responded with a 10-game winning
streak--seven on the road--to clinch the best record in the league.</TE>
<TE>   In these playoffs, they found themselves scrapping against the
Utah Jazz, banged up against the high-powered Dallas Mavericks and
yet they prevailed. They had to win on the road after losing home
games in each series and have responded by winning all four road
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it doesn't matter where we play," Doug Christie said. "We
know that we're capable of winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the mental aspect that I spoke of before the
season. We were going to have to learn how to win those games and
play under pressure situations and see them in a light that isn't
pressure, it's just relaxed and go out there and play.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done that and taken a step in the right direction.
Physically, I think we're as good as any team in the NBA. Do we have
the mental fortitude to go out there every night and put it down?"</TE>
<TE>   He says the answer is yes.</TE>
<TE>   Now they face the big question, the same one any team faces if it
wants to think about championship rings and banners: Can they beat
the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   They won't come out and say it, but they need the Lakers. They've
got to beat them to validate their season. Now they have their
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's only right," Webber said. "No matter who the
champions are, you've got to respect them and give them all the
credit they deserve. Even if the Clippers would have won it last
year, you'd have to give the champions credit. [The Lakers are] the
champions, and you give them the credit and respect. But we want it.
We want what they have, we want to be where they are."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can still get goofy. Nobody--nobody--clowns opposing
crowds the way the Kings do when they win on the road. But that's the
thing--they win on the road a lot now, which is a sign of a
legitimate team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're growing up," Pollard said. "We're a better team. We win
more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of all the best teams in the league, we do have the most
fun, we're still the most exciting to watch. I don't think that you
have to sacrifice the entertaining style, the fun style that we play
and show off on the court. That doesn't mean that you can't do that
and still win. We do that and still win."</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who used to get so worked up that his lip would quiver, is
much more subtle these days. He said his confidence is "at an
all-time high. This is what it's about, this is what I've been
waiting for."</TE>
<TE>   I can't say I've been waiting for a weekend in Sacramento. But I
sure have been expecting it.</TE>

<HD>Giambi Slams Door on Twins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Giambi hit a grand slam through the rain in the 14th inning
Friday night, rallying the New York Yankees to a 13-12 victory over
the Minnesota Twins at New York.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees hit six homers, including a tying solo shot by Bernie
Williams with one out in the ninth. But New York stranded nine
runners in the first four extra innings and gave up three runs in the
14th before winning in the bottom half.</LD>
<LD>   Shane Spencer led off with a single against former Dodger Mike
Trombley (0-1) and Derek Jeter singled with one out. Williams walked
to bring up Giambi.</LD>
<TE>   With only a few thousand fans left, Giambi provided the signature
moment of his short Yankee career. He hit a shot into the
right-center field bleachers, setting off a wild celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees poured out of the dugout as Giambi rounded the bases
and mobbed him at home plate. According to the Yankees, it was the
21st time a player has hit a game-ending grand slam with his team
down three runs. Babe Ruth was the only other Yankee to do it, on
Sept. 24, 1925.</TE>
<TE>   New York hit six homers in all, tying the team record for most
homers in a game at Yankee Stadium. Williams hit two, and Robin
Ventura, Alfonso Soriano and Jorge Posada also homered. The Yankees
have 20 homers in their last five games, a team record, and lead the
majors with 68 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, Boston 3--Jeff Cirillo's two-run single broke a
sixth-inning tie as the Mariners rallied past the Red Sox at Boston
in the opener of a three-game series between baseball's top teams.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle overcame a 3-0 deficit on Ichiro Suzuki's two-run double
in the fourth and a three-run sixth capped by the bases-loaded hit by
Cirillo, whose error led to a run that had put Boston ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Cleveland 2--Paul Byrd became the AL's second
seven-game winner, and Tony Pena got his first victory as manager of
the Royals in the win at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd (7-2) gave up five hits in eight innings and beat the Indians
for the second time in six days to join Chicago's Mark Buehrle with
seven victories.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Texas 3--Robert Fick homered twice, and Dmitri Young
and Wendell Magee also connected at Detroit as the Tigers ended a
seven-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Young hit a two-run homer in the first off Dave Burba (3-1), Magee
a solo shot in the second and Fick in the third. Fick had a two-run
shot off John Rocker in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Oakland 1--Roy Halladay won his second consecutive
start against the Athletics, and Shannon Stewart hit a three-run
homer for the Blue Jays at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 5, Tampa Bay 3--Jeff Conine hit a tiebreaking homer in
the seventh inning, and Geronimo Gil drove in three runs as the
Orioles ended a four-game losing streak by defeating the Devil Rays
at Baltimore.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Scioscia Suggests Mediation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he was "troubled" by talk of another
player strike and suggested the owners and players' union submit
their labor dispute to a mediator. That approach failed during the
last strike in 1994, when the Clinton administration appointed former
Secretary of Labor William Usery as a mediator in a dispute that
ultimately required court intervention.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia pointed out that a stoppage of play would hurt the sport
not only in the United States and Canada but all over the world, with
baseball's popularity increasing abroad even as it declines at home.</LD>
<LD>   Major League Baseball generates enormous interest in Asia and
Latin America, as native sons increasingly populate the majors. A
World Cup of baseball is on the horizon, All-Star game ballots are
distributed in English, Spanish and Japanese, and, according to
ESPN.com, annual international revenues shared among major league
owners have increased from $10 million in 1989 to $80 million today.</LD>
<TE>   "With the kind of interest and worldwide attention and excitement
baseball is generating, this is a golden opportunity to expand on
that," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pote pitched so well last season that the Angels reserved him
a spot in their bullpen this season. Good thing for him, because he
wouldn't have made the team off his Cactus League statistics--a 15.00
earned-run average in 12 innings, with opponents batting .426 against
him.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels stuck with him, and they've been rewarded. He checked
out some old video, changed a grip on his split-finger pitch and the
results have been terrific: a 1.71 ERA in 21 innings, with opponents
batting .134 against him.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway is close to getting back into
football--but not with the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   Elway and a group of investors are deciding whether to go ahead
with placing an Arena Football League expansion team in Denver for
the 2003 season.</LD>
<LD>   "If we're going to do it we want to do it next year," Elway said
Friday. "And we have about a three-to four-week window to decide if
we're going to try."</LD>
<TE>   Elway and the investors--who include Pat Bowlen, owner of the
Denver Broncos, and Stan Kroenke, owner of the Pepsi Center, NBA's
Denver Nuggets and NHL's Colorado Avalanche--were approved for an
expansion franchise by the league's board of directors last August.</TE>
<TE>   The Arena league currently has 16 teams, including the Los Angeles
Avengers. Dallas and Atlanta are the newest teams, and there are
plans for the league to expand by four teams next year and add two
more teams over the next three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Denver, other expansion franchises are being considered in
New Orleans, Washington, Philadelphia, Nashville, Jacksonville and
San Francisco. Denver had an Arena team from 1987, the league's first
season, to 1991. The team, known as the Dynamite, won the league's
first championship game, defeating Pittsburgh, 45-16.</TE>
<TE>   Elway spoke at a luncheon Friday for the Avengers in Staples
Center.</TE>

<LD>Five games into the Arena Football League season, and the Avengers
find themselves in unfamiliar territory. Until this season, the
third-year franchise had not won a game before May 26.</LD>
<LD>   With a 38-24 victory over the Tampa Bay Storm Friday, in front of
11,961 at Staples Center, the 3-2 Avengers not only sport a winning
record in May, they are becoming a playoff contender.</LD>
<LD>   And they are doing so by playing strong on both sides of the ball.</LD>
<TE>   After giving up 78 points last week to San Jose, the Avengers'
defense clamped down on the Storm (1-4), holding the visitors to 260
total yards. It's the second time in two home games this season that
Los Angeles has set a club record for fewest points allowed in a
game. New York scored only 25 points against the Avengers in the
season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt embarrassed last week in San Jose, and these guys were
determined tonight to show me what they were made of," Avenger Coach
Ed Hodgkiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Avenger quarterback Tony Graziani overcame a slow start to
complete 21 of 37 passes for 227 yards. He threw five touchdown
passes, four of them to Greg Hopkins, who caught 11 passes for 127
yards.</TE>
<TE>   The other touchdown went to Kevin Ingram, who caught a 15-yard
scoring pass with 12:42 left in the fourth quarter. That broke a
17-17 tie and gave L.A. the lead for good. A sack by defensive end
Tony Plantin, who stopped Shane Stafford for a six-yard loss during
Tampa Bay's next series, and a subsequent missed 39-yard field goal
by Tampa Bay kicker Mike Black, kept the Avengers in control.</TE>

<LD>Jose Canseco claims 85% of major league baseball players are taking
steroids.</LD>
<LD>   "There would be no baseball left if they drug-tested everyone
today," he said Friday during an interview with Fox Sports Net.</LD>
<LD>   Canseco, who announced his retirement earlier in the week, refused
to say if he took steroids.</LD>
<TE>   "It's completely restructured the game as we know it," he said.
"That's why guys are hitting 50 or 60 or 75 home runs."</TE>
<TE>   During an interview with the Associated Press, Canseco would not
reveal if he used steroids, saying he would give details in the book
he is writing.</TE>

<HD>What Bibby Is Not Is Key to the Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Practice had been over for more than an hour. Reporters had come and
gone, having filled their notebooks and tape recorders with the wit
and wisdom of the Sacramento Kings. Players and coaches drifted away,
toward home or, perhaps, a late lunch.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Bibby remained behind, standing slightly to the right of the
top of the key, shooting baskets while a couple of team officials
with can-we-go-now? looks on their faces rebounded.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby didn't miss often, so the predominant sound inside the
Kings' practice facility one recent afternoon was silence. The ball
left Bibby's hands, arced toward the basket with textbook backspin
and snapped the net ever so slightly before landing in the hands of a
rebounder.</LD>
<TE>   "Mike Bibby is incredible," forward Chris Webber said, marveling
more about his teammate's overall game than this particular shooting
display. "We've barely scratched the surface with him."</TE>
<TE>   What has Bibby, in his first season with Sacramento, meant to the
Kings?</TE>
<TE>   "He's meant everything," center Vlade Divac said. "He's one of the
best point guards in the league. People say they are surprised at how
he plays in the playoffs. It's not a big surprise to me."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento faces the two-time defending NBA champion Lakers in the
Western Conference finals, which begin today at Arco Arena, and the
Kings say it's because of Bibby, a 6-foot-1 guard, that they have
advanced this far.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, 24, could prove to be the X-factor in the best-of-seven
series against the Lakers, who often failed to contain San Antonio
point guard Tony Parker during their five-game conference semifinal
victory over the Spurs. After all, Bibby has already outplayed John
Stockton of the Utah Jazz and Steve Nash of the Dallas Mavericks in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Stability," Coach Rick Adelman said when asked for Bibby's most
significant contribution to the Kings' best season since the
franchise moved from Kansas City to Sacramento before the 1985-86
season. "He makes great decisions with the ball. You know what you're
going to get from him. He's a great shooter. He goes to the basket
strong. You don't see Mike Bibby going 100 mph. He seems to slow down
and he freezes defenses."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had an exceptional team last season. They had strength
up front with Webber and Divac, and finesse with Peja Stojakovic
shooting from the wings. They also had a selfless all-purpose player
in Doug Christie.</TE>
<TE>   What they lacked was a steady guiding hand.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Williams turned heads with his eye-popping passes and
long-range shooting. He was fun to watch for fans of his
unpredictable game, but perhaps a headache to coach and play with
sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   All too often, Williams whipped the ball behind his back (and off
target) when a simple chest pass would have sufficed. The Kings won
50 games with Williams at the point, but when they meekly bowed out
of the conference semifinals, four games to none, against the Lakers,
it was time for a change.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings dealt Williams and Nick Anderson to the Memphis
Grizzlies for Bibby and Brent Price on June 27, 2001. If it wasn't
the best trade of the off-season, then it was a close second to New
Jersey's acquisition of Jason Kidd from Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "Steady as a rock," Christie said of Bibby's first season as a
King.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the trade happened during a summer of uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was prepared to leave Sacramento as a free agent, all but
punching his ticket out of town in the days after the Lakers
eliminated the Kings. Webber, occasionally seen in the company of
model Tyra Banks, longed for the brighter lights of L.A. or New York.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Kings added Bibby and retained Webber, signing
their power forward to a seven-season deal worth $123 million--the
league's second-richest contract.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Webber wasn't sure what to expect from Bibby, who is
eligible to become a free agent July 1. Webber was one of Williams'
biggest boosters and he was disappointed to see his friend leave for
Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   But now, as Webber recently noted, the transition is complete and
he has become one of Bibby's biggest boosters.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole demeanor is different," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings won the Pacific Division by three games over the Lakers
and nailed down home-court advantage throughout the playoffs with a
61-21 record largely because of Bibby's steadying influence at the
point.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting a better idea now of what Mike can do," Adelman
said. "He breaks down defenses. He makes a huge difference. He helps
everybody else out there too. Jason had the long jumper or he'd take
it all the way to the basket. Mike has the in-between game."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, the son of former NBA player and USC Coach Henry Bibby,
would only say he's starting to feel more comfortable with his new
teammates after spending three seasons with the woebegone Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he believed there was something he brought to the Kings
that they might have been missing with Williams at the point, Bibby
said flatly, "I'm not a critic." But when he was asked to assess his
play during his first playoffs, Bibby was a bit more expansive.</TE>
<TE>   "I have played better than I did in the regular season," he said.
"I've become more confident. I'm concentrating on making things
happen. I'm hitting my shots [44% overall, 48.5% on three-pointers].
I think I'm a pretty good shooter. I want to be in the middle of
things. I don't just want to be standing around and watching things."</TE>
<TE>   With averages of 21.8 points and six assists during the Kings'
conference semifinal series victory over the Mavericks--up from 18.3
points and 5.4 assists in the regular season--there would seem to be
little doubt that Bibby has indeed been an active participant in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more comfortable," said Bibby, who acknowledged feeling
jittery before the playoffs began last month. "The team has helped me
with my confidence. If I miss a shot, Chris and Peja will tell me to
keep shooting. It can't get any better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Kings have been so encouraging because Bibby has been
so willing to do what's necessary to win. For instance, in Game 4
against Dallas, Bibby drove to the basket for the tying score with
31.7 seconds remaining in regulation time. In overtime, he scored the
winner by driving the left baseline with 12.2 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' 115-113 victory gave them a 3-1 series lead. They
finished off the Mavericks in Game 5 on Monday at Arco Arena, going
where no Sacramento team has ventured: a conference final.</TE>
<TE>   Next: the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they'll do a good job of coming at him and putting
pressure on him for the whole game," Adelman said when asked about
his expectations of the Lakers' play against Bibby. "It's up to us to
find a way to make sure Mike has a chance to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's true. But it also could be said that it will be up
to Bibby to make sure the Kings have a chance to succeed against the
Lakers.</TE>

<HD>A One-Year Wonder, but a Dodger to the End</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Black never recaptured his 1952
rookie-of-the-year form, but his World Series win that year made
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Black, a one-year sensation for the Dodgers who in 1952 became
the first black pitcher to win a World Series game, died Friday of
prostate cancer. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Black, whose health had deteriorated the last few months, died at
the Life Care Center of Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   "Joe and I played together and we were very close friends," said
Tom Lasorda, Dodger senior vice president. "He was a tremendous guy
and he loved the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "He maintained that Dodger attitude until the day he was called
upon to leave. He was always a Dodger."</TE>
<TE>   Black joined the Dodgers in '52, five years after Jackie Robinson,
his Dodger teammate and roommate, had broken baseball's color
barrier. A former pitcher in the Negro leagues, Black arrived in
Brooklyn at 28 after a season in the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander excelled out of the bullpen for Manager Chuck
Dressen, finishing 15-4 with 15 saves and being selected the National
League rookie of the year for the pennant winners.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very much of a power pitcher, much the same as I was,"
said Dodger director of community relations Don Newcombe, who played
against Black during their childhood in New Jersey and joined him on
the Brooklyn roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We threw our fastball and our curveball, told them here it comes
and hit it. He always gave his best and he was a hard worker."</TE>
<TE>   Black's 2.15 earned-run average would have given him the ERA title
in '52, but he finished eight innings short of qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a guy who came to spring training and he wasn't on the
roster, so that made it all a surprise," Hall of Fame announcer Vin
Scully said. "The first time I ever saw him, and I remember
distinctly, I looked and I thought, 'My God, he's an ebony statue.'
He had a marvelous body.... It was just perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very pleasant guy. It was no problem for him to say
hello, and he had a lovely smile. Then, my God, as the year went on,
Charlie Dressen kept relying on him. He won 15, rookie of the year,
and the next thing you know, Charlie starts him in the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Black won the opener in the '52 Series against the New York
Yankees, tossing a six-hitter to beat Allie Reynolds, 4-2. He lost
the fourth game, 2-0, and the seventh, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Black's career turned after his stirring rookie season as he lost
command of his fastball and curveball while trying to add other
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   After three more seasons with the Dodgers, Black drifted to
Cincinnati and Washington and was out of baseball by 1958. He was
30-12 in six seasons--half of his wins coming in his rookie season.</TE>
<TE>   After his career ended, Black became an executive with Greyhound
in Phoenix. In addition to lobbying for black players, he remained in
baseball through his affiliation with the commissioner's office,
where he consulted with players about career choices.</TE>
<TE>   Black was a board director of the Baseball Assistance Team and
worked for the Arizona Diamondbacks in community relations after they
joined the National League in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Plainfield, N.J., Black graduated from Morgan State in
1950 and later received an honorary doctorate from Shaw University.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his son Joseph "Chico" Black and a daughter,
Martha.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete, but his son said Black would
be cremated, with a memorial service in New Jersey.</TE>

<LD>So you think gambling is illegal on the PGA Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Wanna bet?</LD>
<LD>   Although wagering during tournament play is against the rules,
betting during practice rounds is permissible under U.S. Golf Assn.
regulations, and the PGA Tour tolerates it--though it's no longer as
common as it once was.</LD>
<TE>   A popular game among pros during British Open and Masters practice
rounds is known as "Thousand-dollar no bogey," the Dallas Morning
News reports.</TE>
<TE>   If someone plays a bogey-free practice round, his playing partners
each have to pay him $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   An old game Lee Trevino used to play is called "Trees."</TE>
<TE>   Each time a player hits a tree, that player owes everyone else in
the foursome $10.</TE>
<TE>   If a ball bounces off one tree and hits another, everybody gets
$20.</TE>
<TE>   How much for off a tree, off the cart path, over the green and
under the beverage cart?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only jockey to win the Triple Crown twice?</TE>
<TE>   Freak injury update: In honor of Vince Coleman, here are a few
additions to the hallowed hall of sports mishaps, courtesy of Rick
Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   * Former San Francisco Giant Kevin Mitchell once missed part of
spring training after undergoing surgery to repair a tooth damaged by
a microwaved chocolate doughnut.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Cincinnati Red catcher Joe Oliver once required seven
stitches and missed three games after cutting his hand while emptying
the dishwasher. (However, women around the nation perked up at the
thought of a professional athlete actually emptying the dishwasher.)</TE>
<TE>   The reason all of this is pertinent in Chicago?</TE>
<TE>   "The other day, Bears' defensive lineman Bryan Robinson tripped
over his rambunctious dog, fell backward down the stairs and broke
both wrists," Morrissey writes.</TE>
<TE>   "By the way, when Robinson was lying at the bottom of those steps,
witnesses heard him murmuring something about an 'illegal chop
block.'"</TE>
<TE>   More bizarre: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News on Denver
Bronco quarterback Brian Griese falling in Terrell Davis' driveway:</TE>
<TE>   "Does this mean Michael Strahan is already claiming sack No. 1 for
the 2002 NFL season?"</TE>
<TE>   Playoff wager: You know the drill. Politicians from competing
cities make a bet on their teams' playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   If Toronto wins the NHL Eastern Conference finals over Carolina,
Raleigh Mayor Charles Meeker will don a Maple Leaf jersey for a city
council meeting and plant a maple tree outside City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   If Carolina wins, Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman will wear a Hurricane
jersey to city council--and board up his windows.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he'll plant a North Carolina oak--and be glad he didn't
lose to the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Eddie Arcaro. He won on Whirlaway in 1941 and
Citation in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Justin Leonard, quoted by the Dallas Morning News on
why gambling and golf go hand-in-hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the USGA's fault," Leonard said. "Well, I'm not saying it's
their fault, exactly. It's the handicapping."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jordan Still Sidelined by Side Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What was originally diagnosed as a lower back strain for left fielder
Brian Jordan was actually a strain of the abdominal or oblique area
on his left side, an injury suffered Monday night against the New
York Mets.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan underwent a precautionary MRI test Friday, and the results
showed no tears or major abnormalities, but he sat out his fourth
consecutive game Friday night and will likely sit out tonight's game
against the Expos, as well.</LD>
<LD>   "You miss games, you get frustrated," Jordan said. "The back is
not that bad. It's my side, and that was referring pain to my back."</LD>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said the team has not considered putting Jordan
on the 15-day disabled list, but the longer the Dodgers are short a
position player, the more likely Jordan will go on the DL.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jordan is still stiff and sore, he has been feeling a
little better every day. He was scheduled to take a few swings and
hit some off a tee Friday, and he is eager to return.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I can play with a broken arm," he said. "I'm not
saying that's smart, but the bottom line is I've got to wait on [the
medical staff]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Shawn Green is in an 0-for-15 slump, going five
games without hitting a ball out of the infield and extending his
string of at-bats without a home run to 86. He went 0 for 3 Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Though Green's average has dipped to .230 and he has more
strikeouts (39) than hits (35), Tracy said he has given no thought to
benching him for a game or two or dropping him from the third spot in
the order.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be OK, he's going to hit," Tracy said before the
game. "He's been searching, no doubt about it, but he's well
surrounded in the lineup, and we have to keep him there in order to
get him started. He's not to the point where he's so distraught he's
saying, 'Get me away from it.' It's a mechanical thing. He'll figure
it out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros took the field for batting practice in
his usual blue warmup jersey and was greeted by an entire
team--Dodger players and coaches--wearing T-shirt replicas of Karros'
No. 23 game jersey, which were given to fans Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good prank," Karros said. "I don't know who was
responsible, but someone will pay."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers wore the Karros T-shirts for the entire
batting-practice session.</TE>
<TE>   Would Gary Sheffield have taken part in such a display of
solidarity last season? "Oooh," Karros said, refusing to touch that
topic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Terry Mulholland received a cortisone shot in his back
Thursday and has made little progress in his recovery from lower-back
spasms. The left-hander will not be ready to return when he is
eligible to come off the disabled list Sunday.... Before Friday's
game, Dodger pinch-hitters had combined for a .276 average (16 for
58), the third-highest mark in the league. They ranked first in
doubles (five), second in hits and fourth in RBIs (seven).</TE>

<TE>   Update--Dodger shortstop Cesar Izturis, whose average slipped from
.270 Sunday to .253 Wednesday and did not start Thursday, was dropped
from the second to eighth spot Friday night. Tracy said it wasn't so
much a demotion as it was a chance to keep Adrian Beltre, who had
three hits in the second spot Thursday, at the top of the order.
Perez has given the Dodgers seven consecutive quality starts and has
limited opponents to a National League-low .176 average. Pavano gave
up eight runs in three innings of his only start against the Dodgers
last season, his first game back from elbow surgery.</TE>

<HD>When Reis Gets a Shot, He Stops It for Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's only natural that the more Matt Reis plays, the more at ease he
becomes in goal. And the better the results for the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   Reis, a former career back-up, will start in goal today at Kansas
City for the seventh time in eight Major League Soccer matches and is
coming off his first shutout of the year, a 1-0 Galaxy victory last
weekend at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "Absolutely you get more comfortable," said Reis, who had six
saves on a rain-slick artificial surface against the Fire. "You see
certain situations in practice and then you see certain situations in
games and the ones in the games are completely different from
practice. So the more games you get and at the higher level, the more
comfortable you feel. With more experience and playing in different
places, it all helps."</LD>
<TE>   Reis, 27, ranks third in MLS with a 0.79 goals-against-average
and, with a record of 4-0-2, he is the only goalkeeper in the league
to have played at least 150 minutes and not lost a match.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's only loss was with Kevin Hartman in goal, though
Hartman, 28, is a former league goalkeeper of the year and was the
first to have consecutive seasons (1999-2000) when he averaged less
than one goal given up a game.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't lost with [Reis] in goal and as I've said all along, I
have confidence in Matt and I have confidence in Hartman," said
Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid, who also coached both at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're blessed with two good goalkeepers. It's a little
like [Brad] Friedel and [Kasey] Keller [with the U.S. national team].
"We can win with either goalkeeper and right now it's Matt's turn."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City will be without its starting goalkeeper, Tony Meola,
who is the United States' third goalkeeper for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the Galaxy scored twice off Meola's backup, Bo
Oshoniyi, in a 2-1 overtime victory at Arrowhead Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we'll go off the last game and try to limit their
scoring opportunities," Reis said. "Our defense has done a good job
of that this year."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's defense will get a lift today with defender Ezra
Hendrickson returning to the lineup after a lengthy stay on the
sidelines because of a strained right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   But midfielder Sasha Victorine tweaked his back Thursday at
practice and may not play.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, every game is different because we always have different
personnel on the field," Schmid said. "We get Ezra back but we lose
Sasha ... so we're always changing."</TE>

<KH>GOLF ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Price Is Rolling Along at Colonial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Price, long one of the PGA Tour's best ball-strikers, putted his
way to a share of the lead in the Colonial at Fort Worth.</LD>
<LD>   Price shot a five-under-par 65 Friday in the rain-delayed second
round to share the lead at six-under 134 with Esteban Toledo, who
overcame eight bunker shots for his second 67.</LD>
<LD>   Play was suspended because of darkness with 18 players, including
defending champion Sergio Garcia, still on the course.</LD>
<TE>   Price needed only 26 putts.</TE>
<TE>   "My putting is so much better. It's more consistent," he said. "I
need to take my putting up a notch like I have the last two days.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like my all-around game now is probably as good as it's
ever been, it just lacks a bit of fire. I don't know what that fire
is, but one thing is I'm not one of the longest hitters out there
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   That's not a necessity on the historic 7,080-yard Colonial layout,
where even in the swirling gusty wind, shotmaking and putting are at
a premium.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Flesch and Bob Tway, who like Price teed off in the first
section of players after a 31/2-hour rain delay, were a shot back at
135. Flesch had a 67, and Tway shot a 68.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, after an opening 76, was 10 over with two holes to play
this morning and will miss the cut.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval had a triple bogey and two double bogeys while
shooting 43 on the back nine. He finished with a 78 for a 145 total,
two strokes above the projected cut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thorpe and John Jacobs, playoff rivals in the first senior
major of the year, shot season-best seven-under 65s to share the lead
in the Instinet Classic at Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago in Arizona, Thorpe beat Jacobs on the first extra
hole in The Tradition for his first major victory.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe, a five-time winner on the Senior PGA Tour, finished
birdie-birdie-bogey-eagle, hitting a 260-yard approach shot within
three feet on the par-five 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, the winner of the rain-shortened Royal Caribbean Classic
in February, had nine birdies after beginning the round with a double
bogey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Janice Moodie shot a six-under 66, the best round of the
tournament, and took a two-stroke lead over Laura Davies halfway
through the Asahi Ryokuken International at North Augusta, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Moodie, a fifth-year pro from Scotland who started the round three
shots behind Davies, was at eight-under 136. Davies shot a 71.</TE>
<TE>   Moodie said she has been hitting the ball well this season,
although her best finish was a tie for 12th at the Welch's/Circle K
Championships. At Mount Vintage, she says she has been making the
putts that have not fallen this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those golf courses where you're challenged mentally
the whole way around," said Moodie, whose only victory came at the
Shoprite LPGA Classic two years ago. "You really have to be in the
right place in the fairways to give yourself the opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Wie, a 12-year-old from Honolulu, missed the cut after
shooting 81-75.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Tiger Woods shot a three-under 69 and trailed
Germany's Alex Cejka by five strokes after the first round of the
Deutsche Bank SAP Open at Heidelberg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had four birdies and a bogey on the 7,255-yard, par-72 St.
Leon-Rot Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't my best, but any round in the 60s today is a job well
done," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   Cejka shot a 64 and led New Zealand's Greg Turner by one stroke.
Colin Montgomerie shot a 66.</TE>

<HD>Railbird Stakes Has Spotlight</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Perfect Drift sitting out the Preakness after finishing third in
the Kentucky Derby, jockey Eddie Delahoussaye will be a fairly busy
man at home today.</LD>
<LD>   Delahoussaye has mounts in six of the nine races at Hollywood
Park, among them Fun House in the $100,000 Railbird Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-furlong Railbird drew only five entrants and will be run
as the third, so it won't be part of the pick six.</LD>
<TE>   When the race is history, one of the 3-year-old fillies will have
her first graded stakes victory and the most likely winner is Fun
House or September Secret.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Verne Winchell's VHW Stables and trained by Ron McAnally,
Fun House has won two of five and is shortening up after finishing a
disappointing fifth in the Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Park on April
12. In her debut here last Dec. 8, the Prized filly beat maidens by
three lengths.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of Our Emblem, who sired Kentucky Derby winner War
Emblem, September Secret has won two of three for trainer Mike
Machowsky and the Lo Hi Stable. She also broke her maiden at
Hollywood Park, winning by a length in a quick 57 flat last June 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Startac, who earned his biggest win in the Grade I Secretariat
last Aug. 18 at Arlington Park, will make his first start beyond 11/4
miles when he takes on eight others in the $75,000 Jim Murray
Memorial Handicap on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Named to honor The Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist who
died in the summer of 1998, the Murray goes at 11/2 miles on the
turf. Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and trained by
Laura De Seroux, Startac was third behind Ladies Din and Thady Quill
in his first race in five months on April 24.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders include Straight Flush, who has won three of four
at 12 furlongs; the Bobby Frankel-trained Skipping; Sharbayan, who
was impressive winning an allowance at Keeneland for trainer Wally
Dollase on April 11, and recent local winner The Price Spirit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for her first win in the $361,000 Kindergarten Futurity,
which will be run for the 48th time tonight at Los Alamitos, trainer
Donna McArthur will saddle three of the 10 participants.</TE>
<TE>   Her 2-year-olds Morning Snow and Style N Grace are hardly
slouches, but most of the attention in the 300-yard race will be
focused on Lonely Moon Sign.</TE>
<TE>   A California-bred son of Royal Quick Dash, Lonely Moon Sign has
been dominant in his first two starts. He won his debut under jockey
Sam Thompson by three-quarters of a length on April 20, then became
the fastest qualifier for the Kindergarten two weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   In winning by 13/4 lengths, Lonely Moon Sign, who is owned by
Jesus and Sandra Soto, completed the 300 yards in :15.44.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about him is that he has not made any mistakes, knock
on wood," McArthur said. "I don't think they can beat him if he
continues to break like he has been."</TE>
<TE>   While McArthur is looking for her first win in the Grade I, Jaime
Gomez will attempt to become the second trainer to win the race three
years in a row. Having won with Secret Card and Sassy Smith, Gomez
will be represented by Suzy Cartel, a maiden who will break from the
rail.</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Two brothers entered a thoroughbred that had won previously in a
maiden race by giving the horse an alias, a scam that got them a
$300,000 payout when it won, federal prosecutors charged Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Emmett Winter of Williston, Fla., and his brother Kelly Winter of
Albuquerque, N.M., entered a gelding named Forty Two, which had won
previously, under the name Almost Impossible in a July 17, 1998, race
at Calder Race Course for horses that had yet to win, prosecutors
said.</LD>
<LD>   Their horse beat nine others at odds of 12-1.</LD>
<TE>   The brothers fooled Calder officials by submitting a counterfeit
foal certificate for the ringer horse, with its name and
identification number altered, said Guy Lewis, U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   They were charged with conspiring to fix races in Miami and in
Pennsylvania. They face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine
if convicted.</TE>

<LD>On the one-year anniversary of his fourth-place finish in the
Preakness, Dollar Bill, one of the most over-hyped horses to run in
recent years, will try for a rare victory in the $500,000 Hawthorne
Gold Cup in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Gary and Mary West and trained by Dallas Stewart, the
4-year-old son of Peaks And Valleys has won only one of his last
eight starts, that in a weak allowance race at the New Orleans Fair
Grounds in his first start of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Although only five others entered the 10-furlong Gold Cup, they
make for an accomplished quintet.</LD>
<TE>   Parade Leader, Hail The Chief, Chicago Six, Sir Bear and Duckhorn
have won 59 of 183 starts and have earned $4,793,538.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Victory Ride will look for her fifth win in six
starts when she faces only four rivals in the $200,000 Shuvee
Handicap at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by G. Watts and Louise Humphrey, and trained by George
Arnold, Victory Ride, a 4-year-old Seeking The Gold filly, will be
trying for her second graded stakes win in the Shuvee, which is a
Grade II. Last year, she dominated seven other 3-year-old fillies in
the Test at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Those opposing her in the one-mile race are Atelier, who was
scratched from a stakes at Pimlico on Friday, Two Item Limit, Raging
Fever, who is four for four at Belmont, and Shiny Band.</TE>
<TE>   In another graded stakes, Janet and Keemoon, who finished 1-2 in
the race last year, will meet again in the $150,000 Yerba Buena
Breeders' Cup Handicap at 13/8 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey David Flores has the mount on Janet, who won the Grade III
by three-quarters of a length last year, while Jason Lumpkins will
ride Keemoon. The field is completed by Racene, Nepenthe, and the
Gary Tanaka-owned entry of Peu a Peu and Polaire.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Hollywood Park, a turf route for
$50,000 claimers, has a full field and is one of the better betting
races of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Joshua Litt. The trainer, who will run probable
favorite Thisone'sforernie in Hollywood Park's ninth race, has won
with six of 13 starters this year.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Edgar Prado. The jockey got off to a three-for-40 start
at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: In the Preakness, keying Medaglia d'Oro in

<KH>JOE BLACK 1924-2002</KH>
<HD>Hard Thrower, Soft Heart</HD>
<DH>Appreciation: Black wasn't just a pitcher, he was a
humanist, and a great advertisement for America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER KAHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We were riding a slow train, somewhere between Mobile and Montgomery,
in the old racist South, "the Hookworm Belt," as the great sports
editor Stanley Woodward described it.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Black was a 28-year-old Dodger rookie, who would have been a
big leaguer years before, except for his color. Now he was telling me
stories about life in the Negro Leagues, using a kind of "Amos 'n'
Andy" drawl. After a while he said, "You're with a big paper. Does
the manager tell you if he's gonna keep me?"</LD>
<LD>   I was young enough and brash enough to be blunt: "You really want
to make this ballclub, don't you?"</LD>
<TE>   Black looked at me clear and straight. The drawl vanished. "If I
could express as well as Shakespeare, I still couldn't tell you how
much I want to make the Dodgers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So began a friendship that ran for 50 years and ended in the only
way it could end, with a departure. Joe Black, who died Friday of
prostate cancer, was more than the first black pitcher to win a World
Series game. He was a psychologist, a humanist, a businessman and,
across his 78 years, a magnificent advertisement for America.</TE>
<TE>   He did make the Dodgers, and in that first season, 1952, he won 15
games and saved 15 more for a club with somewhat shaky pitching. That
brought the team a pennant.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the season, a friendly case arrived in the
press box at the top of Ebbets Field. It contained one bottle of
Scotch whiskey for each sportswriter who had regularly covered the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I threw the pitches," Black wrote in a cover note, "but
the stuff you fellows wrote sure helped." You may have anticipated
the brand of Scotch Joe sent. It was Black and White.</TE>
<TE>   The great reliever started three games against the Yankees in the
World Series, posted a 2.53 earned-run average, but was beaten on
short rest in the seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   That winter we worked out together and he told me more than once
that his pitching success was really simple. "They've got people here
in Brooklyn who can think," he said. "They say throw high, I throw
high. They say throw low, I throw low." He left out this: He threw 97
mph and in his great 1952 season he could throw a ball that hard over
a match stick.</TE>
<TE>   He kept his arm loose by throwing a rubber ball. I became his
off-season catcher in a small YMCA. The experience, catching that
midwinter smoke, remains vivid as an electric shock.</TE>
<TE>   He never again matched '52 and after his career wound down in
1957, he became a schoolteacher back home in Plainfield, N.J., in an
area mixing blacks and Jews. After the youngsters studied under Joe,
they got along. One day, he brought a bedraggled school baseball team
to Yankee Stadium and Casey Stengel came out of the dugout to shake
his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Case," Joe said, "these are good kids but they've lost their last
11 games. What do you think I ought to teach them?" Stengel did not
hesitate. "Teach 'em to lose in the right spirit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Greyhound corporation offered Black 10 times his teaching
salary to become a vice president for marketing. Part of the job, to
be sure, was the high-level selling of bus tickets to African
Americans. But also--Joe made sure of this--it was articulating ideas
about blacks and whites in our society.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the things he said:</TE>
<TE>   To exalt a special language for black Americans is a kind of
bigotry. "What is our language? Fo'teen for fourteen? Pohleeze for
police? Any man, white or black, who says white people have to learn
'our' language is insulting. What he's saying is every other ethnic
group can migrate to America and master English. But we, who were
born here, and whose families have lived here for so many, many
years, don't have the ability to speak proper English. Wear a dashiki
or an African hairdo but, in the name of common sense, learn the
English language. It is your own."</TE>
<TE>   When Martin Luther King was shot, Black flew to Atlanta to help
with the services. So did Sammy Davis Jr. Afterward, Joe found
himself clearing a path for Davis through a gathering of poor Atlanta
blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "My people, my people," Davis cried, throwing out both hands in
deep emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Some," Black said, "are your people. Our people. Some will steal
the rings off your fingers. Stay close and keep your hands in your
pockets, Sam."</TE>
<TE>   Like his life, Joe Black's words spoke banners.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roger Kahn, the author of "The Boys of Summer" and other baseball
books, writes periodically for The Times.</TE>

<HD>Turkoglu Will Try to Swing It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Hedo Turkoglu, who will replace injured swingman Peja Stojakovic
today in the Kings' starting lineup, would like to point out the
significant differences between them.</LD>
<LD>   Turkoglu is Turkish; Stojakovic is Serbian.</LD>
<LD>   Turkoglu believes he's an All-Star in waiting; Stojakovic already
is one.</LD>
<TE>   Turkoglu says he's content to play defense and rebound; Stojakovic
is a scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic will be sidelined because of a sprained right ankle for
at least the first two games of the Kings' first Western Conference
finals appearance since 1981, when the franchise was located in
Kansas City. Turkoglu said he is confident he can fill the void.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough, though, because I am replacing one of our leading
players," Turkoglu said. "We are different players. I try always to
be an all-around player, helping in scoring, rebounding and
defending. Peja is a really good scorer."</TE>
<TE>   Until today, Turkoglu's most significant game was with Turkey in
the European championships last summer. He helped the Turks defeat
Germany and Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 23, 11 and eight in the semifinals against Dirk," he said
with a smile, referring to his points, rebounds and assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings don't expect that sort of production from Turkoglu
today. They simply need Turkoglu to play to his strengths. Coach Rick
Adelman has been planning to play this series without Stojakovic, so
the role of swingman is Turkoglu's for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going on the assumption that we won't have Peja back,"
Adelman said. "If and when he's back, it will be big boost for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento center Vlade Divac began his NBA career with the Lakers
and it clearly pained him the last few days to answer repeated
questions about the pre-series trash talking between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect that organization a lot," he said Thursday. "All good
things happened to me there. I had the start to my career with that
team."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the King-Laker rivalry, he said Friday, "Obviously,
there is a rivalry there. You have two teams from California, one
from the north and one from the south. You have to have a rival. You
can't just be alone. For us, to go to the championship, we have to go
through them.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is their rival? We have the best record in the regular
season. I don't really care, though. I look at them as a team we have
to beat."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Mike Bibby said he has watched a good deal of
videotape of Derek Fisher, his Laker counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what he likes to do, his tendencies at both ends of the
court," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   What Bibby wouldn't say is what, in particular, he believes he can
exploit in Fisher's game.</TE>
<TE>   "Not for the cameras," he said with a wry smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxious," he added. "I'm ready to go. Other than that, that's
the only feeling I have right now. I think everybody's still relaxed
at this point."</TE>

<HD>It Doesn't Get Easier for Horry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Horry will be making a defensive switch from league MVP Tim
Duncan to Sacramento MVP Chris Webber.</LD>
<LD>   There are, Horry said, only shades of differences between the two.</LD>
<LD>   "They're basically the same player," he said. "They do the same
thing. They both shoot the [mid-range] jumper, they both face up in
the post."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of Peja Stojakovic, the Lakers expect to see a lot
of Hedo Turkoglu, less experienced than the elder Stojakovic but
similarly skilled.</TE>
<TE>   Turkoglu's jump shot and floor sense helped the Kings finish off
the Dallas Mavericks in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox's greatest postseason contribution to the Lakers last
season was his defense on the clever Stojakovic in the second round.
Although he hardly seemed relieved at getting Turkoglu instead, Fox
smiled and said, "Fresh meat. New challenge."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "They are similar players in the sense that they're very effective
as small forwards in this league," Fox said. "Turkoglu might be a
slightly better rebounder. Maybe more of a finisher at the basket.
So, same approach, same principle. It's my job to control that
position on the floor defensively, and help out in other areas,
regardless of who's there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant sent the sneakers he wore in Tuesday night's victory
over the Spurs to Steve Tyson, whom Bryant met over dinner in San
Antonio on Saturday. Bryant signed them first. Tyson's father, Steve,
said his son, stricken with cystic fibrosis, could hardly wait to get
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blessing to be put in a position where you can have such
an impact on someone," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the Kings engulf Shaquille O'Neal with their sagging,
zone-like defense, and assuming Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard can fall
down enough to get the attention of the officials, Bryant's scoring
and playmaking should go a long way to deciding the series.</TE>
<TE>   He carried much of the offense in the last series, particularly in
the third and fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends upon what his shooting's like," Coach Phil Jackson
said. "If he shoots well from the outside, yes, he's going to have
successful games against them. But it's not necessary as much as it
is necessary for him to penetrate and find his teammates, for them to
get the shots he can provide them. He can provide shots for his
teammates. He doesn't have to do the scoring."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher sat for much of the fourth quarter of Game 5,
primarily because his jump shot was not falling, so Jackson went to
the quicker Lindsey Hunter on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said while Fisher's misses--he was one for nine from the
arc, five for 19 overall in the final two games against San
Antonio--concerned him, he pointed out that other Lakers missed a lot
of open jump shots in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We need everybody to shoot the ball well," he said.</TE>

<LD>   It is a quaint place with a sporty basketball team, one good
enough to have won 61 regular-season games and to draw national
attention to a series many had expected since September.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, twice-defending NBA champions, will play beneath a
banner at Arco Arena this afternoon that proclaims the Sacramento
Kings this year's Pacific Division winner. It is a presumptive
curtain, given that two of the remaining four teams in the playoffs
are the Boston Celtics and the Lakers, for whom dozens of banners
stand for astonishingly more.</LD>
<TE>   But the once run-down Kings have taken long, large steps to get
here, to a series that will determine which team plays for the NBA
title. They were eliminated two years ago by the Lakers in the first
round, and last year by the Lakers in the second. They have
home-court advantage and an underdog's fight, no matter the
regular-season records, whereas the Lakers have a sense of
entitlement that lately has made their foes wilt and fourth-quarter
shots fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rivalry for them," Laker guard Kobe Bryant said. "It's a
huge challenge for them. I'm sure they're looking forward to it, and
we're looking forward to it too."</TE>
<TE>   Unspoken is that the Lakers don't yet recognize the rivalry,
because they don't yet recognize the Kings, not at this level. The
Kings are in the conference finals for the first time in more than
two decades, since they wore Carolina blue and played in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the Lakers don't see the changes in the Kings.
They swept the Kings in four games last year, when Chris Webber, the
Kings' skilled power forward, was rarely a factor. He seems more
confident. The Kings have traded up in point guards, from the
unpredictable Jason Williams to the collected Mike Bibby, whose game
not only translates to closely played postseason games, it
flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   And then, Vlade Divac, their center, predicted doom for the Lakers
if they were without home-court advantage against the Kings, which
they are.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to do the same thing last year," Laker forward Robert
Horry said of the Lakers' sweep of San Antonio. "In the Western
Conference final, we had to go in there against the top team in the
league and get a win. So, hopefully, that experience from last year
will carry us."</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings feel overlooked, possibly it's because, for going on
three years, they have been. If they believe the Lakers are arrogant
champions, it's because they are. And although the players spent the
week poking at each other's frailties, none of the talk would seem to
mean much today, when hundreds of people will clang cow bells and the
rest will try to watch basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban was so enamored of the bells in
the last round that he bought them for everyone, and it didn't
translate into a single home victory for his team.</TE>
<TE>   The fans can rattle their hearts out, and the series still boils
down to the Lakers, and whether the Kings have caught them, just as
the Lakers once caught the Celtics, as the Detroit Pistons once
caught the Lakers, as the Chicago Bulls once caught the Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are improved. The Lakers, for a variety of reasons, have
not been as dominant. Shaquille O'Neal, their powerful center, played
the season with an arthritic toe and the playoffs with a sprained
ankle or two and a stitched shooting finger.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis is how you learn to defend against teams that are
sitting in front of you," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said, "so, your
players can match them psychologically, and emotionally and
physically. That becomes the problem you're trying to face.
Offensively, you're always trying to find a trigger point or an
escape point or a release valve or something that will open up so you
have more than just one or two guys that are contributing."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are deeper from three to 12 on their roster. The Lakers
are deeper from one to two. Often enough, that has been plenty for
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq presents a problem that nobody else has," Jackson said.
"Vlade is a great center. He has a lot of skills, all-purpose skills.
The mentality is, can he stand up to Shaq? [Portland's Arvydas]
Sabonis gave an effort a couple years ago in the playoffs. He
prevented Shaq from going where he wanted to go on the floor. I think
that's one of the keys. How can you defend him? Can you defend him
with a team? Can you defend him with more than one guy?</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way you have to do it, I guess. You have to figure out
what's going to take the team ahead of you down."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, with O'Neal a bit down, particularly against San Antonio,
the Lakers have turned to Bryant, who has carried the scorer's
burden.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a burden," Jackson corrected. "It's not a
responsibility. Some of it's an honor because you get to take the
shots. Some of it is a license. I think that's where we have to step
into a different realm against Sacramento to be able to survive in
this series. That is to find other people that can score for us,
because we know this is a team that is going to key on Kobe and Shaq
and we have to have two or three other players who step up game by
game."</TE>
<TE>   Then it could be a rivalry. And then the Kings could get
themselves a real banner.</TE>

<LD>STARTERS</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't talk much about them, but Shaquille O'Neal appears to
be gaining on all of his injured parts. He removed the stitches from
his finger this week, which meant he was feeling much better or was
very bored. Either way, the Lakers expect O'Neal's turn-around
jumpers to start falling soon. The headline matchups among starters
are Vlade Divac and/or Scot Pollard against O'Neal, Doug Christie
against Kobe Bryant, and the Laker power forward of the day--Robert
Horry, probably--against Chris Webber. The Kings give up too much in
two of the three, and Webber, who is reticent on the inside to start
with, is intimidated by O'Neal. In last year's conference semifinals,
Webber often opted for jump shots rather than test O'Neal or Horace
Grant near the rim. The Kings will be without small forward Peja
Stojakovic, who has a sprained ankle, for at least a game or two. He
averaged 18.3 points in three regular-season games against the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Edge: Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   BENCH</TE>
<TE>   Because of Stojakovic's injury, the Kings have the option to start
Hedo Turkoglu at small forward or Bobby Jackson at shooting guard,
moving Christie to small forward. King Coach Rick Adelman tried both
against the Dallas Mavericks. While the Lakers are vulnerable to
quick backcourts, a fact that would tempt Adelman to try Jackson, the
Lakers are too big and physical. So Adelman loses Turkoglu, who
averaged 11.3 points in short minutes against the Lakers, from his
bench for the short term. That leaves Jackson, Pollard, Gerald
Wallace and Lawrence Funderburke. Jackson could become Lindsey
Hunter's defensive assignment, just as Tony Parker was late in the
last series, particularly if Derek Fisher's three-pointers aren't
falling. The Laker bench got a little deeper in the final two games
of the San Antonio series, when Hunter made a big three-pointer late
in Game 5 and stayed with Parker. Against the Spurs, Samaki Walker
scored on put-backs and from the elbows, played gamely on defense and
took a few rebounds. Brian Shaw has made five of 12 three-pointers,
but Devean George has missed 12 of 14. If George regained his
midseason proficiency--both in shooting and decision-making--the
Lakers would be better here. Otherwise, Jackson is the best bench
player in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Kings.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSE</TE>
<TE>   What we know from the Kings' last series, against the Mavericks:
The Kings score at will against no defense. What we know from the
Kings' first-round series, against the Utah Jazz, which had some
defensive conscience: They can be defended. Before they averaged
110.2 points against the Mavericks, the Kings didn't score more than
91 in four games against the Jazz. Still, after running and scoring
and having a good old time for 11 days in the conference semifinals,
the Kings are in an offensive rhythm, even without Stojakovic, their
No. 2 scorer in the regular season. The Kings averaged nearly 105
points in the regular season and will try to push the tempo against
the Lakers, who prefer to run the offense through O'Neal. The Lakers
have the best one-two scorers in the league in O'Neal and Bryant, but
O'Neal isn't entirely sound and Bryant had to do a lot on his own
against the Spurs. The Kings can get a little from a lot of places,
and Webber might have something to prove after appearing to pout
through parts of last year's series. After scoring 13.7 points a game
in the regular season, Mike Bibby has averaged 18.3 points in nine
playoff games. He has made 16 of 33 three-pointers. And, despite all
of the new offense, even his assists are up.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Kings.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Come playoff time, the Lakers not only believe in defense, they're
sure it is the reason they've won consecutive NBA titles. O'Neal
became more active as the San Antonio series went on, even defending
Tim Duncan straight-up and with reasonable success late in games.
When O'Neal is moving and blocking shots and threatening harm, the
Lakers defend the perimeter and Bryant is freed to patrol the passing
lanes and help from the weak side. One of the themes of last year's
four-game sweep of the Kings was Rick Fox's defense on Stojakovic and
the Lakers' team effort on Webber. The Kings are on the long list of
teams that cannot stop O'Neal or Bryant. They try to defend O'Neal
with the finesse of Divac and Pollard, both of whom fall down a lot
to get the attention of the referees. The strategy is occasionally
effective and annoys O'Neal. Christie, rangy and fast, tries hard but
cannot stay with Bryant, who has already run through Ruben Patterson
and Bruce Bowen with relative ease in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Adelman doesn't seem to approve of Phil Jackson. When the
late-season conversations were about the Pacific Division race, and
whether a March game in Sacramento was important to it, Adelman said
it wasn't. Jackson said it was. Adelman took it personally. "Really,
well," he said when told of the differing opinion. "He obviously
knows a lot more than everybody else, me included. I think Phil's
just talking. But what amazes me is people keep listening and taking
him seriously." Something about the 10 championship rings, eight of
them as a coach, apparently. For all of the under-coaching in the
regular season, Jackson has the Lakers' attention in the postseason.
They play his defense and try to run his offense. Adelman deserves a
lot of credit for taking the Kings to the division title, and for
creating a strong chemistry after Webber nearly left for free agency
after last season. His players clearly trust him.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   KEY TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are without home-court advantage and the Kings believe
in the momentum that started in the regular season, but the Lakers
blink wearily and feel as if they've done this a thousand times. The
Lakers won twice in Sacramento in last year's playoffs and once
during the regular season. They are resilient and tough, strengthened
by their belief in Jackson. They've seen their teammates do critical
things at the most critical times, both early in series and closing
them out. When all fails, the Lakers have two offensive options in
O'Neal and Bryant. The series will turn, eventually, on the
experience gained in the past 21/2 postseasons, the last two
concluding in Laker championships.</TE>

<LD>So Diane Pucin thinks it would be "a great thing for the NBA" if the
Kings beat the Lakers in the Western Conference finals [May 16].
Well, I think it would be a great thing for Laker fans who subscribe
to this Los Angeles newspaper if Ms. Pucin stuck to penning nice
little stories about tennis or hockey, and left writing inane
articles about the NBA to the master of that trade, Mark Heisler.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel E. Hartman</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I enjoyed reading Diane Pucin's article as much as I enjoy
watching the Sacramento Kings. I just love watching Vlade Divac flop
to the floor and cry like a baby. I think "Vlade" literally
translates to "he who falls down and cries."</TE>
<TE>   For her to say that the Lakers need to take the Kings seriously is
understandable, but we've beaten them five out of the last six games
on their home floor. We own them. And, sorry Diane, but Sacramento is
not in the class of the Lakers. They will play us and they will lose.
Period.</TE>
<TE>   And why do ratings numbers matter more to Diane than team loyalty?
Wow, the Sacramento-Dallas series was watched by 30% more people than
any other series? Who cares? Hey, Diane, four out of five dentists
recommend sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Reyes</TE>
<TE>   Arleta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to accept Sacramento being in the same class as the
Lakers--all I need to do is look up and count the NBA championship
banners on the rafters of Staples Center and ask, how many do the
Kings have? Sorry, Ms. Pucin, but you can learn a thing or two from
Mr. Adande when it comes to basketball and basketball history.</TE>
<TE>   Lina Roth</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anyone think that the Spurs would do much better as a franchise by
donning skates and sticks and morphing into an NHL team? What better
team than San Antonio can play competitively for only three periods?</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn L. Davis</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' fourth-quarter collapses against the Lakers reminded me
of Phil Mickelson when Tiger Woods is nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Emerson</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I just finished reading Bob Huggins' comments about Phil Jackson's
coaching ability [May 15]. What has Huggins done to make anyone think
he is an expert? Let's see, what round did his No.1-seeded team get
knocked out of the NCAA tournament this year?</TE>
<TE>   Huggins apparently has the same problem of no brains that the
voters for NBA coach of the year have. How soon they forget that Del
Harris had Shaq and Kobe and couldn't get them to the NBA Finals, let
alone a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Osborn</TE>
<TE>   Rowland Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To all those out there who claim that Phil Jackson won his eight
NBA championships not because he was a great coach, but because he
was blessed with great players, two questions:</TE>
<TE>   1. Has there ever been a coach anywhere who has won without having
talented players?</TE>
<TE>   How many titles did Jordan or Shaq or Pippen (or young Kobe, for
that matter) win before being coached by Jackson? Answer: zero.</TE>
<TE>   David Macaray</TE>
<TE>   Rowland Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Kobe was great against the Spurs, but Shaq deserves major
props. Despite injuries that surely would sideline any player during
the regular season, Shaq is sucking it up and delivering a strong
message to the Lakers and all of their fans. That message is, "We
will not lose when we give all we have."</TE>
<TE>   You can see the grimace on his face when he has to extend and use
an injured ankle, finger or toe. I don't think I've ever been more
proud of Shaq than I am now. He's an amazing guy and an unbelievable
athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Shechtman</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Humanity Hall of Fame should take notice of the kind of man
Kobe Bryant is becoming, as evidenced by his kindness to Steve Tyson
[May 15]. Neither Kobe nor his PR people boasted of his actions, for
it was the senior Tyson who shared with all of us the experience
between his son and Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   A hall-of-fame act by a future member of the Hall of Fame
(Humanity and Basketball).</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Miramontes</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It must be playoff time. Kobe is taking charge in the fourth
quarter, Shaq is making his free throws, and Allen Iverson and Larry
Brown are acting like 5-year-olds. All is right with the world.</TE>

<LD>The Times today [May 15] referred to the best team in baseball over
the last 17 games as the "rampaging Angels." And rampaging is exactly
what many exhilarated and dedicated fans of the club do as they are
forced to gather around crackling transistor radios in order to catch
the Angel road games.</LD>
<LD>   How does a team build a strong fan base when it goes into virtual
exile every time it leaves town? Every successful major league
franchise televises away games. It is not a coincidence that these
same teams have enough loyal fans who populate the home ballpark upon
their team's return to outnumber cheering fans of the opponent.</LD>

<LD>No, no, not again. Isn't it enough that for over two decades pro
football fans in Los Angeles had to endure two of the most
self-serving, devious owners in sports? And now history is about to
repeat itself.</LD>
<LD>   Sweet Georgia was a latter-day Lucretia Borgia who poisoned the
hearts, souls and minds of Ram fans with her greed and ineptness. Her
departure to Anaheim was most welcome, but it hastened the arrival of
the next brigand from Oakland and his band of Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   Snake Oil Al Davis was the original "Crown Prince of Paranoia" and
when he was not burdening the courts with legal shenanigans, he was
up in the press box calling the plays from a 1960 Sid Gillman
playbook. His return to Oakland raised the IQ level of both cities.</LD>
<TE>   Now what? The Spanos boys (Frank and Jessie) are setting their
sights on the City of Angels. I'm not exactly the president of T.J.'s
fan club, but he's sure got these two guys pegged right.</TE>
<TE>   They say you can tell something about a man's character by playing
a round of golf with him. I guess the folks who run the AT&amp;T
tournament at Pebble Beach figured this out a while back. It seems
that young Spanos, who won the pro-am division of the tournament with

<TE>   Please stop wasting space on the prospects of an NFL team in L.A.
I, for one, do not miss the hype and antics associated with the NFL,
and what the Rams and Raiders put on the field during their last few
years here could hardly be called professional.</TE>

<TE>   The NFL-in-L.A. project depresses me. Our officials and the
richest men in the U.S. expend way too much money, time and energy on
a game but spend no time at all thinking about solving real problems,
such as affordable housing, education for kids and homelessness. How
about some perspective on life?</TE>
<TE>   But maybe building a stadium would be a good thing. Because this
$400-million structure with 64,000 seats would be used less than 9%
of the time (32 days out of 365 days a year), it can also serve as a
resting place for L.A.'s tens of thousands of homeless people on the
333 vacant days. Maybe they can clean up the stadium aisles after the
games in exchange for food and a place to sleep. The project can
combine games with human good.</TE>

<LD>Ah, the first of many poorly contrived jokes prior to the World Cup
has appeared [May 1], referring to the excitement of a 0-0 tie,
considered wrongly by the author to be somewhat frequent and/or
boring.</LD>
<LD>   Is it not possible this year (especially noting The Times' fearful
aversion to potential multicultural insensitivity) to avoid these
jokes and the pathetic debates regarding these slights? Most proper
football fans are aware of the World Cup's superiority to the Super
Bowl's self-proclaimed "most watched game in the world" (especially
the last two) and major league baseball, and hopefully won't need to
respond, therefore avoiding the whole pathetic but inevitable waste
of sportswriting talent.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, if you didn't bother reporting the World Cup at all, it
might be just as well, as the ghettoized coverage is embarrassing as
it is, and most fans simply use the Internet for adequate
information. This might be a distinct possibility once the United
States is eliminated in the first round, and I think most of us would
simply rather avoid the whole thing.</LD>

time to trade Chad Kreuter and his .125 batting average to the

<HD>Nady Has Turned Up the Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The formidable heart of a California League batting order is about to
become a little less fearsome.</LD>
<LD>   Lake Elsinore's designated hitter, Xavier Nady, a top prospect for
the San Diego Padres who hits cleanup for their Class-A affiliate,
should be promoted to triple-A Portland within the next two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The move has been anticipated. Nady was the California League's
most valuable player and the Padres' minor league player of the year
last season after hitting .302 with 26 home runs and 100 runs batted
in. The 23-year-old slugger would have been promoted already had he
not required off-season Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm, which
has limited the left fielder to the role of designated hitter this
season.</LD>
<TE>   But remaining with Lake Elsinore has had its benefits. Nady has
added significant pop to a lineup that also includes promising
prospects Taggert Bozied and Jake Gautreau, who bat third and fifth.
All three players were college All-Americans, and all three are
expected to play in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if they'll arrive at the same time, but there's a
very good chance they could either be in our infield or outfield
soon," San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said. "All three guys,
we're looking at being major contributors when we move into our new
ballpark in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   The trio has carried an otherwise anemic offense. The team batting
average through Thursday was .240, second worst in the league.
Bozied, a first baseman who was selected in the third round of last
year's amateur draft, was hitting .320 with eight home runs and 31
RBIs heading into the weekend series. Gautreau, a second baseman
drafted last year in the first round, was hitting .313 and had put
together a 19-game hitting streak. And Nady, a 2000 second-round
pick, was hitting .279 and was second in the league with 12 home runs
and fifth in the league with 32 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Continued success will be crucial to the long-term prosperity of
the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a small-market team, we're going to live and die by the
players we draft and develop," Towers said. "We need to have good
drafts and develop players to stay competitive."</TE>
<TE>   The rising stars have grown close in their short time together at
Lake Elsinore. Bozied has known Nady since they played for Team USA
while they were still in college; Gautreau and Nady played together
on Team USA the following year.</TE>
<TE>   In other California League news:</TE>
<TE>   * Lancaster Manager Steve Scarsone, who played with the Angels
during spring training in 1998, has taken a leave of absence for
"personal matters not involving baseball" for the rest of the season,
according to a release issued Thursday by the club. Former Seattle
Mariner manager Bill Plummer has assumed Scarsone's duties.</TE>
<TE>   * With his 13-game hitting streak on the line, High Desert left
fielder Pete Zoccolillo stepped to the plate in the ninth inning
Tuesday and slammed a three-run homer, giving the Mavericks an 8-7
victory over Lake Elsinore. Zoccolillo was second in the league with
a .368 average through Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * San Jose right-handers Boof Bonser and R.D. Spiehs combined to
pitch the league's first no-hitter in three years May 5 in a 9-1
victory over Rancho Cucamonga. Bonser pitched the first six innings,
Spiehs the final three. Bonser surrendered a run in the first inning
after walking the leadoff batter, who later scored on a fielder's
choice.</TE>
<TE>   * High Desert third baseman Daryl Clark became the third player
this season to tie the league record of three home runs in a game
when he hit two solo home runs and a grand slam May 6 in a 13-6
victory over Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   Angels' System</TE>
<TE>   Hatuey Mendoza, a Dominican right-hander for double-A Arkansas,
became the first Angel minor leaguer to throw a no-hitter in nearly
five years Monday in a 3-0 victory over Texas League rival Tulsa.
Mendoza, 23, retired the final 24 batters after issuing a leadoff
walk in the second inning. Tulsa's only other baserunner was hit by a
pitch in the first inning. It was only the second start of the season
for Mendoza, who had pitched out of the bullpen until left-hander
Tony Milo was sidelined because of soreness in his pitching elbow.
Mendoza is 1-1 with a 2.33 earned-run average and 10 strikeouts in
191/3 innings. The last Angel minor leaguer to throw a no-hitter was
Ramon Ortiz, who shut down Quad City for Cedar Rapids on Aug. 7,
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake right-hander Mickey Callaway could tie the triple-A
franchise record of eight consecutive wins today when the Stingers
play in Callaway's hometown of Memphis. Callaway, who turned 27
Monday, leads the Pacific Coast League with seven victories and is
second in the league with a 1.47 ERA. Teammate Robb Quinlan, an
outfielder, tied the franchise record Sunday with eight RBIs in a
game against Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers' System</TE>
<TE>   Even though he was hitting .352 with 11 home runs and 41 RBIs in
32 games for triple-A Las Vegas, catcher Todd Greene was released
Wednesday by the Dodgers, who didn't have much choice. They had to
either promote him by May 15 or allow him to exercise a contract
clause that permitted him to become a free agent. The Dodgers
couldn't promote him because there was no room on their roster, so
Greene decided to pursue his career with another team. He signed with
Texas on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Pilkington, the Dodgers' top pick in last year's draft, has
gotten off to a solid start this season with Class-A South Georgia.
Pilkington, taken in the second round with the 68th selection overall
from Garden Grove Santiago High, is 3-1 with a 4.23 ERA and 31
strikeouts in 381/3 innings. Perhaps even more impressive, he has
issued only five walks.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Nation</TE>
<TE>   Since getting shelled for eight hits and nine runs in his first
start of the season, right-hander Kirk Saarloos, from double-A Round
Rock, has been nothing less than masterful. The former Cal State
Fullerton star has gone 5-0 with an 0.63 ERA since his rocky debut,
working seven scoreless innings Wednesday in a 1-0, 11-inning loss to
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Former USC right-hander Mark Prior, who last week made a stellar
debut with triple-A Iowa, has not fared as well since. Friday, Prior
lost to New Orleans, 5-1, giving up six hits and five runs--three
earned--in four innings. He struck out four and walked two. In his
second start, last Sunday, he gave up four hits, four walks and four
runs--all unearned--while striking out 10 in 42/3 innings.
Nonetheless, 43.8% of respondents to a poll on the team's Web site
said the Chicago Cubs should immediately promote him.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Paul Pierce proclaimed the Nets can't stop him, a boast even New
Jersey admits might be true.</LD>
<LD>   His Celtic co-star, Antoine Walker, has feuded with New Jersey
Coach Byron Scott, whose distaste for Boston dates to his playing
days.</LD>
<LD>   The Eastern Conference finals might not have the glamour and star
power of its all-California counterpart in the West. But there is a
history between the teams, along with some running of the mouths,
that could help make it almost as interesting as the King-Laker
matchup billed by some as the true NBA championship series.</LD>
<TE>   "They had a great season like us. They had a big turnaround, too,"
Scott said. "They've done a fantastic job to get to this point. It's
going to be a war."</TE>
<TE>   No team has had a bigger about-face than the Nets, who
flip-flopped last season's 26-52 record and went 52-26 this season to
earn the No. 1 seeding in the East.</TE>
<TE>   About the only team whose turnaround compares is Boston, which
also missed the playoffs last season while enduring Rick Pitino's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who wins this series, which begins Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
PDT, it will mark the first time since 1978 that a team that failed
to qualify for the postseason the previous year will make it to the
NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, the league's third-leading scorer, believes he's the main
reason the Celtics will eliminate the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they have anybody that can really defend me,"
Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce averaged 37 points in four games against New Jersey this
season, with Boston winning three of them.</TE>
<TE>   Scott walked onto the court during a fracas in a Net-Celtic game
earlier this season and was yelled at by Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Said Scott, whose personal history against the Celtics includes
the Larry Bird-Magic Johnson era, when he was a member of the Lakers:
"That green and white still doesn't sit that well with me."</TE>

tournament for the first time since she turned pro in October 1994.</LD>
<LD>   "I am obviously very disappointed that I will be unable to play in
Paris," Hingis said Friday. "However, I am hopeful that the surgery
on Monday will go well and that I can look forward to a speedy
recovery."</LD>

<HD>Milestone Night for Piazza, Mets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Piazza hit a grand slam to surpass 1,000 runs batted in, and
Edgardo Alfonzo started a triple play as the New York Mets routed the
bumbling San Diego Padres, 13-4, Friday night at San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza's 13th career slam, and first since July 18, 2000,
highlighted an eight-run seventh inning and sent the Mets to their
highest total this year. It was New York's fourth consecutive victory
since dropping eight of nine.</LD>
<LD>   The Padres, who led the majors in errors each of the last two
seasons, committed a season-high five, three by shortstop Deivi Cruz.</LD>
<TE>   New York led the majors with 43 errors coming in, but looked sharp
in turning the triple play, from third baseman Alfonzo to second
baseman Roberto Alomar to first baseman Mo Vaughn in the bottom of
the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonzo also had three hits.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and second in the bottom of the fifth, Wiki
Gonzalez hit a sharp grounder to Alfonzo, who took two steps to the
bag to force Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonzo threw to Alomar to force Sean Burroughs, and Alomar
completed the triple play by throwing to Vaughn. Gonzalez didn't
appear to be running full speed until about two-thirds of the way to
first, when he suddenly picked up the pace, but it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   It was the ninth triple play in Met history, and the first since
Aug. 5, 1998, against San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 9, Florida 3--Former Dodger Tom Goodwin hit a
pinch-hit tiebreaking two-run single in the seventh inning and
Tsuyoshi Shinjo had a grand slam in the eighth as the Giants won at
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   With two out and the bases loaded in the eighth, Braden Looper
walked Reggie Sanders, putting the Giants ahead 5-2, and Shinjo
followed with his first major league slam.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Colorado 2--Tom Glavine pitched into the seventh inning
and hit an RBI single, and Wes Helms homered to lead the Braves to a
victory at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (6-2) gave up two runs--one earned--and six hits in 62/3
innings for his 230th victory, moving past Luis Tiant and Sam Jones
for 53rd on the career list. Charlie Buffington is next with 231
victories.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Cincinnati 1--Darryl Kile gave up two hits in seven
innings as the Cardinals extended their winning streak to five by
defeating the Reds at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vina's sacrifice fly off Scott Sullivan (3-1) broke a
seventh-inning tie for the Cardinals, who ended Cincinnati's
four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Chicago 2--Glendon Rusch pitched seven strong
innings, and rookie Alex Sanchez hit a bases-loaded triple at
Milwaukee in the Brewer victory.</TE>
<TE>   Rusch (3-3) gave up two runs and six hits and improved to 5-1
lifetime against the Cubs. He also defeated Chicago at Wrigley Field
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Pittsburgh 4--Jeff Bagwell hit a three-run homer at
Houston, and the Astros extended their winning streak to a
season-high six games.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 4-2 in the sixth, Bagwell connected off Ron Villone (2-5)
for his ninth home run of the season.</TE>

<HD>There Is Nothing Cold About Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They win eighth consecutive game by beating the
White Sox, 8-4, in chilly Chicago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The shortstop looked as if he had lost a fight in an alley. The
center fielder dodged a beer shower tossed at him from behind the
outfield fence. The first baseman shoved a fan out of his way to
catch a foul ball. And the guys sitting in the bullpen warded off the
bitter cold by wearing black parkas borrowed from the home team.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing routine about this game for the Angels--except, that is,
for the victory. On a night better spent inside, with the fireplace
crackling and a hot chocolate in hand, the Angels extended their
winning streak to eight games with an 8-4 victory Friday over the
Chicago White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' eight-game winning streak is their second of the
season, a feat unprecedented in club history. Their 23-16 start
matches the best in team history, particularly satisfying for a team
whose 6-14 start was the worst.</LD>
<TE>   With a temperature of 42 degrees at game time--and a wind-chill
factor of 34--the Angels leaned upon locals who grew up playing in
cold, rain and even snow. First baseman Scott Spiezio, from nearby
Joliet, homered and drove in three runs. Relievers Lou Pote and Al
Levine, each from the greater Chicago area, combined for four hitless
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicago is their kind of town," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.
He couldn't resist saying it, to a chorus of groans, but laughter
comes easily when your team has lost twice in the last 24 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got in-laws in Chicago," starter Scott Schoeneweis said.
"Does that count?"</TE>
<TE>   Sure, why not? Schoeneweis, who grew up in the cold of New Jersey,
staggered through five innings, giving up four runs and nine hits but
earning the victory by stranding runners at third base with one out
in the fourth and fifth innings.</TE>
<TE>   And center fielder Darin Erstad, who grew up coldest of all in
North Dakota, scored twice and had three hits, raising his average to
.299. He missed eight days because of a concussion, went hitless in
his first game back and is hitting .379 in the 15 games since then.</TE>
<TE>   Although Erstad still hurls his body around the field with
reckless abandon, team executives will be pleased to know he does not
endorse concussions as a means of breaking out of a slump.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't do that again," he said. "It wasn't very fun."</TE>
<TE>   Neither was what happened to shortstop David Eckstein. In the
first inning, a foul ball caromed up from his bat, slammed directly
into his face and then proceeded to crack his batting helmet.
Television replays showed blood trickling from his face, but Eckstein
said he was so cold he didn't feel a thing, even as he walked back to
the dugout to get a new helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know I got hit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my helmet in my hand, I was looking at the helmet, and I
saw blood dripping down."</TE>
<TE>   He was worried for a few moments that his right eye might shut,
but Angel athletic trainer Ned Bergert treated him--"like a cut man
in the corner," Scioscia said--and Eckstein returned. The eye was
swollen and discolored, and a bandage covered a cut on his nose.</TE>
<TE>   His only hit, a bunt single, ignited a fifth-inning rally in which
the Angels scored three times to take the lead for good. Chicago
starter Jon Garland forced home two of the runs by walking Brad
Fullmer and Tim Salmon with the bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox ought to schedule the Angels more often, since
friends and relatives of the visiting players accounted for sizable
chunks of the announced crowd of 12,736.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most annoying fans was the one in the outfield
bleachers who tossed a beer at Erstad as he ran to field a double.
Erstad made the play; the fan missed on the throw.</TE>
<TE>   The most puzzling fan was the one Spiezio pushed aside to catch a
ball that would otherwise have landed in the first couple rows of the
stands. And what did Spiezio notice about the guy trying to interfere
with the catch?</TE>
<TE>   "It was a guy with an Angel hat on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bandwagons are weird places to be, apparently.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Get a Win They Can Clutch</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy has been patient, but he had to be wondering
if that big hit, the one with two out and runners on base to break
open a close game, the one that would create some breathing room for
a team that has been gasping for runs, would ever come.</LD>
<LD>   It finally arrived Friday night. And it brought a few friends.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Karros sparked an 8-5 victory over the Montreal Expos, ending
a string of 96 at-bats without a home run with a two-out, two-run
blast to give the Dodgers a lead in the fifth inning. The Dodgers
then staged a two-out, four-run rally in the sixth before 48,146 in
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   It was the most runs the Dodgers had scored since a 10-0 victory
in Chicago on April 26, and the four-run sixth was their biggest
inning since a six-run sixth against the Cubs that day.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who were batting .224 with runners in scoring
position and two out before the game, scored another run on a two-out
hit, Marquis Grissom's solo homer in the fourth, giving them seven
two-out runs. Karros' homer was the team's first with a runner on
base since April 28.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, those two-out hits with a guy on second are like three-run
home runs," Grissom said. "They're big clutch hits that lift your
team and cause the momentum of the game to change."</TE>
<TE>   They were all but absent from the Dodger landscape for the past
two weeks, as the team scored three runs or less in 14 of 16 games.
But they came in bunches Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something we haven't seen in the last few weeks," Tracy
said of the two-out hits, several of which went to the opposite
field. "And to see the kinds of at-bats we had in those situations
was very encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 batter Shawn Green continued to struggle, extending his
hitless streak to 15 at-bats and failing to drive a ball out of the
infield for the fifth game in a row, his average sinking to .230.</TE>
<TE>   But leadoff batter Dave Roberts, returning to the lineup after
four games out because of a strained right quadriceps, had two
singles and a run batted in, No. 2 batter Adrian Beltre keyed the
sixth-inning rally with a two-run double, cleanup batter Paul Lo Duca
had two hits and an RBI, and No. 8 hitter Cesar Izturis had two
doubles and a run.</TE>
<TE>   And Karros came up huge in the fifth spot, making a diving stop of
Jose Vidro's grounder and flipping to first with the bases loaded to
end the second inning and turning a one-run deficit into a one-run
lead with his homer in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The performance came on Eric Karros T-shirt Giveaway Night in
Dodger Stadium. Can Shawn Green T-shirt night be that far behind?</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big home run EK hit," Tracy said. "It really energized
the entire club, and things snowballed from there."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos took a 3-2 lead with two runs in the top of the fifth,
and pitcher Tony Armas looked as if he might breeze through the
bottom of the fifth when he retired the first two Dodgers. But Lo
Duca shot a ground-ball single to left, and Karros ripped his third
homer of the season into the left-field bullpen for a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers then blew the game open in the sixth. After Grissom
singled and Roberts walked, Beltre greeted reliever Britt Reames with
a two-run double to right, giving the Dodgers a 6-3 lead. Green was
intentionally walked, and Lo Duca slapped an RBI single to right,
scoring Beltre for a 7-3 lead. Green scored on an overthrow to third,
making it 8-3.</TE>
<TE>   Vidro's two-run double cut the lead to 8-5 in the eighth, but
Dodger closer Eric Gagne threw a scoreless ninth for his 14th save,
preserving the victory for starter Hideo Nomo, who improved to 3-5
despite giving up three runs on six hits and walking five--bringing
his season walk total to 34--in a shaky 52/3-inning performance.</TE>
<TE>   After mustering a total of four hits in back-to-back shutouts to
the New York Mets Tuesday and Wednesday, the Dodgers have scored 12
runs in two wins over the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   "Those days are going to happen, but we never got down," Grissom
said. "We just have to keep swinging the bats, making things happen,
instead of sitting back, panicking, and worrying about hitting into
double plays."</TE>

<LD>Water polo is one of those Olympic sports that's forgotten in the
United States by all but the most devoted fans from one Summer Games
to the next. U.S. and international water polo officials are intent
on changing that.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Sunday at La Canada High, USA Water Polo will launch a
series of clinics and exhibition games throughout California that
will match the U.S. men's national team against a team of
international all-stars. Those events will be a prelude to the launch
next month of the FINA World League, in which the world's top teams
will vie for $400,000 in prize money.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Wigo, USA Water Polo's executive director, acknowledged both
plans are ambitious. But with a push from Ratko Rudic, hired 16
months ago to be the men's team's first full-time coach, Wigo agreed
it's time to take the big plunge.</LD>
<TE>   The planned clinics and exhibitions, Wigo said, are "probably one
of the greatest things that has happened in water polo in the 10
years I've been executive director. We're getting national team
players out there to work with kids and getting some of the best
players in the world out there too. The national team is going to
have some great competition and the kids have a chance to learn from
the best."</TE>
<TE>   Participation fees will vary, depending on whether there's a
clinic, a game, or both. The tentative schedule includes appearances
in Villa Park, Anaheim, Claremont, Tustin, El Toro and Commerce, and
runs into July. Seven players from European professional leagues have
agreed to play for the all-stars, including Sydney Olympic gold
medalists Tamas Marcz and Zolt Varga of Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   The FINA World League has eight teams. The U.S. will play two
games against Croatia and two against Russia in June and July at the
national training center in Los Alamitos before traveling to Europe
for games in Russia, Croatia and Hungary. The U.S. ends its schedule
with two games against Hungary in Moraga, Calif. The finals will be
played Aug. 1-4 at Patras, Greece.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been talking about this as long as I've been in the
sport," Wigo said. "FINA looks at this as an opportunity to create
publicity and promotion, and the idea is to try to create an American
water polo league on the model of the leagues in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of our best players going to Europe, we can keep them
here and bring the best Europeans here. We have to start now, and if
we have a few bumps in the road, we just have to get past them."</TE>
<TE>   On the Brink</TE>
<TE>   UCLA alumnus John Godina, the world's top-ranked shotputter last
season, says he's primed to break through the 71- to 72-foot barrier,
even though he has been bothered recently by tightness in his back.</TE>
<TE>   "The training base over the last six months has been so good, that
if there was ever a time when something big would happen, it could be
in the next few weeks," said the three-time world champion, who will
compete in the Oregon Track Classic today at Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1995, I had a really big period of about two months and the
next three or four years I spent trying to catch back up to that
performance. Now I've caught up and I'm at that level and expecting
at some point in the near future, because of experience, flow and
technical prowess, that everything is going to take off again."</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Powell, another UCLA alum and the U.S. women's discus record
holder since her throw of 227 feet 10 inches last month, will also
compete in Portland. She, too, thinks she can improve, thanks in part
to the competition she's getting from Seilala Sua, Kris Kuehl and
Aretha Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that has made everyone get better, because no longer is
205 or even 210 an acceptable mark," she said. "It's good to know
there are three other girls in the country who are working just as
hard and want the same things you do, and that forces you to train
harder and focus more."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Milena Glusac of Fallbrook was added to the field for the New York
women's mini marathon, June 8 in Central Park. Glusac won the U.S.
half-marathon, 20K and 25K titles last season. Jeanne Hennessy, this
year's 25K champion, has also entered, as has 2000 Olympian Jen
Rhines. Deena Drossin of Mammoth Lakes previously entered the race,
which carries a $30,000 prize.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Crawford, the 2001 indoor gold medalist in the 200 meters
and U.S. outdoor champion, ran a personal-best time of 9.94 seconds
in the 100 last weekend at Osaka, Japan. That equaled the world's
best 100-meter time this year, clocked last month by Tim Montgomery
of the U.S. and Frankie Fredericks of Namibia. Crawford also has the
world's fastest 200-meter outdoor time, 19.85 seconds, recorded April
12 in Pretoria, South Africa. He will compete today in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney pole vault gold medalist Stacy Dragila cleared 15 feet 13/4
inches (4.62 meters) to set a world-best women's mark last weekend at
the Modesto Relays. However, she missed an attempt at 15-93/4, which
would have broken her outdoor world record of 15-91/4, set last June.</TE>

<HD>Baseball's Best Days Are History</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Satchel Paige wasn't kidding when he laid down his sixth and final
rule for staying young: "Don't look back. Something might be gaining
on you."</LD>
<LD>   It's a sage piece of advice that baseball loves to celebrate,
loves to wink at, loves to bundle up together with the best of Yogi
Berra, Casey Stengel and Jerry Coleman for a few laughs around the
hot stove. But it's also a piece of advice baseball, for decades now,
has steadfastly and resolutely chosen to ignore.</LD>
<LD>   No sport looks back as frequently and as longingly as baseball
does--back to the spindly legged home run shuffles of the Babe, back
to the comforting gray flannels of the Brooklyn Dodgers, back to the
canonized radio calls of Mel Allen, Red Barber and Russ Hodges.</LD>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   Because something is always gaining on it.</TE>
<TE>   If it's not football, which has already caught and passed the
grand old game, it's basketball. Or auto racing. Or golf. Or
skateboarding. Or snowboarding. Or PlayStation 2. Or "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Today's baseball, at least the big league version, is a grotesque
mutation of the languid, chin-stroking, chess-on-a-diamond
original--juiced-up players swatting juiced-up baseballs long
distances, mainly for the benefit of "SportsCenter" highlight editors
and rotisserie league obsessives. "Home Run Derby" with infielders.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Diamondbacks, not yet five seasons old, are reigning
World Series champions, because new money can buy the best pitchers
just as easily as old.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, among the surliest sports personalities of his
generation, is the new home run king.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins lead the American League Central, but when
fans ask, "For how much longer?" they are wondering about the
existence of the franchise after 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos are battling for the lead in the National
League East, playing for four-figure home crowds on their way out of
town or out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance is down. Ticket prices are up. "Contraction" is the
buzz term of the day, with "work stoppage" warming up in the pen.</TE>
<TE>   Who can wax romantically about that?</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has some great old stories to tell, but as it tries to
build interest for its 2002 season, it stages a memorable Super Bowl
that produces an unlikely champion, doesn't threaten to shut down
four teams the day after, hypes the new talent just drafted to join
the league and opens a new franchise, in Houston, the league's 32nd.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball, meanwhile, prints books.</TE>
<TE>   Paige's famous advice appears on Page 318 of "Baseball: A Literary
Anthology," sandwiched between John Updike's fabled essay on Ted
Williams' final game and an excerpt from Bill Veeck's memoirs. Paige
is pictured, warming up before a Kansas City Monarchs' game, on Page
96 of "Baseball As America: Seeing Ourselves Through Our National
Game."</TE>
<TE>   Paige is analyzed and assessed as the greatest pitcher in the
history of the Negro leagues on Page 193 of "The New Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract."</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball As America," commissioned as a companion piece to the
current National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum national tour, is
an exercise in propaganda--short, lavishly illustrated,
easy-to-consume chapters on the game's icons (Joe DiMaggio, Roberto
Clemente) and rituals (card-collecting, the seventh-inning stretch)
and baseball bouquets lobbed by the likes of Mark Twain, Walt
Whitman, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Tom Brokaw and John Grisham.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball: A Literary Anthology" comes armed with Damon Runyon,
Ring Lardner, Thomas Wolfe, James Thurber, Red Smith, Robert Frost,
Gay Talese, Don DeLillo, Stephen King and a premise that plays to
both the game's strengths and weaknesses: At its best, baseball
writing is better entertainment than baseball watching.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: James' revised "Historical Baseball Abstract,"
updated and expanded from the 1985 original. As cantankerous and
idiosyncratic as always, James tries to rank the top 100 players of
all time at every position. There's a sports-bar debate brewing on
every page (Jeff Bagwell over Eddie Murray? Ron Santo over Brooks
Robinson?), but agree or not, I'd rather read James arguing the
merits of old Cubs and Phillies than watch the current ones miss
cutoff men, any day on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Intentionally or not, each book has a retrospective,
wrapping-up-the-millennium feel to it--"Baseball: The Boxed Set."
Future generations, please note: This is what baseball looked like,
felt like and sounded like when it held our attention as a nation,
through a couple of world wars, for sizable portions of the 19th and
20th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Burns' documentaries on baseball and jazz left behind a
similar residue: Once upon a time, these pastimes said important
things about America and its values, but both peaked decades ago,
long before they were trampled under by the things that define
America at the dawn of a new century--NASCAR and Britney Spears.</TE>
<TE>   So where does baseball--and its books--go from here?</TE>
<TE>   "The Montreal Expos, 1969-2002: A Short History."</TE>
<TE>   "Ball Four: Why Barry Bonds Will Never Again Hit 73 Home Runs in
Our Lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   "The GameBoys of Summer: How Virtual Baseball Eclipsed the Real
Thing."</TE>
<TE>   "The Sub-4.00 ERA, the Complete Game and Other Baseball Oddities."</TE>
<TE>   "Fehr Strikes Out: The Great Baseball Work Stoppage of 2002-2004."</TE>
<TE>   Don't look back?</TE>
<TE>   From this vantage point, Satch, it's the only view to consider.</TE>

<HD>Frankel's Cloak of Darkness</HD>
<DH>Preakness: In a twist, trainer is bringing favorite
Medaglia d'Oro to Pimlico only 14 hours before post time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Just about the time some of the Preakness revelers were locating
their pillows, a horse van was pulling in at Pimlico this morning,
having made a 225-mile trip from New York. The van was carrying
Medaglia d'Oro, who's only the morning-line favorite today. Another
Triple Crown race, another late arrival.</LD>
<LD>   With an unusual plan, trainer Bobby Frankel is hoping Medaglia
d'Oro does better than Johannesburg and Castle Gandolfo, who were
only Churchill Downs rumors two weeks ago until they arrived from
Keeneland, 70 miles away, on the day of the Kentucky Derby. The Irish
imports ran eighth and 12th in the Derby, on a day when Medaglia
d'Oro lost most of his chance with a poor start and finished fourth,
eight lengths behind the longshot War Emblem.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Bailey, who has ridden five Triple Crown event winners, most
recently Red Bullet here in 2000, takes over for Laffit Pincay as
Medaglia d'Oro and 11 others try to prevent War Emblem from winning
the second leg of the Triple Crown. The series windup, the Belmont
Stakes, will be run June 8 in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Frankel doesn't see Medaglia d'Oro's 4 a.m. race-day arrival, only
14 hours before post time, as avant-garde. He says that, for years,
he has been successfully shipping last-minute horses a longer
distance, from his Southern California base to Bay Meadows and Golden
Gate Fields near San Francisco. But this is the Preakness, and
Pimlico barn crawlers are used to seeing the showcase horses in
advance. In fact, the last time a horse won the Preakness after not
showing up until race day was 1983. Deputed Testamony was vanned in
after completing his Preakness training at a Maryland farm about 40
miles from the track.</TE>
<TE>   Deputed Testamony and Red Bullet are the only horses in the last
19 runnings to have won the Preakness after skipping the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "That's enough of a record to keep you from buying the fresh-horse
theory," trainer Wayne Lukas said. "The Preakness is not known for
surprises."</TE>
<TE>   Lukas is running two horses today--Proud Citizen, who was second,
beaten by four lengths in the Derby, and Table Limit, stepping into
stakes company for the first time. A victory by either would be
Lukas' 14th in a Triple Crown race and enable him to break the record
he shares with the late Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons.</TE>
<TE>   Besides War Emblem, Medaglia d'Oro and Proud Citizen, there is
only one other Derby returnee--Harlan's Holiday--in the 127th
Preakness. Harlan's Holiday, a modest 6-1 favorite, did virtually no
running in a seventh-place finish at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, like Lukas, is a member of the Racing Hall of Fame, but
has been comparatively underexposed in Triple Crown races, which is a
polite way of saying he has never won one. Medaglia d'Oro, who races
for Edmund Gann of Rancho Santa Fe, is only Frankel's second
Preakness starter, 27 years after Native Guest's seventh-place finish
in 1975. Two years ago, Frankel had a Preakness possibility,
Aptitude, who had finished second in the Derby. But Frankel bypassed
Pimlico and saddled the colt for another second, to Commendable, in
the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "I might not have even brought Aptitude to the Preakness if he had
won the Derby," Frankel said. "Medaglia d'Oro is a much sounder horse
than Aptitude. He can take it."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a downside today to Medaglia d'Oro, it is that the
Preakness will be his third taxing race in five weeks. He was second,
between Buddha and Sunday Break, in a tight three-horse finish in the
Wood Memorial, and in the Derby he had to work hard--encountering
trouble in the stretch as well as at the start--to finish fourth.
Medaglia d'Oro was about the only Derby horse to greatly improve his
position over the 11/4 miles. Today's distance is a sixteenth of a
mile shorter.</TE>
<TE>   The Wood-Derby-Preakness grind would be demanding for any horse,
perhaps more so for Medaglia d'Oro. When Gann bought him in February
he had raced only twice overall and once this year.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a step backwards in the Derby," Frankel conceded. "I
can't predict what he'll do in the Preakness. He's more seasoned than
the five races might indicate. In the Derby, because of what
happened, he got more experience than a horse might get in four or
five races."</TE>
<TE>   In another intriguing twist, Frankel hasn't seen Medaglia d'Oro
since Louisville, He runs two divisions, in California and New York,
and after the Derby he returned to California to tend to his horses
there. But Frankel knows that Medaglia d'Oro has been in good hands,
with Ruben Loza and Jose Cuevas, who were to accompany the colt on
his four-hour trip to Pimlico. Loza has been with Frankel for 27
years.</TE>
<TE>   "A big reason I've had so much luck in recent years is because
I've got such great help--some guys who have been with me a long
time," Frankel said. "When the horses are with guys like these, I can
sleep at night."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey was introduced to Medaglia d'Oro on Thursday at Belmont
Park, where the colt shook out any lingering cobwebs with a
35-second, three-furlong breeze. That has been the colt's only
workout since the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "He's plenty fit," Frankel said. "If no other horses go with War
Emblem early, we'll go, but I can't see it as a race where everybody
takes back [as was the case in the Derby]. My horse is not a run-off
horse. When he makes the lead, he relaxes. We're not going in
depending on other horses. Jerry will ride his horse. He'll ride his
own horse and not depend on anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The track may be wet-fast for the Preakness. Thundershowers were
in the forecast until noon today. Temperatures will be in the 60s....
Bailey rode favored Chamrousse to a 21/4-length victory over Shop
Till You Drop in the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Autumn Creek
was third in a field cut to six by two scratches, one of which, Take
Charge Lady, would have been favored.... Other stakes winners at
Pimlico were Summer Colony, who nosed out Dancethruthedawn in the
$148,500 Pimlico Distaff Handicap, and Merry Princess in the $75,000
The Very One. Fleet Renee, high weight in the Distaff, was scratched.</TE>
<TE>   With only $178,000 in the win pool, War Emblem was 2-1 for the
Preakness, followed by Medaglia d'Oro, 3-1, and Harlan's Holiday,
9-2. Booklet was 8-1 and the nine others were 10-1 or higher.... The
Preakness is the 12th race on a 13-race card that starts at 7:30
a.m., California time. Post time for the Preakness is 3:09 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors have resurfaced that Frank Stronach, the owner of Santa
Anita and other tracks, is close to a deal that will net him Pimlico
and its sister track, Laurel Park.... Gary Stevens, who rides Table
Limit in the Preakness, has switched agents, moving from Brian Beach
to Craig O'Bryan. There was a minor flap early in the week when an
irate Nick Zito said that he had planned on Stevens riding Straight
Gin, one of his two starters. Robby Albarado wound up with the
assignment on Straight Gin.</TE>

<LD>Rialto football Coach Don Markham, who called his players "a bunch of
jerks" while talking with a reporter last fall, has been fired by
Principal Anna Rodriguez, Rialto Unified School District spokeswoman
Marilyn Cardosi said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Markham, a former Bloomington coach who recently expressed
interest in that school's coaching vacancy, was dismissed after
telling Rodriguez he could not commit to remaining at Rialto next
season, Cardosi said.</LD>
<LD>   Markham compiled a 13-9 record in two seasons at Rialto, which had
never posted a winning season before his arrival. Markham is not
commenting on the action.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant Larry Claunch has been promoted on an interim basis.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been 13 years since Chatsworth High had won a boys' volleyball
City championship. The Chancellors had experienced plenty of
frustration while making their postseason runs.</LD>
<LD>   That changed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Paul George delivered 14 kills and Chatsworth denied Taft a fourth
consecutive City title, 15-5, 15-4, 15-1, in a match that lasted only
62 minutes at Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Cornell had 12 kills and six blocks, and the Chancellors won
a championship for the first time since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd won three in a row, but we're the team on the championship
trophy now," said George, who has signed with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no greater feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth never trailed, taking a 7-1 lead in the first game, an
8-1 lead in the second game and completely dominating the final game,
giving Coach Greg Saltzberg a title in only his third season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than I expected, but I knew when I started working with
these guys that I had something special," Saltzberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rodstein had six kills for Taft (10-5), which lost to
Chatsworth for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall def. Fairfax, 15-7, 15-10, 8-15, 16-14--Javier DeLeon had
18 kills and the Barristers won the Invitational championship.
Marshall, seeded No. 9, finished 12-3. Fairfax is 8-7.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For someone who admitted having playoff jitters, senior right-hander
Jonathan Combs of Santa Barbara High came through with a performance
Friday that set the standard for how pitchers are supposed to pitch
in pressure-filled games.</LD>
<LD>   Combs struck out two, walked none and induced 10 groundball outs
in Santa Barbara's 2-1 victory over Newhall Hart in a first-round
Southern Section Division II playoff game at Santa Barbara High.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of guys who make a living doing what he did
today, throwing strikes," Hart Coach Jim Ozella said.</LD>
<TE>   Only once was Hart (15-11-1) able to get its leadoff batter on
base against Combs (9-2), who never wavered even after junior Chris
Valaika's leadoff home run in the sixth inning gave the Indians a
momentary boost in confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a great job out there," Valaika said. "He came out with
intensity and threw a lot of first-ball strikes."</TE>
<TE>   Combs said he was nervous because last season he gave up six runs
in the first inning of an 11-1 playoff loss to Agoura.</TE>
<TE>   All day, his stomach was churning, leaving it up to his teammates
to serve as his sports psychologists.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys calmed me down and helped me relax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Crucial to the victory for the Dons (21-5) was getting off to an
early lead. Credit Eric Bowman, who contributed an RBI double in the
first on an 0-2 fastball from losing pitcher J.P. Slauenwhite (5-3).</TE>
<TE>   Chuy Deloera added an RBI double in the fourth inning for the
Dons, the Channel League champions.</TE>
<TE>   Valaika, a junior shortstop, showed why he'll be one of the most
recruited players in Southern California next season. Besides having
two of Hart's five hits, he made two outstanding plays on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley 14, Rialto 8--Jason Corder hit two
home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in six runs for the
visiting Cougars (17-11), the two-time defending Division I champions
who advanced out of the wild-card round.</TE>
<TE>   Rialto, No. 18 in The Times' rankings, finishes its season at
17-8.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley 2, L.A. Loyola 1--Freshman Trevor Bell provided
the margin of victory for the top-seeded Falcons with a solo home run
with one out in the sixth inning in a Division II first-round game at
Crescenta Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Krise threw a two-hitter with seven strikeouts for No. 5
Crescenta Valley (23-3).</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara-bound pitcher Andy Graham (3-5) threw a
five-hitter for Loyola (17-10). The Cubs tied the score in the top of
the sixth on an RBI single by Brendan O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   Phelan Serrano 6, Covina Charter Oak 1--Randy Woolard had two hits
and an RBI and Jordan Craft (5-4) threw an eight-hitter to lead the
Diamondbacks (14-9-1) to an upset victory in the first round of the
Division III playoffs. Second-seeded Charter Oak (19-4) was ranked
No. 13 by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In volleyball:</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Royal d. Newport Harbor, 15-13, 11-15, 15-13, 10-15,
15-12--Senior middle blocker Kyle Vondrak had a school-record 44
kills, including 29 in the third and fourth games, to lead Royal to a
Southern Section Division II quarterfinal playoff victory at Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Vondrak, who had 19 kills in an hour-long third game, scored the
last two points on a block and a kill to clinch the Highlanders'
victory. Vondrak's kill total broke the school record of 43 set last
year by David Russell, who is now at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Royal senior setter Bart Kowalski had 90 assists, three short of
the school record set by John Baxter in 1995 and equaled by Baxter in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Highlanders (23-6) rallied from deficits in each
game they won. Baxter's younger brother, Kevin, had 33 kills,
including 12 kills in the third game, and 17 digs. Shawn Farrell had
14 kills and Darren Miller had 20 digs for Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Senior outside hitter Greg Perrine had a team-high 27 kills and
middle blocker Erik Peterson had 24 for Newport Harbor (26-7).</TE>

<LD>Jennifer McCard scored on Nikki Haines' grounder to shortstop in the
bottom of the 12th inning Friday to give La Palma Kennedy a 1-0
victory over Corona at Cypress Park in the first round of the
Southern Section Division II softball playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA-bound Michelle Turner (20-4) pitched her 13th consecutive
shutout and her 20th of the season. She extended her consecutive
scoreless-innings streak to 99, getting toughest in the 11th inning,
when runners were at first and second with no out. After a sacrifice
bunt, Turner got one of her seven strikeouts, followed by a popup.</LD>
<LD>   "She beat us," Corona Coach Jo Ann Byrd said. "When the game's on
the line, she's toughest. We would like to have seen her in the
quarterfinals, at least."</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy (21-5-1), No. 9 in The Times' regular-season rankings,
will play Hemet (16-9), a 7-5 winner over San Gorgonio, in the second
round on Tuesday. Corona, ranked No. 20, ends its season 19-9.</TE>
<TE>   Turner gave up only five hits in outdueling Corona freshman
Brittney Bargar (11-3), and took the victory on Haines' bases-loaded,
grounder to shortstop with none out.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't charge it," said Corona's Dena Tyson, whose throw
to home plate was late.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Loara 5, Anaheim Canyon 0--Lauren Lappin drove in two runs

<LD>Having given War Emblem no chance to win the Kentucky Derby two weeks
ago when he was 20-1, there is no way to climb aboard the Preakness
bandwagon that will make him the first or second choice in the
wagering.</LD>
<LD>   For the second race in a row, War Emblem was able to get away with
an unpressured lead, and as he had in the Illinois Derby a month
earlier, he took advantage in his first race for the Thoroughbred
Corp. and trainer Bob Baffert at Churchill Downs.</LD>
<LD>   Seeing how everybody now views him as the 3-year-old to beat and
what can happen if he is left alone early, the early pace will be
swift in the second leg of the Triple Crown.</LD>
<TE>   None of the other early speed types have any chance of winning,
but Table Limit, Booklet and Menacing Dennis are all drawn outside
War Emblem and they have only one way to go.</TE>
<TE>   If Victor Espinoza, War Emblem's jockey, tries to run with that
trio, he risks fading late. If he remains off the pace, the
Kentucky-bred is going to have to show a new dimension to win the
Preakness and head to New York with a chance to become the first
Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   In his five victories, War Emblem has scored from off the pace
only once. On Nov. 23 at the Fair Grounds, he was fifth early, more
than three lengths off the lead, and won by 41/2 lengths at 2-1
against a weak allowance field.</TE>
<TE>   When he failed to take the lead against tougher opposition, he
retreated to fifth in the Lecomte at the same track on Jan. 26, then
was a tiring sixth in the Risen Star on Feb. 17.</TE>
<TE>   While doubts exist about War Emblem's versatility, there are no
such concerns with Medaglia d'Oro.</TE>
<TE>   The El Prado colt was on the lead in the Wood Memorial, but, in
his victory in the San Felipe at Santa Anita, he rallied after
surrendering the top spot and was going away at the finish.</TE>
<TE>   In the Derby, he was victimized by a troubled start, losing all
position early, and he had other traffic problems along the way. Yet,
he managed to finish fourth and was the only horse who made up ground
in the final quarter of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   If the anticipated scenario becomes reality, Medaglia d'Oro and
new jockey Jerry Bailey could fall into a great spot entering the
first turn. If three races in five weeks isn't too rigorous a
campaign, he can give trainer Bobby Frankel his first victory in a
Triple Crown race.</TE>
<TE>   Those who could join him in the exacta, trifecta and superfecta
include Proud Citizen, the runner-up in the Derby who continues to
improve for Wayne Lukas, U S S Tinosa, Harlan's Holiday and Equality.</TE>
<TE>   Hampered by a rough trip in the Santa Anita Derby, U S S Tinosa
could have the right style for the race and there was nothing wrong
with his two previous outings--a second in the San Felipe and a
victory in the Sham.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Graham Motion, Equality had trouble as the favorite in
the Aventura at Gulfstream Park and he's another who could threaten
in the stretch at a big price.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday has been somewhat forgotten after finishing
seventh as the 6-1 favorite in the Derby. It was his first
off-the-board finish in 11 starts. If he rebounded, it would not be
the first time a horse that failed as the favorite in Kentucky
bounced back in Maryland. In fact, Point Given did it last year as
did Snow Chief in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Easyfromthegitgo, Magic Weisner, Straight Gin and Crimson Hero
will all be longshots for good reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Zito, who trains Straight Gin and Crimson Hero, has been
saying that he thinks his colts could be factors in the Belmont. He
could be right. If no other 3-year-olds enter the last Triple Crown
race, they will probably finish 1-2.</TE>

<HD>Emotional Toil</HD>
<DH>Rizza is a top player, but sometimes he lets anger get the
better of him</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rylan Rizza wears his emotions on his sleeves, but he'll roll up
those sleeves anyway and get to work this weekend in the Southern
Section individual tennis tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Rizza, a senior at Palos Verdes Peninsula High, is among the top
contenders in the competition, which has singles and doubles
champions and runners-up from each league vying for the annual
championships beginning today.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I have a shot," said Rizza, whose preliminary will take
place at the Costa Mesa Tennis Center. "If I play well and play the
way I'm capable of, I think I have a good chance to win."</LD>
<TE>   If he does, the feat is likely to bring a smile to his face as
easily as a line call against him or a backhand volley into the net
makes him grimace, grouse or grind his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   It would be no surprise if he threw his racket into the air in
celebration. After all, he has been known to slam his racket to the
ground in disgust, usually with himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just reaction, right at the moment," said Rizza, who did not
play in the high school singles tournament last year. "But I play
with passion. I think it's hurt me sometimes and helped me at other
times."</TE>
<TE>   Rizza , the U.S. Tennis Assn. Southern California section's junior
player of the year in 2000, is No. 8 in the USTA's Southern
California boys' 18 division standings.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, he is at No. 18, behind only No. 9 Doug Stewart of
Malibu among players competing for the high school title. Both will
attend Virginia on tennis scholarships next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like Doug comes to us as a pretty complete player, and
Rylan's not far behind," Virginia Coach Brian Boland said. "[Rizza's]
so quick and athletic and has so much room for improvement. If he
puts his mind to it, his potential is just unlimited."</TE>
<TE>   But Rizza needs to learn to control his emotions, Peninsula Coach
Tom Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox has pressed the point by defaulting Rizza out of three sets
this season for disciplinary reasons. The defaults account for all
but one of the player's losses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to learn to control yourself," Cox said. "You
can't act like an idiot in other places. Why should you do it on the
court?"</TE>
<TE>   Rizza won the Bay League singles title and has posted a 49-4
record in sets this season, losing on the court only to San Marino
senior Travis Kinard, 7-6 (6). That defeat in Peninsula's 13-5 loss
to the Titans on April 1 came after Rizza squandered two match
points. It precipitated defaults of his other two sets that day after
Rizza threw his racket to the ground as he came off court, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox declined to discuss the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just impulse," Rizza said of his actions. "If I took three
seconds to think about it, I wouldn't do it."But if I didn't care, if
I didn't play with the passion that I do, I don't think I'd be as
good a player."</TE>
<TE>   Rizza's parents have tried to curb those negative impulses, using
tactics ranging from giving him an earful, to grounding him, to
fining him--usually about $5--for each outburst.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't tell you how many times I'd tell him, 'I don't care if
you win or lose, as long as you play hard, don't misbehave and
respect your opponent,'" said Dennis Rizza, Rylan's father and coach.
Dennis is a teaching pro at Jack Kramer Tennis Club in Rolling Hills
Estates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always about himself. When he's not doing well, he can get
down on himself in a very negative way."</TE>
<TE>   Rizza has twice received warnings from tournament officials but
has not received penalty points or been defaulted from junior-circuit
matches.</TE>
<TE>   And beyond the San Marino defaults, and another one he took
against Mira Costa in March, Cox said Rizza has been a positive force
for Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   He and Paul Matysek are team captains, and the coach credits Rizza
for making a point to attend practices and work out with teammates in
an effort to help them improve.</TE>
<TE>   Rizza is the crucial factor in the Panthers' 15-7 record,
nine-match winning streak, 11th consecutive league title and progress
into Tuesday's Division I team quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's clearly above everybody else in terms of ability and
rankings," Cox said. "It's nice to go into a match knowing you're
probably going to get those three points every time."</TE>

<HD>A Three-Homer Game for Durazo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Erubiel Durazo homered three times and drove in nine runs--the most
in the majors in three years-- to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks over
the Philadelphia Phillies, 12-9, Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Playing his second game of the season since coming off the
disabled list, Durazo hit three two-run homers after singles by Luis
Gonzalez.</LD>
<LD>   Durazo had a chance to tie the major league record of four home
runs, matched 15 days ago by Seattle's Mike Cameron, when he came to
bat with two outs in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   He lined a 3-2 pitch from Cliff Politte into the right-field
corner for a three-run double, setting a franchise record with nine
runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most RBIs in one game since Boston shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra knocked in 10 runs against Seattle on May 10, 1999, at
Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo is the third player to hit at least three home runs in a
game this year. Houston's Lance Berkman also hit three April 16 at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez scored four times to tie a club record, and the
Diamondbacks rallied from four runs down.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo's first two homers came off starter Terry Adams in the
first and sixth innings. The third, off reliever Rheal Cormier (1-4)
in the seventh, gave Arizona its first lead, 9-7. The homers traveled
418 feet, 396 feet and 421 feet.</TE>
<TE>   After missing the start of the season because of surgery on his
right wrist, Durazo was immediately inserted into the cleanup spot by
Arizona Manager Bob Brenly.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out his first three at-bats Thursday, but since then has
two doubles and three homers in six plate appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo finished four for five Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo is the third Arizona player to hit three homers in a game,
joining Gonzalez and Steve Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Rollins led off the game with a home run for the second
night in a row, but once again the Phillies couldn't hold a lead,
falling to 0-5 on their seven-game road trip and 3-17 away from home
overall despite getting 17 hits.</TE>

<HD>Bruins' Summer Practices to Start at Cal Lutheran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to enhance team unity, the UCLA football team will conduct the
first week of summer training camp at Cal Lutheran University in
Thousand Oaks. It will be the first time the Bruins have held
practices off campus since 1984 when they did so to accommodate the
Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins will hold two practices a day and live in dorms at Cal
Lutheran from Aug. 17 until Aug. 24, when they will return to UCLA
for a scrimmage at Drake Stadium. Practices will be open to the
public.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel that the move to Cal Lutheran will provide our team a
chance to come together and bond," Coach Bob Toledo said. "Team
chemistry has become an increasingly important component of success
in athletics and being at Cal Lutheran will give us a chance to lay
the foundation."</LD>
<TE>   The move will shorten the commute for Toledo, who lives in
Westlake Village, and several assistant coaches, among them defensive
coordinator Phil Snow, who lives in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Cowboys trained at Cal Lutheran for 27 years before
moving their camp to Austin, Texas, in 1990.</TE>

<HD>Can Webber Be a Money Player?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KREIDLER</AU>
<BD>SACRAMENTO BEE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is what he wanted, remember? Chris Webber wanted exactly this
shot. He wanted to be at this place in this moment with this much
riding on the outcomes of the games, and we know it because he said
so.</LD>
<LD>   Webber's return to the Kings last summer was predicated on any
number of things, but in the end, the fact that Sacramento probably
gave him his best angle on an NBA championship ring stood atop the
list. We know it because he said so.</LD>
<LD>   And now it's time to watch Webber in the crucible. It is time to
see the big man in the biggest games of his career.</LD>
<TE>   And, not to be too indelicate about it, it's time to check ye olde
return on investment.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, we've always thought the money angle with Webber was the
wrong way to go. He received more than $120 million from the brothers
Maloof last summer, it's true; and now the team is salary-heavy
beyond recognition, and that gets us to Mike Bibby and ticket prices
and trade possibilities and everything else you'd care to name.
Webber's contract has become the convenient scapegoat for all messy
matters financial, and you could see that coming from the moment he
sat down to sign.</TE>
<TE>   People look at the money with Webber and see red. Wrong response.</TE>
<TE>   The right response is this: Elite players elevate teams, don't
they?</TE>
<TE>   Elite players elevate teams, and Chris Webber is the player, and
the team is this one. The Kings can't wait to see how things develop
in another season or two. They're on a great growth pattern,
certainly, but the only sure thing is that they stand four victories
away from the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   And Webber, it says here, is going to have to get at least one of
those wins personally. These are the Lakers, not the Jazz or the
Mavericks. Four victories against L.A. can feel like a dozen against
anybody else. The Lakers get their pound of flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento is a deep team and a solid team and, coming out of last
week's stunning trip to Dallas, seemingly a changed team. But it is
still so much a team about Webber, because Webber's game has such a
direct influence on everything else that happens out there.</TE>
<TE>   Webber can star in games without taking them over, which is part
of the Kings' overall appeal. But if he doesn't take over at least
once against the Lakers, this series will die an ignoble death. Elite
players elevate teams, even the balanced ones.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings lost Peja Stojakovic in Dallas without losing the
series. That became part of the lore. But finishing the Mavericks
absent Peja and beginning against the Lakers are two quite different
propositions, and that brings us very quickly back to the All-Star
who remains.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was as good as his word in Dallas. That's part of the
compelling nature of this theater.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber is that rare top-shelf player who is perfectly
willing to acknowledge his career won't be complete without an NBA
title. And beginning today, he has to reach for the blasted thing
himself.</TE>
