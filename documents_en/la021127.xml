<HD>Auto designer shifts gears</HD>
<DH>Mazda's former design director takes on a new challenge at
a San Francisco art college</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Matano, retired global advanced design director and chief
designer for Mazda Motor Corp., couldn't sit still. A day after
leaving Mazda on Aug. 31, he stepped into his new job as head of San
Francisco-based Academy of Art College's growing industrial design
school and its automotive design program.</LD>
<LD>   Matano, 55, said he just didn't want to slip into retirement and
fade away. "I've got a lot of ideas and knowledge about design up
here," he said, pointing to his temple. "And I want to share it.
Besides, being around young students keeps you interested."</LD>
<LD>   A native of Tokyo, Matano (his Japanese surname is Tsutomu) took
part in an engineering program at Seikei University but found little
joy in what he once called the engineer's "cold and scientific" work.</LD>
<TE>   So in late 1969 he hopped a freighter owned by his grandfather's
company and came to the U.S., where in 1971 he enrolled at Art Center
College of Design in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from that school's transportation design program
-- which claims to be the alma mater of nearly 70% of the
professional automotive designers working in the U.S. and Europe
today -- Matano joined General Motors Corp.'s design team, first for
Oldsmobile and later for a GM subsidiary in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983 he went to BMW in Germany to work on the redesign of the
3-Series, but left after a year. Munich, he said, was a beautiful
city, "but too cold in the winter."</TE>
<TE>   Matano returned to California in 1984 to run Mazda's Irvine-based
North American Research and Design Center and began working with the
team that was designing the Miata roadster, which resurrected
interest in the open two-seat vehicle when it was introduced in the
U.S. in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Matano oversaw or was part of the teams that
designed various generations of the rotary-engine-powered RX-7, the
Tribute crossover SUV, the 6 sedan and the upcoming RX-8 four-door
sports car for Mazda, which is controlled by Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Matano said he was attracted to his new job in part because the
Art Academy has an open-enrollment policy that makes the auto design
program more collegial and less cutthroat than those at Art Center
and Michigan's Center for Creative Studies.</TE>
<TE>   At those schools, aspiring auto design students must compete for
admission based on a faculty critique of their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   "My idea," said Matano, "is not to try to compete with the other
schools, where everyone is constantly worried about being at the top
of the class and getting a job with one of the big auto firms, but to
provide these students with a better quality of basic design
education."</TE>
<TE>   After all, he said, "that's what they came here for, and it
shouldn't make any difference whether they actually go into auto
design or not."</TE>
<TE>   The academy, founded in 1929, has buildings scattered around San
Francisco and an enrollment of about 6,800 students in 10 programs.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial design program Matano heads has 260 students, 70 in
transportation and the others in product, toy and furniture design
specialties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for his own learning curve, Matano said that after being out of
school for 25 years, "just trying to remember all the processes and
the special language [of academics] has been tough. You forget all
that very quickly when you leave school."</TE>
<TE>   He'd also forgotten what being a student was like, but got a quick
refresher when he reported to work and found that finding housing in
San Francisco wasn't going to be a snap: "I had to live for five
weeks in the dormitory." There was a back-to-school party in the room
next to his the first night, he recalled, "and all night long I was
awake with the people going up and down the stairs and the
[stairwell] doors opening and closing."</TE>
<TE>   Matano and his wife, Kako, decided to keep their main residence in
Irvine. "I have five cars and you can't have a five-car garage in San
Francisco," he said. But they bought a small condominium near the
former Cadillac dealership on Van Ness Avenue that houses the
academy's industrial design program.</TE>
<TE>   He's still a bit of a Mazda loyalist and drives around San
Francisco in his silver RX-7, but he tells students not to be
concerned about brands as they are working on design projects. "That
makes you tied into a design theme, and you should be wide open."</TE>

<HD>Automakers want to give diesel a push</HD>
<DH>Chrysler plans to roll out a Jeep Liberty SUV in 2004 in an
effort to encourage use of the more efficient fuel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chrysler Group said this week that it would begin selling a
diesel-powered version of its Jeep Liberty SUV in the United States
in 2004, following up on announcements at the Paris Auto Show, where
leaders of the major auto companies said they would push for adoption
of universal diesel standards.</LD>
<LD>   About 35% of the passenger vehicles in Europe are diesel-powered,
whereas only a handful of heavy-duty pickup trucks and a few
Volkswagen passenger cars are sold with diesel engines in the U.S.
That mainly is because consumers and regulators in the U.S. still see
diesels as the noisy, smoke- and soot-belching machines they were in
the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   But technology advancements have made them far more efficient and
quieter these days. Europeans see diesels as highly fuel-efficient
engines with lots of power. Diesels still are dirtier than gasoline
engines, but because of their fuel efficiency contribute far fewer of
the so-called greenhouses gases, such as carbon dioxide, that trap
heat in the atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   Another difference is that diesel fuel sold in Europe is low
sulfur, which is far cleaner than the diesel fuel sold in the U.S. If
one-third of the American auto fleet used diesel engines with cleaner
fuel, Chrysler Group President Dieter Zetsche said, "the United
States could reduce its oil use by approximately 800 million gallons
and its carbon dioxide emissions by 8 million tons annually."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in New York,
Zetsche called on U.S. regulators and oil refiners to work together
to resolve the diesel emissions challenges. New federal standards for
cleaner diesel are scheduled to take effect in 2006 and call for fuel
that is much lower in emissions-causing sulfur than now is produced.</TE>
<TE>   The diesel Jeep Liberty will be powered by a 2.8-liter
turbo-diesel engine produced by DaimlerChrysler. It will be available
with a manual or an automatic transmission and in two- and
four-wheel-drive versions.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler currently offers diesel engines in its Dodge Ram
heavy-duty trucks in North America, and they account for about 75% of
all Ram 2500 and 3500 sales here.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is campaign's focus</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club has made Ford Motor Co. the first target of its
drive to protect California's controversial Global Warming Law, which
instructed the state air resources board to come up with a plan to
reduce California's contribution to the production of greenhouse
gases.</TE>
<TE>   Because internal combustion engines emit lots of carbon dioxide,
the auto industry has become the focus of a concerted effort to
reduce greenhouse gases by improving the fuel efficiency of car and
truck engines.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the auto industry see the California law, which leaves it
to the air board to come up with a plan by 2006, as a way for the
board to start regulating fuel economy: The less gasoline burned per
mile traveled, the less carbon dioxide produced.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and other automakers have threatened to sue the state,
claiming that the power to regulate fuel economy is reserved to the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club is concentrating its lobbying efforts on Ford
because its chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., publicly calls
himself a staunch environmentalist.</TE>
<TE>   He also promised last year to improve the Ford fleet's average
fuel economy by 25% but has since backed off on that. And the company
recently pulled the plug on its Think electric car division,
declaring that the public isn't interested in battery-powered
electric vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say the decisions are driven by economics and
the need to run a profitable company. But Sierra Club organizer Kate
Jackson says the club believes Ford and other carmakers can be
profitable and green at the same time. The club's Campaign for
Responsible Car Companies is urging Sierra Club members and others to
go to car dealers and ask for environmentally friendly vehicles,
especially fuel-efficient and low-emission versions of sport utility
vehicles and pickups.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel-cell celebrations</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have taken leadership roles
in the effort to bring alternative-fuel vehicles to California --
Honda with the Insight and Civic gas-electric hybrid models and
Toyota with the Prius hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   They now are pushing fuel-cell development and Monday are holding
separate-but-equal events to tout their latest accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota kicks off things with a ceremony delivering the keys to a
fuel-cell-powered Toyota FCHV -- it stands for Fuel Cell Hybrid
Vehicle and is based on the Highlander SUV -- to officials at UC
Irvine's National Fuel Cell Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Honda hands Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn the
keys to the first of five Honda FCX fuel-cell vehicles the city is
leasing over the next year.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the announcements is dictated in part by Toyota's
plan to announce terms of its Japanese fuel-cell leasing program in
Tokyo the same day.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the UCI center is leasing the Toyota fuel-cell
vehicle for $10,000 a month -- a price that underscores how expensive
these test vehicles are. Terms of Honda's lease agreement with L.A.
won't be announced until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Both vehicles use hydrogen, passed through a catalyst, to produce
electricity that powers electric drive motors. The only waste
products are heat and distilled water that dribbles from a tailpipe.</TE>
<TE>   Most in the auto industry and the environmental movement see fuel
cells as the emissions-free power plant of the future, but widespread
use is a decade or more away. It is dependent not only on perfecting
fuel-cell technology for everyday automotive use, but also on
developing a nationwide system of producing and delivering hydrogen
to individual motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Studies suggest that to build a fuel-cell system to rival the
present gasoline delivery system could cost $400 billion or more.</TE>
<TE>   Christ as consumer</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of evangelical religious groups concerned about the
effects of air pollution and oil consumption have launched a campaign
-- "What Would Jesus Drive?" -- aimed at persuading people to reject
large trucks and SUVs and embrace smaller, more environmentally
friendly passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   The Evangelical Environmental Network's initiative is part of a
broader effort by the Interfaith Climate and Energy Campaign to push
for changes in fuel economy standards.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups organized meetings in Detroit last week with
representatives of General Motors Corp. and, at Ford Motor Co., with
the man himself, William Clay Ford Jr., as well as other Ford
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Their message: Automakers need to do more, voluntarily, to improve
fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "You make it, we'll buy it," said Doug Grace, director of the
Interfaith campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The religious leaders asked Chrysler Group officials to meet with
them as well, but Chrysler environmental affairs spokeswoman Kathy
Graham said there apparently was a mix-up in communications. The
company doesn't have any record of a request, she said. "We weren't
even aware they were coming" to the Detroit area.</TE>

<HD>GM recall to check steering assembly</HD>
<DH>Ford also will call back some of its 2000-01 Focus cars on
concerns about suspension bolts and engine fires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. is recalling about 1.5 million 1996-'98 minivans
and mid-size and small cars in the U.S. and Canada to repair a
bearing in the power steering gear assembly, and Ford Motor Co. said
this month that it would recall 572,795 of its compact Focus cars
from the 2000 and 2001 model years because of potential safety
problems such as engine fires.</LD>
<LD>   GM's problems stem from a potentially faulty bearing in the power
steering gear assembly on 1996-'98 Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac
Sunfire cars and Chevrolet Lumina and Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette
and Pontiac Transport minivans, and 1997-'98 Pontiac Grand Prix cars.</LD>
<LD>   If the bearing fails, it can cause loss of power assist during
left turns and, in some cases, unintended steering input to the right
following a left turn. GM said 15 crashes and three injuries have
been reported that may be related to the bearing.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it would begin notifying owners in January,
requesting that they bring recalled vehicles to a local dealer for
installation of a new bearing or, if necessary, replacement of the
steering gear assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said its Focus recall involves two separate problems.</TE>
<TE>   One involves a front suspension bolt that can become loose and
cause noise and vibration or lead to separation of the ball joint.
The other involves vehicles with Zetec engines in which the placement
of a battery cable could result in smoke, melting wire or under-hood
fires.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman said there had been no reports of injuries
stemming from either of the potential defects in the recalled
vehicles, but two accidents are alleged to have been caused by loose
or missing front suspension bolts.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also said it was extending a service program on 2000-2001
Focus vehicles in North America because of concerns about a
rear-wheel-bearing seal.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier service program because of the problem involved vehicle
owners in 21 states. But Ford said North American customers outside
those original areas, including owners in Canada, now will be
encouraged to bring their cars into dealerships to have the seal
replaced.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another November recall, Subaru of America Inc. said it was
recalling 163,243 vehicles because a transmission flaw can cause them
to slip out of park.</TE>
<TE>   The recall includes some 2001 Legacy models; some 2003 Baja
models; and all 2002 and some 2003 Legacy, Outback, Forester and
Impreza vehicles. All have automatic transmissions. No injuries or
accidents have been reported as a result of the problem, Subaru said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it believed that only about 1% of the vehicles in
the recall were affected. Customers will be sent letters explaining
the problem, and repair parts are expected to be available by
January, the company said. Meanwhile, setting the parking brake can
prevent the vehicles from rolling if there is a defect.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on engines</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday
that it had elevated a preliminary investigation into the Focus
engine problem to an "engineering analysis," a step that often
precedes a recall.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said Ford had received 3,274 complaints about the Focus
engine problem and added that the stalling allegedly had caused 16
crashes and three injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The data analysis conducted during the PE [preliminary
evaluation] indicates the Focus will stall at all speeds without
notice," the federal agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was originally thought to involve about 573,585
Focuses from the 2000 and 2001 model years, but NHTSA said it was
broadening the scope of its investigation because of complaints about
2002 models.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said it also had upgraded an investigation into thousands of
complaints about engines stalling without warning on Ford's Escape
compact SUV and the Tribute SUV sold by Ford's Mazda subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints involve vehicles from the 2001 and 2002 model
years, NHTSA said.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the litany of vehicle safety and quality issues at Ford,
NHTSA said it also had opened an engineering analysis into complaints
of engine compartment fires stemming from alleged defects in a speed
control deactivation switch on several full-size Ford sedans.</TE>
<TE>   About 1.8 million Town Car, Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis
sedans from the 1992-97 model years were the target of that
investigation, NHTSA said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal recall reminder</TE>
<TE>   The federal highway safety agency issued its monthly recall
reminder list to provide a second notice to vehicle owners who might
have missed initial announcements about recalls that would affect
them. The reminders cover recalls originally issued in September.</TE>
<TE>   Daewoo Motor: The South Korean automaker is recalling 38,181
Nubira cars from the 2000 to 2002 model years for replacement of
potentially faulty front brake hoses that can crack and rupture,
resulting in loss of braking power.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors: Nearly 559,000 Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Tahoe
and GMC Yukon and Denali SUVs sold as 2000 to 2002 models and built
from September 1999 to February 2002 have been recalled because of
complaints of finger injuries to drivers and passengers while folding
down the second-row seats. Dealers are to install protective covers
over pinch points.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan North America: The company is recalling 18,300 of its 2003
Infiniti G35 models built from January to July to inspect and
properly reattach a potentially loose fuel pump hose.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen of America: 10,450 Passat sedans sold as 1996 models
and built from August to December 1995 are being recalled because of
a potentially faulty connection that can cause headlights and
windshield wipers to fail. Dealers will replace the electrical part
of the ignition switch assembly.</TE>

<LD>Chevrolet's upcoming SSR roadster-pickup will be a two-seater with a
5.3-liter V-8 engine, not a three-seater with a 6.0-liter V-8 as
reported in the Showroom column in last week's Highway 1 (Nov. 20).
The larger engine and extra seat were part of the SSR concept
package, but specifications for the hot-rod-styled SSR have changed,
Chevrolet said.</LD>

<KH>THE CALIFORNIA COOK</KH>
<HD>Here's reason enough to celebrate</HD>
<DH>This holiday season you won't find perfection wrapped in
shiny foil and ribbon, but rather encased in the hard shell of the
Dungeness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT my house we celebrate four major holidays at this time of year:
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's and the opening of Dungeness crab
season. I am willing to concede the possibility that God has made a
more perfect food, but I haven't come across it yet.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a typical Dungeness Day menu: Crab. White wine. Maybe a
green salad afterward and, if we're feeling particularly indulgent,
something like a lemon curd tart to finish.</LD>
<LD>   But none of those other things is necessary. Cold cracked crab by
itself, as much as you can eat, is extravagance defined.</LD>
<TE>   Dungeness crabs are big (they're weighed in pounds rather than
ounces) and generous (about 25% edible flesh as opposed to 15% in
more meager crabs). And the meat comes away in large, buttery flakes
that practically melt in your mouth, with a sweet flavor balanced by
just a tinge of what wine writers might call "minerality" -- a
slightly pointed savory undertone like something you might find in a
great white Burgundy.</TE>
<TE>   In every area where crabs grow, people seem to regard their local
product as a special treat. I know I have argued the superiority of
Dungeness crab from the Chesapeake Bay to the Adriatic Sea. Never
once has anyone succeeded in convincing me I'm wrong (though there
was that simple dish of cold crab meat dressed with just a whisper of
really good olive oil that I had one hot summer night in Venice that
came close).</TE>
<TE>   Dungeness crabs are primarily a winter treat, at least in the
Lower 48. Traditionally the California harvest begins just before
Thanksgiving from Avila Beach, near San Luis Obispo, to San Francisco
and gradually progresses north from there. About 80% of the
California catch is taken in December and January. Oregon usually
starts around the first of December and Washington follows not long
after. In British Columbia, the Dungeness harvest doesn't start until
April and in Alaska, it's a summer crab.</TE>
<TE>   The Dungeness fishery is considered a model of sustainability.
Only male crabs are taken and only when they are at least 6 1/4
inches across the carapace, meaning they are at least 4 years old and
already have been sexually active for a couple of years (this is
California after all).</TE>
<TE>   Still, the harvest is cyclical, fluctuating for reasons that
marine biologists do not completely understand. California had one of
the biggest in its history in 1995-96, but since then the catch has
been in a steady decline, though predictions for this year are
better.</TE>
<TE>   A short leap to the plate</TE>
<TE>   Most crabs are cooked immediately upon being unloaded from the
boats. Only a small percentage is sold alive. These can be found in
aquarium tanks in upscale groceries and Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much that's simpler than fixing a crab (almost
literally, just add water). I've found the best cooking time to be
about 15 minutes from the moment the water reaches a boil. Many cooks
recommend 20 minutes. I'd err on the long side.</TE>
<TE>   You can overcook a crab -- the meat loses some of its sweetness
and turns slightly grainy -- but that is infinitely preferable to
undercooking it, which gives it a bitter edge and a slimy texture.</TE>
<TE>   Live crab isn't always better than precooked, though it is almost
always cheaper. Early last week I bought two crabs, one live from my
local Filipino fish market, the other already cooked from an upscale
grocery.</TE>
<TE>   Once they were cold and cracked, it was pretty hard to tell the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   This is probably at least in part because the live crab I bought
was less than stellar -- it was one of only two left in the tank and
was pretty light.</TE>
<TE>   And here's a hint: Shopping early in the week probably is a bad
idea since the markets haven't had time to restock after the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Though the crabs were of roughly similar quality, there was no
mistaking the difference in price.</TE>
<TE>   The already cooked one was almost exactly twice as expensive
($9.99 a pound versus $4.99). On the other hand, it was more
convenient.</TE>
<TE>   If you're planning a quick feast for two, precooked is probably
not a bad way to go. The fish guy at my grocery had some good advice
about picking cooked crabs -- they should be heavy and if you have
any question, have the store crack the shell for you.</TE>
<TE>   The "butter" inside should be smooth and hold together. Of course,
it should smell fresh. And always ask whether they were shipped fresh
or frozen; the latter is to be avoided whatever the cost.</TE>
<TE>   In general, a crab will serve four as an appetizer or two as a
main course. Only gluttons will eat a whole crab by themselves. But
that's exactly what we do on our annual Dungeness Day celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   An intimate feast</TE>
<TE>   As opposed to the other winter holidays, which are all about
hospitality and friends, these crab suppers are for immediate family
only.</TE>
<TE>   There's something primal about tearing into a platter of crab.</TE>
<TE>   You crack the pieces open with your hands and use your fingers to
peel out the meat.</TE>
<TE>   It's so good that even if there's a bare scrap left in the shell,
you'll do anything you can to get to it.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of bites, your hands and face are sticky and you
just can't help smiling.</TE>
<TE>   With the crab, serve the biggest, oakiest, most Californian
Chardonnay you can find. There aren't many foods these wines will go
with, but that butter-and-toast style is a perfect match for
Dungeness.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure whether it's the crab or the wine, or probably a
combination of both, but almost inevitably conversation at the table
turns important -- not the casual chitchat of the holidays, but how
we really feel about things, what we remember about the last year and
what we hope for the next.</TE>
<TE>   Can there be a better meal than that? Well, maybe. Last year I got
the bright idea of taking some of the butter and innards from the
crab (the equivalent of a lobster's tomalley), straining out the hard
bits, beating it with mayonnaise, spooning it onto slices of bread
and baking it in a hot oven until the bread crisps and the topping
browns and puffs.</TE>
<TE>   These toasts are rich and intensely crabby.</TE>
<TE>   I won't claim they're better than the Dungeness itself.</TE>
<TE>   But even if you can't improve on perfection, every once in a while
you can give it a twist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cold cracked Dungeness crab with crab toasts</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   1 (2- to 2 1/2-pound) live Dungeness crab</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons tarragon vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 baguette, sliced very thin</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the crab in a large pot and cover with water. Place the
pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes. Drain
the crab and rinse under cold running water. Refrigerate until almost
ready to serve, about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   2. About 30 minutes before serving, heat the oven to 350 degrees
and remove the crab from the refrigerator. Pull off the legs and
claws. Crack the large sections of each using the back of a heavy
knife or a nutcracker. Arrange on a platter. Lift off the top shell.
Using a small spoon, scoop out all of the golden butter and any ivory
fat. Set these aside in a small bowl. With your fingers, pull away
the slender, finger-like gills and discard them. Also pull away the
thin, hard jaws from the front of the crab and the fat "spade" from
the bottom. Using a heavy chef's knife, cut the body in half
lengthwise, then in half again crosswise, cutting through the leg
joints to expose as much meat as possible. Add these to the platter.</TE>
<TE>   3. Spoon the crab butter and the fat into a strainer and using the
back of a wooden spoon or a plastic spatula, press them through the
strainer into another bowl. (Be sure to scrape the bottom of the
strainer; much of the crab butter collects there.) You should get
about one-quarter cup of strained crab butter. Add the mayonnaise,
vinegar and salt and whisk until smooth. The mixture should be about
the consistency of stirred yogurt. Taste the mixture; it should be
intensely crabby and slightly sharp. If necessary, squeeze in a
little lemon juice. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and
spoon 2 to 3 teaspoons of this crab mixture onto the center of each
baguette slice. Bake until the crab mixture is puffed and golden and
the edges of the baguette are beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Arrange these crab toasts on the platter around the crab pieces
or on a separate platter. Careful, they're hot. Serve immediately.</TE>

<HD>The holiday where oil is the star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Roden</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WHEN Hanukkah begins Friday night, all around the world Jews will be
preparing dishes that represent the holiday perfectly. The Ashkenazim
will be frying potato latkes. In Israel they'll be making sufganiyot,
the little jam-filled doughnuts. Italian Jews will deep-fry pieces of
chicken dipped in batter. The Sephardim will eat fritters in syrup,
which are variously called zalabia, bimwellos, loukoumades, sfenj or
yoyos.</LD>
<LD>   It's all about the oil, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Each dish is a way of commemorating the miracle of the oil that
was enough to burn only for one day but instead burned for eight as
the Jews set about restoring the temple at Jerusalem in a time of war
more than 2,000 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   In Egypt, where I grew up, it was the zalabia that reigned at
Hanukkah, and the fritters soaked in a sweet, perfumed syrup are
still close to my heart, because they are a reminder of my parents,
my brothers and grandparents, my cousins, uncles and aunts and of our
home in Cairo. We could buy zalabia from street vendors year-round,
but at Hanukkah they took on a symbolic significance and Awad, our
cook, made masses of them, enough to serve all the visitors who
called to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years I've learned to make and to love all of those other
fried holiday dishes too. This is all simple food, representing very
old traditions, not the gourmet creations of chefs who add trimmings
for the sake of originality. And I think these dishes are all the
more delicious for it.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest, of course, is the potato latke, the golden pancake
made with just eggs and grated potatoes squeezed dry of their starchy
juices. They should be made just before eating, so they are crisp on
the outside and soft inside. Many versions add ingredients such as
onion and garlic, but I prefer the original basic dish, with the pure
taste of potato.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the pollo fritto, the Tuscan dish of tender, juicy
chicken, pieces is sharpened with a simple lemon marinade and then
rolled in flour and beaten egg. The scrumptious apple latkes, made
with fruit macerated in brandy, are dipped in an ever so light
batter.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, there are the zalabia.</TE>
<TE>   Some years ago, I was experimenting with the zalabia recipe in
London when my grandson, then 7, happened to call. The following day
Cesar came home from school with a drawing representing me, very tiny
in the middle of a huge page, surrounded by bowls filled with little
balls -- on the kitchen table, on the dresser, on the floor,
everywhere. I had made so many batches while trying out different
proportions of flour and water in order to get them to come out
perfectly round, which they never did.</TE>
<TE>   And really, the shape didn't matter. They were incredibly light
and puffy, and gorged in aromatic syrup. They were, in the end,
another miracle, the culinary triumph of hot oil.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicken pieces fried in batter (pollo fritto)</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 20 minutes, plus 1 hour standing</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 2-4</TE>
<TE>   1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, about 1/2 pound</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Flour</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, lightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   Canola oil, for frying</TE>
<TE>   1. Cut the chicken into 2-inch pieces. Marinate for 1 hour in the
lemon juice and a little salt and pepper. Roll the pieces in flour,
then in the beaten egg (prepare a soup plate of each, and the chicken
pieces can all be in at the same time).</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat 1 inch of oil in a heavy pot to 350 degrees. Deep-fry the
chicken until golden, about 3 minutes. If the oil is too hot, the
batter will burn before the chicken is done. If you want to make a
large quantity, you may reheat the chicken in the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Each of 4 servings: 262 calories; 131 mg. sodium; 100 mg.
cholesterol; 17 grams fat; 2 grams saturated fat; 6 grams
carbohydrates; 20 grams protein; 0.24 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation: The Tunisian "Livornese" version -- poulet en beignets
-- is a chicken cut in small pieces marinated 1 hour in a mixture of
3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon, 2
crushed garlic cloves, 3 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley,
salt and pepper, then dipped in a batter made with 1/3 cup flour
beaten with 1 egg and a little water -- just enough to obtain a light
cream -- plus salt and pepper. Deep-fry about 3 minutes in oil heated
to 350 degrees, and serve with lemon quarters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apple latkes</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes, plus 1 hour standing</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: This is a specialty of Hanukkah. Of several fritters that I
have tried, this one is the most scrumptious, because the apples are
macerated in brandy, which gives them a most wonderful flavor, and
the batter is very light. You can also use beer or milk instead of
water for the batter.</TE>
<TE>   4 tart or sweet apples</TE>
<TE>   2-3 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons brandy, dark rum or fruit liqueur</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, separated</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons canola oil</TE>
<TE>   A good pinch of salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   Vegetable oil for frying, preferably sunflower</TE>
<TE>   Superfine sugar, for sprinkling</TE>
<TE>   1. Core and peel the apples and cut each into 4 thick slices.
Place them in a shallow dish with the sugar and brandy, rum or
liqueur, and turn them so that they are well coated. Leave for at
least 1 hour, turning the slices over occasionally so that they
absorb the spirit.</TE>
<TE>   2. For the batter, beat the yolks with the oil and salt, then stir
in the flour and mix well. Now beat in the water gradually and
vigorously, squashing any lumps. The batter will be thick and sticky.
Let stand for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   3. Beat the egg whites until stiff, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold
one-fourth of the egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest
of the whites.</TE>
<TE>   4. Heat at least 3/4 inch of oil in a large frying pan to 375
degrees. Pat dry the apple slices (so the batter will stick to them).
Dip the slices in the batter -- about 5 at a time -- making sure they
are well covered. Lift each one out carefully and lower it into the
hot oil. The oil must be sizzling but not too hot, or the fritters
will brown before the apple is soft inside.</TE>
<TE>   5. Fry in batches, and turn the slices over to brown both sides,
about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes a side. Lift out the slices with a slotted
spatula and drain on paper towels before serving. Pass the superfine
sugar for everyone to sprinkle on.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fritters in syrup (zalabia)</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours, plus 2 hours standing</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 16-18 servings (96 fritters)</TE>
<TE>   Sugar syrup</TE>
<TE>   5 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1/2 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon rose or orange blossom water</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the sugar, water and lemon juice in a saucepan and simmer
until it is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 15 minutes. Add the
rose or orange blossom water and simmer a few seconds longer, then
remove from the heat and let come to room temperature. Cover while
you make the fritters.</TE>
<TE>   Batter</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons active dry yeast</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup hot water (120-130 degrees), plus 2 1/2 cups warm water,
divided</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for frying</TE>
<TE>   1. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the half cup of hot water and
let stand until it froths, 10 to 15 minutes. Place the flour in a
large bowl, mix in the yeast liquid and the salt, then gradually stir
in the remaining 2 1/2 cups water and beat vigorously on medium-high
speed with an electric mixer until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes. Cover with a dish towel and leave to rise in a warm place
for 1 hour, then beat the batter another 10 minutes, and let it rise
again for 30 minutes. Beat the batter again for 10 minutes, then let
it rest a final time for 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Make the fritters in batches, using 2 skillets at once, if you
prefer, to speed up the frying: Fill a deep, nonstick skillet a
little more than half full with oil and heat to 375 degrees. Drop
little balls of batter by the tablespoon into the oil; you may find
it easiest if you dip the spoon in oil first, then fill it with
batter using another spoon so that the batter rolls off easily. Wipe
the spoon with a damp paper towel after making each ball. Fry the
balls, turning them with a slotted spoon to brown them all over,
until crisp, golden and puffed, about 7 minutes. Do not crowd the
skillet; 6 at a time is a good number. The batter is light and
produces irregular, rather than perfectly round, shapes. If the oil
is not hot enough to begin with, the batter tends to flatten out.</TE>
<TE>   3. Lift the fritters out with a slotted spoon, drain on paper
towels and dip them in the cold syrup for a few seconds (if you
prefer, you may leave them longer to soak up syrup). Set them on a
wire rack with wax paper underneath to drain. They are at their best
hot but are also good cold.</TE>

grams fat; 0 saturated fat; 22 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein;
0.70 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation: Instead of dipping the fritters in a sugar syrup, pour
a honey syrup over them; make it by heating honey with about half its
volume of water. You can also sprinkle the fritters instead with
powdered sugar and cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Potato latkes</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: You may add pepper, chopped parsley and finely chopped onion
to the egg and potato mixture.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds potatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for frying</TE>
<TE>   1. Peel and finely grate the potatoes. Put them straight into cold
water, then drain and squeeze them as dry as you can by pressing them
with your hands in a colander. This is to remove the starchy liquid,
which could make the latkes soggy.</TE>
<TE>   2. Beat the eggs lightly with salt to taste, add to the potatoes
and stir well. Film the bottom of a skillet with oil and heat over
medium heat. Take serving-spoonfuls or as much as one-fourth cup of
the mixture and drop into the hot oil. Flatten a little and lower the
heat so that the latkes cook through evenly. When one side is brown,
turn over and brown the other. Lift out and serve very hot.</TE>

grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 27 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams

<HD>The best of two seasons in one</HD>
<DH>Warm weather gives Thanksgiving cooks their pick of fall
and a late-summer bounty.</DH>

<LD>SOUTHERN California's unseasonably hot fall has proved a godsend to
Thanksgiving cooks, who can gather armfuls of squashes, yams and
cool-weather greens that tradition demands yet still garnish their
dishes with late-summer raspberries and tomatoes.</LD>
<LD>   Harvested before the recent rains, the last of the summer grapes
and plums are piled high at the Santa Monica farmers market on
Arizona Avenue, along with an astonishing variety of tomatoes,
haricots verts and figs. Baby artichokes, baby squashes and corn that
will vanish after Thanksgiving are spilling off of the tables.</LD>
<LD>   "The weather has really been in our corner -- all of this sun,"
said Kerry Clasby, who shops a variety of farmers markets for a group
of Los Angeles chefs. "I picked up a lot of arugula, white radicchio,
cavalo nero, ... mesclun, all of the great Italian greens. And Tutti
Frutti still has great heirloom tomatoes."</LD>
<TE>   Today's farmers markets will team with eager cooks, said Stephen
Vodantis, coordinator of the Santa Monica market. About 15,000
shoppers -- 30% more than the usual Wednesday crowd in Santa Monica
-- are expected to check out the produce of nearly 100 farmers.
Farmers will sell as much as $100,000 worth of produce, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brilliant orange Fuyu and Hachiya persimmons are everywhere for as
little as $1 a pound. Laura Ramirez, owner of ALJ Ranch in Bryn Mawr,
has customers clamoring for her ripest Hachiyas to make persimmon
pudding garnished with pomegranate seeds. An astringent fruit,
persimmons can be intimidating, she said: "The Persians and the
Lebanese know how to eat them. The Asians come by the busload to our
ranch to buy them."</TE>
<TE>   James Birch plans to greet the rush of culinary treasure hunters
with a special treat: the fruit from the 100-year-old chocolate
persimmon tree on his farm near Sequoia National Park. Boasting that
his fruit, when it's gushy ripe, tastes like chocolate liqueur, Birch
said that even at $6 a pound, "I'll sell every one." He may put a few
aside for Suzanne Goin, the executive chef at Lucques in West
Hollywood, who featured the Flora Bella Farm's small dark gems last
year on a Sunday supper menu.</TE>
<TE>   The little potatoes, including the nutty-flavored La Rattes and
fingerlings, cipollini onions, spaghetti squashes along with
delicata, hearts of gold and red kuri squash are all readily
available.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few brave cooks will tackle the 15-pound New Zealand blue
squash at Windrose Farm's booth. These hefty rounds with ulcerated
gray-blue skin have a dense meat that makes a creamy puree. "It's a
complex flavor, full-bodied," said Barbara Spencer, whose Paso Robles
farm specializes in a wide variety of squash.</TE>
<TE>   Her prize squash, however, is the more manageable butternut for
soup. "This is the time for squash -- there's 200 times as much
demand around Thanksgiving," she said, noting that butternuts are
available by the bushel.</TE>
<TE>   Sweet potatoes -- jewels, garnets and Japanese -- are everywhere
in the market. So are apples -- Fujis, heirlooms and sweet, tiny crab
apples. And the citrus is now fully available, including Satsuma
tangerines, pummelos, Meyer lemons, grapefruits and oranges. The
kiwis are just arriving.</TE>
<TE>   Clasby weighed a softball-sized quince in her hand then placed it
back in a flat full of the yellow-skinned fruit. "A few more," she
told Cheng Blain, the grower from Lake Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing like quince to garnish game or foie gras, said
Yvon Goetz, the chef at the main dining room of the Ritz-Carlton in
Laguna Niguel, and a client of Clasby's. "I think I'll make a
chutney, a little honey, a little butter."</TE>
<TE>   "This will be it for the quince," Clasby said, noting that next
week's pickings will be slim.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no. We have more," Blain said with a wink and a sly smile.</TE>

<HD>The trick to light fritters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Deane</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fritters in syrup disappear from plates quite easily; they're
delicious. But getting them just right -- so that they're slightly
puffy and crisp on the outside with soft, chewy centers -- takes a
little practice.</LD>
<LD>   The secret to a truly puffy fritter, we found, is in the beating
and resting of the batter. It's important to follow the beating and
resting directions to the letter, otherwise you may wind up with
flat, crunchy fritters, as we did more than once in the Times Test
Kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   The batter is beaten the first time for 10 minutes, then rests for
an hour. Two more 10-minute beatings follow, but the resting time
after each is reduced to 30 minutes. When we tried only two beatings
with two one-hour rests, our fritters were flat. That third beating
and third rest made all the difference.</LD>
<TE>   We picked up a few other tips during our testing: Use a large
nonstick skillet and fill it a little more than half full with oil.
To speed up the frying, use two skillets at once. It's also important
to maintain the temperature of the oil (375 degrees). Be sure to turn
the fritters during frying so that they brown evenly.</TE>
<TE>   As they fry, they'll puff up with little holes all over the
surface: a sure sign of success.</TE>

<HD>How we stack up</HD>
<DH>Wander down the china aisle or search the depths of your
cupboards, and you may find more than plates. You might discover
yourself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HAD I played my cards right, I could have inherited the full china
collections of both my grandmothers and my mother. I was an only
granddaughter and only daughter. Tradition dictated that I got all
the plates from both sides of the family. At three services per lady,
this amounted to something like 540 plates, not including formidable
stacks of kidney-shaped side dishes.</LD>
<LD>   There were the intensely floral Minton plates, metal-banded Lenox
ones and, as one grandmother grew older, a certain number of Franklin
Mint commemorative plates. There was porcelain, bone china,
stoneware, plastic. There were English plates, French plates,
American plates, Mexican plates, Victorian plates, mid-century Modern
plates, plates with flowers on them, birds, Christmas trees, scenes
of Yale University campus. There was even a plate edged with faded
pink flowers that looked European, but whose under-stamp read, "Made
in Occupied Japan."</LD>
<LD>   All I had to do to be eligible for all these plates was to get
married in a manner befitting them.</LD>
<TE>   I eloped. My husband and I went to the Conran Shop and bought the
most minimalist white porcelain we could find. It was the early
1980s, and we were rebels, we thought. Individualists! Only now is it
obvious to me that we were no such thing. Rather, we were so
predictable that the ceramics industry could easily have given us a
number, say the B-2s or C-4s.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, for example, my cold white plate told buyers that I was
artsy and educated, but lacking the great wads of cash driving the
bridal trade. They knew that I was interested in the plate as canvas,
that I thought about the color of food and probably was trying the
fashionable dishes of the day: carrot soup with cilantro, chicken
with mango, avocado salad with strawberries and black pepper. So
'80s! Alas, so me.</TE>
<TE>   When my husband and I split at the end of that food-mad decade, I
became another kind of plate shopper. Confused. I experimented with a
modern British clay plate with a white glaze sprayed with blue
speckles, a pattern called Vogue. I liked it long enough to get the
set home, but Vogue, I soon realized, was my rebound pattern. It went
under house plants, and whoops, smash, got dropped a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the next choice was my mother's. She had been so irate
at my secret wedding, after each of my grandmothers died, she gave
away most of my great big plate dowry to my brothers. When she died
in 1995, there was only one full set left: hers -- cream-colored
porcelain, gold edged, bearing a wheat sheaf motif at the center.
Very 1950s, very good taste, very mother. She always regarded them as
an antidote to my grandmothers' stacks of pseudo-Sino-Anglo gaud.</TE>
<TE>   I used the wheat sheaf ones for about four years before realizing
that although I had more plates than I needed, I still needed plates.
I'd open my cupboard and the white plates reminded me of a divorce,
the speckled ones of a regrettable impulse and the formal ones of a
dead mother. Yeesh!</TE>
<TE>   The minute I realized why I wanted new crockery, I realized what I
wanted the new plates to do: to be cheery and luscious, nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   Stacks of subtext</TE>
<TE>   The search was on but was unexpectedly exhausting, like a sudden
case of multiple-personality disorder. Every weekend I'd go to a new
kitchenware shop, credit card in pocket. At Crate &amp; Barrel, there
were octagonal stoneware plates, ideal for immaculate bachelors who
serve artful rolls of sushi. There were Mediterranean plates with
tomato and olive motifs. All wonderful for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   At Sur la Table and Williams-Sonoma there were the infinitely
tasteful French variations on white porcelain, which I would have
chosen if I didn't already have my divorce white.</TE>
<TE>   At Williams-Sonoma, I lingered longingly over the Wedgwood
transferware, named Highgrove after Prince Charles' country pile.
I've always wanted plates like these, or thought I did, and a country
house to go with them. But as I stood there holding a sample,
marveling that they were now dishwasher safe, it was irrefutable: I
wasn't Camilla Parker Bowles, and never would be.</TE>
<TE>   At Macy's, there was plenty of gilded bridal stuff, the fine
china. Impressively this is all now dishwasher- and microwave-safe.
But I'm a kitchen table type, so I made my way to the kitchenware
section. Here was distinctly smart stoneware in a mid-century Modern
style, effortlessly chic, perfect for a graphic designer in a studio
apartment. This is also the place to find the American classic Fiesta
ware. Oh, yes! I love these plates! But basking in their sunny flair,
I suddenly realized they were every bit as wrong for me as Highgrove.
The owner of Fiesta ware should have a bright retro kitchen with
Formica, stainless steel and cook burgers and eat Cheerios.</TE>
<TE>   I'd almost given up when I wandered into Pottery Barn one
Saturday. Bang! There were my plates: intensely colored discs in
dusky shades of scarlet, coral, moss green, smoky blue, much the same
colors as I'd painted the interior of my Craftsman house. The pattern
name was one of the less cloying the plate world has to offer:
Sausalito. The saturated colors were joyous, but not too bright or
too dull, too old or too young. They had large lips and contained
centers, perfect for holding sauce and heat. The dinner plates were
bigger than I like, the plate equivalent of big hair. But I bought
them on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   I rushed home and immediately reorganized my cupboards. The old
plates were respectfully shown to seldom-opened cupboards, "Taps" was
played, doors were shut. The new plates were set out in glorious
ranks. I found myself making frequent visits to that cupboard. Still
there, plates? Hello, plates!</TE>
<TE>   I bought them new table mats and napkins. I began cooking more.
I've given more dinner parties in the last three months than in the
last three years. I started seeing my plates everywhere, including
TV: There were my mugs on the only show I admit to watching, "This
Week," the Sunday morning political show with George Stephanopoulos.</TE>
<TE>   But even rejuvenated, plate-wise, I couldn't escape the feeling
that I had somehow bought an identity as surely as I had bought
plates. I suddenly wanted to know who was selling all these plates,
who had typecast us as plate buyers, and while I was at it, how they
classified me.</TE>
<TE>   To find out, I phoned designers, museum curators, historians and
plate buyers for leading stores. I learned that the plate industry
not only had my number, it has the number of just about everybody who
doesn't eat off the floor. For starters, before I even decided to
shop, the plate industry knew my gender. Plate buyers are female.
Women constitute more than 90% of the plate-buying market.
(Gentlemen, if you buy, think about or even wash plates, you are a
sociological blip.)</TE>
<TE>   We are also incorrigible romantics. It is no accident that
patterns have names that sound more like titles of Harlequin
romances, or, at the top of the market, Evelyn Waugh novels:
Patrician, Jewel, Centurion, Wellesley, Fitzhugh and Gloucester, The
Granville, Coupe Savoy and Royal College. Plate marketers correctly
surmised that these names sell more plates than more accurate
possibilities, such as Oh My God My Mother-in-Law Is Coming for the
Holidays. Or, Next Year I Swear We're Going to the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   From the historians, I learned that the dreamy, aspirational
quality is far from new. From the time the Staffordshire potter
Josiah Wedgwood got his first royal commission in the 1760s, he
immediately began marketing his dinnerware as pinky up. He named his
everyday cream-colored "Queensware." It became an instant emblem of
respectability and remained so enduring that Martha Stewart still
recommends the pattern.</TE>
<TE>   This preference for European plates is nothing new. Our ancestors
liked French flowers, Dutch windmills, English game birds, but not so
much turkeys and covered wagons. It has to be said that we lacked the
craftsmen. But as our potteries established themselves, frustrated
American porcelain makers were reduced to using pseudo-British
under-stamps to sell their wares at home.</TE>
<TE>   But by the 1870s, American potteries began playing the patriotism
card. Ohio potter Homer Laughlin created an under-stamp in which an
American Eagle attacked the English Lion. In 1918, New Jersey
porcelain works Lenox finally sold its first set to Woodrow Wilson's
White House. This West Wing taste in dinnerware remains current.
According to Macy's dinnerware buyer Karen Luehr, Lenox Federal
Platinum is the chain's most popular formal pattern.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, suffrage and Modernism brought colliding trends from
the East and West. Cool Modernism, the sort generally celebrated by
the Museum of Modern Art in New York, came from Europe while a wave
of vibrant, almost euphoric color flooded out of Southern California
potteries. These super-vibrant golds, blues and greens broke the
color barrier, argues Cleveland Museum of Art's Charles Venable in
his enormous book, "China and Glass in America: 1880-1980" (Dallas
Museum of Art, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   As Southern California paved the way for Fiesta ware and
irrepressible cheer in crockery, the formal market responded with a
torrent of novelty plates, starting with Spode's 1938 Christmas tree
plates. From that time on, says Venable, America had a plate for
every occasion: formal, Christmas, poker games, graduation, weekday
dinners.</TE>
<TE>   But the No. 1 occasion, and only authentically traditional one,
was marriage. In 1935, Marshall Field &amp; Co. opened the first formal
bridal registry for fine china. Lenox sponsored table-setting
contests in high schools. Girls as young as 12 began collecting
wedding china. Still, as the bridal business became more efficient,
behind the scenes, says Venable, choice plummeted. Plates were
standardized, patterns too. After World War II, Venable charts
Lenox's selection dropping suddenly from 400 patterns to 47.</TE>
<TE>   Is the postwar plate industry in crisis? Invariably, says Bonnie
Lilienfeld, the Smithsonian Institution specialist for ceramics in
the division for social history. If the plastics industry wasn't
raiding the plate market in the '50s, feminism was messing with the
bridal trade in the '70s. By the '90s, brides were as likely to
register for video recorders as china.</TE>
<TE>   A plate of one's own</TE>
<TE>   But not all social upheaval, it seems, is bad for the plate
industry. Divorced women like me are returning to china stores.
Industry has even given us and other single types a specific title:
"self-purchasers."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, we're experimenting, too. "This time, women are buying
what they want, not what their mothers wanted," Venable says. Across
the chains, buyers guess that self-purchasers account for the leading
selections in patterns and colors, while couples lead the white
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   This does not make couples boring. Greg Smith, director of
tabletop and entertaining retail merchandizing for Williams-Sonoma,
says white porcelain has plenty of personality. It can be
accessorized. He likens it to dressing well: "If you own a blue suit,
a gray suit and a black suit, you do a lot of things with shirts and
ties; the same thing happens with a white dinner plate."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Coviello, co-founder of the East Coast chain KitchenEtc, says
whatever the pattern, all of our plates are getting bigger, going
from 10 to 11 to even 12 inches, to the state they are practically
platters. "In the 1990s, oversize came in," he says. "There were big
plates, big silverware, oversize wine glasses." He reckons chefs
using all those big white plates in the 1980s restaurant boom to make
squiggly patterns with sauces was part of it. Then there's our
gluttony.</TE>
<TE>   What's the next big trend? The coming novelty plate, guesses Renee
Behnke of Sur la Table, will have flamingos on it. They were huge in
Paris recently. But our society is running so fast, says KitchenEtc's
Coviello, it's not clear where we are headed.</TE>
<TE>   It seems the only way I bucked my demographic was preferring
pottery over porcelain. I wanted the lustrous glaze that comes with
pottery, even if it means they are more likely to chip and break.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mind if they do. My nieces won't have to worry about
inheriting them.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: You once published the steak soup from the Pam Pam
Restaurant in San Francisco, which closed years ago. Could you
publish it again?</LD>

<TE>   Dear Kyle: Maybe you're not into leftovers. So here's a different
kind of soup, one that is very robust. Serve it to a crowd with some
good crusty bread, and you'll have a meal. The last time this recipe
ran was in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pam's easy steak soup</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 55 minutes</TE>

<LD>SQUASH is so beautiful and abundant this time of year, it seems a
shame to leave it off the Thanksgiving menu. So we created two easy
dishes using especially pretty varieties: the delicata, an oblong
golden squash with greenish stripes, and the sweet dumpling, a small
bulbous squash striped and speckled in green and white.</LD>
<LD>   Either dish can be partially made ahead. Fill the delicata halves,
cover them in plastic wrap and refrigerate four to six hours before
baking. Peel and slice the dumpling squash the day before, seal it in
a plastic bag and refrigerate until needed.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Winter squash gratin</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8 servings</TE>
<TE>   Note: From "Mustards Grill Napa Valley Cookbook" by Cindy Pawlcyn
with Brigid Callinan (Ten Speed Press, $39.95)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 sweet dumpling squashes, peeled, halved and thinly sliced (about
2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   2 cups thinly sliced red onions</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 cups chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 13-by-9-inch oval baking
dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Arrange the sliced squashes in
the dish; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2
tablespoons of butter and heat until melted. Add the onions and cook,
stirring occasionally, until soft and caramel-colored, 8 to 10
minutes. Season with the salt and pepper. Stir in the chicken broth.
Bring to a boil and pour over the squash.</TE>
<TE>   3. Cover and bake 15 minutes, then uncover and continue to bake
until the squash is tender, 30 minutes. Pour the whipping cream
evenly over the top and bake until the top begins to brown, another
15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the parsley before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Delicata squash and wild rice</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is from Mayi Brady of the Times Test Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   4 delicata squash (about 4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces pancetta, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 small onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cups cooked brown rice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup cooked wild rice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup toasted pine nuts</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup dried cranberries</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cut the squashes in half crosswise and scoop out the seeds.
Trim about one-fourth inch off the bottom of each so it will stand
up. Place cut side up on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper
to taste and dot with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Bake until very
tender, about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   3. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the pancetta and cook until browned and crisp, 5 minutes. Add the
onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes.
Add the brown rice, wild rice, pine nuts, dried cranberries, thyme
and lemon juice. Stir to combine. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   4. Remove the squash from the oven and carefully scoop out the
cooked squash; keep the shells intact. Chop the cooked squash and
stir into the rice. Adjust the salt and pepper. Spoon the rice into
the squash shells and set them on a baking sheet. Top each with a
small piece of the remaining butter. Bake until the rice is heated
through and the tops are slightly crisp, 30 to 40 minutes.</TE>

<DH>Napa may sneer at Francis Ford Coppola's show-biz style,
but his wines are winning high acclaim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>RUTHERFORD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Niebaum-Coppola Estate has two faces. Most people see the vulgar
show-biz facade that glorifies the Napa Valley estate's owner, film
director Francis Ford Coppola. Yet behind all the glamour and hype --
and the merchandise emporium selling "Godfather" souvenirs -- is one
of the world's finest wine estates.</LD>
<LD>   This is the most striking paradox in California wine. Coppola is a
shameless self-promoting businessman on one hand, on the other a
conscientious vintner who has painstakingly reconstructed one of
California's great 19th century wine estates.</LD>
<LD>   And this fall, the historic Niebaum winery produced wine from
Niebaum estate grapes for the first time in 36 years. This
achievement has a sweet taste indeed. The Rubicon and Cask Cabernet
Sauvignons, the old-vines Zinfandel, the rich Cabernet Franc -- each
showed ravishing perfume and deeply concentrated, vibrant flavors,
and the ineffable character of the vines that grow on the estate's
gentle slopes. The little one-room winery within the imposing chateau
seems far removed from the limousines, buses and tourist hordes with
their branded bags of Coppola merchandise.</LD>
<TE>   More than a century ago, Finnish sea captain Gustav Niebaum
retired from the Alaskan fur trade to the Napa Valley estate he
called Inglenook. He built a Bordeaux-style chateau containing a
jewel box of a winery that turned his Rutherford grapes into some of
the first Napa Valley wines to be internationally recognized.
Niebaum's 1887 Inglenooks were the first California wines to be
estate-bottled, rather than shipped in bulk.</TE>
<TE>   Niebaum's descendants maintained a high standard for Inglenook
"Cask" wines through the 1960s, when his grandnephew, John Daniel,
sold the estate to Heublein Inc. The sale was disastrous. Heublein
exploited the estate's reputation by ballooning production with
generic grapes brought in from outside Napa Valley, erecting an ugly
industrial winery to handle the volume.</TE>
<TE>   The final vintage for estate wines produced in the original
Niebaum winery was 1966. By the mid-1970s the lustrous Inglenook
name, once a symbol of California's highest potential, had become a
synonym for cheap jug wine.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola purchased Capt. Niebaum's house and part of the original
Niebaum vineyard from the Daniel family in 1975. He watched and
waited while Heublein was purchased by a series of increasingly
larger companies.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-'90s the Inglenook brand was virtually dead, and its
new corporate owners had lost sight of the estate's true value.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Coppola made them an offer they couldn't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   A big production</TE>
<TE>   That's where the paradox began. Coppola continued the large-volume
production, using Lodi and Central Coast grapes to produce more than
300,000 cases annually of inexpensive table wines bottled under the
Francis Coppola Presents label.</TE>
<TE>   And he went beyond simply restoring the original Niebaum Chateau
to create "a structure devoted as much to Hollywood as to Bordeaux,"
as writer James Conaway observed in "The Far Side of Eden."</TE>
<TE>   What true wine lover could pass up the chance to pay $85 for an
"Apocalypse Now" camp shirt (available only at the winery and its Web
site)? Actually, some might relish the irony of a historically
significant building housing a display of ersatz "artifacts" such as
actor Al Pacino's desk from "The Godfather," or the mint-condition
car from Coppola's lesser-known "Tucker."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, however, he quietly restored the integrity of the
original Niebaum estate. John Daniel's vineyard manager, Rafael
Rodriguez, continued to tend the vines by organic methods (the entire
estate was certified organic in 2000).</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s Coppola introduced a limited-production wine
called Rubicon, made from the estate's best vines and produced in a
makeshift winery in the old Niebaum stable.</TE>
<TE>   The first Rubicon vintages were disappointingly dense, coarse, and
tannic. They were shunned by critics and consumers alike.</TE>
<TE>   But Coppola persevered. He hired a prominent winemaking
consultant, Tony Soter, to upgrade the Rubicon program. And in 1991
he brought an untried young winemaker named Scott McLeod on board.</TE>
<TE>   McLeod has been calling the shots for several vintages now, and
the estate seems to fit his sensibility like a glove.</TE>
<TE>   The tourist-trap aspect doesn't bother him, he says: "That's on
the periphery of my job, which is producing a first-growth level wine
from this jewel of an estate. If there seems to be a disconnect
between the two sides, I think we just have to be realistic about the
fact that Napa Valley is a big tourist destination. It's America's
wine area."</TE>
<TE>   A maritime aesthetic</TE>
<TE>   Under McLeod, the Niebaum-Coppola estate wines -- Cabernet-based
Rubicon (3,000 cases, $100 a bottle), Cask (1,500 cases, $65 a
bottle) and Edizione Pennino Zinfandel (1,500 cases, $44 a bottle) --
have taken their place among the most consistently impressive Napa
Valley bottlings. The distinctive Cabernet clone in the estate's
vineyards was recently registered as UC Davis Clone 29.</TE>
<TE>   I tasted some of the new wines from the tanks with McLeod during
the harvest. Some were in mid-fermentation and still sweet, like
ambrosial syrup. The Rubicon Cabernet from the 35-year-old Garden
Block, which produces less than three tons per acre, tasted like
chewy violet candy.</TE>
<TE>   Others had already fermented to near-dryness and were ready to be
pressed, before going into small oak casks for aging. The old-vine
Zinfandel had a luscious aroma and flavor like sun-warmed berries
spiced with black pepper, and the Cabernet Franc made me think of a
black cherry liqueur.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt the winery reflects Capt. Niebaum's maritime aesthetic.
It's easy to imagine it inside an old-time sailing ship. The room is
a compact wooden box with lots of vaguely nautical-looking hardware,
some old and some brand-new.</TE>
<TE>   Cosseting the grape</TE>
<TE>   It was noted by early observers of the California wine industry.
"To insure a proper receptacle for the wines, Captain Niebaum erected
a cellar and winery, which was completed in 1887, and which, for
perfection of detail and elegant finish, has no equal in America,"
wrote Frona Eunice Wait in her 1889 book "Wines and Vines of
California." Wait went on to describe a winemaking regimen that is
remarkably similar to the one practiced by McLeod today.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Zinfandel grapes are
delivered to the winery from the surrounding vineyards in large
boxes. Their first stop is a stainless steel table where the bunches
are examined by workers who reject any fruit that looks underripe or
moldy.</TE>
<TE>   The crusher is gentle -- it barely breaks the grapes to let the
juice begin to flow and absorb color from the skins. As the bin
beneath the crusher fills with crushed grapes and juice, a forklift
(just a minor improvement on the 19th century block and tackle)
raises it and dumps the soupy must into one of the tall oak tanks
that line the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The wine is fermented in these wooden tanks the traditional way,
with indigenous yeasts.</TE>
<TE>   Once fermentation is underway, winemakers ascend to a wooden
catwalk where they deploy pneumatic equipment to punch down the cap
of skins and seeds and aerate the new wine that comes bubbling up
from the inky depths.</TE>
<TE>   The gleaming metal gadgetry looks futuristic, yet it's simply
bringing a mechanical advantage to tasks performed with muscle power
a century ago; "Captain Niebaum meets Captain Nemo," as McLeod puts
it.</TE>
<TE>   The reference to 19th century sci-fi writer Jules Verne is apt.
You might say McLeod is making wine in a time machine. The little gem
of a winery was considered state-of-the-art when it first produced
wine in 1887. Amazingly, behind some of the most garish commercialism
in the modern Napa Valley, it still is.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: JAMAICA</KH>
<HD>Carribean that's off the main drag</HD>
<DH>In Santa Monica, a detour for jerk chicken and meat
patties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Perry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, let's nutshell it: Owner of a car repair shop opens a Jamaican
restaurant. Now make that a repair shop for English sports cars, put
it in Santa Monica and you have Port Royal Cafe.</LD>
<LD>   To be more exact, Port Royal Cafe is in back-street Santa Monica.
It and the British Car Clinic next door are on a stretch of Broadway,
so quiet that one side of the street doesn't even have parking
meters.</LD>
<LD>   Because the neighborhood's empty in the evening, Port Royal
ostensibly closes at 6:30. In practice, it will stay open later if
you make a reservation, but pay no attention to the wildly
inoperative hours listed on a sign often set out on the sidewalk. The
place usually doesn't open for dinner at all on Saturdays.</LD>
<TE>   It consists of two tiny dining rooms decorated with prints of
Jamaica and reggae singers. If you turn right just before the back
dining room, a place of rough concrete walls painted pale pink and
off-white, you'll see a little takeout shop with a deli case for
snacks and desserts.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Radcliffe Reid has run the neighboring car clinic for 20
years. It was only in February that he took over this building and
opened it as a restaurant with his daughter, Zoe, who speaks with the
sort of English accent that makes Americans think of Gwyneth Paltrow,
rather than in a Jamaican sing-song. She's the one who decorated one
wall of the shop with panels from wine cases -- rather hip wines too,
making you think it's probably a shame the restaurant doesn't have a
wine license.</TE>
<TE>   A banner outside the place advertises patties, which are little
flat pies, roughly square and colored bright yellow with annatto,
that are related to the Cornish pasty and the Spanish empanada.
They're the sort of thing that Americans would call pockets and carry
as snacks if the pastry weren't so flaky and fragile. The main
fillings are simple ground beef or spicy curried chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Chicken dominates the menu, because Port Royal has the
understandable impression that Santa Monica is poultry-eating
country. The mildly spiced jerk chicken is basically just very good,
moist roast chicken (at least at lunch; by evening it sometimes seems
a little dried out). Occasionally there's a lively special of jerk
pork, also perfectly cooked but far spicier. They ought to put it on
the regular menu.</TE>
<TE>   The other chicken dishes are at least as good at the jerk. Brown
stew chicken has a rich brown gravy, and curry chicken uses a lively,
medium-hot curry powder, not heavy with fenugreek.</TE>
<TE>   Curry goat comes in a milder curry sauce, and it's very tender and
moist, not as gamy as some other goat curries around town. It's very
meaty, but the meatiest thing here is Negril oxtail. It comes in a
bit of rich brown gravy along with, oddly, a couple of lima beans.</TE>
<TE>   Fish isn't Port Royal's strong suit, though the hint of vinegar in
escoveitched fish makes red snapper less boring than usual. Fish Port
Royal style includes sprigs of fresh thyme, which raise it above the
usual dish of fish simmered in tomato sauce that you find everywhere
from Louisiana to Chile.</TE>
<TE>   There are a couple of simple, hearty soups and salads, and you can
get callaloo, a West Indian green like collards only milder, either
as a side dish or in the "vegetarian surprise" entree. On Fridays
Port Royal serves the dish Jamaicans are most homesick for, salt cod
stewed with ackee, a vegetable that tastes a bit like scrambled eggs.</TE>
<TE>   All entrees come with fried plantain, steamed vegetables (just
cabbage and carrots, but with a sweet, attractive flavor) and
"festival bread," a fried cornbread like a slightly sweet,
extra-crunchy hushpuppy. You have a choice of plain steamed rice or
rice and "peas" -- black beans, that is.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts are mostly familiar cakes: carrot, Black Forest, sock
it to me or fruit cake. Banana bread, bread pudding with rum sauce or
sweet potato pudding are also listed on the menu, but typically only
a handful of desserts are available at any given time, and there
usually aren't any at all on Mondays. Given a choice, I'd generally
go for the coconut meringue pie, very sweet and with a strong coconut
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Port Royal doesn't make much of the fact, but it has an espresso
machine. It offers a couple of American and Jamaican sodas, including
Kola Champagne (brass-yellow and ginger-flavored), Jamaican ginger
beer (clear and positively fierce with ginger) and Ting, a grapefruit
soda.</TE>
<TE>   It also makes some drinks, such as a pineapple drink with a
bright, aggressive note of ginger, and sorrel. Ironically, Jamaican
sorrel is better known in California as the Mexican drink jamaica,
pronounced "hah-MY-kah," as in Spanish. But in a nutshell: The
Jamaicans had it first.</TE>

<LD>SO is tomorrow Salmon Day?</LD>
<LD>   If turkey has always struck you as a rather dull fowl, you'll be
pleased to know that restaurants around the city are offering more
and more alternatives to the main course this Thanksgiving, from
steak to game, pasta dishes to vegetarian plates.</LD>
<LD>   But on every list, there is one dish as ubiquitous as the bird:
salmon.</LD>
<TE>   At Saddle Peak Lodge in Calabasas, the choices include turkey,
mesquite-grilled venison chop, butternut squash ravioli -- and wild
Scottish salmon, pan-seared and baked, served with a pumpkin-rock
shrimp hash. At Joe's in Venice, alongside turkey you'll find an
autumn vegetable plate -- and roasted Scottish salmon. Joe Miller
serves the fish on a Swiss chard, bacon and tomato compote, topped
with garlic cracklings. At Patina, the choices include turkey,
suckling pig, beef strip loin and, yet again, roast Atlantic salmon,
this time with beets, cranberries and pistachios.</TE>
<TE>   Joe's general manager Todd Barrie says, "Fish is really what the
pilgrims ate, and salmon, it's an easy choice. It's the most popular,
most recognizable fish around, as well as being a very versatile
fish."</TE>
<TE>   And really, when salmon is what we order so much of the time
anyway, why should Thanksgiving be any different?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the highest-purchased seafood in restaurants across the
United States," says Gerhard Tratter, general manager at Saddle Peak.
"It's familiar and completely approachable, people are looking for
simple, old-fashioned food on this particular holiday."</TE>
<TE>   For those who dine out on Thanksgiving, at least, the turkey's
long reign as king of the day may be coming to an end.</TE>

turkeys (there are only a few hundred in the country) he got directly

it and serving it with cider sauce. It's a chance to see whether this
now-expensive old-time breed is indeed superior. Today and Friday.</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>Napa's adopted chef</HD>
<DH>With his turbulent L.A. days far behind, Ken Frank finds
happiness in the wine country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KEN Frank -- onetime wunderkind, longtime enfant terrible of the Los
Angeles restaurant world -- is alive and well (very well, thank you)
in Napa Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Frank, as many of you may recall, was the chef/proprietor of La
Toque on Sunset Boulevard from 1979 to 1994 and, before that, he was
one of the opening chefs at Michael's restaurant in Santa Monica. A
brilliant saucier, he was -- like so many good chefs -- almost as
well-known for his temper as for his culinary skills. Indeed, he had
so many brutal battles with his bosses at various restaurants that I
always thought it appropriate that he made his first splash here at a
restaurant named La Guillotine.</LD>
<LD>   It was Frank, back in the '70s, who first introduced many here
(myself included) to rare duck breast, and it was Frank who stunned
the traditionalists among us back then with his all-garlic and
all-truffle menus -- each ending with ice cream (garlic ice cream?).
But Frank was simultaneously cocky and shy in those early years, and
it took both maturity and a move to Napa Valley, where people go to
restaurants to drink good wine and eat good food, not to see and be
seen, for him to find both happiness and success.</LD>
<TE>   Frank is 47 now, and his once rail-thin, 6-foot, 2-inch frame
carries 192 pounds -- 27 more than when he opened his Rutherford
restaurant four years ago and 74 pounds more than he weighed in 1981,
after a six-month bout with Guillain-Barre syndrome ravaged his
central nervous system and left him temporarily paralyzed "from the
eyebrows down," as he put it at the time.</TE>
<TE>   But Frank still has the skin-so-soft, choirboy face he had when he
burst onto the restaurant scene here in the mid-1970s. His blue eyes
still sparkle with energy and enthusiasm, and he still looks so young
that I was momentarily startled when he said over breakfast one
recent morning in Yountville, "This is my 30th year in the kitchen,
dating back to the first potato I peeled."</TE>
<TE>   Frank -- born in Whittier, raised in Pasadena -- started cooking
in restaurants in Los Angeles when he was 17, two years after
spending his sophomore year in high school in the 16th century walled
village of Yvoire on the banks of Lake Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   He fell in love with French food in Yvoire and worked there as a
dishwasher and kitchen apprentice before returning home, where he
quit college three months into his freshman year to work full time in
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   not .</TE>
<TE>   Frank worked in 18 restaurants in eight years here in the 1970s
and '80s -- leaving one after the other in disputes over money or
because of personality conflicts or because his high standards were
incompatible with the owner's limited budget and/or limited vision.</TE>
<TE>   Early in his career, Frank threatened to kill a waiter he caught
nibbling food from the plates the kitchen was sending to the dining
room; when the waiter replied, "I'll kill you first," Frank grabbed
the biggest knife he could find.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't use it, but the waiter's two brothers owned the
restaurant; unemployment soon beckoned anew.</TE>
<TE>   He's had no such problems in Rutherford, where he leases his
restaurant from the adjacent Rancho Caymus Inn. The restaurant is
also called La Toque, but that's where the comparisons end.</TE>
<TE>   Frank was something of a cult figure in Los Angeles in those years
-- widely praised by the critics, passionately admired by the
cognoscenti but largely ignored by the dining public. I first met him
in 1976, when, barely 21, he was cooking at La Guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   Rave reviews prompted the owner there to overbook and look for
shortcuts, at which point Frank stalked out. Every time I heard he
was cooking at a new restaurant, I'd make a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   In time, he returned to La Guillotine. Except that it was no
longer La Guillotine. It had a new name and a new owner.</TE>
<TE>   Frank bought the place and changed its name again, to La Toque.
But old debts, a kitchen fire, Frank's illness and continuing
financial difficulties ultimately led to Chapter 11 proceedings.
These problems -- plus Frank's cockiness -- kept him from traveling
and learning much about what other chefs were doing and how
contemporary cuisine was evolving. He didn't grow as much as his fans
expected, and, talented though he was, a certain sameness took hold
in his kitchen -- sure death in Los Angeles, the capital of "What's
new? What's different?"</TE>
<TE>   But in Rutherford, while Frank has not suddenly become humble, he
has lost some of his youthful arrogance, and he's clearly more eager
to learn and more able to travel -- and he's never been happier or
cooked better. It's no coincidence that what he calls "my favorite
new dish" -- nuggets of braised oxtail in a rich red wine sauce with
wild mushrooms and a layer of Parmigiano flan -- was inspired by a
recent trip to Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced, Frank remarried in June and his life in the wine country
is, he says, "very, very good."</TE>
<TE>   La Toque is open only five nights a week -- closed Monday and
Tuesday -- and it doesn't serve lunch. The restaurant has just 62
seats, and the menu is always a prix fixe, six-course tasting menu,
changing weekly. Basically, Frank cooks what he wants, when he wants.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked 100-hour weeks most of my life," he says. "I didn't want
that anymore, and I didn't want what I had to deal with in Los
Angeles -- people who came in and wanted everything their way ... a
meal of grilled vegetables, with no sauce and no dessert and maybe a
little diet soda."</TE>
<TE>   My most recent dinner at La Toque in Rutherford featured a
spectacular dish of panko-crusted frogs' legs, as well as Sonoma foie
gras with broiled Hamada Farms figs; North Sea turbot with braised
mushrooms and toasted leeks, and pan-roasted squab with port and
green peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   The food was superb. So were the wines -- a different one with
each course, paired by Frank and his sommelier, Scott Tracy, who
offer their optional pairings every night, adding $45 to the $85
menu.</TE>
<TE>   Frank has always enjoyed wine, but in Los Angeles, he never had
the money to buy much. In Rutherford, his wine list is 18 pages long.
Although it's far from the biggest -- or the best -- in Napa Valley,
it is infinitely better than what he had here.</TE>
<TE>   His list features many of the big names of Napa and Sonoma --
Harlan, Dalle Valley, Diamond Creek, Araujo, Peter Michael -- as well
as such French superstars as Jayer, Domaine de la Romanee-Conti,
Latour, Lafite, Chateau Rayas and Zind Humbrecht.</TE>
<TE>   "Scott and I taste wine together every Wednesday and Thursday from
anyone who wants to come by and try to sell us their wine," Frank
says.</TE>
<TE>   He laughs that familiar boyish laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it."</TE>

<KH>RESTAURANT REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Cape Cod, on the West Coast</HD>
<DH>Hans Rockenwagner's Ballona Fish Market has great allure
for seafood lovers. The busy menu could take a cue from the relaxed
setting, though.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EAST Coasters new to L.A. imagine heading toward the water and
falling upon countless seafood restaurants serving up Pacific fish
and shellfish. Instead of a West Coast version of Cape Cod, though,
they have to settle for Gladstone's or Ivy at the Shore. The truth
is, with the exception of Water Grill downtown, seafood restaurants
are not where you go for the best fish cooking around here. That is
found on the menus of top restaurants of any ilk. Period.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. isn't alone. But it's still odd that, at a time when more and
more people want to add fish to their diet for various reasons, we
have so few dedicated seafood restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   So when Hans Rockenwagner decided to close his Rockenwagner
spinoff in Marina del Rey, the globe-trotting Rock, and reconfigure
it as a fish house, it seemed like the right idea at the right time
and the right place, close to the ocean. With typical enthusiasm, the
hammer-wielding chef/owner designed the new incarnation and did much
of the physical work to transform Rock into Ballona Fish Market.</LD>
<TE>   He's tamed the unwieldy loft-like space by constructing a series
of whimsical facades inside the restaurant, turning Ballona into a
Cape Cod village by the sea. The faux fronts define a couple of
private dining rooms. One is topped with a New England weathervane;
another is shingled. Inside the third, an armoire and a wonderful
Ingo Maurer "chandelier" hung like a magical tree with scraps of
poetry and sayings give that room the feeling of a private house.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, Ballona Fish House is a much more comfortable place
than Rock was. Booths upholstered in leather or nautical blue and
white stripes are bathed in soft light cast from lampshades of thin
wood. Beach photos of family and friends hang on the walls. A tiny
child's sailor suit is framed under glass, and napkins are weighted
with pretty oyster shells. It feels like a well-loved local hangout,
which is quite an achievement, considering that Ballona is part of a
shopping mall. And the service is about as friendly and competent as
it gets in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Reasonably priced</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the idea of a neighborhood restaurant, Ballona's
menu is moderately priced, family-friendly. Good quality seafood is
expensive, yet Ballona's main courses all come in under $20 and the
portions are not small. They're even served on expensive china.</TE>
<TE>   However, when most people think of a fish house, they envision a
place to get a nice piece of fish simply prepared. "Simple," though,
is not part of this ebullient chef's vocabulary. An early adopter of
California cuisine, Rockenwagner is enthralled with fussy
presentation, and his enthusiastic piling-on of ingredients often
works against the enjoyment of the fish. And neither Rockenwagner nor
his chef at Ballona, Frank Springmann, seem to be able to give up the
idea of tall food. It's over, guys.</TE>
<TE>   Keep it simple</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea of a fish house is to serve the freshest possible
fish, simply prepared, so that what you're tasting has some
resemblance to the sea. Think Dover sole sauteed in butter, a whole
Dungeness crab, oysters or clams on the half-shell, steamed lobster
with drawn butter. Tom Douglas' restaurants in Seattle are a model of
the genre. What can be better than seafood, impeccably fresh and
skillfully cooked?</TE>
<TE>   That said, the menu proposes some appealing first courses. There's
a lovely version of tuna tartare made with diced ahi tuna in a punchy
dressing accompanied by pickled onions and delightful little Steiner
crisps covered in what looks like birdseed. Calamari are fried to a
crunchy gold and served with a pale lemon-colored honey-jalapeno
aioli that could pack more of a kick. A single fat cake of fresh,
shredded crabmeat is flattered by lemongrass mayonnaise and pickled
honeydew melon.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody in the kitchen is enamored of sweet. A fine butternut
squash soup, the special one night, is garnished with dried
cranberries and hazelnuts; it would be better off straight. An oddly
sweet pinky-plum fig and pear soup is saved by a blast of chipotle
chile and a scribble of creme fraiche. And the delicious grilled
prawns and their roe wrapped in salty crisp Black Forest ham are
unbalanced by their accompaniment: sticky sweet baked beans. Even the
couscous beneath a golden fried trout is dotted with dried fruit.</TE>
<TE>   The best main course is, surprisingly, fried chicken. Crinkly and
crisp in a light buttermilk batter, it leans against a Matterhorn of
mashed potatoes. The Hawaiian fish opah, a treat in itself, is hard
to appreciate -- there are so many other elements on the plate
competing with its delicate flavor. Wild striped bass sits on smashed
Peruvian blue potatoes and snow peas. It also has a basil sauce and,
on top, a dollop of vinegary eggplant for unnecessary punctuation.
Steamed black cod and French lentils with Swiss chard is an appealing
combination of flavors. Why confuse things by throwing in sun-dried
tomatoes and anchovies?</TE>
<TE>   For a neighborhood restaurant, Ballona has a wonderfully eclectic
wine list, just one informal page but filled with interesting bottles
at fair prices. You might want to try an Albarino from Spain, a
California Viognier or, for a red to accompany the excellent pretzel
burger, a Valpolicella from the Veneto or a Central Coast Pinot Noir.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're a 10-year-old kid, dessert is not Ballona's strong
suit. There's nothing wrong with going for the homey, but a crumble
shouldn't be so sweet it makes your teeth ache. The tempting homemade
chocolate-chip cookie ice cream sandwich filled with praline ice
cream turns out to be sweet piled on sweet. Not to mention that it
takes an engineer to figure out how to eat it. It's too fat to eat
like a sandwich; the only possible solution is to wield your spoon
like a pickax.</TE>
<TE>   The best dessert I tried was a beautiful plain cake with the
texture of brioche and a tender crumb that tasted of sweet butter.</TE>
<TE>   If only more of the food here had that kind of integrity and
focus, Ballona Fish Market would feel like a true fish house. Even
so, with its inviting architecture and sense of whimsy, it's already
more at home in the neighborhood than Rock ever was.</TE>

<LD>Before buying plates, measure your dishwasher and cabinets. Today's
massive dinnerware often exceeds the widths of cupboards and the
height of dishwasher racks. Then, know your grades of ceramics. Here
is a guide:</LD>
<LD>   Earthenware or pottery: Crockery made from clay, then sealed with
a waterproof glaze. The glazes are often the most lustrous, but tend
to allow some water absorption. This will eventually make the clay
expand, the glaze crack and the plate break. But quality has greatly
improved in the last 20 years, with better clay mixes and
computerized kilns, so almost all are dishwasher/ microwave safe.</LD>
<LD>   Stoneware: Most durable type of earthenware, fired at high
temperature and tough enough to use without glazing. Often found in
mid-century Modern- and Asian-style dinnerware, with enamel and
translucent glazes.</LD>
<TE>   China: A term originally referring to the home of porcelain, now
used merely to connote dishes. Phrases such as "real China" mean
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Porcelain: The highest grade of ceramic tableware. Originally made
in China and neighboring countries but from the 1800s, manufactured
throughout Asia and Europe, and a bit in the Americas. The
exceptionally high quality owes to the use of mineral-rich clay,
which can be fired at such extreme temperatures that it becomes
glass-like and opaque. When a porcelain plate is broken, it should be
impossible to distinguish the body from the glaze.</TE>
<TE>   Transferware: In a process developed by English potteries,
handsome patterns were inked on instead of hand-painted. Modern
transferware is usually dishwasher/microwave safe.</TE>

<KH>COOKBOOK WATCH</KH>
<HD>With a pinch of nostalgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Betty L. Baboujon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baking season has arrived, and so has a new reason to heat the
oven: an inviting cookbook called "Baking in America" by Greg Patent
(Houghton Mifflin, 2002, $35).</LD>
<LD>   Its recipes are the sort that inspire nostalgia. Their titles are
homey and comforting in their simplicity: chewy butterscotch loaf,
lemon-honey drop cookies, buttermilk bread ...</LD>
<LD>   You'll find American favorites in other cookbooks, but "Baking in
America" offers recipes closer to their origins. It's fun for an avid
baker who's made Boston cream pies or spongecakes many times before
to try vintage versions (with the benefit of adaptations for the
modern kitchen). And it's just as fun to read about how they came to
be our favorites today.</LD>
<TE>   Patent sifted through two centuries' worth of American cookbooks,
journals and other recipe collections. He traced the classics,
searched for forgotten gems and listened to the wisdom of bakers
past. He then returned to his own kitchen and emerged with a
collection of recipes spanning a nation's lifetime and the stories
behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "Baking in America" begins with savory breads, but not long into
the second chapter, it turns its attention to sweet goods and never
looks back. All along the 12 chapters -- through layer cakes, cream
puffs, cheesecakes and pies -- the book offers heaps of reassuring
advice as well as glimpses of the past both relevant and amusing.</TE>
<TE>   Making the sour cream lemon pound cake? (If not, you should be --
it's exceptional.) Listen to Mrs. Crowen pontificate in 1850 about
the benefit of beating the butter and sugar to a light cream. And
should you think that a Boston cream pie isn't worthy of its name
without a chocolate glaze, thank Betty Crocker (or at least the folks
behind the fictitious cooking maven) for adding that now-ubiquitous
touch in 1950, nearly a century after the classic cake's inception.</TE>
<TE>   An American touch</TE>
<TE>   The book's recipes include culinary firsts (America's earliest
cookbook recipe for a chocolate cake, for example), Pillsbury
Bake-Off winners and regional favorites with a distinctively American
touch. But just as notable are Patent's own creations. They are proof
that the "American tradition of improvisation," as the author calls
it, is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   And thank goodness. For although it is interesting to try a
gingerbread recipe from 1851 (a bit drier and more cake-like than
what we're used to, which is perhaps why Patent suggests serving it
with a dollop of cream), our modern tastes are grateful for the
innovation of bakers and the arrival of other ingredients into our
pantries. Take Patent's sophisticated ginger cupcakes: Three forms of
the well-loved spice -- fresh, powdered and crystallized -- join
forces in a moist, tender-crumbed cake, which is then crowned with a
luxurious white chocolate ganache.</TE>
<TE>   A onetime zoology professor and a lifelong baker, Patent gives us
recipes with meticulous instructions. And at the outset, he devotes
several pages to ingredients and equipment, enlightening the novice
but also teaching the more experienced a thing or two.</TE>
<TE>   "Baking in America" makes a fine effort to ensure that the line of
bakers continues. Long live an American tradition indeed.</TE>

<TE>   Ginger cupcake triple play</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 14</TE>
<TE>   Note: These can also be baked in mini-muffin pans. Bake for 15
minutes; use a butter knife to spread the frosting on top.</TE>
<TE>   Cupcakes</TE>
<TE>   1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon ground ginger</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon allspice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger root, finely grated (plus any juice)</TE>
<TE>   Finely grated zest of 1 orange</TE>
<TE>   1cup light brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1egg</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup buttermilk</TE>
<TE>   About 1/4- 1/3 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger</TE>
<TE>   1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-third position and heat the
oven to 350 degrees. Line 14 muffin cups with paper liners; set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Resift the flour with the baking soda, salt, ground ginger and
allspice; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   3. In a large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer on
medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla, fresh
ginger, orange zest and one-fourth cup of the brown sugar. Beat for 1
minute. Beat in the remaining three-fourth cup brown sugar about
one-fourth cup at a time, beating for about 20 seconds after each
addition. Scrape the bowl and beaters and beat on medium-high speed
for 4 minutes until smooth and fluffy. Add the egg and beat 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   4. On a low speed, add the flour mixture in 3 additions,
alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour
and beating only until smooth after each addition. Stir in the
crystallized ginger. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups,
filling them about two-thirds full. Don't bother to smooth the
batter; it will level itself during baking.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake until the cupcakes are golden brown and spring back when
gently pressed in the center, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for
5 minutes, then remove them to wire racks. Cool completely before
frosting.</TE>
<TE>   Frosting</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 (3.5-ounce) bar white chocolate, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sour cream</TE>
<TE>   1. While the cupcakes are cooling, heat the cream in a small heavy
saucepan over medium heat until it just comes to a boil. Remove from
the heat and add the white chocolate. Whisk until the chocolate is
melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the sour cream. Set aside,
whisking occasionally, until the frosting is completely cool and
thickened enough for spreading.</TE>
<TE>   2. Place a teaspoonful of frosting on top of each cupcake and
spread evenly with the back of a spoon. Let stand until set before
serving.</TE>

<HD>A guided tour without the bus</HD>

<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're a relative neophyte in the world of wine and are about to
fly to visit Napa Valley for the first time -- or maybe even the
second or third -- here's a suggestion:</LD>
<LD>   Buy the CD "Napa Uncorked," put it in your suitcase, pop it into
the CD player in your rental car -- or your car, if you drive the
whole way -- and by the time you get to Napa, you'll no longer be a
neophyte.</LD>
<LD>   The 97-minute, two-disc set takes listeners on a 30-mile guided
tour of California's best-known wine region, starting in Napa, going
north to Calistoga and back. Narrator David Hyde Pierce mixes in some
history, some tasting tips, a simplified explanation of the
winemaking process, even a few hints on how to translate a wine
label.</LD>
<TE>   Pierce mentions more than 30 wineries and discusses the roles
played by virtually all the great figures who helped make Napa Valley
what it is today--Gustav Niebaum, Charles Krug, Jacob Schram, the
Beringer brothers, Louis Martini, Georges de Latour, Andre
Tchelistcheff and Robert Mondavi.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce, a stage, film and television actor perhaps best known for
his TV portrayal of Frasier's snooty brother Niles, tries too hard,
at times, to be clever. When he mentions "Rutherford dust," he
quickly adds, "No, no. Vacuum cleaner salesmen need not rush to the
scene." When he describes the battle between Robert and Peter
Mondavi, he calls it "Rocky meets the Blues Brothers ... 'Gone with
the Wind' meets 'All My Children.' "</TE>
<TE>   Knowledgeable wine lovers and veteran visitors to Napa Valley
won't find anything new or exciting on this CD, but at least Pierce
doesn't take himself (or wine) too seriously. That makes it easy to
listen to -- all the more so because of the soft jazz and blues on 21
cuts on the two discs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Napa Uncorked," is available for $19.99 from CD Roam in Los
Angeles, www.cdroam.com, from Amazon.com and select wine stores.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not every Bordeaux comes with a grand pedigree. Bordeaux Superieur
may not turn heads the way the historic first and second growths do.
And it certainly doesn't give you the same kinds of bragging rights
among wine snobs. But even in this more humble category of Bordeaux,
some estates clearly stand out.</LD>
<LD>   Chateau de Camarsac, an ancient fortress in Entre-Deux-Mers, turns
out a rouge with an exceptional rapport of price to quality. Deep
ruby red in color, the 2000 is juicy and delicious, tasting of ripe
red berries and spice. At this price, you can afford to pour it for a
party.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Quick swirl</TE>
<TE>   Region: Bordeaux</TE>
<TE>   Price: About $9</TE>
<TE>   Style: Supple, easy-drinking Bordeaux.</TE>
<TE>   Food it goes with: Beef, beef and beef. Think steaks, roasts,
prime rib.</TE>
<TE>   Where you'll find it: Available at fine wine shops and retailers.</TE>

<LD>The men and women who came of age during the Great Depression and
served in World War II have only recently been given the accolade
"The Greatest Generation." That they did not give themselves such a
name is itself an indication of how modest and matter-of-fact they
had been about their sacrifices and heroism. But even in the midst of
an all-out war, not everyone gets to be a hero.</LD>
<LD>   A.E. Hotchner was an entry-level lawyer in a St. Louis law firm
when American men between 21 and 36 were ordered to register for the
draft. It was 1940 when Hotchner received his draft number. Hitler's
armies had been battering their way across Europe, and London was
being bombed heavily each night.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, as Hotchner recalls, neither he nor most of his fellow
Midwesterners really believed they would be called to take part in a
war. Isolationism was strong in this part of the country, and its
most potent spokesman was none other than their "very own St. Louis
hero, Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh," whom Hotchner had worshiped ever
since the second grade.</LD>
<TE>   Appalled by the Nazis' treatment of the Jews and by their brutal
conquests of other countries, young Hotchner was nonetheless resigned
to the supposed "fact" that nothing could be done against such
overwhelming military might.</TE>
<TE>   He also considered himself a pacifist. Yet to his own surprise, he
found himself strangely excited by the advent of war: It gave him a
sense of being present at the unfolding of history. And when the U.S.
came under attack, he, like the great majority of his fellow
citizens, was eager to do whatever was required of him.</TE>
<TE>   Combat pilot? Bombardier? Deck officer on a destroyer? Hotchner
had seen a lot of Hollywood movies, and his head was filled with
dreams of glory. Reality turned out to be nothing like the movies,
although, in a very different way, it involved movies. In the four
years that Hotchner served in the Air Force, whenever it seemed
likely that he was about to be sent on a combat mission, he would
instead be called on to stage a musical comedy (to boost morale and
to raise funds for servicemen's widows and orphans) or make a film
about Air Force operations against German U-boats (to boost morale
and to stop the Navy from taking credit for the accomplishment). And
just when he thought he might finally be assigned to a bomber, he
found himself working for the Air Force's official magazine in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   For Hotchner, life in the U.S. military was full of the
unexpected. During his cadet training in Miami, he had a poignant
encounter with Clark Gable, who, at 41 and recently devastated by the
death of wife Carole Lombard, had eschewed the easy way out and was
doggedly sweating through the same grueling course as Hotchner and
other GIs. Later, Hotchner did a stint in Hollywood, where he ended
up having to fire actor Alan Ladd for his uninspired narration of the
documentary Hotchner was making for the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   Having been thrown willy-nilly into the role of musical comedy
writer by the Air Force, Hotchner ditched his law career after the
war and became a real writer, known best for his memoir "Papa
Hemingway" but also for books on film stars, including Doris Day and
Sophia Loren. Indeed, he had already had a number of interesting
encounters with celebrities, as described in this crisply written,
highly enjoyable memoir of his unorthodox military experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Hotchner's accounts of the more quotidian aspects of military life
are just as colorful and eye-opening. This was also a time, he
reminds us, when women suddenly got to play a more active,
independent, "liberated" role in the workplace and the bedroom.
Oddly, he does not discuss the fact that the military was still
racially segregated in those days. Or was segregation such a fact of
civilian life in St. Louis then that it never occurred to him?</TE>
<TE>   But the war gave almost everyone a chance to try the unaccustomed.
For Hotchner and his two assistants, none of whom had even handled a
movie camera before, making a film was indeed what we now call a
"growth opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Hotchner describes his experiences of some 60 years ago with an
uncanny sense of immediacy and a nicely understated sense of humor,
which should make this memoir appealing to his fellow veterans and to
later generations trying to make sense of what it was like to be part
of such a great -- and incredibly diverse -- war effort.</TE>
<TE>   "All of America seemed to be pulling oars in the same boat," he
recalls, likening the spirit of patriotism, sacrifice and unity to
the Revolutionary War and to our current moment of truth in the wake
of Sept. 11. Atypical as Hotchner's wartime duties may have been, he
too was able to display in these unchosen, unheroic assignments some
of that resiliency and "can-do" attitude that helped win the war.</TE>

<KH>TV RATINGS</KH>
<HD>L.A. news sweeps results are mixed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Recent transitions in the ownership landscape of the local television
market provided mixed results for several stations as they approach
the end of the November sweeps, according to local Nielsen ratings
data released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   This sweeps period, which officially ends tonight, is the first to
measure the effects of several duopolies -- consolidations in which a
single company owns two television stations in the same city. The
relaxing of rules by the Federal Communications Commission governing
TV ownership in 1999 has led to several duopolies and new marketing
strategies by management of the newly merged stations.</LD>
<LD>   KCBS-TV, which merged with KCAL-TV Channel 9 earlier this year
under the joint ownership of Viacom, continued to come up short in
the afternoon and 11 p.m. news competition, despite the highly
publicized arrival of former KABC-TV "Eyewitness News" anchor Laura
Diaz, that station's top female anchor. In September, Diaz was teamed
up with Harold Greene, an "Eyewitness News" partner.</LD>
<TE>   The KCBS 5 p.m. news, anchored by Diaz and Greene, showed a 23%
decline in rating and 20% decline in audience share from last
November. The Diaz-Greene team's 11 p.m. newscast was up only 2% in
rating and off 10% in audience share from last year.</TE>
<TE>   Don Corsini, vice president and general manager of the two
stations, was still encouraged, noting the station's afternoon and
evening news shows demonstrated mostly double-digit growth since
October. He added that the 11 p.m. news last November benefited from
viewers who had tuned in to several highly rated network specials.
This year, the network relied more on regular programming.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said this was going to be one day at a time, baby
steps," Corsini said. With boosts from the highly rated "CSI: Miami"
on Mondays and "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" on Thursdays, he said
the 11 p.m. news was positioned to improve significantly in the
coming months: "I'm pleased to death that Laura is in a position to
move the needle."</TE>
<TE>   KCAL's three-hour prime-time news block, on the other hand, had
more cause for celebration. The 8 p.m. news increased 3% in rating
from last November, while the 9 p.m. news rose 12% from last year.
However, the 10 p.m. newscast fell off 7% from last November. Jerry
Dunphy, KCAL's main anchor, died in May.</TE>
<TE>   The traditionally competitive 10 p.m. news rivalry between KTTV-TV
and KTLA Channel 5 wound up with a clear victory for KTLA. Coming
back from a rating loss during the last major sweeps period in May,
KTLA "News at 10" came in first in the time period, while KTTV's "Fox
News at 10" came in second, dropping 18% in rating and 29% in share
from last November.</TE>
<TE>   One of the tightest news races of the local sweeps is going down
to the wire. Rivals "The KTLA Morning News" and "Good Day L.A." on
KTTV were almost neck and neck going into the final day. Status quo
remained in other races. KNBC-TV Channel 4 maintained its dominance
in the 11 p.m. news competition, while KABC Channel 7 remained on top
in late afternoon.</TE>

<LD>Rebecca Miller's "Personal Velocity" sneaks up on you. The film and
its title originate with a slim collection of stories Miller
published last year that was politely received in reviews that often
seemed to miss the point. On the face of it, the book and the feature
Miller has made out of three of its stories involve women who, for
various good reasons, are running from the men in their lives. That's
common enough, even at the movies where interesting female characters
are as rare as albino tigers, but what gives Miller's characters a
jolt of truth is that they're also running from the women they have
become.</LD>
<LD>   The film's heart is its second story, in which Parker Posey plays
not-nice as her director takes no prisoners. Adrift in her early 30s,
daughter of a great man (Ron Leibman) and wife to a perfectly nice
guy (Tim Guinee), Greta works as a cookbook editor at a sleepy New
York publishing house where she spends her days wading through
recipes and nervously tugging at her too-short skirts. When literary
hotshot Thavi Matola (Joel de la Fuente) decides that Greta, formerly
a fearsome editor at the Harvard Advocate, can shave the fat from his
epic-in-progress, she sharpens her pencil, then buys a pair of
alligator heels. As she cuts the dross out of Matola's novel, she
again becomes the ambitious young woman she was, building a sleek new
image from the writer's forfeited words.</LD>
<TE>   Miller is the daughter of playwright Arthur Miller, and it's
likely that she knows something about being brought up in privilege
and the need to escape from under a shadow. In the voice-over
narration that weaves through the film, an unidentified male voice
(John Ventimiglia) explains that Greta's father, Avram, is an
influential lawyer who often appears on television standing on
courtroom steps while declaring that "this decision is a victory for
justice in this country." It's a gently mocking characterization --
Daddy Dearest as the very personification of the law -- but it also
gets at why for much of her early life Greta pulled toward her
charismatic father and away from her mother, a Polish refugee born
just days before the liberation of Auschwitz. However schematic, it
is a setup that a lot of us know by heart.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's other two stories have their share of truths, but without
"Greta" or Posey's tautly wound performance to hold the center,
"Personal Velocity" would not have as strong a claim on authenticity.
Some of what makes Greta's story feel truer, fair or not, comes from
what we know about the author's own life (the paternity and the
privilege), but mostly it's that the women in the other stories are
not as finely tuned. Although the first ("Delia") is more developed
as a narrative than the sketchy third ("Paula"), the women at their
center feel too blurry, more like types pulled from case studies. In
contrast, you could cut your hand on Greta's newly sharpened edges,
which bring to mind what Saul Bellow's Herzog, with no small alarm,
said of women -- that they "eat green salad and drink human blood."</TE>
<TE>   Although nothing in Miller's film matches Bellow's sublime malice,
what distinguishes it from most American movies about women is that
it's similarly impolite. In the first story, Delia (Kyra Sedgwick)
packs up her children and leaves the husband who's been slapping her
around. One of those women whose cloistered marriage has left her
without friends, Delia escapes under the cover of night, eventually
moving into the garage of a woman, Fay (Mara Hobel), for whom she had
once done a small kindness. One day in high school, Delia had beaten
off some boys who had pulled down Fay's pants, exposing her
overstuffed flesh to ridicule. Delia had been the school's nymphet
and Fay its sacrificial lamb, and some 20 years later all that binds
them is their respective shame, which floats between them like an
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   The envy and old resentments that waft around these two are only
part of a larger story about a woman whose identity is bound up with
her sexual attractiveness to men and only part of a larger story
about women who, having learned to live with men -- fathers and
husband alike -- sometimes need to live apart from them. One of the
gutsiest images I've seen in a movie this year is the sight of Delia
sobbing alone in the middle of the night, away from her sleeping
children and missing the man who had once bloodied her face. That
isn't what women are supposed to do when they leave, either through
the front door or out the back. Miller's strength in her stories and
in the film is in her ability to push past ideology and get right
down to the nitty-gritty of desire.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything works. Sedgwick pumps a lusty swagger into Delia's
hips but the actress is miscast, having neither the haunted look that
comes with a life filled with abuse nor the character's vaunted
physicality. (Only in Beverly Hills could that tush be called
"heavy.")The film's third, most gossamer story, "Paula," featuring
Fairuza Balk as a bohemian fugitive in meltdown, barely gets going
before it ends. Still, these are quibbles for a movie that at its
best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but
insists on the virtue of imperfection -- how different from the
vacuumed ideal that fills most of our screens! You may not see
Miller's women when you look in the mirror but at least here you
recognize the likeness.</TE>

design, is becoming a retail center for sophisticated furniture and
furnishings.</DH>

<LD>It's impossible for guests not to gawk: Truly, that's some
crazy-kinky vertical sofa Brad Pitt's standing next to at the new
Vitra furniture showroom.</LD>
<LD>   The store's opening-night party is a Spin-Art swirl of faces from
the entertainment and design worlds plus several hundred others
dressed in art gallery black, including a pair of shy nuns from
Mexico City. Among the head-turning objects positioned on concrete
tiers and wood planks are Frank Gehry's sturdy corrugated cardboard
Wiggle chair, which goes for $995, and the $12,000 talker, Verner
Panton's carrot-colored "Living Tower" sofa, which can stack four
people above one another.</LD>
<LD>   Vitra, which opened last week, is the latest in a string of
high-end European and contemporary showrooms to situate within blocks
of one another near the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.
Tree-lined streets and big display windows in this, the Bayside
District, beckon browsing pedestrians.</LD>
<TE>   In July, Boffi, a luxury Italian kitchen and bath company that
boasts $37,000 tubs carved from Bihara stone, moved into a dramatic
two-story brick building on 4th Street. And in August, San
Francisco-based Design Within Reach converted a bookstore on the
corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and 4th Street into a product
gallery housing Philippe Starck's Hula Hoop swivel chairs ($595) and
George Nelson's Saucer Pendant lamps ($335).</TE>
<TE>   Now there's Vitra on 5th Street. It's here, in a former military
recruiting center with exposed ceiling rafters, rather than elsewhere
in L.A. because of "professional links ... and our people told me we
should be here," says Rolf Fehlbaum, CEO of the Swiss company that
makes designer home and office furniture. (Five days earlier they
launched a showroom in New York's meatpacking district.)</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons he was steered toward Santa Monica. The Bayside
District is a creative environment that attracts sophisticated
furniture and furnishings shoppers who have a fondness for a
well-placed curve. And there's space to lease, thanks to a series of
economic waves.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, film and TV studios, production houses and
advertising agencies settled in the city. Many of these
right-brainers liked living and playing close to work, and the
renovated Third Street Promenade near the Santa Monica Pier became a
watering hole. As the area's popularity rose, so did rents; art
galleries and other independents were replaced by formula stores and
other big-buck operations. Dot-com and software companies went poof
in 2001, and rents softened enough to entice furniture companies to
follow the footsteps of Dormire, the ICF Group and Knoll.</TE>
<TE>   The city has never offered incentives for design-based companies
to set up shop. "They just come here," says Mark Richter, economic
development manager of the 8-square-mile of earth that's boxed in on
three sides by the City of Angels and opens to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   'A counterbalance'</TE>
<TE>   From the vantage point of the bookstore he manages on the
promenade, Douglas Woods has watched the design scene unfold like an
unleashed bolt of fabric. Professionals, celebrities and -- by all
appearances -- regular folks in worn shorts and flip-flops spend
hours hunched over visual arts books in his store, Hennessey +
Ingalls. Then they continue their education by window-shopping the
neighboring furniture stores.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 20 years we've been here, Santa Monica has gone from a
sleepy, seaside community to a design hub," says Woods, who
collaborated with the Eames Office Gallery on nearby Main Street to
create a window display in the bookstore on the furniture designs of
Charles and Ray Eames, who were based in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "The showrooms moving into the neighborhood create a
counterbalance to the chain stores that bring a same-old, same-old
atmosphere," Woods says. "The showrooms make the neighborhood more
interesting and bring like-minded people here."</TE>
<TE>   Across the promenade from the bookstore is the playful accessory
store, Ultra House, where passersby pause to check out the inflatable
9-foot plastic ball called the Chillout Room ($500). Five people can
crawl inside and gaze through its transparent bubble ceiling. Says
the manager who goes by one name only, Dawid, "People here understand
cool."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica connection</TE>
<TE>   Two blocks away, the walls of Vitra's showroom are adorned with
spiral graphics that repeat the lean lines and stylized angles of the
designer furniture on the floor: Jasper Morrison's Ply chairs ($775);
Maarten van Severen's .03 chairs ($465) and Jean Prouve's Gueridon
tables ($1,165).</TE>
<TE>   Vitra chief Fehlbaum acknowledges that his company owes a lot of
its success to Santa Monica. One of his first coups -- in 1957 -- was
landing the European rights to reproduce the Eameses' pieces. That
deal propelled the Swiss company from one that made glass display
cases -- vitrines -- into an internationally known furniture
manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   And there's another strong tie: Fehlbaum and longtime Santa Monica
resident Gehry go way back. They met in the 1960s, and the
architect's first European commission was the Vitra Design Museum in
Weil-am-Rhein, Germany, in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Before arriving in Santa Monica, Vitra spent two years in a
"cave-of-a-space without street exposure" in the Pacific Design
Center in West Hollywood, says the store's space planner Jess
Mullen-Carey. The easy access to the storeroom's new home brings not
only celebrities and style setters to its doors but also regulars who
appreciate good design.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen-Cary says a worker laying telecommunications cable in the
store before the opening was scholarly in his knowledge of the
Eameses' output and bought a wood miniature of one of their chairs
his mom used to have.</TE>
<TE>   And those sweet nuns at the party? They know design too. They
worship at a gold-paneled altar in Mexico City's Tlalpan Chapel, a
gift from Pritzker Prize-winning architect Luis Barragan.</TE>

<HD>Schuur and smooth for Manilow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Look out, here come the jazz police: Barry Manilow is producing a
jazz album. For the past few weeks, the pop megastar has been busily
working in the studio with singer Diane Schuur, producing a CD of
all-Manilow originals positioned in what he insists is a pure jazz
setting.</LD>
<LD>   The venture began after Manilow joined the Concord record label.
"I took a look at their roster," he says, "and they have some true
musicians on the label -- the real stuff -- and Diane Schuur was one
of them. They said that if I ever felt like producing anyone, to just
pick through the roster. Well, Diane's like our Ella Fitzgerald, so I
called her, told her I'd love to produce her, and she said, 'Let's
go.' "</LD>
<LD>   Manilow is quick to add that producing is not exactly a new
activity for him.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always loved it," he says. "I did Dionne Warwick's 'Dionne,'
with 'I'll Never Love This Way Again' on it, and I did Bette Midler's
first two albums and Nancy Wilson's 'With My Lover Beside Me.' And
I've always co-produced my own stuff, forever.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Manilow been completely detached from the jazz world in a
career in which he notes, with a laugh, that he started out as a
cocktail pianist. But it wasn't until he had become well established
as a multimillion-selling pop artist that he decided to take a flier
in an entirely different area.</TE>
<TE>   "I bit the bullet in 1984," he recalls, "and told Clive Davis that
I'd run out of pop ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "So I put together this album called '2:00 A.M. Paradise Cafe' and
I called Gerry Mulligan and Mel Torme and Sarah Vaughan -- all these
dynamite, legendary musicians and singers -- and they all joined me
on this original album. I wrote everything on it -- a kind of
12-song, 45-minute suite. I was the soloist on it, and I don't think
I sounded half bad. Certainly I sounded totally different from the
guy who sang 'Ready to Take a Chance.' And I got some interesting
reviews."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the "interesting" response, Manilow has pretty much been
Manilow ever since. At least until his association with the
jazz-drenched Concord label revived his jazz affections.</TE>
<TE>   But working with Schuur, who has often been criticized for a
tendency to use her obvious vocal skills and what might generously be
described as a histrionic style, called for a careful approach to
production.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess [those sorts of histrionics] come from being on the road
so much," he says, "because audiences flip out when you do that kind
of thing. Then, when you do it in the studio, the musicians and the
producer flip out too. But when you take it home, it's just too
overwhelming for your stereo system. The truth is that recording is
not the same as live performance. There's a whole different art to
making a record.</TE>
<TE>   Manilow and his songwriting associates spent a year writing the
material for the album, which also features a version of "When
October Comes," one of a group of songs written to Johnny Mercer
poems offered to Manilow by the great lyricist's widow. But it took
some sorting out to find the appropriate jazz focus. Initially some
consideration was given to smooth jazz -- but not for long.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about it," he says. "Smooth jazz, contemporary jazz,
boring jazz. It used to be great, but now it's become, I don't know,
bland or something. And I didn't want to put her in something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Manilow felt far more comfortable with a much earlier genre.</TE>
<TE>   "The era that I always go back to in the world of music and jazz,
especially," he explains, "is the '50s. For my taste, that's when
they were really being inventive."</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, Manilow brought in players such as Peter Erskine,
Alan Broadbent, Chuck Berghofer and Warren Luening, with singer
Karrin Allyson chipping in for a duet on one number with Schuur.</TE>
<TE>   Will Manilow wear more than a producer's cap and move into the
studio himself for some musical participation in the album, which is
scheduled for release in the spring? "Oh, man," he says, "the problem
is that the jazz police would really come down on that. Because this
is a true jazz album, and I'm not. My singing is not true jazz
singing. I love it, I can produce it, I can write it. But when I try
singing it, I sound like Pat Boone. It just doesn't want to come out
right."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it wouldn't be surprising if Concord decided to crank up
the heat for at least a token Manilow appearance.</TE>

<DH>Beck's smart concert still cuts to the bone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how many times you've seen Beck in concert, you need a
moment of adjustment whenever the pop auteur steps into the
spotlight. You just don't expect to be excited and touched by someone
who looks like a naive 16-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran Los Angeles singer-songwriter is actually twice that
age, but he conveys such a sweet, Bambi-like innocence that even a
novice grifter would size him up as the ideal mark.</LD>
<LD>   Beck's blank expression was perfect in the '90s when it italicized
the irony and wit in his music so well that you wondered if it wasn't
just a put-on. But that boyish look seemed almost incongruous when he
opened his concert Monday at the Universal Amphitheatre with "Guess
I'm Doing Fine," a song from his marvelous new album, "Sea Change."</LD>
<TE>   Beck has always been a gifted, folk-oriented songwriter, but his
musical instincts have been so adventurous that he spent much of the
'90s trying to wrap his tunes around hip-hop energy, something he did
brilliantly in 1996's "Odelay" album.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sea Change," he cuts out the middleman, so to speak, and
operates in a straightforward singer-songwriter context, expressing
romantic heartbreak with the eloquence and craft of Hank Williams,
the greatest of country songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   Backed only by his acoustic guitar during the opening segment of
the night, Beck sang "Doing Fine" with a soulfulness and character
that suggested a lifetime of seasoning and experience. It's a tone
richer and deeper than we've heard from him before.</TE>
<TE>   Because everyone knows how it feels, and because it lends itself
so easily to melodrama, heartache is one of pop's most valuable and
dangerous themes. But Beck expresses melancholy vividly in "Doing
Fine" (one line goes, "Yellow roses in the graveyard/Got no time to
watch them grow") without slipping into self-pity or cliches. Like
the album, the song is a graceful testimony to the resilience of the
human spirit.</TE>
<TE>   After that intimate moment, many in the audience might have been
pulling for Beck to play the entire album acoustically. But the songs
gained dimension a few numbers later when the Oklahoma City band the
Flaming Lips and a guest keyboardist joined Beck midway through "The
Golden Age."</TE>
<TE>   Even though "Sea Change" is an album-of-the-year contender, Beck
is too restless an artist -- and too savvy an entertainer -- to
include more than six songs from it in his concert. During the rest
of the 100-minute set, he led a voyage through the many sides of his
musical personality, all of them smart and stylish.</TE>
<TE>   He was the foot-stomping, harmonica-blowing blues man on "One Foot
in the Grave," the hip-hop enthusiast on "Where It's At," the
funk-minded partygoer on some "Midnite Vultures" tunes. He took us to
Brazil on the lilting "Tropicalia" and into a rowdy Memphis
honky-tonk for "Lord Only Knows."</TE>
<TE>   Changing styles is a real high-wire act for a performer, because
the audience's confidence can get shaken any time a new direction
starts feeling inauthentic. Remember how many people wrote off Neil
Young (prematurely, it turned out) in the '80s when he made
uninspired moves into rockabilly and techno?</TE>
<TE>   But Beck has been unerringly authentic and absorbing in everything
he has tried -- even his James Brown dance steps Monday. Like Young,
Beck represents the purity of the creative impulse, fearless enough
to move at his own pace and selfish enough to refuse to consider the
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Beck is on such a roll these days that he made an inspired choice
in inviting the Flaming Lips along on this tour as the opening act
and his own backing band. The Lips are a wildly imaginative and,
often, simply wild outfit whose leader, Wayne Coyne, seems to have
declared war on everything conventional in pop music.</TE>
<TE>   During its own set, the Lips were joined by some two dozen people
dressed in fuzzy animal costumes dancing and waving spotlights at the
audience and looking like New Year's Eve revelers. Coyne and his
bandmates sometimes walk too far out on the plank for mainstream
tastes, but they are striking indeed at times, especially in "Do You
Realize??," which may just be the best feel-good song about death
ever written. It's such a gorgeous, melodic number that Beck even
reprised it in his set. This guy's no rube.</TE>

<DH>'Treasure Planet' turns a Robert Louis Stevenson classic
into a hybrid of visuals and characters, with mixed results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Treasure Planet" is another one for the boys. Disney's latest
animated adventure is a hybrid on several levels, starting with
relocating Robert Louis Stevenson's classic lads' tale "Treasure
Island" in a space-travel world.</LD>
<LD>   Although it may sound gimmicky, the notion of setting the popular
story of young Jim and the pirate John Silver in a fantasy world
based on the planet Montressor (French for "my treasure") turns out
to be an excellent, much more appealing one than might be imagined.</LD>
<LD>   The idea, as explained by filmmakers John Musker and Ron Clements
(who co-produced and co-directed; they also co-wrote it with Rob
Edwards), was to create a world where 70% of the inspiration for sets
and props would be the original's 18th century England, with 30%
designated as futuristic.</LD>
<TE>   So while the story's central space vehicle, the RLS (for Robert
Louis Stevenson) Legacy, looks like an elegant tall ship loaded down
with sails, it turns out to be rocket-powered. And though the plot
features encounters with recently discovered phenomena like exploding
supernovas and black holes, the filmmakers acknowledge a debt to the
famous Brandywine School of illustrators and vintage pictorial giants
like N.C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasure Planet" is also a hybrid on the animation level. It
marries traditional hand-drawn sequences with extensive use of
computer-generated backgrounds, giving its people the run of what the
studio calls "virtual sets," wonderfully detailed and teeming places
like the spaceport of Crescentia.</TE>
<TE>   One of the film's first sequences, with teenage hero Jim Hawkins
(voiced by "3rd Rock From the Sun's" Joseph Gordon-Levitt) putting a
powerful solar surfer through an exhilarating series of moves,
showcases the kind of visuals that simply wouldn't be possible
without computer-generated imagery.</TE>
<TE>   In broad outline, Jim's adventures follow the path laid out by the
much-filmed original, which has survived a 1934 version starring the
dream team of Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper as well as a 1950
Disney version that remains a fond memory for once-young television
watchers.</TE>
<TE>   Addicted to pirate lore since boyhood, teenage Jim comes into
possession of a map of the legendary Treasure Planet, where the
feared pirate Nathaniel Flint hid "the loot of a thousand worlds."
Helped by dog-like family friend and astrophysics expert Dr. Delbert
Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) and cat-like ship's commander Captain
Amelia (Emma Thompson), Jim sets off across the universe to make the
treasure his own.</TE>
<TE>   If this sounds familiar, Jim is not. Apparently fearful of being
saddled with some namby-pamby hero no self-respecting young person
would go near, the Disney folks have given Jim a decided edge, making
him a sullen rebel raised by a single mom after his father's
desertion, someone who's continually in trouble, failing at school
and always letting his poor mother down.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of "Treasure Planet" share this darker nature,
resulting in a film loaded with strange alien pirates like the
super-sinister, spider-like Scroop, voiced by the especially menacing
Michael Wincott. But if the hybrid model works for the visual aspects
of "Treasure Planet," it is less successful in terms of character.
Every person in the film seems to be in his or her own movie, and
their personas don't mix well in practice.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tedious Dr. Doppler and the glib Amelia,
there's an engaging, shape-shifting blob named Morph and a tiresome
creature that speaks Flatula (you figure it out). There's also the
far too frantic robot B.E.N. (Martin Short), who underline's
"Treasure Planet's" tendency to try too hard for comedy and to be all
over the map, so to speak, where personality is concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Also unconvincing is the individual who needs to be the film's
heart, the cook and pirate captain John Silver who, as if things
weren't complicated enough, also serves as a kind of surrogate dad
for father-deprived Jim. Voiced by veteran stage actor Brian Murray,
this slippery cyborg is neither visually involving (slice-and-dice
Cuisinart-type artificial arm notwithstanding) nor a person who grabs
our imagination the way the character simply must.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that any of this is inept, it's just that filmmakers
Musker and Clements, with "The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin" and
"Hercules" in their past, can clearly do better. What their effort
here points out is how difficult it is to get things like this
completely right. The genre's recent past has set the bar quite high,
and "Treasure Planet" doesn't quite make it over.</TE>

<LD>Once upon a time, long before you were born, people walked on the
moon. These people were called astronauts, and they made six Apollo
landings there. With an excellent telescope, you might see some of
the stuff the astronauts left behind: six American flags, six bags of
tools and garbage, and three Jeep-like vehicles called lunar rovers
that astronauts used to explore the moon's surface. With a really
outstanding telescope, you might even see two golf balls!</LD>
<LD>   It took the biggest rocket ever built -- the Saturn V -- to get
the astronauts to the moon. At 363 feet high, a Saturn V was taller
than the Statue of Liberty and almost as high as a 40-story
skyscraper! One Saturn V was needed for each Apollo mission.</LD>
<LD>   It costs a lot of money to send people to the moon. No one has
been there since 1972. But NASA still goes where no one else has gone
before. Today, its New Millennium Program is busy developing
technologies for the 21st century such as "zero emission" cars that
are small, smart and inexpensive.</LD>

<HD>Showcasing dogs on Turkey Day</HD>
<DH>NBC, with no football scheduled, believes the contest will
attract a sizable audience and perhaps become a holiday staple.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC is going to the dogs on Thanksgiving Day. While CBS and Fox will
be telecasting traditional football games from Detroit and Dallas,
the peacock network is offering a different type of sporting event --
a pedigree dog show.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be a warm, fuzzy Thanksgiving," says Mitch Metcalf,
NBC Entertainment's senior vice president for scheduling.</LD>
<LD>   "The National Dog Show Presented by Purina," which airs directly
after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, was taped Nov. 16 in
Philadelphia. Hosted by the Kennel Club of Philadelphia, which
presented its first dog show in 1879, the "National Dog Show"
features 2,000 of the nation's top canines vying for group and best
in show.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we in the dog show world are fortunate that NBC lost
football," says David Frei, the expert analyst for the two-hour
special. "Now we get our chance. This is fabulous family programming
when the kids are home and the family is home. There are probably
some people in the world who don't need to watch football."</TE>
<TE>   Pedigree dog shows have proven to be very popular on cable
television. USA does well every year with its two-day, six-hour
telecast of the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. ESPN
and Animal Planet have also scored high ratings with dog shows.</TE>
<TE>   The National Dog Show -- the first broadcast-network dog show --
features a lot of the top pooches representing 150 breeds who have
competed at Westminster. "It is the same format for a confirmation
show, but what makes it a little different, and it adds to the
prestige of the event, is it is an on-site bench show," says Frei
referring to a particular kind of competition that is now used by
only about six shows in the country. Let him explain:</TE>
<TE>   "Years ago when dog shows first started, they were all bench
shows. That meant a dog had to be in a certain area, literally on a
bench, so when the public came through the doors they knew they could
go to bench No. 14B and find the row of Afghan hounds. They could see
the dogs up close. It is a great educational process."</TE>
<TE>   At most shows these days, Frei says, a handler and his dog can
arrive at the venue just prior to competition and then leave.</TE>
<TE>   Metcalf says that NBC had long wanted to bring dog programming to
broadcast television. "When we started to talk with the Kennel Club,
immediately there was advertising interest because it is just a
natural fit," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that really makes this work is the day we are going to
do this. If we did it on a normal Saturday or Sunday afternoon in the
sports time period, it would be another one-time-only sports show.
But it fits so perfectly after Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. It has
great potential to become a holiday tradition for us."</TE>
<TE>   NBC also enlisted Paul Carson and his sports promotion company,
Carson International, to produce the event. Carson does several
canine events per year including the "Incredible Dog Challenge," on
TBS.</TE>
<TE>   "There are over 1,500 dog shows per year," Carson says. "But to do
them at the quality of a national show is a different thing. Nobody
has done that in the past, so basically that was one of our areas of
expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Carson says he is not surprised that NBC would throw its leash
into the dog show ring. "Out of all the events I have ever been
involved with, I never had the response and the success we have
enjoyed with the 'Incredible Dog Challenge.' People love dogs and
there is a bond that people share, and really when they see dogs you
are evoking that bond."</TE>
<TE>   John O'Hurley, who played the clueless J. Peterman on "Seinfeld,"
will host the dog show and provide color commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to liven up the broadcast," says Metcalf. "He's not
going to be making fun of the event or the participants, but he is
going to provide a lot of comedy and an irreverent look at it."</TE>
<TE>   Frei says he always wanted to make it clear during a show that
these dogs have a normal life outside the ring. "The old, tired line
I use all the time is that these are real dogs that go home and sleep
on the couches and steal food off the counters and probably
eventually drink out of the toilet once in a while."</TE>

<CX>   Dog show -- The cover story in the Nov. 24 TV Times and a story in
last Tuesday's Calendar mistakenly said that NBC's telecast of the
National Dog Show on Thanksgiving Day marked the first time a dog
show had been shown on one of the major broadcast networks. It
wasn't.</CX>

<HD>A race to the finish for sweeps crown</HD>
<DH>With two nights to go, CBS is narrowly in the lead, with
NBC ahead in young adult viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new television season and November rating sweeps have emulated
the college football season, yielding two networks -- CBS and NBC --
with legitimate No. 1 claims, while ABC has at least begun the
rebuilding process and Fox can do little more at this point than
chant, "Wait till next year."</LD>
<LD>   Network officials put their respective spins on the numbers
Tuesday because of the sweeps, a four-week ratings survey conducted
on behalf of local TV stations that concludes tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The prime-time rating race finds CBS narrowly edging NBC in
overall viewership, with two nights yet to be tabulated, while NBC
holds a commanding advantage by the measuring stick that network
sales departments care about most -- the young adults used as
currency in dealing with advertisers.</LD>
<TE>   "That's how we judge ourselves, and how advertisers judge us,"
said NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker.</TE>
<TE>   By that measure, CBS -- which traditionally appeals to an older
audience -- will settle for third place behind ABC, which has
exhibited some signs of life after a dismal 2001-02 season, thanks
primarily to its unscripted dating show, "The Bachelor," as well as
the new comedy "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter."</TE>
<TE>   As for charting public tastes, few patterns have emerged other
than an appetite for what might be called "brand extensions," with
all three versions of "Law &amp; Order" performing well and CBS spinoff
"CSI: Miami" quickly becoming TV's most-watched new drama.</TE>
<TE>   Although networks weigh their performance versus the previous year
to gauge progress, or lack thereof, such comparisons have been skewed
by the events of Sept. 11, which played havoc with last fall's
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   CBS -- the most-watched network all but two weeks this season --
will likely eke out a narrow first-place finish for November. Through
Monday, the network has been averaging about 13.3 million viewers
during an average minute of prime time, based on Nielsen Media
Research data, versus 13.2 million for NBC. ABC has achieved small
gains in overall viewing and young adults, to 10.9 million viewers,
while Fox -- laboring to plug holes left by "The X-Files" and "Ally
McBeal" -- is down sharply, to 8.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The WB network is also having an impact -- particularly on Mondays
and Tuesdays, with the youth-oriented dramas "7th Heaven,"
"Everwood," "Gilmore Girls" and "Smallville." For November, the
network's audience has risen to 4.9 million viewers -- surging more
than 15% year to year -- to pass UPN, which slipped to 4.2 million.
(The WB is part-owned by Tribune Co., owner of The Times.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite several gaps in its lineup, ABC has enjoyed more triumphs
than many anticipated, given the hole the network found itself in
last season. Thanks to "8 Simple Rules" and the Damon Wayans sitcom,
"My Wife and Kids," the network has solid lead-off shows Tuesday and
Wednesday, and the latest "The Bachelor" became a bona-fide
sensation. "We've had more success early on than we had any right to
expect coming into the season," said Lloyd Braun, chairman of ABC
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing that enthusiasm is the fact that ABC's new dramas have
been uniformly disappointing and that its most-watched program hits
the bench come January once the "Monday Night Football" season ends.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, meanwhile, has gotten off to a slow start after baseball and,
as with ABC, has struggled with its new dramas. The network has
already canceled "Ally" creator David E. Kelley's "Girls Club," and
it announced Tuesday that it plans to pull "Firefly," a high-profile
project from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" creator Joss Whedon.</TE>
<TE>   With little going right, Fox has shifted its focus to 2003, when
the network hopes to garner a lift from a second go-round of its
summer hit "American Idol." The talent contest returns Jan. 21 and
will air Tuesdays and Wednesdays, letting the network move "The
Bernie Mac Show" back to 9 p.m. -- away from competing with ABC's "My
Wife and Kids," another comedy about an African American family.
Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group,
said it is "no coincidence" that "Idol" will lead directly into
"Bernie Mac" and Fox's other critically acclaimed second-year show,
"24."</TE>
<TE>   This fall's rating woes have fueled apprehension at Fox, where
Rupert Murdoch -- chairman of parent company News Corp. -- isn't
renowned for his patience.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if any lesson is to be gleaned from recent seasons, it is
that even the leading networks can hardly rest easy. NBC, for
example, has seen some long-running hits exhibit signs of aging this
fall, including "The West Wing" and "Frasier," although the latter
rallied in November thanks to a story line involving Niles' heart
problems.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' inroads Thursday -- with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"
becoming TV's most-watched program -- also don't bode well for the
"Must-See TV" franchise if "Friends" does indeed conclude its run
this spring. Even with "Survivor" invading its turf, TV's top-rated
sitcom has proved remarkably resilient, averaging more than 26
million viewers this month -- its best November since 1996.CBS,
meanwhile, can point to solid results across the week but has seen
its Sunday movie languish, causing TV movie producers to fear the
network will try series that night in its place. Only a few years
ago, all three major networks programmed movies on Sundays, but the
cost-to-reward ratio, high-profile cable fare and what some
characterize as sheer mismanagement have combined to undermine the
genre.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a time period we're looking at very carefully," said CBS
Television President Leslie Moonves, who blamed the movie's decline
in part on audience being siphoned away by HBO's "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   In general, the competitive landscape facing the networks is
increasingly challenging, with cable programs demonstrating the
ability to register previously unimaginable ratings. Both "The
Sopranos" and ESPN's Sunday-night pro football reach 10 million
viewers a week, with the latter helping ESPN rank as November's
most-watched basic cable network, averaging 2.8 million viewers. TNT,
Nickelodeon, USA and Lifetime followed, all averaging from 1.8
million to 2 million viewers.</TE>

<HD>An ex-mayor with power, and parking</HD>
<DH>A day in the overactive life of Richard Riordan,
indefatigable operator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, is not lost, he
just doesn't quite know where to park.</LD>
<LD>   The garage beneath 10100 Santa Monica Blvd. reads "monthlies only"
and there seems to be nothing to do but pull onto the small driveway
that runs alongside the street. Riordan is on his way to see Haim
Saban, the billionaire head of Saban Entertainment, and is running a
tiny bit late.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess I can leave it right here," he says, although all
appearances are to the contrary. Indeed, a few yards away, a man in
an official-looking jacket and Las Vegas bouncer hair is shaking his
head, shrugging his shoulders and walking toward Riordan's Ford
Explorer with the words "ya moron" all but floating above his head in
a thought balloon.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan quickly takes off his sunglasses and rolls down the
window. "How you doin'?" the former mayor says genially. "Shall I
pull it up somewhere?" And, magically, the man's irritated expression
is transformed into the earnest desire to be of service. "Just leave
it right there," he says, smiling and opening the door. "You don't
worry about a thing. It's good to see you, Mr. Mayor."</TE>
<TE>   A day in the life of a former mayor reveals that this is the
difference between Richard Riordan and most Angelenos; he can still
pretty much park anywhere he wants. And he knows it.</TE>
<TE>   Which may be a bit of compensation for the fact that a year ago
Riordan, and many other people, thought he'd be governor by now.
Instead, he remains as he ever was, a figure defined mostly by his
own will -- the self-made millionaire who never really ran a
business, the two-term mayor with no previous political experience
and now an indefatigable operator with much influence but no
political machine.</TE>
<TE>   By turns frank and intentionally vague, witty and arrogantly
oblivious, he continues to shine in power circles not just because he
is determined to remain a player but because he remains such a
striking contrast to the ho-hum, automaton nature of L.A.'s current
mayor and California's current governor. As his filled engagement
calendar proves, many Angelenos still look to him for answers, while
others think it's time for him to let go. But even those who take
issue with Riordan can agree that he's interesting, a bit of
crackling weather in an often hazy, somnolent political scene.</TE>
<TE>   With his rich-guy's version of Irish charm and his mayoral access,
he still spends much of his time -- and money -- addressing civic and
social problems. And if his ability to simply make things happen
overnight has been curtailed, so, too, have the rules he must follow.</TE>
<TE>   The recent brouhaha over billionaire financier Eli Broad's attempt
to persuade Theodore Mitchell, president of Occidental College, to
run for the L.A. Unified School Board made a stop at Riordan's
doorstop earlier this month. Broad had dangled a $10-million donation
to form a school leadership institute and, Mitchell told campus
trustees, Riordan also had offered to pay for a new executive
position at the college should Mitchell decide to run.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan says that is not exactly the case -- he told campus
trustees that should Mitchell win, he, Riordan, would find the money
to fund an administrative position to take up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the children," he says of his involvement. More than a
year out of office and Riordan's political savvy is still mayoral.
When called for an explanation of his involvement in the Occidental
incident, he said, "I'm headed to Las Familias, come meet me and I'll
tell you." So he is able to make his statement standing in the
cramped play area of a skid row family service center. "Look around,"
he says. "Would Ted Mitchell have been good for the children? Would a
school leadership program help the children? That's the issue, not
who's paying for what."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan says he is simply "someone who gets things done," and he
resolutely believes that if you bring the right sort of people
together in a room, and relieve them of "unnecessary" regulation, all
sorts of things will change for the better.</TE>
<TE>   "You get some people with resources together and let them own the
problem," is his answer during the course of one day to problems
ranging from education and child care to housing to airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan spends a lot of his time these days trying to arrange such
meetings, trying to coax the wealthy and the influential into what he
considers the best course of action. Yes, there is the very real
possibility that he may park himself long enough to start a weekly
newspaper in Los Angeles -- along with his ever-vilified "latte
liberals," there are few things he hates more than the Los Angeles
Times, which he considers, among other things, pro-Palestinian and
anti-L.A. -- but for the time being he seems perpetually in motion,
helping people make the "right" connections. Tooling around town on a
fine fall day, Richard Riordan is a charming, hard-working,
appointment-keeping, phone-call-returning political yenta.</TE>
<TE>   It is strange that a man who so loathes The Times would agree to
be shadowed for a day by a reporter from that very paper. But at
about 8:40 a.m., it all suddenly makes sense; he is going to kill
her. The plan is to meet at his house in Brentwood and bike the five
or six miles to the beach for a breakfast meeting at Shutters. What
wasn't mentioned is that he wants to do this in 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Rattling down the ramp from the Santa Monica Pier on his bike, he
nods toward the nearby hedgerow of chess tables that face the beach,
empty in the early hours. "This is one of my favorite places in the
city," he says. Riordan has long been a chess player and aficionado.
"I brought Garry Kasparov down here a few weeks ago. He was a
gentlemen, he withdrew after six moves."</TE>
<TE>   He is meeting with Ben Austin, one of his former deputies. Austin
is a clear-eyed, clear-skinned young man who treats the 72-year-old
Riordan in a fond, deferential way, as if he were Mr. Chips. He works
now for filmmaker and children's advocate Rob Reiner as part of the
Los Angeles First Five, the Proposition 10 commission that will dole
out $100 million in an effort to provide universal preschool. Austin
wants Riordan to help the new director navigate the land-mined turf
of child-care and early-education agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "With that kind of money, you gotta watch out for the poverty
pimps," says Riordan, agreeing to help. Across the table, Austin
laughs and winces a bit at the term, which he has heard many times
before. Riordan settles into a rant against what he considers
nonsensical regulations -- including the state-mandated ratios of
children to caregivers -- that make child care so expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Four infants to one worker is ridiculous," he says. "Why not make
it six infants to one, get more kids in that way." When he's asked if
he has ever cared for six, or even four, infants at a time, his tone
turns steely. "So, you'd keep poor kids out of day care to preserve
perfection? The pursuit of perfection is what keeps things from
getting done."</TE>
<TE>   "The pursuit of perfection" is one of Riordan's betes noirs. He
will rail against it during this late October day in reference to
housing development, airport security, police department reforms and
the restaurant business. Overregulation is, in his opinion, at the
root of many social ills.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a knee-jerk liberal," says Austin earnestly, leaning across
the table. "But the mayor cares more about poor people than anyone I
know."</TE>
<TE>   Less than half an hour after pedaling home from breakfast, he is
changed and driving to a lunch at UCLA, after which he will speak to
a graduate class in public policy. Sliding his cell phone into its
hands-free holder, he calls his assistant, Jeannette Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, it's me," he says. "Anyone call?" Sally Ride, he is told, and
Broad. "He wants to know if you're going into Hollywood for Halloween
and can he tag along?" When is Halloween? Tomorrow. "Oh, OK, sure.
We'll get some pictures of Eli with a transvestite."</TE>
<TE>   Turning onto the campus, a flock of academics is waiting for him
on the sidewalk outside the staff mess hall. He pulls over, although
it is a red zone, and apologizes for being late. "Oh, please," says
Amy Zegart, assistant professor of policy studies, "we're just so
glad you could come. But we'll need to get someone to park your car
for you." And he is ushered into the faculty dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Around the table, introductions are made, gratitude and admiration
for the former mayor expressed and more than one person says it would
be nice if Riordan had made it onto the ballot. Many people have said
this, and, in fact, one poll concluded that the former mayor was more
popular than either Bill Simon and Gray Davis. When asked earlier
what he thinks about this, Riordan demurred. "It's easy for people to
say they would like me better now," he says, laughing. "They just
don't know me as well as they know the other guy." The predictable
follow-up question -- will he run again -- is answered in the
predictable way -- no, no, he doesn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   But around this table he has many opinions on many subjects.
Airport security would be more efficient if one person were allowed
to "own" the problem, to make decisions without running through the
labyrinth of procedure and red tape, without having to answer to
anyone. "If some guy walks by and his pilot's uniform doesn't fit
right, someone should be able to move on that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The housing shortage could be alleviated by more condominiums, but
that won't happen until regulations "out of Sacramento" are done away
with. He is very concerned that the county tax for trauma centers
won't pass (it does). "If people are worried about our anti-terrorism
strategy, they should worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   After an hour in the classroom, during which he speaks about many
of the same things in much the same way, Riordan heads home. It is a
beautiful house, just off Sunset Boulevard, with a backyard chapel
and full-size trampoline. There are lots of toys in the family room,
the kind kids actually play with, and way more photos of the children
and grandchildren than of Dick and his wife, Nancy Daly Riordan, with
political luminaries, although there are plenty of these as well.</TE>
<TE>   It is a house that would be lovely to live in, except for the
intercom. There are phones everywhere, constantly ringing, and every
few minutes a disembodied voice -- Chavez or his wife -- falls from
the ceiling. "Mr. Mayor, pick up Line 1 please," "Dick, can you get
Line 2?"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan obeys or ignores these requests, depending on their
urgency and his own state of business, but it is obvious that these
voices, speaking to him like Joan's saints, are as natural to him as
the help who quietly stock his refrigerator with goods from Whole
Foods Market.</TE>
<TE>   After a cup of coffee -- not surprisingly, the man drinks a lot of
coffee -- he's off again, to that meeting with Saban. Or rather the
meeting he has arranged for Art Levitt, chief executive of the
movie-related Internet company Fandango, to have with Saban. Levitt
is part of Project Communicate, an effort by some Hollywood
heavy-hitters to build a public relations campaign for Israel, which,
they believe, is being unfairly cast in the American imagination as
the Evil Empire to Palestine's plucky rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Saban is Israeli and the largest single contributor to the
Democratic Party, Riordan explains, so the fit seems pretty good. He
too is happy to see Riordan and ushers him into a large room with a
conference table, a living-room suite of sofa and chairs, a bathroom
and a wall of TV screens.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt is not here and, before he arrives, Riordan has something
he would say to Saban, in private. "Let's go into your office," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is my office," says Saban, puzzled, unconsciously
offering the former mayor, who has a two-story library at home, a
lesson in relativity. It is essentially a pitch meeting and Riordan
stays long enough to see Levitt explain the project, but not long
enough to see what Saban will say about his support.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that went well," he says, stopping for a moment in the
reception area to admire the jaw-dropping view of the L.A. Country
Club golf course. "Saban's a very smart guy. As you see. He has real
money."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the car, he calls Chavez and asks her to call the woman
who heads the East Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club. During the
question-and-answer period in the UCLA class, a student had thanked
Riordan for his support of the organization, and when he asked how it
was doing, she admitted that it was still barely hanging on. He told
the young woman he would look into it, and so he does.</TE>
<TE>   At home, the family room is laid out with coffee and pastries for
yet another meeting. Riordan, who still owns downtown L.A.'s Original
Pantry, has called together a coterie of high-profile restaurant
types to discuss the possible expansion of a famous local eatery. The
meeting lasts almost two hours; everyone speaks carefully, except the
former mayor, who, after listening to many possibilities and
explanations, responds with questions that are quite blunt.</TE>
<TE>   There is not much, it seems, that the former mayor is afraid to
say and that is both admirable and regrettable. As much as the
American mythos prizes frankness, there is also honor -- and
political gain -- in realizing that there are many sides to most
issues, that one person's vision of a vain "pursuit of perfection" is
another's sincere attempt at ensuring justice.</TE>
<TE>   After his disastrous showing in the gubernatorial primary, some
analysts said Riordan had not tailored his message to his audience --
the conservative side of the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   The benefit of life for Richard Riordan today is that now he can
tailor his audience rather than his message.</TE>
<TE>   That and the great parking.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the November sweeps ending, the networks can focus their
attention on lineup changes that will kick in starting in January.</LD>
<LD>   NBC will schedule "Mr. Sterling," a new drama starring Josh Brolin
as a young U.S. senator, at 8 p.m. Fridays beginning Jan. 10. The
series replaces "Providence," though NBC has back-pedaled from saying
that the series will end its five-year run in December. The network
is leaving the door open to ordering additional episodes. The network
also confirmed it is considering a new "Hunter" series, after a movie
reunion of the cop show, starring Fred Dryer, drew solid ratings
earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, NBC said that Harry Connick Jr., a guest star on
"Will &amp; Grace" this season, could be upgraded to a series regular.
Connick's character married Grace, played by Debra Messing, in last
week's episode.</LD>
<TE>   ABC, meanwhile, will premiere two new dramas Jan. 27, hoping to
capitalize on tune-in for its telecast of the Super Bowl the day
before. The new shows, which will fill the void left by "Monday Night
Football," are a revival of "Dragnet," starring "Married ... With
Children's" Ed O'Neill, and "Miracles," in which a pair of
investigators examine possible miracles.</TE>

<LD>Al Gore and wife Tipper continue their book tour promoting "Joined at
the Heart," a book about the American family, and its coffee-table
companion, "The Spirit of Family." The couple have been in Time
magazine and appeared on several TV talk shows in connection with
their books, but readers, it seems, aren't as interested as the
media.</LD>
<LD>   The books have had a disappointing debut, according to the
Washington Post. But, as former Gore campaign press secretary Chris
Lehane told the Post, "as long as Justice Scalia -- Judge Grinch --
does not have the Supreme Court rule that the Gores' book cannot be a
stocking stuffer for the holidays, I am sure it will do well. Also,
Bush should like the Gore picture book -- with all the photos, it is
right up his alley."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Jackass" star Johnny Knoxville expressed sympathy to the family of a
teen who died last week after falling from a moving pickup in a stunt
possibly inspired by the TV show.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart goes out to the kid's family, but we've done everything
we can to prevent this type of thing from happening," Knoxville told
The Knoxville News-Sentinel.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't take submissions. We never have," he said. "We have
warnings at the beginning and the end. In every interview I have ever
given, I have stressed: 'Don't try this at home.' We steer away from
stunts that are easily imitable."</LD>
<TE>   Adam Ports, 18, of Wooster, Ohio, and three fellow students at
Tiffin University set a chair on fire and threw it from the back of a
moving truck while friends photographed the stunt. Officials said
Ports either jumped or fell from the truck and died the next day from
head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "They were trying to create some type of stunt like they have on
the TV show 'Jackass,' " Seneca County Sheriff's Sgt. Brian Hescht
wrote in a report. The now-defunct MTV show of crude stunts was made
into a movie that debuted last month.</TE>

<LD>So much for that: Nicolas Cage has filed for divorce from Lisa Marie
Presley after three months of marriage, citing irreconcilable
differences. It was Presley's third marriage and Cage's second. Also,
German supermodel Heidi Klum and her husband of five years, celebrity
hairstylist Ric Pipino, have separated. The split is "mutual and
amicable" and the two have not divorced, a spokeswoman for Klum said.</LD>

<KH>REGARDING MEDIA / TIM RUTTEN</KH>
<HD>Since when did 'security' mean prior restraint of print
media?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one with an ounce of sense would minimize the pain and loss
endured by Americans in the post-9/11, post-Enron era that began so
shockingly in Lower Manhattan a little more than a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Nor should any sensible person dismiss the continuing peril posed
by terrorists acting under the color of Islamo-fascism and by those
corporate crooks whose deceits have betrayed -- and, in many cases,
beggared -- millions of trusting employees and investors.</LD>
<LD>   To link these outrages is not to suggest that they are morally or
emotionally equivalent. The loss of thousands of lives in the Twin
Towers cannot be compared with the diminishment of 401(k)s. People do
matter more than profits -- even when the dead are strangers and the
money is your own. Still, the depredations of Osama bin Laden's
murder gang and the rogue capitalism practiced by Enron and its ilk
have conjoined to undermine Americans' long-standing confidence in
their physical and material well-being.</LD>
<TE>   As bad as this situation is, it is being made worse by
overreaching government authorities, who are behaving as if anything
called "security" now trumps every other established American value.
How else to account for a proposal now before the Securities and
Exchange Commission that would allow the federal government to compel
newspapers and magazines to print certain information?</TE>
<TE>   In the face of recent allegations that stock analysts have issued
false opinions to drive up the value of certain stocks and win
lucrative investment banking opportunities for their firms, the stock
exchanges are under intense pressure to restore the appearance of
integrity to the analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the New York Exchange and the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, which operates Nasdaq, sent to the SEC a proposed
regulation governing stock analysts' conversations with print
journalists. In interviews, analysts would be required to disclose
any potential conflict of interest posed by their own stock
ownership. If a newspaper or magazine fails to print that information
along with any comments attributed to the analyst, the analyst would
be forbidden to speak again to the offending publication. Failure to
abide by the regulation could result in fines or suspension of the
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   What we have here is an attempt to launder a constitutionally
impermissible prior restraint of speech by calling it a securities
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC shortly will open the issue to public comment, but 1st
Amendment experts already are appalled</TE>
<TE>   "This is nuts," said Jane Kirtley, the Silha Professor of Media
Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota. "Some ideas are so
stupid they don't deserve the dignity of careful analysis, and this
is one of those, if ever I've seen one.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly illustrative of the fact that the appetite of
federal regulatory agencies to control speech is insatiable and, if
they can do so under the guise of protecting the public, so much the
better. It's sinister, really. But, unfortunately, it's also
illustrative of the Kafkaesque way in which federal authorities
change the meaning of words to suit their purpose. It has become
common since Sept. 11, but I feel it must be resisted, though I'm
amazed at their arrogance in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Levine, a Washington-based 1st Amendment lawyer, agreed. "I've
never seen anything like this," he said. "There is no question that
it raises the most serious constitutional concerns. Imposing what
amounts to a de facto command that the press publish certain
information or risk losing access to its sources is a pretty
draconian step from a 1st Amendment perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the proposed regulation appears to fly in the face of
the 1974 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Miami Herald vs. Tornillo.</TE>
<TE>   In that instance, the justices struck down a Florida law that
ordered newspapers to print the responses of political candidates who
were the target of certain kinds of allegations by their opponents.
"The court," Levine said, "held that requiring the press to publish
anything it does not want to publish is just as bad as naked prior
restraint and that both are entirely forbidden by the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   In Levine's view, "The best thing we can say about this proposal
is that it is a misguided attempt to react to corporate scandals of
the Enron and WorldCom variety, and we only can hope that cooler
heads prevail."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this week, Nasdaq's operators, responding to protests
from the print media, said they would submit a revised regulation to
the SEC by the first of the year.</TE>
<TE>   However, Edward A. Kwalwasser, executive vice president of the New
York Stock Exchange, said his organization intends to seek
implementation of this rule. "We think it's very important that this
information gets out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, broadcast media, which are regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission, already have accepted a similar
regulation. TV interviewers routinely ask analysts on business
programs whether they hold any of the stocks under discussion. The
Times, as with most other major newspapers, prints such information
when it is deemed relevant.</TE>
<TE>   However, said Kirtley, "if the SEC attempts to make this
mandatory, it will face a constitutional challenge, since there is no
conceivable theory under which its authority extends to the press.
This is all part of a new government attempt to regulate speech, not
by going after the press, but by going after the speaker. It's
precisely what they tried to do by trying to criminalize leaking by
government employees."</TE>
<TE>   The language of the law, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, is
not logic but experience. And, if long and bitter experience has
taught the United States anything, it is this:</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution and our Bill of Rights are not a promissory note
to be redeemed in some ideal future. Rather, they are a blueprint for
the day-to-day realization of those indispensable freedoms that are
the bare requisites of a healthy civil society.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution may not be a suicide pact, but neither is it a
luxury, an indulgence to be enjoyed in tranquil safety. There never
has been such a time and there never will be -- not now, not ever.</TE>

<LD>It was nearly dark outside and Uncle Ruben was taking Maria and
Alfonso on a nature walk along a small stream in the San Bernardino
Mountains. It was an overgrown waterway where cattails and willows
grew in thickets. They were looking at plants and listening to the
birds.</LD>
<LD>   As they walked back, Uncle Ruben asked the children to observe the
tracks on the trail to see what had been here. Maria said, "Look, a
horse came through here."</LD>
<LD>   "And a dog too!" Alfonso added.</LD>
<TE>   Maria then spotted a small hand-shaped track.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben said it had to be a skunk, an opossum or a raccoon. He
pulled out his small reference book that showed pictures of all the
tracks, and let the children thumb through it until they could
discover what made the small track. The little book showed the actual
size of most tracks, which was a big help.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso quickly ruled out the opossum, since the opossum's rear
foot has a thumb-like digit, and the tracks they were looking at on
the ground didn't have that human-like quality.</TE>
<TE>   The picture of the skunk track also didn't match the track in the
ground. Maria urged Alfonso to keep turning the pages.</TE>
<TE>   After a few pages, there it was -- a raccoon. The picture in the
book was identical to the track they were viewing.</TE>
<TE>   They followed the raccoon's trail for about 100 yards. It had
followed the outer edge of the horse trail. Eventually, the raccoon's
tracks veered off the trail and led right down to the stream's edge,
but the raccoon was not there.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso and Maria felt like important detectives. As they walked
back to camp, they carefully examined the trail in search of other
animal tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder what animals made these tracks?" asked Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "We did!" yelled Alfonso and Maria together.</TE>

<HD>Sandler's crude jokes hide a sweet message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights" has got to be a first on two
counts: an animated holiday musical invoking the spirit of Hanukkah
instead of Christmas, playing against the sentimentality of the
season with some of the raunchiest scatological humor ever seen or
heard on the screen, at least in a mainstream movie. A couple of the
lines are enough to make even the thought-we'd-heard-it-all types
wince. But on the whole, this lively, bittersweet Columbia release
works well and is sure to connect strongly with fans of Sandler at
his most free-wheeling and uninhibited.</LD>
<LD>   Scrub off the latrine humor, and underneath there's a
heart-tugging sentimental tale of uplift and redemption. Sandler had
a hand in all aspects of the film except for direction, which he left
to Seth Kearsley, and he voices the three central characters.</LD>
<LD>   He's first of all Davey, the 33-year-old scourge of a charming,
small New England city. (Production designer Perry Andelin Blake
visited New Hampshire, where Sandler grew up, to ensure authenticity
in the details.) As a youngster Davey was a basketball prodigy, but
he has long been the town troublemaker: surly, cruel, combative, and
a frequent and obstreperous drunk. (We in good time learn why he
turned out this way.)</LD>
<TE>   His latest escapade is about to land Davey in prison for a
substantial period of time when Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), the
perennial referee of the town's youth basketball team, speaks up and
asks the judge to be allowed to take responsibility for the
community's most despised citizen. Squeaky-voiced, diminutive Whitey
is a bouncy butterball of unalloyed love and devotion to the kids,
but he's no pushover.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably but ever so gradually, resisting all the way, Davey
warms up to his job as Whitey's protege, especially when he moves in
with Whitey and his kvetchy but adorable twin sister Eleanore (also
voiced by Sandler, in homage to his Aunt Sarah).</TE>
<TE>   That Davey will eventually change is pretty much a given, but to
its credit, the film effectively makes the point that it is easy to
ridicule and overlook the selfless contributions that eccentric
characters make to our lives. And the truth is that Sandler is
probably right that kids wouldn't sit still for such a worthwhile
message if it weren't served up with an onslaught of scabrous humor
and a slew of rowdy, hard-driving songs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights'</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for frequent crude and sexual humor, dialogue
and brief drug reference.</TE>
<TE>   Times guidelines: The film's scatological humor is extremely crude
and not for the easily offended.</TE>

<LD>A powerful thirst for fame, a fixation on sex and a prodigious
appetite for cocaine -- no, we're not describing yet another
out-of-control sitcom star here, but Sigmund Freud, who has managed
to find his way into prime time tonight at 9 on KCET.</LD>
<LD>   "Young Dr. Freud" is an absorbing if overlong look at the forces
that molded the career path of one of the seminal figures of modern
psychology. Filmmaker David Grubin's two-hour effort is split into
two overlapping segments, the first, "Struggling With the Demon,"
focusing on the good doctor's early struggles to find his place in
the world, and the second, "Opening the Eyes," delving into some of
his breakthrough discoveries.</LD>
<LD>   The special serves up a pastiche of photos, filmed re-creations
and interviews with his granddaughter Sophie as well as experts to
better understand the troubled genius.</LD>
<TE>   The missteps are possibly even more interesting than the
achievements, such as Freud's experiments with cocaine as a treatment
for depression. The doctor became so convinced that he had stumbled
onto the elixir for modern living that besides his own regimen of
self-medication, he prescribed the drug for his fiancee "to make her
strong and to give her cheeks red color."</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't busy with his 20-cigar-a-day habit, Freud's
research eventually led him to unlock the unconscious as a means of
treating hysteria, the umbrella term of the day for mental illness.
As he further explored the inner recesses of the mind, he locked onto
the dream state of his patients, which he believed served as a
Rosetta stone for understanding how the unconscious mind affects
conscious behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" eventually earned him the
respect of colleagues he so desperately sought, but the doctor may
have been just as pleased to find himself the subject of this TV
special.</TE>

<HD>Soderbergh takes a space walk with 'Solaris'</HD>
<DH>The director's remake of the sci-fi classic is a
challenging meditation on love and loss.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Solaris" accomplishes many if not quite all of its aims, but what it
does most of all is reinforce Steven Soderbergh's position as
Hollywood's most gifted chameleon, a filmmaker able to operate with
elan in all manner of genres.</LD>
<LD>   With the divergent "Ocean's Eleven," "Traffic," "Erin Brockovich"
and "Out of Sight" on his recent resume, the writer-director now
turns to a remake of the Russian science-fiction classic, directed by
celebrated Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a novel by iconoclastic Polish writer Stanislaw Lem and
made at a length (two hours and 45 minutes) that enraptured partisans
while boring detractors, the original "Solaris" was a challenging,
philosophical film that played like "Forbidden Planet" filtered
through the dark agonies of the Russian soul.</LD>
<TE>   The new stripped-down 96-minute version, produced by James
Cameron's company, Lightstorm Entertainment, stars George Clooney as
a psychologist and Natascha McElhone as his wife, a couple who may or
may not be given another chance to experience their love in a space
station moored above the strange planet that gives the film its name.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's a bit more than half as long as its predecessor, the
new "Solaris" is in its own way also a brooding, open-ended
meditation on themes of love, death, consciousness and identity. Far
from a typical studio film in its determination to be elliptical and
elusive, it's an example of sophisticated, challenging filmmaking
that stands, despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft, in
welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the
director's previous "Full Frontal."</TE>
<TE>   As has become habitual with Soderbergh, who serves as his own
cinematographer under the Peter Andrews pseudonym and has a hand in
the editing as well, "Solaris" is beautifully shot, filled with
arresting visuals that intrigue the eye without overwhelming the
story.</TE>
<TE>   Working with his longtime production designer Philip Messina (who
recently did "8 Mile"), Soderbergh has created an unobtrusive yet
convincing futuristic look, sleek, rainy and lived in, that seems to
echo "Blade Runner" while carving out territory of its own.</TE>
<TE>   As the director of a focused five-person cast, Soderbergh creates
a tight, ensemble feeling that helps the futuristic scenario seem
plausible. Yet, though it is adept at creating an inescapably
haunting mood, the one effect that turns out to be beyond "Solaris' "
grasp is making its core story as moving as it needs to be.</TE>
<TE>   The film starts with Clooney as psychologist Chris Kelvin, as
darkly brooding as any Russian, living alone and not being happy
about it. Then he gets a video message from Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur),
a friend in charge of the Solaris space station. Strange things are
happening out there, the crew should leave but they don't want to,
and could Kelvin make the trip and negotiate everyone's safe return.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Kelvin arrives at the station, only two crew members
remain alive, and they are not much help. When he asks Snow (Jeremy
Davies), a bearded space cadet who looks as spooked as a fugitive
moonshiner, what's happening, he's told, "I can tell you what's
happening, but I don't know if that would tell you what's happening."
Adds Gordon (Viola Davis), "Until it starts happening to you, there's
no point discussing it."</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, it does start happening. In Kelvin's room with
him when he awakes the next morning is his wife, Rheya (McElhone). To
all intents and purposes she is a flesh-and-blood human being, but
for any number of reasons, this is not possible. What is apparently
happening is that the planet itself is causing this to take place for
its own unknowable reasons (novelist Lem believed in the
impenetrability of alien intelligence), with emotionally devastating
results.</TE>
<TE>   At least they're supposed to be emotionally devastating.
Soderbergh in fact attempts to ensure that outcome by showing us the
entire trajectory of Kelvin and Rheya's relationship back on Earth,
something the original "Solaris" didn't do. It's a good idea, but
it's hamstrung by the film's overall iciness and by the difficulty
Clooney has playing someone who is in complete anguish.</TE>
<TE>   The actor tries hard to capture the correct tone, but his
on-screen persona is, not surprisingly, more suited to the
irreverence that is his habitual mode to be a match for the much more
effective McElhone, who makes genuine emotional connections with her
part. Unavoidably, "Solaris" ends up more challenging and intriguing
than personally involving, and while these are far from small things,
it is only human to hope for more.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Underscoring the closeness of their November sweeps race, CBS edged
NBC by the narrowest of margins last week, while ABC posted an
unusually competitive finish thanks to the unlikely tandem of "The
Bachelor" finale and the movie "The Santa Clause," based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers reliably showed up for sweeps-timed stunts last week, from
a wedding on "Will &amp; Grace" -- which helped "ER" deliver its biggest
audience since the season premiere in September -- to the ongoing
plot involving Niles' health problems on "Frasier." NBC's "Third
Watch" and "Ed" have also attracted their highest ratings this fall.</LD>
<LD>   ABC's "The Pennsylvania Miners' Story" and CBS' "Martin and Lewis"
drew respectable numbers in an old-fashioned battle of Sunday-night
movies, as NBC countered with the feature "Runaway Bride." Despite
that competition, HBO channels amassed more than 11 million viewers
during "The Sopranos."</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, Fox's "The Simpsons" drew its biggest audience since
March 2001 going up against two family-oriented movies -- "Santa
Clause" and the WB's telecast of "The Wizard of Oz." Viewing dropped
sharply, however, for "King of the Hill" and "Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to trouncing CBS' "Victoria's Secret Fashion Show,"
"The Bachelor" held "The West Wing" and "Law &amp; Order" to season-low
ratings. The show's halo effect also carried over to the sitcom
preceding it, ABC's "George Lopez Show," which posted its highest
rating yet.</TE>

<HD>California EAR Unit returns to start a lively conversation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the California EAR Unit kicked off its four-concert season at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Monday, no great revelations
or mind-benders emerged from a bumper crop of premieres. What the
concert did offer was proof of the lively, diverse and sometimes
contradictory conversations in new-music circles.</LD>
<LD>   It was an evening of electronically modified neo-impressionism,
deadpan doomsday humor, audio-video interactions and the usual
assiduous playing of the unit. In the pure, real-time music category,
Jonathan Thomas Miller's "Smear" opened the concert with work for
quartet in which a fundamental tranquillity and rhythmic steadiness
is periodically interrupted by exciting linear "smears." The closer
was Molly Thompson's "Draft of Shadows," a clever mash-up of tango
and rock rhythmic inferences and taped city noises, more party music
than parlor music.</LD>
<LD>   "Panopticon," the evening's longest and most involved work,
deliriously blended music by Victoria Jordanova (also playing harp
and harmonica) and a mosaic-like video by Relja Penezic. The video's
sardonic charm, satirically spinning off the post-Orwellian,
better-living-through-surveillance theme, wore out its welcome even
as Jordanova's score kept our interest, with its rueful, aloof
rewiring of folk influences.</LD>
<TE>   A more cohesive sight-sound embrace came from Clay Chaplin's
"Tricomatic," with expressive improvised gestures, by a trio,
effectively dialoguing with three different, abstracted video
passages.</TE>
<TE>   It was nice to hear again from composer Daniel Lentz, the formerly
Los Angeles-based para-Minimalist with a knack for fusing mischief
and beauty. Such balance defines his new reworking of a 1975 piece,
"Song of the Siren." Vicki Ray's florid piano sweeps -- made extra
florid via looping -- mixed with Marty Walker's impressionistic
clarinet lines and Amy Knoles' cool and careful recitation of
phonemes, all assembled through delay machinery into the stuff of
dreams, simultaneously lucid and fuzzy.</TE>

<HD>Fable worth telling</HD>
<DH>In 'Haroun and the Sea of Stories,' Salman Rushdie creates
a fanciful, allegorical tale about free speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael J. Ybarra</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>When Salman Rushdie's son Zafar was young, the novelist made up
stories to entertain him in the tub. "You could scoop a cup of water
from the bath and pretend there was a story in it," Rushdie says.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually Rushdie turned that experience into the germ of a book,
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories," published in 1990, a parable about a
father and his son and an ocean on a moon that is the source of all
the tales ever told. Now it's a play, as well.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to see it come back to life in a very different form,"
says Rushdie, just before the play's West Coast premiere last
Wednesday at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   The play, closely adapted from the book, is a fanciful story about
the forces of lightness and darkness, about the need to communicate
and the totalitarian urge to eradicate language, a moral fable
written out of Rushdie's own famous ordeal with censorship and a
price on his head.</TE>
<TE>   The basic plot came from a short story that Rushdie had given up
on years before the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa
(religious order) in 1989, claiming that Rushdie's novel "The Satanic
Verses" was blasphemous and that it was the duty of every Muslim to
try to kill the author.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd become involved myself in a war between language and
silence," Rushdie says.</TE>
<TE>   Rushdie went into hiding for years, and only returned to the
public after the fatwa was lifted in 1999. In the meantime, he wrote
"Haroun" so his son -- then 10, now 23 -- could enjoy the book at one
age as an entertaining story and later as a thought-provoking
allegory.</TE>
<TE>   "He's loved it at every age, I must say," Rushdie notes. "And he
hasn't read that many of my books. He's read a lot of first chapters,
though."</TE>
<TE>   Haroun (Zafar's middle name) is the son of a famous storyteller
who suddenly loses the ability to tell stories. Haroun journeys to
the moon to help his father get back his gift, and the boy wanders
into a war between two tribes, the people who talk, and the people
who don't and who are trying to force silence on the world by
poisoning the sea of stories.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the point of stories that aren't even true?" a character
asks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an animal that tells stories," Rushdie answers himself.
"We start out telling other people's stories and in the end we become
someone else's story."</TE>
<TE>   "Haroun" was first performed on stage at England's Royal National
Theatre in 1998, in an adaptation by Tim Supple and David Tushingham.
The original play hewed closely to the book (all of the lines were
Rushdie's), lasted 2 1/2 hours and concentrated on the story's comic
aspects. That version was performed a couple of times in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Berkeley Rep Artistic Director Tony Taccone met
Rushdie and suggested staging a different version of the story.
Dominique Serrand and dramaturge Luan Schooler took the original
play, cut it down by an hour and tried to make it more serious
without losing the lightness.</TE>
<TE>   "The other version was very much cartoonist," says Taccone. "We
thought the script was too long and thick, insistently light and
ignored the full spectrum of the world that the book explores."</TE>
<TE>   Rushdie approved the adaptation and flew out early from his home
in New York to offer advice during rehearsals. "Any input I wanted to
make, they were very generous to accept," he says. " 'Haroun' is
mostly dialogue; it's written like a play already."</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are four lines in the whole thing that are not
Salman Rushdie," Taccone adds.</TE>
<TE>   The production is a visual spectacle: Actors emerge from a pool of
water. Rise through the air on cables. Glide across a catwalk like
ghosts. The stage plunges into darkness when Haroun goes to the land
of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Overtones of current events seem unavoidable (one character wears
what looks like a burka, which the director says was not
intentional).</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 is irrelevant to this production," says Serrand, who
directed the production. "There's a great deal of censorship in
America. Sept. 11 should have started a time of questioning, not
reaffirming. Jesse Helms and the head of the Taliban are the same
person. My father was a terrorist by George Bush's definition. He was
in the French resistance. The baddies are here as well as everywhere
else. This play is about questioning ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   "The play is as much about small acts of censorship," adds
Schooler, "books being pulled from shelves anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley Rep has produced plays dealing with the subject of
oppression before, most recently Tony Kushner's "Homebody/Kabul,"
which had its West Coast premiere earlier in the year.</TE>
<TE>   "This play is a wildly different approach than 'Homebody,' "
Taccone notes. "Haroun is completely accessible. It is a parable
about the ability to speak, to tell one's story, that censorship
under any guise is not healthy. We've tried to introduce the sense of
darkness that's linked to lightness."</TE>
<TE>   Reviews have been so-so. "Rushdie was there, seated in the middle
of the audience ... ," wrote the San Francisco Chronicle. "Sadly,
Rushdie's presence was less apparent in the work presented on the
stage ... its artistic-freedom theme becomes less a parable than an
attractively illustrated lecture."</TE>
<TE>   "If the show is lacking in sheer dramatic firepower, in the
crackle of emotion and charisma that brings a text to life, there is
no shortage of lovely images and wise words ... ," added the San Jose
Mercury News. "The flaws in this production might be beside the
point. The true star of the show remains Rushdie."</TE>
<TE>   If Rushdie steals his own show, it's a role he seems to be
enjoying. "In college I did more acting than writing," he says. "I
wanted to be an actor." His most memorable stage moment, Rushdie
says, was in a production of "The Alchemist" at Cambridge University.
"There was a moment I realized that the line I was speaking was the
answer to the question I was about to be asked," he recalls. "I
didn't have a very distinguished career."</TE>
<TE>   "Haroun" was optioned for an animated film years ago but Rushdie
says that the project has never gotten off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The novelist was closely involved in turning another of his books
into a play, the celebrated "Midnight's Children." Rushdie and Supple
adapted the 1991 novel for the Royal Shakespeare Company, a
production that is scheduled to debut in January in London and travel
to Michigan and New York in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got the bug," Rushdie says. "Maybe I'll write directly for
the theater. Theater is more collaborative than novel writing. My
whole career has been by myself in a room. Noel Coward talked about
writing plays in a couple of days. A novel isn't like that. It's a
marathon."</TE>
<TE>   Still, what Rushdie really wants to do is to act. "That itch has
always needed scratching and it hasn't had much scratching," he says.
"I got my break in 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' I thought the telephone
would ring, but it's remained mysteriously silent. You can play
yourself only once. I'm open to offers."</TE>

<LD>Guevara trial -- A story in the California section Nov. 15
incorrectly reported evidence presented by prosecutors during the
trial of Huntington Park Councilwoman Linda Guevara, who was
convicted of falsely claiming she lived in Huntington Park when she
actually lived in Downey. The story said investigators from the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office observed Guevara return
regularly to a house in Downey. In fact, prosecutors presented
evidence showing that she had returned one time to the Downey home.</LD>

<LD>Pakistani medal -- A story in Section A on Friday referred
incorrectly to the Olympic Games at which Pakistan's field hockey
team won a gold medal with the front-office assistance of Mir

<HD>Cal-ISO Says Enron Didn't Force Blackouts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's grid operator said Tuesday that Enron Corp.'s infamous
trading strategies probably caused power prices to rise but did not
force blackouts during the state's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the California Independent System Operator, in a report
Tuesday, blamed the blackouts on suppliers that offered limited
electricity and on transmission bottlenecks from Southern to Northern
California. Cal-ISO produced the report in response to testimony by
energy consultant Robert McCullough for the state Senate committee
investigating manipulation of California energy markets. He had
contended that Enron could have contributed to blackouts by creating
phantom electricity traffic jams.</LD>
<LD>   The trading strategies caused "detrimental financial impacts" in
the state's advance electricity markets but "would typically not
impact system reliability," the report said. That's because they were
not used in the last-minute electricity market or in Cal-ISO's
real-time balancing of supply and demand on the grid, according to
the report. Enron's trading schemes did not reduce supply to the
grid, although they may have resulted in higher electricity prices
and payments to relieve electricity congestion, the report added.</LD>
<TE>   McCullough characterized Cal-ISO's report as an attempt to spare
itself embarrassment because of miscalculations. He said recently
released data show that Cal-ISO, as it struggled to keep electricity
from fleeing the state, created some of the congestion on the
transmission lines through a byzantine transmission contracting
system.</TE>
<TE>   "They wrestled the gun away from Enron, pointed it at their own
feet and started blazing away," McCullough said.</TE>

<HD>Many Face Cutoff of Jobless Benefits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Policymakers have known for decades that the nation's shambling
unemployment insurance system is in need of repair.</LD>
<LD>   But like the grasshopper in the children's story who fails to
prepare for winter, they have refused to act until the winds of
recession and layoff are swirling around them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Congress and the White House have gone it one better. The
former has effectively decided there's no big problem after all. The
latter has concluded that, even if there is, there's no rush to solve
it. The result is that nearly a million Americans risk losing
unemployment benefits just after Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   "Talk about a kick in the gut," said Pat Zanon, a divorced mother
of three who was laid off in the spring after 24 years with
Denver-based Qwest Communications Inc. and is collecting the
so-called extended benefits that Washington is letting expire.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going to be a bleak Christmas anyway because with
unemployment you don't get that much," said 59-year-old Zanon, who
has gone from making $1,000 a week to getting by on about $300. "But
now it's really going to be bleak."</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, White House aides say the administration is trying to
come up with something for people such as Zanon who have been jobless
for more than six months and have run out of their regular,
state-funded benefits. Labor Department officials say that if
Congress acts quickly when it returns Jan. 7, there's still a chance
that unemployed workers could avoid missing a check. But the fact is
that the administration refused to step in to break the congressional
deadlock that will bring an end to extended benefits. And there is
considerable sentiment, especially among House Republicans, that
there is no more need for the extra aid.</TE>
<TE>   While suggesting that the president may support some additional
assistance, the senior administration official said Bush's aides are
hard at work on an "innovative, new approach" to unemployment
insurance -- one that, it appears, would only indirectly address the
most glaring problems with the jobless benefits system.</TE>
<TE>   That system, the product of the New Deal, is a hybrid in which
states set most of the rules for who gets benefits and how much,
while Washington pays administrative bills and kicks in extra
benefits when times are tough. It all worked as long as layoffs were
short and work patterns were similar. And the setup had an added
advantage: With a national "trigger" turning on extra benefits during
recessions and turning them off in recoveries, the system acted as an
automatic stabilizer to help the economy regain its balance.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 1980s. To cut costs, Washington dropped the national
trigger; that took the "automatic" out of the stabilizer. To meet
foreign competition, employers eliminated positions; workers who lost
their jobs were out for longer periods. And as the economy changed,
so did the nature of work in America.</TE>
<TE>   The combination played havoc with the jobless benefits system,
forcing states to tighten rules and keeping an ever-larger fraction
of workers from collecting benefits. Government statistics show that
75% of the unemployed collected benefits in the mid-1970s recession,
but only 45% are doing so now.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, what we've ended up with is an unemployment
compensation system that doesn't deal with many people who are
unemployed," said former Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.), who tried,
but failed, to fix many of the system's problems in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, a commission appointed by the first President Bush
produced several thick volumes of recommended repairs. Asked recently
whether any of its proposals were adopted, panel chairwoman Janet
Norwood said, "None that I'm aware of."</TE>
<TE>   So what does the current President Bush suggest?</TE>
<TE>   Only part of the administration's "innovative, new" proposal is in
public view. That involves shifting the costs and responsibilities
for administering the jobless benefits system back to the states. The
idea was popular with governors in the flush 1990s, but now -- with
states facing their worst budget crisis since World War II -- it
seems impossibly out of date.</TE>
<TE>   Other elements can be inferred. The Labor Department, for
instance, is known to be interested in "adjustment accounts," money
that people could use to live on or pay for training while jobless.
They then would keep whatever money is left once they are employed.</TE>
<TE>   This has the appeal of offering a solution to what many in the
administration see as a critical problem with the current system by
rewarding efforts to get a new job quickly. But critics say this
approach would require so many rules it would barely differ from what
exists now. At most, it would begin with pilot projects in a few
states.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there's the issue of extended benefits. The president has
yet to show his hand, but many in his party argue that all that's
needed is a few extra weeks of benefits to let those now collecting
down gently.</TE>
<TE>   But don't tell that to Timothy Lech, a purchasing agent for
foundry equipment maker CSI Industrial Systems Corp. in Grayling,
Mich., before the company shut down in June.</TE>
<TE>   Lech, who is collecting extended benefits, says he's been looking
for a job for six months. So has his grown son, who has six children
younger than 7 and also worked at CSI.</TE>
<TE>   The family has decided to pass on Christmas this year. "We talked
about it and said there's no sense putting anybody in a bind," he
said. "We just hope next year's better."</TE>

<HD>GDP Growth Revised Upward for Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Ahmann</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy grew more briskly in the third quarter than first
thought, with robust car sales helping to more than triple the weak
second-quarter pace, the government said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   However, two other reports showed that new-home sales fell in
October and consumer sentiment posted a smaller-than-expected rise
this month.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. gross domestic product, a measure of all output within the
country's borders, rose at a revised 4.0% annual rate in the
July-September period after an anemic 1.3% gain in the preceding
quarter, the Commerce Department said.</LD>
<TE>   Commerce originally had estimated the economy expanded at a slower
3.1% pace in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   However, a buildup in business inventories was one of the main
drivers of the upward GDP revision and there was a decline in
corporate spending, originally reported as rising a bit. Economists
said these were indicators of slower growth ahead.</TE>
<TE>   A increase in consumer spending, up at a 4.1% clip after a 1.8%
gain in the second quarter, accounted for most of the
quarter-to-quarter improvement in the economy's performance. A sharp
gain in auto sales played a big role.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the private Conference Board reported that its
consumer confidence index rebounded in November from a nine-year low,
but the rise to 84.1 from 79.6 in October was smaller than economists
had expected and the index remained well below September's reading of
93.7.</TE>
<TE>   In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of new
single-family homes in October slipped from September's record pace,
dropping 4.5% to a 1.01-million-unit annual rate, still the
third-best monthly sales rate on record.</TE>

<HD>Enron Exec Pleads Guilty to Tax Evasion</HD>
<DH>Larry Lawyer of defunct broadband unit failed to identify
more than $79,000 in income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mid-level executive for Enron Corp.'s defunct broadband unit
pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing false tax returns that failed to
identify more than $79,000 in income from 1997 to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The tax-evasion charge stems from a 1997 deal to sell wind farms
Enron owned in California.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Lawyer, 34, became the fourth person federal prosecutors
have secured a guilty plea in their probe of Enron. The company filed
for bankruptcy protection in December after revelations about years
of inflated profit and hidden debt.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyer, who was among thousands of employees laid off the day
after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection, faces up to three years
in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He is scheduled to be
sentenced in February.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief appearance before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt,
Lawyer was released on $50,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers of the wind farm were friends of former Enron Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow and his aide, Michael Kopper.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer's attorney, Robert Sussman, said his client was working for
Enron Capital Trade when he was involved in handling the wind farm
sales. Kopper gave Lawyer four payments, one per year from 1997 to
2000, which Kopper called gifts, Sussman said. The payments totaled
$79,468.23. Of that amount, Lawyer owed the federal government more
than $29,000. He admitted Tuesday that he did not report the money.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if Mr. Kopper told him it was a gift, he should have
reported it," Sussman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer plans to give the $79,000 to former Enron employees through
a relief fund set up for the thousands of workers who lost their jobs
and retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have pleaded guilty to charges as a result of the Enron
probe are: Arthur Andersen's former auditor in charge of the Enron
account, David B. Duncan, who pleaded guilty to obstruction of
justice; Kopper, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy and
money laundering; and a former top Enron trader from Portland, Ore.,
Timothy Velden, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud for scheming to
manipulate the California energy market.</TE>

<HD>General Electric Chief Executive Immelt Plays the Difficult
Hand Jack Dealt Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Welch, once the most admired of chief executives when he ran
General Electric Co., has given plenty of people reason to be upset
with him in the last six months.</LD>
<LD>   Among them has been his Mrs. of 13 years, Jane Beasley Welch, who
filed for divorce after he had a much-publicized affair. There also
have been GE shareholders, who felt aggrieved after learning of
Welch's lavish retirement package, which included everything from the
use of corporate jets to company-furnished flowers, wine and maid
service.</LD>
<LD>   But in the end, the person with the most complaints could
rightfully be Welch's hand-picked successor, Jeffrey Immelt.</LD>
<TE>   Welch's GE was praised to the skies. Immelt's GE is treated by
Wall Street as a virtual has-been.</TE>
<TE>   When Immelt went before investment analysts again last week to
explain how he was fixing problems at the company and hoping to make
the most of "a slow-growth economy," GE's stock hardly budged. It
sells today at around $26, about half its price of two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   There is, in short, a cloud of skepticism hanging over GE, as
though its past success was not quite genuine.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, the Fairfield, Conn., company has become a
microcosm for U.S. industry, reflecting widespread questioning of
whether the gains of the 1990s were real or illusory.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that most of the gains of the past were real, and
most of the promise of the future is, too.</TE>
<TE>   But given the situation that Welch left behind, Immelt has his
work cut out for him if GE is to rebound to the great heights it once
enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Under Welch, GE racked up heady gains in profit year after year.
All the while, he preached the rigors of self-improvement to GE
employees. Wall Street and the public ate it up.</TE>
<TE>   Welch's success wasn't just built on hype, either. He was an
extraordinary leader and a true business visionary.</TE>
<TE>   But a large part of GE's success also was due to Welch's adroit
use of finance. In particular, he made great use of General
Electric's finance division, GE Capital Services, building it from a
credit facility for home appliances into the largest unregulated bank
in the world with $425 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital, because it enjoyed the privilege of GE's AAA credit
rating, could raise money at the most favorable rates. (Only six
other U.S. companies carry AAA credit ratings, according to Standard
&amp; Poor's.)</TE>
<TE>   That ability to borrow on the cheap, in turn, gave GE a powerful
edge. Its jet engines could be sold under advantageous financial
conditions to the world's airlines, and its power plants could be
peddled to electric utilities on similarly easy terms.</TE>
<TE>   But Immelt doesn't have that same edge today. That's in large part
because Welch went too far during his last year in office.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Welch tried to acquire Honeywell International Inc. in a
$44-billion deal. But Mario Monti, the top antitrust regulator for
the European Union, raised tough questions. He focused on the
financial power of GE Capital and its position as a world leader in
the leasing of planes to airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Monti listened to GE's competitors in the jet-engine business:
Pratt &amp; Whitney parent United Technologies Corp. and Britain's Rolls
Royce. And he demanded that GE allow its rivals to buy into GE
Capital so they could enjoy the same financial benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Welch angrily rejected the idea. But he made a tactical error.</TE>
<TE>   Though he headed a global company, he underestimated the European
antitrust police. Ultimately, the EU nixed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Welch had opened his prize GE Capital division to the
scrutiny of Wall Street investment managers.</TE>
<TE>   Having postponed his retirement to handle the Honeywell deal,
Welch stepped down shortly after the debacle.</TE>
<TE>   That left Immelt to handle the growing reservations about GE
Capital, which last year accounted for 40% of the parent
corporation's $14 billion in operating profit. Such concerns -- which
relate in part to the amount of debt held by GE Capital -- only
increased after the collapse of Enron Corp. and other accounting
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt last week took a big step toward mollifying those with
worries about GE Capital, telling analysts that GE would inject $4.5
billion into the unit. That way, it can secure a AAA credit rating of
its own.</TE>
<TE>   "To say that GE today faces no challenges is a vast
understatement," says analyst Nicholas Heymann of Prudential
Securities. "But to believe that it lacks the resources to deal with
them defies logic."</TE>
<TE>   GE is pushing hard into two new fields. One is water purification
and treatment. The other is homeland security, where GE is developing
sensors and detection devices.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt also is expanding the NBC franchise, with the purchase of
Telemundo and Bravo. He sees NBC at the heart of a GE business that
eventually will bring entertainment and other services into the home
via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt, who at 46 could lead GE for almost two more decades, can
certainly bring back the company's glory days. But to do so, he must
shrewdly play the difficult hand that his friend and mentor, Jack,
dealt him.</TE>

<HD>Quarantine Urged to Fight Fruit Fly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>County agricultural officials have asked the state to slap a
quarantine on 6,400 acres of prime farmland in hopes of stopping the
spread of the voracious Mexican fruit fly.</LD>
<LD>   State, federal and county agricultural officials have set up a
command post in Valley Center and are conducting a tree-by-tree
inspection in northern San Diego County after finding 45 adult flies
and two larvae at sites in 14 orchards. More than 15 types of fruit,
including avocados, oranges, grapefruit, lemons and persimmons, worth
an estimated $33 million, are within the quarantine zone.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to use every tool in the toolbox to get this thing
under control," said Kathleen Thuner, agricultural commissioner for
San Diego County.</LD>
<TE>   Officials are hoping to identify the core zone of the infestation
before calling for aerial spraying. More than 150 traps have been
set, and several dozen inspectors from various agencies are
inspecting groves and meeting with farmers.</TE>
<TE>   County officials expect the state to invoke a quarantine within
days. Under a quarantine, no fruit could be taken from Valley Center
-- even from backyard trees where no fruit flies have been found --
without government approval.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers could apply for permits to sell their fruit, however;
those closest to the core infestation zone are likely to be
restricted to selling their fruit only for juice and those farther
away could sell their fruit after it has been treated.</TE>
<TE>   A Mexican fruit fly quarantine would be the first in San Diego
County since 1999, when a zone near Fallbrook was restricted for
seven months, costing farmers an estimated $3.5 million. This time,
however, larvae were found, making the discovery even more ominous,
officials said. The last such discovery locally was 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials have yet to pinpoint how the fruit flies got to
Valley Center, County Supervisor Bill Horn, who grows oranges and
avocados in the infested area, laid the blame on Mexican fruit that
has been imported under the North American Free Trade Agreement. He
called for a "no-fly zone" of increased inspection at the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We need greater vigilance [and inspection] of seemingly innocent
containers of Mexican fruit, including the lunch bags of farm
workers," Horn said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many stock mutual funds are again attracting more buyers than
sellers, after five months of net redemptions. But investors' mood
remains cautious despite Wall Street's rebound since early October,
some fund firms say.</LD>
<LD>   Major fund companies including Fidelity Investments and Vanguard
Group said Tuesday that their stock funds have attracted more net new
investment in November than in any month since April. Vanguard said
its equity funds have taken in a net $1 billion this month.</LD>
<LD>   But another fund giant, T. Rowe Price Associates, said that net
new investment from small investors in November was just "modestly
positive."</LD>
<TE>   Any net inflow would be an improvement from the June-to-October
period, when the industry suffered heavy redemptions amid the stock
market's plunge to five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   The Investment Company Institute, the funds' main trade group,
said Tuesday that stock funds had a net cash outflow of $7.7 billion
in October, bringing the total of net redemptions to nearly $98
billion for the five-month period.</TE>
<TE>   The recent streak of net redemptions has been the longest since
1988, when investors continued to cash out of equity funds after the
October 1987 market crash.</TE>
<TE>   But as a percentage of total stock fund assets, the net
redemptions have been relatively small this year. Stock fund assets
totaled $2.66 trillion as of Oct. 31, the institute said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebound in share prices since early October naturally is
helping to encourage more investors to put money to work in mutual
funds, analysts said. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 19%
since Oct. 9, though the market was hit by profit taking on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In October, investors continued to favor bond mutual funds over
stock funds: A net $6.3 billion flowed into bond funds in the month,
according to the institute. That was down from $15.4 billion in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Funds that own high-quality bonds have been a safe haven for
investors this year, as falling market interest rates have boosted
the value of older bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Year-to-date through October, bond funds' net cash inflow totaled
nearly $126 billion, while stock funds suffered a net outflow of
$26.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Money market mutual funds had a net inflow of $11.2 billion in
October, but the funds had a net outflow of $146 billion for the 10
months, as interest rates fell and investors moved cash into other
investments, including bonds and real estate.</TE>

<HD>Limits on Home Loans Raised by 7.3%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Yoon</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Tuesday raised the limit on the size of
single-family home mortgages they buy from banks by 7.3% to $322,700,
widening the field of home buyers eligible for lower-cost financing.</LD>
<LD>   The new loan ceiling, up from $300,700, matches the increase in
the U.S. average home price in October from a year earlier, according
to the Federal Housing Finance Board. The government charters for
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require them to base annual increases in
their maximum loan size on the October price increase.</LD>
<LD>   "It will definitely spur more refinancing as people jump from
higher cost jumbo loans" to mortgages that lenders can sell to Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, said Kevin Jackson, a mortgage analyst at RBC
Dain Rauscher Inc. in Chicago. "It helps the borrower save cash."</LD>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and its smaller rival, Freddie Mac, provide money to
the housing market by buying loans from banks and other lenders,
enabling those lenders to make more loans. The government-chartered
companies make a profit by keeping some loans and earning interest on
them, or by repackaging others as mortgage-backed securities that are
sold to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac estimates that an additional 250,000 households will
be eligible for the lower cost loans when the new limit goes into
effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also will boost the mortgage limit on
two-family properties to $413,100 from $384,900; the limit for
three-family properties will rise to $499,300 from $465,200; and for
four-family housing to $620,500 from $578,150.</TE>

<HD>Idec Shares Tumble Again on Downgrade</HD>
<DH>An analyst cites slowing sales of the biotech company's two
drugs to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. fell again Tuesday after an
analyst downgraded the biotechnology firm because of concerns about
slowing drug sales.</LD>
<LD>   Idec dropped 9% to close at $32.84, off $3.40 a share, on Nasdaq
after Merrill Lynch analyst Eric Ende lowered his rating on the San
Diego company to "neutral" from "buy." Ende cited slowing sales of
Idec's lead drug, Rituxan, and limited adoption of its only other
drug, Zevalin.</LD>
<LD>   Idec's stock fell Monday after two analysts slashed their sales
projections for Zevalin.</LD>
<TE>   The medications are used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type
of cancer. Rituxan sales are expected to slow because the antibody
drug already is widely used to treat the disease. Zevalin is a
radiopharmaceutical -- an antibody with a radioactive payload -- that
is complicated to use.</TE>
<TE>   Ende said he remained convinced that Zevalin would become a
successful product. But he said its use has been limited because it
requires coordination between oncologists, who typically treat
lymphoma patients, and hospital-based nuclear medicine departments.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, physicians are uncertain about when to use
Zevalin because, unlike Rituxan, it has significant side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who took Zevalin in clinical trials had fewer
infection-fighting white blood cells and platelets, which control
bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Ende also said doctors are unsure whether they should administer
Zevalin instead of Rituxan, or wait until patients have no other
treatment options.</TE>
<TE>   Idec has been one of the biotechnology industry's successes. Sales
of Rituxan, which Idec co-markets with Genentech Inc., should reach
$1 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   However, Ende cut his Zevalin sales estimate for 2003 to $59
million, from $79 million, and reduced his 2004 Zevalin forecast to
$104 million from $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   An Idec spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Investors Sell on Fears of a Weak Shopping Season</HD>
<DH>Consumer confidence for November is lower than expected.
The Dow falls 172.98, its biggest drop since Nov. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A worse-than-expected consumer confidence report jarred Wall Street
on Tuesday, prompting some investors to cash in profits from stocks'
recent rally on fears of a tepid holiday shopping season.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the market was overdue for a pullback after sharp
gains last week. The consumer sentiment news gave investors another
reason to sell.</LD>
<LD>   "People want to see a strong confidence number, especially with
the holiday season coming up," said Stephen Carl, head of equity
trading at the Williams Capital Group. "If you don't see that, it
doesn't bode well."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 172.98 points, or 2%, to
close at 8,676.42. It was the Dow's biggest drop since it tumbled 178
points Nov. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 37.47 points, or 2.5%, to 1,444.43. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index dropped 19.57 points, or 2.1%, to 913.31.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in trading that was active but below the levels
of recent sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's reading of consumer confidence increased in
November for the first time in five months. But analysts said
investors were disappointed that the number came in below
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's widely known at this point that the Christmas shopping
season is six days shorter" because of the lateness of Thanksgiving,
said Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist for J.P. Morgan Private
Bank. "Investors are looking for signs of strong retail sales in a
shortened period so that retailers can make their earnings numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Investors shrugged off the day's good news -- reports that the
U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter and that
new-home sales, although down in October compared with September,
still enjoyed their third best monthly level ever.</TE>
<TE>   The road to a stock market recovery "is bumpy and today is a
bump," said Hugh Johnson, chairman at First Albany Asset Management.
"I don't look at it as anything more than that. Today, the skeptics
are getting their way."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow still is up 19% from its five-year low reached Oct. 9. The
Nasdaq index is up 29.6% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the economic news sent bond yields lower Tuesday. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.07% from 4.17%
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Despite the consumer confidence report, many retail stocks were
only modestly lower. Wal-Mart fell 58 cents to $53.24 and Nordstrom
slipped 32 cents to $19.49.</TE>
<TE>   * Semtech fell $3.56 to $14.55 after the semiconductor company
warned that it expected fourth-quarter earnings to fall below
analysts' expectations. The SOX index of chip stocks, which had risen
75% since early October, slid 4.4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of software maker Roxio surged 99 cents, or 23%, to $5.28
after Dell Computer agreed to include the company's new video-editing
and DVD-burning software on its PCs. Dell was off 34 cents at $28.33.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of drug maker Eli Lilly fell $4.06 to $64 after an
analyst downgraded the stock. Investors shrugged off news that Lilly
received approval for its new osteoporosis medication.</TE>
<TE>   Among other drug firms, Biogen slid $3.32 to $42.91 after Merrill
Lynch lowered the stock's rating to "sell" from "neutral."</TE>
<TE>   * HMO stocks rebounded after tumbling Monday on an analyst report
that employers are resisting premium increases. Gainers included
UnitedHealth, which rose $2.65 to $79.10 after the health insurer
said it expects 2003 earnings to be on the high end of expectations.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas markets were broadly lower. Key share indexes fell 1.4%
in Japan, 2.4% in France, 1.2% in Britain and 3.3% in Germany.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Wins $301-Million Contract From NASA to Finish Space
Plane</HD>
<DH>Vehicle will test technology that may lead to a replacement
for aging space shuttle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to develop technology to replace its aging space shuttles,
NASA said Tuesday that it has awarded Boeing Co. a $301-million
contract to complete the X-37 space plane.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing Phantom Works said it would complete its X-37 approach and
landing test vehicle and conduct flight tests as part of the Space
Launch Initiative, a $4.8-billion NASA program.</LD>
<LD>   The plane, 27.5 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet, is in final
assembly at the Boeing Phantom Works X-Vehicle Assembly Facility in
Palmdale.</LD>
<TE>   "The X-37 is a technology demonstrator, just proving certain
technologies that will ultimately lead to a replacement for the space
shuttle," said Bill Cole, a spokesman for Phantom Works, which is
based in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   With the contract, Boeing will complete the assembly of the
unmanned X-37 and conduct a flight test in April 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also initiates a design for another X-37
long-duration orbital vehicle, scheduled to be tested in July 2006.</TE>
<TE>   When fielded, the unmanned and autonomously operated X-37 will be
the only X-vehicle capable of conducting continuous on-orbit
operations for as long as 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle also will serve as a test bed for approximately 30
airframe, propulsion and operation technologies, such as a
high-temperature thermal protection system.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Deal in Bias Suit Canceled</HD>
<DH>Appeals court rejects $15-million settlement. Workers could
win more money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court threw out a $15-million settlement of a
class-action racial discrimination suit against Boeing Co. on
Tuesday, saying there was no justification for the $4 million in
lawyers' fees or the substantial disparity in payments among
plaintiffs. The ruling forces the company to reopen negotiations that
could lead to a more costly settlement or trial.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, approved in 1999, would have allowed Boeing a
relatively inexpensive resolution to a suit on behalf of 15,000 black
workers. It alleged widespread harassment and discrimination in
promotions at Boeing plants across the country, including Long Beach.
The alleged harassment included signs in workplaces that purportedly
said "whites only" and "white power," and the hanging of a noose over
a work station in a Wichita, Kan., plant.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement called for the Seattle-based company to pay $3.65
million for diversity training. An additional $3.77 million would
have been split among the 237 named plaintiffs, $3.53 million was to
have been divided among the rest of the class, and the remaining
$4.05 million was to be for lawyers fees.</LD>
<TE>   By comparison, Coca-Cola Co. agreed two years ago to pay a record
$192.5 million to settle claims brought by 2,200 current and former
employees that the company routinely discriminated against blacks.
That settlement was patterned after a 1996 agreement by Texaco Inc.
to pay 1,500 current and former employees $176 million -- the
previous record -- to end a similar suit.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voted
two-to-one to send the Boeing case back to federal district court in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   If a new settlement cannot be reached, the case could go back to
trial, said lawyers familiar with the case and with civil procedure.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for more than 200 black Boeing workers who filed the
appeal objecting to the settlement said the group wants to see a new
settlement that involves substantially more money, is distributed
more fairly and forces the company to change its promotion practices.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the evidence would show that black employees of Boeing
have not fared as well as their white counterparts, and when you take
the experiences of 15,000 people over the 10 years that this would
incorporate, that is very substantial and certainly far in excess of
the remuneration that was agreed upon by class counsel," said Alan B.
Epstein, a Philadelphia-based lawyer representing the objectors. "If
proven, the damages could be substantial."</TE>
<TE>   In the majority opinion, Circuit Judge Marsha S. Berzon said there
was no explanation for why 237 plaintiffs were to receive an average
of 16 times more than other class members. "We find no sufficient
justification in the record for this differential in the amount of
damage awards and the process for awarding them," Berzon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers who brokered the deal for the class did not return
calls.</TE>
<TE>   A Boeing spokesman said the company could not comment on the
ruling because its lawyers were still reviewing it Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman defended the settlement, saying it was "about
inclusion and moving forward together."</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of the decision, the company has been and will
continue to be committed to encouraging diversity in the workplace
and promoting equal employment opportunities for its employees,"
Boeing spokesman Ken Mercer said.</TE>
<TE>   The reversal puts the case back to square one, said Joseph
Beachboard, a Los Angeles lawyer and publisher of the California
Employment Law Letter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is relatively rare that one of these settlements gets
overturned," Beachboard said. "Usually when you have the plaintiffs
and the defendants in agreement with the terms of a settlement, the
courts will go along with that. Here you had some pretty strong
objectors, and that caused the court to take a good long look at the
case."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing rose 18 cents to close at $33.67 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Integretel to Return Porn Scheme Money, FTC Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tamra Santana</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill collecting company Integretel Inc. agreed to give up $1.6
million it charged consumers for Internet-based adult entertainment
services they never purchased, the Federal Trade Commission said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC said San Jose-based Integretel and its EBillit Inc. unit
were involved in an illegal scheme in which customers were billed for
adult "videotext" services through the international telephone
billing system. Thousands of consumers were billed an average of $127
each.</LD>
<LD>   Integretel spokesman Ken Dawson said the companies billed
customers at the request of Verity International Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   "This is consumer money that happened to be sitting in our bank
account, so we're turning it over to the FTC," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal court in New York approved the pact between the FTC and
Integretel. The FTC said it will hold the $1.6 million until its
civil claims against Verity and its owners are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The charges appeared on phone bills as an international call to
Madagascar, the trade commission said. The civil charges were filed
against Verity and its principals in October 2000, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement demonstrates that if billing companies "support
fraudulent activities, they will be held responsible for their
actions," said J. Howard Beales, director of the trade commission's
Bureau of Consumer Protection.</TE>

<HD>Maverick Stance Puts the State's Top Securities Cop in
Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Demetrios Boutris was all but unknown until this week, when
he argued for a tougher deal on analysts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To his fellow state securities regulators, California's Demetrios A.
Boutris has been an all-but-unknown quantity.</LD>
<LD>   He has been commissioner of the Department of Corporations -- the
state's top securities cop -- for less than two years. He rarely
shows up at meetings of the regulators' professional group, the North
American Securities Administrators Assn., sending a deputy instead.</LD>
<LD>   But Boutris' profile is rising quickly.</LD>
<TE>   In a public and potentially nasty split with fellow regulators
this week, Boutris said he thought a proposed settlement with Wall
Street brokerage houses over analyst conflicts of interest was too
lenient. He said other firms ought to be paying at least as much as
the $100 million that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to fork over in the
spring to settle similar charges.</TE>
<TE>   With that broadside, the 41-year-old Greek-born regulator has
grabbed a slice of the spotlight that until now has been held mainly
by friend and fellow Harvard Law grad Eliot Spitzer, who as New York
attorney general has headed the investigation of Wall Street behavior
during the 1990s bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Securities chiefs from other states are angry at Boutris for
possibly disrupting a deal that appeared to be nearing completion,
according to a regulator familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Boutris was unapologetic.</TE>
<TE>   "What my fellow regulators should do is take principled stands
relative to these negotiations," he said. Boutris said he was pushing
back against what he regarded as "an artificial deadline" --
Thanksgiving -- for wrapping up the negotiations with the remaining
dozen Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   His stance is bound to draw political heat both to him and his
boss, Gov. Gray Davis, but Boutris said he isn't inclined to accept
"take it or leave it" offers.</TE>
<TE>   Though Boutris has been a bit of a cipher to the general public,
he isn't publicity shy. He appeared on CNBC on Tuesday to explain his
position on the Wall Street negotiations, and his aides were quick to
provide background on their boss' up-by-his-bootstraps origins.</TE>
<TE>   According to Boutris' account, he moved to San Diego from Athens
at age 11, speaking no English and living with his divorced father, a
room-service waiter at a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The youth not only became the first in his family to go beyond
grade school, but also graduated first in his high school class of
250, made Phi Beta Kappa as a scholarship student at UC Berkeley and
went on to Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an ordinary bear -- he is a very bright guy," said
Mickey Kantor, who as U.S. trade representative in the Clinton White
House hired Boutris as an aide. It was a political reward for
Boutris' serving as national director of Greek Americans for Clinton
in 1992, but Kantor said Boutris handled the job well.</TE>
<TE>   Like Spitzer, Boutris is thought by friend and foe alike to be
using his post as a springboard for higher political office. Boutris
dismissed the idea Tuesday, saying, "I'm not a political person. I
don't hold elective office."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Spitzer, who has spent most of his career as a prosecutor
and securities lawyer, Boutris has seen capitalism from the inside,
serving a stint a few years ago as special counsel to renowned deal
maker Ronald O. Perelman, whose firm controls Revlon Inc., Panavision
Inc. and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Boutris says he puts in 10-to-12-hour workdays, plus a day every
weekend, but he also is a family man. He is married to Aurelia Mika
Chang, a Juilliard-trained concert pianist who has performed around
the world, and has one child.</TE>
<TE>   As a regulator, Boutris said, he has no desire to impede
legitimate business. In fact, he noted that he has reduced state
filing fees for the firms he oversees and has tried to streamline
licensing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pragmatist," he said.</TE>

<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John Rigas and his sons may use
personal assets for reasonable living expenses and to pay legal
bills, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber partially granted a company
request to limit the Rigas family's access to funds, in an order that
will remain in effect for at least 10 days. Rigas and his sons,
Timothy and Michael, should be blocked from selling or transferring
assets because they bilked Adelphia out of at least $3 billion, the
company said in court papers.</LD>

<LD>First Virtual Communications Inc. and three current and former
executives agreed to settle Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that they inflated the company's 1998 revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The executives, including the Santa Clara, Calif., company's
founder and chairman, Ralph Ungermann, agreed to pay a total of $1.3
million, the SEC said. Other officials charged were former Chief
Financial Officer James O. Mitchell and Alan J. McMillan, former vice
president of sales.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC alleged that the company inflated 1998 earnings and
revenue in a January 1999 news release. The executives sold their
company stock after the company had inflated its results, making
$620,000 in illegal profits, the SEC alleged.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit card loans written off by commercial banks jumped 35.6% to
$3.9 billion in the three months ended in September as credit quality
problems grew.</LD>
<LD>   The surge in write-offs, compared with the third quarter of 2001,
came as banks earned $23.4 billion, only $11 million short of the
record set in the second quarter of this year, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reported.</LD>
<LD>   The third-quarter profits were up 34.8% from the July-September
period last year. Still, they were held back by sharply lower income
from banks' international operations and by higher expenses for loan
losses, the FDIC said.</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Paso Corp. had credit ratings on $25 billion of debt cut to "junk"
by Moody's Investors Service on concern the company must sell assets
to make up a cash shortfall and may incur more costs to exit energy
trading.</LD>
<LD>   The downgrade will trigger calls by lenders for more collateral
for its energy-trading business, El Paso said. Failure to keep an
investment-grade rating may force El Paso to expand asset sales that
so far this year exceed $2.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The rating on El Paso's senior unsecured debt was cut to Ba2, the
third-highest rating below investment grade, from Baa3, the lowest
investment-grade rating, Moody's said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of El Paso fell $2.05, or 19.2%, to $8.63 on the New York

Former auditor Arthur Andersen had advised booking the revenue at the

<LD>US Airways Group Inc. will cut an additional 2,500 jobs, or 7.1% of
its work force, and close a maintenance base and a reservations
center in Florida as it tries to emerge from bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   The airline also said it will seek work-rule and benefits changes
from unions to compete with low-fare, low-cost rivals. Shares of
Arlington, Va.-based US Airways were unchanged at 55 cents in

<LD>Semtech Corp. shares fell as much as 17% after the semiconductor
maker said sales this quarter will fall and profit will miss
analysts' forecasts as chip demand slips.</LD>
<LD>   Camarillo-based Semtech fell $3.56 to $14.55 on the Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Demand for chips has fallen in the last two years at Semtech,
Intel Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and rivals as companies reduce
spending. Shipments to desktop-computer customers fell in the quarter
ended Oct. 27 because of supply shortages and increased competition,
Semtech said after the close of U.S. stock markets Monday.</LD>

<HD>SEC Weighs Exemption for Biotech Firm Income</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicky Stamas</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that may help California's burgeoning biotechnology
industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday proposed
allowing biotech firms to increase their income from investments
without having to register as investment companies and comply with
mutual fund regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed exemption, which the Biotechnology Industry Assn.
asked for in May, would let companies earn twice as much from certain
investments as they spend on research and development without having
to register as an investment firm.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, the companies can be exempted only if they spend more
on research than they earn on investments.</LD>
<TE>   "It means they can have a lot more investment income," said Paul
Roye, the SEC's director of investment management.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member SEC voted unanimously to float the proposal,
setting Jan. 15 as the deadline for public comments.</TE>
<TE>   The exemption would relieve biotech companies' complaints that
they are inhibited from spending on research projects, including
joint ventures with other technology firms, that can produce income
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the SEC's action," said Matthew
Chambers, a lawyer representing the Biotechnology Industry Assn. "It
will give biotechnology companies additional flexibility that will
speed drug delivery and give smaller biotech companies sources of
additional capital."</TE>
<TE>   The threat of having to register as an investment company is a
handicap for biotech firms because, under federal law, investment
companies face controls on their operations that other companies
don't.</TE>
<TE>   Under the draft rule for biotech firms, a company could qualify
for the investment company exemption if research and development were
a "substantial percentage of its total expenses for its last four
fiscal quarters combined, and equal at least half of its investment
revenues for that period."</TE>
<TE>   The draft rule addresses a growing trend among biotechnology firms
to make strategic investments in other companies in their field.
Lawyers said the rapid pace of change in biotechnology and the high
costs of research make joint ventures a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech companies are at a disadvantage because many of the drugs
and other products they develop are subject to numerous reviews and
approvals by federal regulators, the SEC said. At the same time, they
"have few tangible assets and often hold large amounts of capital in
liquid instruments so that funds are readily accessible for research
and development," the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, investment income at biotech companies often
increases at a faster rate than research budgets.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Tuesday, the SEC proposed to make permanent a rule
change allowing U.S. companies to accelerate stock buyback programs
in the aftermath of any market emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's terrorist attacks, U.S. stock markets closed for
four days. When they reopened, the SEC implemented emergency rules
letting public companies repurchase their stock without following
normal restrictions on buybacks. The goal was to help support share
prices amid heavy selling by panicked investors.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed permanent change in the rules would allow companies
to buy back their stock, in amounts up to 100% of the shares' average
daily trading volume, after any "market-wide trading suspension."</TE>

<HD>Ad Urges Buffett Not to Buy Burger King Chain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barry Bedlan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OMAHA -- A retired industrialist who has spent millions urging
Americans to stay away from fatty foods is asking billionaire
investor Warren Buffett not to purchase the Burger King chain.</LD>
<LD>   Omaha businessman Phil Sokolof ran an open-letter ad in Tuesday's
Omaha World-Herald addressed to Buffett, who also lives in Omaha,
where his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is based.</LD>
<LD>   "Buying a mammoth business whose incredibly high-calorie, horribly
high-fat foods lead to obesity, diabetes and heart disease would be
unconscionable for a man of your stature," the letter said.</LD>
<TE>   Berkshire Hathaway has been mentioned as a possible bidder for
Miami-based Burger King. The chain is being sold by its parent
company, Diageo of London.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire officials have declined to comment on what they
described as speculation. Buffett's office did not return a call for
comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King's vice president of corporate communications, Rob
Doughty, said Sokolof's statements were unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "He's making uneducated statements," Doughty said.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King was the first chain to offer burgers made from
vegetable byproducts, and it is expanding its salad choices, Doughty
said. He also said the restaurant has long allowed its customers to
make health-conscious changes to their orders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about consumer choice. Consumers have responsibility for
their diets," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks to Erase Tariffs on Manufactured Goods by 2015</HD>
<DH>The proposal, which includes heavily protected textiles,
goes to the WTO next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, searching for a way to jump-start moribund
global trade negotiations, announced a bold negotiating proposal
Tuesday to eliminate border taxes on manufactured goods by 2015.</LD>
<LD>   The administration said its plan would amount to an $18-billion
annual tax cut, the amount that the government collected last year in
manufacturing tariffs on everything from automobiles and airplanes to
shirts and shoes.</LD>
<LD>   "Our proposal would turn every corner store in America into a
duty-free shop for working families," U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Zoellick said. "This historic proposal would benefit the
average American family of four with an extra $1,600 a year."</LD>
<TE>   Seeking to drive home the effect on consumers, the administration
invited managers from a suburban Wal-Mart store to pose with two
identical shopping baskets full of clothing and other items that
currently sell for $202 but could be bought for $170 should the
border taxes be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal will be presented next week at a negotiating
session of the 144-nation World Trade Organization in Geneva,
Switzerland. The WTO has made little progress toward narrowing
differences over a new round of global trade talks that were launched
late last year in Doha, Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   Deep divisions exist on how best to reduce trade barriers not only
on manufactured goods but also on agricultural products and on
services.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal would phase out border taxes on nonagricultural
goods in a two-step process. From 2005, when the current Doha round
of trade talks is scheduled to be completed, to 2010, all tariffs
that are currently at 5% or less would be eliminated, and tariffs
higher than this level would have to be lowered to no more than 8%.</TE>
<TE>   In phase two, the 8% tariffs would be lowered in steps each year,
starting in 2010 until the tariffs were eliminated by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Big U.S. manufacturing companies, which have long complained that
high tariffs keep their goods out of poor countries, praised the
administration proposal as a way to boost U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   American companies that have spent years successfully lobbying
Congress for protection from imports of such products as clothing,
textiles and glassware said the U.S. proposal would result in the
loss of more American jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Auggie Tantillo, Washington coordinator of the American Textile
Trade Action Coalition, said that American textile and apparel
companies have lost 700,000 jobs since 1995 and more than 200 plants
have closed in just the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. textile industry is in the worst crisis of its history,"
Tantillo said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the administration obviously waited until after the
congressional elections to unveil this trade proposal because
officials knew "it would not be overly popular in the hinterlands."</TE>
<TE>   The Zero Tariff Coalition, composed of companies across a broad
range of U.S. industry, praised the proposal.</TE>

<HD>UC to Diversify Stock Pickers</HD>
<DH>With a portfolio that trails benchmarks, the regents opt
for help from outside managers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who can, do. Those who can't, hire out.</LD>
<LD>   That seems to be the message from the University of California's
regents when it comes to picking stocks. They have decided that UC's
in-house investment staff should no longer manage a big chunk of the
system's $47.4 billion in pension and endowment assets.</LD>
<LD>   The UC system disclosed Tuesday that it will hire outside money
managers to handle $13.8 billion of domestic stock assets, taking
those funds away from in-house staff.</LD>
<TE>   Most major public pension funds rely at least in part on outside
experts. By contrast, UC had long opted to go it alone. But the
system's stock pickers didn't earn a passing grade: The staff-run
U.S. stock portion of UC's employee retirement fund trailed market
benchmarks in the 12 months, five years and 10 years ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10-year period, for example, the UC fund's stocks gained an
average of 10.3% annually. That trailed the 11.6% average return of
the fund's benchmarks, which had been the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and
currently is a version of the broader Russell 3,000 index that
excludes tobacco stocks (adopted as the target in June 2000).</TE>
<TE>   "The decision was based on a lengthy review of the portfolios, on
the basis that they have under-performed," said UC spokeswoman Abby
Lunardini.</TE>
<TE>   She said the funds have been under scrutiny for about 18 months,
since David Russ became the system's treasurer. Russ had been an
investment manager at the University of Texas and before that oversaw
a portfolio for Pacific Telesis, now SBC Communications.</TE>
<TE>   The UC shift also will mean diversifying from a large-stock
strategy to a range of equity strategies, the treasurer's office
said. The greater diversification and the use of multiple outside
managers are aimed at limiting risk as well as improving performance,
the office said.</TE>
<TE>   For a public fund, managing money in house can be less expensive
than contracting with outside managers. But any savings can be wiped
out if the portfolio's performance is sub-par.</TE>
<TE>   In UC's case, weak returns in the long run could limit the fund's
ability to pay pension benefits or supply resources for the system's
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Many other public pension funds, including the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, have long used outside managers to
handle at least a portion of assets. "We're kind of an anomaly,"
Lunardini said.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey and Texas state pension funds are among the few
large public funds run exclusively in house, experts said -- although
New Jersey is reconsidering that decision in the wake of recent heavy
losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it is not the common practice and there are so many
outside managers available that can make a compelling case for
themselves, the pressure on funds that still rely on internal
management is great," said Chris McNickle, managing director at
Greenwich Associates, an investment consulting and research firm in
Greenwich, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's particularly easy in the current markets to make mistakes
that really hurt" a portfolio, he added.</TE>
<TE>   UC's decision comes amid the worst bear market in a generation --
and amid predictions that smart stock picking could be a difficult
challenge for several years because of the murky economic outlook and
still-high valuations of many shares.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't certain that outside managers can do better than UC's
in-house staff, of course. But that won't stop firms from bidding for
the potentially lucrative UC contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said bidders could include major players in the pension
arena such as Barclays Global Investors, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.,
Fidelity Investments, Morgan Stanley and Wellington Management Co.</TE>
<TE>   At UC, the change will cost the jobs of nine of the system's 26
investment management professionals, Lunardini said. Two of the
displaced managers already have landed other jobs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting in January, the regents will spell out the criteria
for selecting outside managers, Lunardini said. In the interim the
money will be stashed in the Russell 3,000 tobacco-free index fund
run by State Street Global Advisors, which already handles the 30% of
stock assets that UC invests "passively" -- that is, simply to match
major indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Of the money being shifted, $11.4 billion comes from the system's
defined-benefit pension plan, $1.4 billion from endowment pools and
$1 billion from the 403(b) retirement savings plan.</TE>
<TE>   UC apparently will continue to manage its bond investments in
house. The bond team has beaten its benchmark indexes over the last
10 years, UC said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Shift Its Focus to Telecom</HD>
<DH>As income from entertainment assets drops, the firm
considers increasing its stake in Cegetel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't long ago that Vivendi Universal was on its way to
transforming itself into a glitzy media-and-entertainment
conglomerate that controls a Hollywood studio, theme parks and the
world's largest music company.</LD>
<LD>   Now, its future may lie with a less glamorous product: the
telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi on Tuesday gave the clearest signal yet that it may seek
to become a bigger player in the telecommunications business when
executives announced that the company has lined up $1.3 billion in
financing as it considers expanding its stake in Cegetel, which owns
lucrative French mobile phone company SFR.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for Vivendi's apparently growing interest in telecom is
clear: Cegetel, which has 16 million subscribers, has been a cash cow
for Vivendi. That was underscored Tuesday when Vivendi reported that
Cegetel's operating income grew 64% to $456 million in the third
quarter, accounting for one-third of Vivendi's operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Vivendi Universal Entertainment saw its operating
income fall 30% to $220 million in the third quarter, reflecting a
thinner slate of movies, declines in theme park attendance and
weakness at the USA cable network. Universal Music Group's operating
income dropped 89% to $15.8 million, which the company mostly blamed
on higher recording and artists' costs.</TE>
<TE>   The maneuvering for possible control of Cegetel comes as new
Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou seeks to define a new
future for his beleaguered company.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as September, he vowed that Vivendi would remain an
entertainment and media company with a sizable stake in telecom. But
some analysts question whether Vivendi might in fact seek to
restructure itself as primarily a telecom business that maintains a
stake in entertainment and media.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fourtou has until Dec. 10 to indicate whether he'll go
forward with the Cegetel purchase, "it would seem like Vivendi is
going to end up being a telecom company," said New York money manager
Dennis Leibowitz.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain, some say: Fourtou no longer has the luxury
of rebuffing bids for the U.S. entertainment group such as the
$13-billion offer made recently by Los Angeles mogul Marvin Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely puts more pressure on Fourtou and raises the
possibility of an outright sale," said Paul Kim, an analyst with
Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Jacques Espinasse,
Vivendi's chief operating officer, conceded as much: "We have an
obligation to look at all offers that are presented to us ....Do I
think in two years' time these assets will be ... part of [Vivendi]?
I do not know."</TE>
<TE>   He stopped short of saying Vivendi had decided to increase its
Cegetel stake but added that such a scenario is possible because
"Vivendi Universal's cash crisis is now over."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis offer, which came to light last week, has put the
Universal assets in play and is expected to draw out offers from
other potential suitors. Several parties, including NBC, Viacom Inc.
and cable mogul John Malone, have in the past expressed interest in
the various assets.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis camp seized on Vivendi's financial results to justify
Davis' $13-billion offer, which the Paris company has dismissed as
too low.</TE>
<TE>   "You have these extremely strong entertainment assets that are not
being maximized, not because the people in charge aren't good -- they
are terrific -- [but] because they are part of a larger company where
the focus is elsewhere," a source close to Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fourtou has not given any indication that he wants to pull
entirely out of Hollywood. In fact, Vivendi said this month that
Fourtou would join Barry Diller as co-chief of a reconfigured
entertainment group.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Fourtou say he and Diller are preparing to fold
the entertainment group into a separately traded company next year.
There has been widespread speculation that Vivendi would be a major
investor in the new company and that Diller would head it. Diller has
taken steps to slash costs to prepare the businesses for a possible
spinoff, studio sources say.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, Fourtou is mostly focused on Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, which owns 44% of the company, wants to own a majority
stake so it can have access to Cegetel's cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   But Vivendi faces competition for control of Cegetel from
Britain's Vodafone, which has made an offer to buy Vivendi's stake
and that of two other owners. Vivendi has two weeks to make its own
bid or accept Vodafone's nearly $7-billion offer for Vivendi's share
in Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, however, probably faces pressure from fellow French board
members to hold on to the successful French company, investors say.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to weigh the notion that this is a French guy," said
Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Asset Management, which owns about 5 million
shares. "He wants to leave his legacy in France."</TE>
<TE>   Some investors were puzzled that Fourtou didn't immediately accept
Vodafone's offer given Vivendi's massive debt.</TE>
<TE>   That piled up during a three-year buying spree to transform a
150-year-old water utility into a global media giant by merging with
Seagram Co.'s Universal properties and European television and film
company Canal Plus. The acquisition binge left Vivendi on the verge
of bankruptcy this summer. Since then, Fourtou has bought himself
some breathing room by securing new loans and selling assets.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi further strengthened its cash position Sunday with a deal
to sell its remaining 40% stake in its water utility, raising nearly
$1.8 billion this year and an additional $2.1 billion by 2004. The
company expects to raise $7 billion by year's end, Espinasse said.</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives say Tuesday's results come as no surprise given
that Universal Pictures released fewer movies and didn't have a slate
of blockbusters like last year, when it dominated the box office with
such hits as "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music Group, with artists such as Bon Jovi and Eminem,
was hurt by higher recording costs and an industry sales slowdown
blamed on rampant piracy on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Vivendi reported a net loss of $1.22 billion, or $1.12 a
share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $951 million, or
91.2 cents, a year earlier. The results included one-time costs from
the sale of Boston-based publisher Houghton Mifflin Co. and Italian
pay-TV company Telepiu.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom, SEC Agree to Partial Settlement of Case</HD>
<DH>A federal judge approves a deal in which the firm accepts
allegations of fraud and agrees not to violate securities laws in the
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Tuesday approved a partial settlement in a securities
fraud case against WorldCom Inc., in which the telephone company
accepted allegations of fraud and agreed not to violate securities
laws in the future.</LD>
<LD>   "This shows the company has made laudable progress in moving
toward a much more positive position and the correction of past
mistakes," U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said in a hearing in New
York.</LD>
<LD>   Rakoff said WorldCom agreed to retain consultants to perform a
separate review of the company's internal accounting controls and
policies. It also will undertake a mandatory training program for all
its officers and employees involved in accounting and financial
reporting.</LD>
<TE>   A monitor appointed in the case also will continue its efforts and
its role may be expanded by the court. The federal court also will
determine what penalty WorldCom will face for past violations, Rakoff
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a critical prerequisite to going forward with a rescue
of WorldCom," said James Owers, professor of finance at Robinson
College of Business at Georgia State University in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "All of those questions [about WorldCom's viability] will be eased
in terms of the employees who work there but probably most critically
for clients' potential to do business" with WorldCom, Owers said.
"This is a major clearing of the stage."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom still faces shareholder lawsuits and probes by Congress.
The SEC, which regulates financial markets, charged WorldCom in June
with fraud and alleged that the company manipulated its financial
records to meet Wall Street expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom filed the world's largest corporate
bankruptcy case in July and has said it expects to restate more than
$9 billion in earnings.</TE>
<TE>   This month, WorldCom named Michael Capellas, former president of
Palo Alto-based computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co., as its new
chairman and chief executive, effective Dec. 2. It also has hired
restructuring experts and named new board members to fix the problems
of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Four former WorldCom executives have pleaded guilty to securities
fraud and have agreed to cooperate with authorities probing the case.
Former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan, who the company
fired in June, has been indicted on seven counts of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The partial settlement with the SEC will go further toward helping
WorldCom regain the trust of Wall Street and customers, legal experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does it put the SEC litigation behind WorldCom, but also
sends a very strong message to investors and bondholders and lenders
that [the company is] making peace with the government and you can
bank on us in the future," said David Howard, a partner with law firm
Dechert in Philadelphia.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann Completes Purchase of Zomba Music</HD>
<DH>The $2.7-billion deal comes as the popularity of the
label's teen pop acts is waning and amid the resignation of its CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertelsmann completed its $2.7-billion pact to buy Zomba Music Group
on Tuesday, hailing the acquisition as a sign of its growing strength
in the global music business.</LD>
<LD>   Industry insiders see it as something else: absurd.</LD>
<LD>   Bertelsmann, critics say, drastically overpaid for Zomba and will
be hard pressed to generate a return on its investment.</LD>
<TE>   The Zomba deal could go down as the most expensive label
acquisition ever -- dwarfing the price tags of such legendary labels
as Interscope, Geffen, Island, A&amp;M and Motown.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the declining state of the music industry, it's nearly
impossible to square away any multibillion-dollar transaction for
just one label. It makes no sense," said Michael B. Nathanson, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly when you could buy EMI, a corporation with a
profitable publishing arm and a 100-year-old catalog that includes
the Beatles and Frank Sinatra," Nathanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, EMI Group, a British music powerhouse that is triple the
size of Zomba, has a market value of $1.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Zomba deal, originally announced in June, closes the book on a
series of costly moves by the executives who formerly ran
Bertelsmann's music division.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions by former BMG Chairman Michael Dornemann and his chief
executive, Strauss Zelnick, prompted years of executive turmoil and
cost the German conglomerate billions of dollars, sources said. Both
executives were forced out of their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of a 1991 agreement struck by Dornemann allowed Zomba
founder and Chief Executive Clive Calder to exercise an option to
sell Bertelsmann the remaining 80% stake of his company if Zomba hit
specific sales targets. At the time, Dornemann never dreamed that
Zomba would hit the targets, BMG insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   But Calder, cashing in on the global success of such discoveries
as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, decided to force
Bertelsmann's hand in June.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann -- already struggling with a $4-billion debt load --
has said it plans to help underwrite the Zomba acquisition by raising
up to $1 billion in a bond offering.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann takes charge of Zomba at a time when the teen pop
craze is fading. Zomba also faces several legal challenges: R&amp;B
crooner R. Kelly, one of its top stars, was arrested in June on child
pornography charges, and the Backstreet Boys sued the label on
Tuesday for breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   Calder resigned Tuesday immediately after the $2.7-billion
transaction was announced. Calder's right-hand man, Barry Weiss, will
run the Zomba label under Bertlesmann.</TE>

<HD>Yes, but Are You Happy?</HD>
<DH>Money may be good, but friends -- be they real or imaginary
-- are better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The most I can do for my friend is simply to be his friend." Henry
Thoreau said that.</LD>
<LD>   Sound advice with the holidays upon us. Particularly since many of
my friends are downcast. Just look at the drift in the world around
us, they say.</LD>
<LD>   I have been. And for the sake of my friends, I'm happy to report a
happy trend. After way too long studying what makes us miserable,
social scientists are turning their thoughts to the opposite: What
are the sources of our well-being?</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, we are told, the good life rests on the obvious,
like having friends. But coming upon the self-evident and
understanding it are not necessarily the same. For instance, British
researcher Michael Argyle, a professor of social psychology at Oxford
who died earlier this year, found that watching soap operas on TV was
a source of "a great deal of happiness" for some people.</TE>
<TE>   "One theory," he reported, "is that through doing it, they are
making imaginary friends."</TE>
<TE>   There's a thought that could veer in many strange directions, no
doubt. But the truth is that happiness and its various component
parts, in particular friendship, remain one of the least explored,
most understudied facets of human life. That's why the new scientific
emphasis on our well-being is such an encouraging development. If
nothing else, it reminds us that getting the most out of life
requires more than surmounting its problems.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to dismiss, certainly not entirely, any of the many
popular neuroses that have people in their grip, real and imagined.
But perhaps we've gotten carried away. Obsessed with victimhood and
surrounded by evidence of social derangements, we are losing track of
those things that provide natural recourse.</TE>
<TE>   I am not the first to note that antidepressant drugs receive far
more attention, in the news and in the laboratory, than do the
circumstances that might reduce their need.</TE>
<TE>   David Myers, a social psychologist at Hope College in Michigan,
surveyed the published literature in psychology since 1887 and
reported 85,938 mentions of depression but only 3,912 of happiness
and 5,485 of friendship.</TE>
<TE>   In his book "The Pursuit of Happiness," Myers concludes that those
scientists who bother looking find strong correlation between friends
and one's self-esteem, career satisfaction, longevity and health. "We
humans are made to belong," he concludes.</TE>
<TE>   So here's to your health, friends. And to what we hope will be a
growing awareness of the things that count.</TE>
<TE>   In one published study of 800 college graduates, individuals who
sought high incomes and career prestige were twice as likely to
classify themselves as unhappy compared with classmates who gave a
higher priority to friends and a close marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Kahneman, a Princeton economist, has added new legitimacy
to the scientific study of our well-being. He received the Nobel
Prize in economics this year for his insight into how people
intuitively account for risk in making decisions. He's now pursuing
questions of our happiness. In a published interview, he said
preliminary findings foretold "the huge importance of friends. People
are really happier with friends than they are with their families or
their spouse or their child."</TE>
<TE>   For many today, the problem with friends has become time and
distance. Our hours at work and our commutes to get there are both
lengthening and may already have rendered us more or less perpetually
exhausted. Then, according to the Census Bureau, the average American
moves 11.7 times in a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that many people regard their spouse or lover as
their best friend, the news is not good either. The percentage of the
population living alone has tripled since 1940, and the share of
single-parent households has more than doubled during the last
generation. Thoreau's advice to be friends to our friends has never
been more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   In my experience, e-mail and telephones bring friends close again
in time of crisis, but otherwise serve chiefly as maintenance and
little more. Maybe this explains the astonishing popularity of the
suburbia computer game Sims, where friends and the unceremonious
social life associated with friends can be summoned to the screen --

<TE>   What's clear is that Reagan-esque strategies for success through
individual competition, like many good ideas, can be pursued to
extremes.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Twain might have been wrong when he said "grief can take care
of itself." But he surely was not when he added: "To get the full
value of joy, you must have somebody to share it with."</TE>

<TE>   By the way: In a column earlier this month, I was wrong in saying
that two Democratic senators were killed in airplane crashes in
recent years. Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri was not elected senator
until after his death.</TE>

<HD>Wheels of Commerce Are Rolling Over the Homeless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alice Callaghan</AU>
<BD>Alice Callaghan, an Episcopal priest, directs Las
Familias del Pueblo, a nonprofit community center in downtown Los
Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bumps slept curled by the trash bin. It was 6:30 a.m., Thanksgiving
less than two weeks away, yet the rancid air was heavy with
summer-like heat. David and Faustino, members of the Catholic Worker
community, left their soup kitchen as six police cars swarmed down on
the homeless sleeping on Gladys Street.</LD>
<LD>   Faustino, a brown-skinned fourth-generation American born in
Kansas, was ordered against the wall. David, a white-skinned
American, was not, and his simple, unsubstantiated claim that
Faustino was a member of Catholic Worker secured Faustino's release.</LD>
<LD>   There has been another raid since that first one. Police and
business leaders insist that they carefully targeted criminals and
were not out to harass the homeless and poor of skid row. Just the
day before, business and political leaders unveiled their plan to
clear skid row sidewalks. A civic party is about to get underway
downtown, and the poor and homeless are not invited. "Downtown Los
Angeles is on the cusp of an urban renaissance," the leaders
declared.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, these business and City Hall heavyweights, led by
billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad, went to New York the week
before, inviting real estate moguls like Donald Trump to the party.
Trump declared downtown Los Angeles depressing. "It needs people," he
noted. Bumps is not whom he had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   The business community plan, "Downtown's Human Tragedy: It's Not
Acceptable Anymore," begins by asserting that downtown does not have
a homeless crisis but rather a health and safety crisis. No longer
acceptable is the visibility of homelessness. Its misery is barely
noted.</TE>
<TE>   The plan says the few who are "temporarily homeless" through
circumstances not in their control will be aided by existing
services. Beyond this empty offer, the business community turns a
cold shoulder to the rest of skid row. The plan acknowledges L.A.'s
housing shortage but says "this plan will not address housing issues
at all." Notwithstanding "compassion for those in need," it is
necessary for society to "take back our streets from those who cannot
help themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is not the streets in the financial district that the
business community wants to take back. No encampments and few
homeless linger there. It is the streets of skid row. There,
speculators and developers see huge financial opportunity and, with
city support, already have begun to convert skid row's low-cost
housing to high-rent lofts.</TE>
<TE>   Living on city sidewalks is unacceptable to everyone, especially
the homeless. However, until and unless sufficient and acceptable
shelter is available, the city cannot order people off skid row
sidewalks. There are hundreds fewer shelter beds and affordable
housing units than in the past. Skid row sidewalks are the housing of
last resort. Every affordable housing unit on skid row has a waiting
list. Providing jobs, mental health services and addiction programs
will not get the homeless off sidewalks. Only affordable housing can
do that.</TE>
<TE>   Come January, the civic heavyweights promise to begin arresting
homeless sleeping on sidewalks and stop church groups from handing
out food. It is a cynical calculation that public concern for the
homeless will be put away with the Christmas ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   The business plan states that "a civilized society should not ever
condone people living on the street in squalor." The homeless would
agree. A civilized city ensures that all citizens have the
fundamental human needs of food and shelter.</TE>

<HD>Hard Part Will Be Waging Peace in Iraq</HD>
<DH>Ethnic divisions preclude a 'light' intervention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Levitsky</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levitsky was counselor to the U.S. ambassador
to the U.N. from 1999 to 2001 and supervised Balkans issues.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the likelihood of war with Iraq increases, the time has come for
the president to speak more clearly about how we will win the peace.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has said little other than that the United
States will help rebuild Iraq as a stable democracy. Options
apparently range from a "light" intervention and a quick handoff to
local authorities to a U.S. military governorship styled after
postwar Germany and Japan. But there is more recent history the
administration should turn to for guidance: the challenges the
Clinton administration faced in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Riven by ethnic and religious divisions that have long been
suppressed by a powerful central government, the situation in Iraq
bears important similarities to the Balkans before Yugoslavia's
breakup. Here is what the U.S. will face the day after Saddam Hussein
is gone:</LD>
<TE>   The Kurds in the north will wish to enhance the autonomy they have
developed under the protection of the U.S./British- enforced "no-fly"
zones and perhaps even aspire to independence. The repressed Shiites
in the south, a majority in the nation, will seek a greater voice in
government, and some may desire closer ties with Iran. Smaller
groups, such as Turkoman and Christian sects, may come under threat.
And all will resist continued rule by the Sunni minority, with or
without Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Under these circumstances, ideas for a "light" intervention seem
profoundly misguided.</TE>
<TE>   Building a functioning state in postwar Iraq, much less a tolerant
and democratic society, will not be quick or easy. Seven years after
the Dayton peace accords ended the brutal war in Bosnia, and more
than three years after the conclusion of the conflict in Kosovo,
enormous progress has been made. But the international community's
task will not be complete for years.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's government will need to be rebuilt from the ground up,
based on principles of federalism to accommodate ethnic and religious
divisions, but with central institutions strong enough to hold the
nation together. Designing these institutions, gaining Iraqi support
for them, holding elections and mediating disputes will require years
of international supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that Iraqis do not threaten each other or their neighbors
and that Iraq does not become a failed state and terrorist haven will
require a massive international security force at the start. Troops
will need to remain, at reduced levels, for many years.</TE>
<TE>   To succeed, the effort to rebuild Iraq must be truly multilateral.
International administrators will be there for a long time, and it is
critical that they be seen as legitimate by the Iraqis and the other
people of the region.</TE>
<TE>   Broad international participation under U.S. leadership is
necessary to achieve this goal. NATO allies should play a key role,
with regional powers as part of the postwar coalition. Russia and
France, whose attitudes toward the conflict we can expect to be at
best ambivalent, should know they will be welcome in building the
peace. The U.N. Security Council's blessing would help, though we
should avoid the bureaucracy and loss of control that come with
creating a U.N. peacekeeping mission.</TE>
<TE>   Our partners can be important contributors to the postwar military
force, freeing American troops for other duties. And their support in
building a civilian administration is critical.</TE>
<TE>   In Kosovo and Bosnia, it took far too long for civilian capacity
to catch up with the military presence, and that was with the help of
experts provided by partners around the world.</TE>
<TE>   We will need the same assistance in Iraq, in areas ranging from
police to elections and judicial reform. The administration's recent
efforts to reach out for support are a good first step. But these
gestures will fall short unless followed up with meaningful
engagement of partners.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly defining our plans for a viable end to the conflict, one
that includes a deep role for allies and partners, will help gather
backing for the war from those who might otherwise doubt our
intentions. And it is our best chance for success at the far more
difficult job of winning the peace.</TE>

<HD>A Winning $700-Billion Balancing Act</HD>
<DH>To begin regaining ground, Democrats must attack Bush's
estate tax cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert B. Reich</AU>
<BD>Robert B. Reich, a former secretary of Labor, is a
professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University and
the founder and national editor of the American Prospect. A version
of this essay appears in the Dec. 16 issue of that magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've got great holiday news for you. Starting as soon as possible,
you'll be relieved of payroll taxes on the first $20,000 of your
income.</LD>
<LD>   The tax holiday will last two years. That means about $5,000 extra
to your family, if you're a typical two-earner household. Ballpark
cost to the government over the two years: $700 billion. How to pay
for it? Repeal President Bush's estate tax cut, which will also cost
around $700 billion if made permanent.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get too excited yet. First, you and I need to convince
Democrats that this is a smart move and strike fear in the hearts of
enough Republicans to get it passed and signed.</LD>
<TE>   Bush has a different plan, of course. His goal is to make
permanent his whopping $1.35-trillion tax cut, including the estate
tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans love forcing Democrats to vote for or against tax
cuts. It puts Democrats into a Republican box. Bush did it last year,
and it worked. Having lost both houses of Congress in recent years,
Democrats should have learned their lesson. Avoid the Republican box.
Instead, force Republicans into a Democratic box. Make them choose
between a payroll tax cut for more than 130 million working families
or a tax cut for the richest 2% of American families. If Republicans
are too dumb to choose a payroll tax cut over an estate tax cut,
Democrats should blast them.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone hates taxes, but the payroll tax is about the worst. Four
out of five American workers pay more in payroll taxes than they do
in income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The payroll tax is also regressive; poorer workers pay
proportionately more. It's paid out of the first dollar earned, all
the way up to a threshold that's now about $80,000. After that,
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy earners pay only the tiny Medicare portion of the payroll
tax on all their earnings. So the very rich finish paying early in
the year. Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates is done a few minutes
past midnight, Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   True, poorer retirees get back more each year from Social Security
and Medicare than do richer retirees relative to the taxes they
contributed when they worked. But poorer retirees don't live nearly
as long; so overall, the system is still regressive.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of World War II, only 2% of federal revenue came from
payroll taxes; now, it's 37%. The estate tax, on the other hand, is
almost a mirror image of the payroll tax: 98% of American families
don't come near it, because it now affects only people who die with a
net worth of more than $1 million. A quarter of all estate taxes came
from just 467 families, each of whom was worth more than $20 million.
We're talking about the super, super rich.</TE>
<TE>   A payroll tax cut would be a boon to the economy, stimulating more
spending just when we need it. If you hadn't noticed, the economy is
almost comatose. The Federal Reserve Board can't get it moving even
after 12 rate cuts because there aren't enough customers for all the
goods and services that can be produced. The best way to get
consumers to buy more is to put more money in their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   And since employers would no longer have to pay their share of
payroll taxes, they'd have an extra incentive to keep more people on
their payrolls. The Bush estate tax cut gives more money to a handful
of rich families who already spend as much as they want.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone worried that a payroll tax cut would hurt Social Security
or Medicare doesn't understand federal budgeting. Every tax dollar
the government collects is the same as every other dollar. Repeal the
estate tax cut and prevent it from becoming permanent and the federal
government gains $700 billion, making up for the $700 billion it
loses by cutting the payroll tax for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Framing it as a choice between the two cuts also draws public
attention to the scandal of the widening gap of income and wealth in
the United States over the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats had no message in 2002 and paid the price. Bush had a
tax cut and a war on terrorism. You can't fight something with
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   If Democrats want to win back at least one chamber of Congress and
have a fair chance of regaining the White House in two years, they'll
have to fashion a tough but humane foreign policy along with a plan
to get the economy moving.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, they'll need to remind Americans what's at stake:
a democratic society that offers the world a model of equity and
opportunity or one run mainly by and for people at the top.</TE>

<HD>Europe: No to Extremism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The poor showing of the extremist Austrian Freedom Party, which won
only 10% of the vote in national elections Sunday, is a big setback
for the European far right. The party's chameleon-like leader, Joerg
Haider, has been a symbol to anti-immigrant parties across Europe,
but his party's collapse suggests that though ugly vestiges of
Europe's past will always remain, the basic stability of Western
European democracy is proving itself.</LD>
<LD>   When Haider's party scored a shocking 27% in elections in 1999,
expressions of international fear and outrage included European Union
sanctions and Israel's withdrawal of its ambassador from Vienna.
Although the reaction may have been overstated -- Austria was never
in danger of failing as a democracy -- the concern was
understandable.</LD>
<LD>   Haider has always sought to distance himself from the aura of
brownshirts and toothbrush mustaches. Instead, the Austrian, with his
ski-instructor good looks, has tried to represent a kind of modern
yuppie fascism, portraying himself as a freedom fighter against an
oppressive EU bureaucracy and against those who would condemn the
nation's Nazi past. He has called for slashing taxes and played the
innocent provocateur in praising Nazi-era employment policies and
referring to concentration camps as mere "punishment camps."</LD>
<TE>   Haider's behavior, which includes meeting several times with Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein, seems to have turned off voters. Austria,
like other countries on the continent, faces a sputtering economy.
But voters did not buy the scapegoating of immigrants for economic
problems this time; instead they backed the program of the mainstream
conservative People's Party, which won 42% of the vote and is pushing
further integration into the European Union and privatization of
state-owned enterprises. The Social Democrats endorsed some tax cuts
and won 37%.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Haider and his remaining followers will continue to
flicker on Austria's political landscape. But coupled with Swiss
voters' rejection, also Sunday, of a nationalist initiative that
would have essentially closed off the country to all asylum seekers,
it was not a good weekend for reactionaries in Europe. Both
developments indicate that there is a great deal of room for hope
that the appeal of xenophobia and extremism in Europe is not gaining.</TE>

<HD>New Church-Indian Divide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Juaneno Indians' fight to preserve an ancient village site in San
Juan Capistrano echoes the centuries-old unease between indigenous
Californians and Roman Catholic settlers. The Native Americans were
there first but, as usual, never got a property deed. Teenagers will
play ball over what may be Indian graves unless the factionalized
Juaneno band and a Catholic high school enter good-faith talks. The
struggle is just one chapter in California's spotty record of
preserving sites precious to the land's earlier residents.</LD>
<LD>   The 29 acres in question contain the remains of a village,
Putiidhem, founded in the 1400s and a rare "mother village" from
which other Indian settlements sprang. The villages in turn attracted
Catholic missionaries, who picked a nearby spot for Mission San Juan
Capistrano. Strange to say, the Juanenos' claim on the land was
strengthened by the mission fathers, who chronicled Indian
genealogies. Thus some living Juanenos can trace their ancestry to
the village.</LD>
<LD>   Now a new Catholic high school wants to put its athletic buildings
and playing fields on the site. One Juaneno faction approves; the
other two are outraged. Fanning the discontent is the school's name:
Junipero Serra High, JSerra for short, after the missionary whom many
California Indians accused of destroying much of their culture.</LD>
<TE>   Some Juanenos want the entire parcel left untouched as a sacred
site, though archeologists think the main part of the village was
limited to about five acres. The primary issue is the remains of
ancestors. Seven sets of remains have been found, and archeologists
are certain there are more.</TE>
<TE>   The Juanenos are not (yet) federally recognized and thus have no
cash-generating casino. This is not a rich tribe that could buy the
land. The Catholic school, for its part, has struggled to find a big
parcel of flat land, a rarity in Orange County. As a compromise,
putting aside part of the land, especially the five key acres, may be
possible and certainly makes sense. But JSerra's actions have
prompted mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, school officials said they would talk only to the
Juaneno tribal leader most sympathetic to them because he was the
only one recognized by the state. That's untrue; all three factions
are recognized by the state, and school officials say they realize
that now. Still, despite 20 years of archeological evidence, they
continue to question whether Putiidhem was on their land.</TE>
<TE>   State law lauds preservation of such sites, but does little to
bring it about. Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a stronger measure last
session, with the valid criticism that the wording gave Indian tribes
too much power over land planning. Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco)
plans to bring the measure back; under it, Putiidhem probably would
qualify for stronger protection.</TE>
<TE>   Recent federal legislation would pump $10 million into
California's aging missions, including the 196-year-old Great Stone
Church at Mission San Juan Capistrano. A worthy goal -- but it should
be accompanied by a concerted effort to preserve less scenic,
untouristy Native American sites that in some cases existed thousands
of years before those missions.</TE>

<LD>This time around, the rules in Iraq are tougher. Hans Blix, the
United Nations' chief weapons inspector, says that as his teams go
into the field today they will assume that Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction unless it proves otherwise. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Monday that Baghdad must fully cooperate with inspectors
to avoid military conflict -- no more cat and mouse, no more taking
truckloads of who knows what out the back door.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of tough, consistent demand, backed by the threat of a
U.S.-led invasion, is necessary to push Iraq to open its factories,
government buildings and presidential compounds to inspectors.
Baghdad is more likely to lie, cheat and evade if it perceives a
split among members of the Security Council, which, pushed hard by
the United States, revived U.N. weapons inspections.</LD>
<LD>   The 17 inspectors in the advance guard are expected to begin their
work with visits to sites where previous teams installed cameras and
other monitoring equipment before leaving Iraq nearly four years ago.
The withdrawal followed Baghdad's obstruction of inspectors in
defiance of U.N. resolutions and preceded four nights of bombing by
U.S. and British warplanes of suspect sites and military
installations across Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The chemists, biologists and physicists returning to Iraq have
ever-better detection tools in hand. Ground-penetrating radar can
identify underground weapons laboratories, and sophisticated sensors
can disclose the past use of chemical agents in buildings now empty.
Iraq must allow confidential interviews with government officials and
scientists. It must hand over documents detailing the use of
chemicals that have civilian as well as military purposes. About 100
inspectors eventually are expected in Iraq, with fleets of
four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters that will make it possible
for teams to visit sites without much advance notice.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 8 is the deadline for Iraq to produce an inventory of its
weapons and biological and chemical agents that can be turned into
weapons. Baghdad has resisted in the past. After losing the Gulf War
and being forced to accept inspectors, Iraq denied having biological
weapons. Only after a high official defected did Iraq admit having
manufactured biological weapons, but it declared it had destroyed
them all after the war. It also listed fewer ballistic missiles and
launchers than it actually possessed.</TE>
<TE>   As the Security Council debated the tough resolution it adopted
Nov. 8, Iraq continued to deny it had weapons of mass destruction.
Blix said Iraq also hinted it would be more difficult to enter
presidential compounds and government buildings than factories.
Inspectors must insist that all of those sites be opened immediately
on demand, in keeping with the Security Council resolution. Finding
its weapons of mass destruction -- again -- is the necessary first
step toward the goal of disarming Iraq.</TE>

<LD>Re "More Tanker Oil Hits Shore," Nov. 22: Can we please put an end to
considering drilling offshore of California? The Spanish tragedy is
only the latest proof that the potential ecological and economic
harms far outweigh the potential benefits of locating oil in our
precious coastal waters. Let us devote more resources to developing
alternative energy sources and improving fuel economy. I am willing
to pay higher gas prices if it means my children and their children
will enjoy the beaches and sea life that still abounds.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Big Dose of Reality in Geography Knowledge," Nov. 21: Although
the National Geographic Society should worry that more young Swedes
than Americans can locate the U.S. on a world map, Americans'
inability to apply geographic information to specific places is of
far greater consequence. Identifying Iraq, Afghanistan and the
Pacific Ocean on a map are to geography what the alphabet is to
reading. They open the gate for boundless and lifelong learning. But
those conversant in geography can also identify the global patterns
of climate, landforms, economics, political systems, human culture
and migration that order our complex world.</LD>
<TE>   This ability to "think geographically" raises a flat map to life.
While it is important to locate Mexico on a map, it is vital to know
that since almost half its population is under 16 years of age, the
immigration pressure on our border has just begun. Pinpointing Alaska
is great, but it's better to know that with just 1% of proven global
reserves, Arctic oil will not reduce our dependence on foreign
sources or affect the price of gas. I'm more optimistic about our
collective future when Americans recognize how epidemic poverty --
half the global population drinks filthy water and survives on less
than $2 per day -- provides Osama bin Laden and his ilk with an
endless cohort of angry suicide bombers. When I see students at any
grade level who understand these geographic cause-and-effect
relationships, I encourage them to one day run for public office.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Where on Earth Are We?" editorial, Nov. 23: Students are lost!
That would answer the editorial's rhetorical question about the
disgraceful results of the National Geographic survey. And The Times
is correct in its observation that geography is not stressed on state
tests. Before I quit the Capistrano Unified School District, I was
told by my department head that "there is no time in the American
government and economics curriculum for geography." His statement was
in response to my inclusion of a small amount of geography in my
economics course.</TE>
<TE>   How a teacher could cover the study of land, labor and capital
without geography is mind-boggling. Since this conversation took
place the CUSD has added a semester-long geography class to the
graduation requirements. Let's hope my former department head found
the new geography materials helpful.</TE>

<TE>   The editor seems disturbed that only 17% of our "young people"
could locate Afghanistan on a world map on a National Geographic
survey. I suggest that the editor assign an investigative reporter to
take another survey, this time asking "old people" if they can find
it. The results will be just as embarrassing. Better yet, next time
you publish the California public school standardized test results,
ask those oldsters some of the math questions on the high school exit
exam.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Haunting Echo," Opinion, Nov. 24: Shlomo Avineri's attempt to
find some similarity between the 1930s appeasement of Hitler and the
current situation with Iraq falls way short. Germany was a military
superpower that easily conquered most of Europe and fought the allies
to a standstill for several years.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq, even at the height of its military power in 1990, was a
paper tiger that offered only token resistance and surrendered after
a few weeks of tremendous losses. Now, after 11 years of strict
sanctions and the steady destruction of its weapons by the U.N.
inspectors, Iraq has an anemic 10% of its 1990 firepower. Containing
Saddam Hussein has been fairly simple because his first priority is
staying in power, and he knows that if he attacks any country he will
be quickly crushed by a U.S.-led alliance.</LD>
<LD>   The CIA rated the chances of Iraq attacking the U.S. [in the near
future] as very low, unless we attack Iraq first, in which case the
chances are high that terrorists will strike in the U.S. and Iraq
will use the few biological or chemical weapons it might still have.
Why is President Bush so intent on making this happen?</LD>
<TE>   Clifford Olin</TE>
<TE>   Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avineri makes a convincing argument for his position, but I am not
comfortable with his conclusion. Truman resisted pressure from the
military to extend the Korean War into China. Kennedy resisted the
goading of Gen. Curtis LeMay to attack Cuba during the missile
crisis. In 1954, preventive war with the Soviet Union was seriously
presented as a police option to President Eisenhower. The president
replied that this "was contrary to every principle upon which our
nation was founded and which it continues to profess." These
situations were much more serious than Hussein will ever be. Our
presidents were not pacifists -- they had common sense. I hope Bush
has common sense.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Henninger</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avineri may be right. Opponents of war with Iraq may someday be
viewed as latter-day appeasers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, fear of appeasement helped push this country
into Vietnam, a war fought without the support of many of America's
allies or the approval of the United Nations. I doubt many Americans
would want to repeat that mistake, either.</TE>
<TE>   Alan D. Buckley</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avineri makes the point well, but why wasn't this the case when
the president's father, now-Vice President Dick Cheney and
now-Secretary of State Colin Powell made the decision to leave
Hussein in power? Why didn't George W. Bush talk about Iraq when he
campaigned for office or in the months following the election? Is it
surprising that so many people suspect that this is just another
attempt to use national security for political advantage?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "High Court to Hear Miranda Challenge," Nov. 24: Let me get this
straight. First, police shoot an innocent man, then an Oxnard police
supervisor fails to issue a Miranda warning and continues to verbally
assault the victim to coerce a confession of guilt. This assault
continues into the ambulance and the emergency room, interfering with
the victim's treatment. Finally, the city of Oxnard pushes this case
all the way to the Supreme Court to contest Miranda's interpretation
that individuals have a constitutional right to avoid interrogation
by police. This move is embraced by the Bush administration and the
more radically right members of the Supreme Court, who are itching to
put limits on Miranda.</LD>
<LD>   Could there be any better case to demonstrate the problems with
the Warren court's interpretation that police interrogation needs to
be regulated? Here we have a gravely injured man whose access to
treatment was impeded by police questioning. The supervising officer
couldn't be relied on to distinguish between aggressive investigation
and action that was tantamount to torture. We need the protections of
Miranda more than ever, especially now that the mood of the country
is to sacrifice any personal protection that could interfere with the
war on terrorism.</LD>

<TE>   Your article about the high court hearing a Miranda challenge is
chilling. On the heels of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's arrogant claim
that, merely on his whim, he has the power to strip any person he
considers "an enemy combatant" of access to counsel or the courts,
now comes the Miranda challenge? So now, the local police are to be
free to interpret a citizen's rights? We don't have to wait to
connect the dots with this administration. The picture is rapidly
emerging, and it's very scary.</TE>

<LD>Re "130 Arrested in Sweep of Skid Row," Nov. 21: Does the Los Angeles
Police Department really think these tactics are going to work? As a
recovering heroin addict who has experienced living in a "low-income"
downtown hotel, I can tell you, the answer is no. A night, or 30
days, spent in jail will be of absolutely no help to any of these
people. What will? Outreach programs, drug and alcohol rehabilitation
programs targeted at groups such as parole violators and those who
have been homeless for long periods and methadone programs offering
counseling and support groups as well as detox and maintenance
programs.</LD>
<LD>   It is one of these programs that has helped me to get and stay
clean. As for those whom the LAPD has incarcerated, I can tell you
that the homeless will be back on the streets in no time, as will the
drug users and dealers, without any kind of treatment. Also, the
dealers arrested will be replaced by more within hours.</LD>
<LD>   It was very misleading to say that drug pushers "prey" on the
homeless. While I am in no way defending the distribution of
narcotics, this image of the drug scene is only one invented by
police and anti-drug campaigns. In reality, dealers don't prey on
anyone; rather; it is the users and addicts who must track them down.
Take it from someone who knows.</LD>

<HD>Jackie Gayle, 76; Stand-Up Comic, Movie and TV Character
Actor</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Jackie Gayle, the veteran second banana who opened Las Vegas shows
for such luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Tina Turner
and earned his own fame for character roles in such films as "Tin
Men," has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Gayle died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach
of complications after open heart surgery, publicist Warren Cowan
announced in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A stand-up comedian in nightclubs for 40 years, Gayle performed on
the Playboy Club circuit and in major Las Vegas showrooms at Caesars
Palace, the Hilton and other resorts, opening for many stars,
including not only Sinatra, Bennett and Turner, but Tom Jones, Paul
Anka, Pearl Bailey, Patti Page and Ed Ames.</LD>
<TE>   Gayle held the stage in small saloons across the country, and his
reputation earned him roles as himself or as a fictional comedian in
a handful of movies, including Woody Allen's "Broadway Danny Rose."</TE>
<TE>   Gayle was 61 when Barry Levinson cast him in his popular 1987
comedy, "Tin Men," starring Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito as
warring aluminum-siding salesmen.</TE>
<TE>   Critics raved. Leonard Maltin in his annual Movie &amp; Video Guide
wrote, "Stand-up comic Gayle is hilarious as DeVito's sales partner,
who has 'Bonanza' on the brain." The Times' reviewer wrote that
DeVito's "partner, Sam (played with magnificent sang-froid by Jackie
Gayle) broods frequently on the sex life of the 'Bonanza' boys."</TE>
<TE>   Gayle relished the opportunity to play something other than a
comedian and delighted in the attention the role brought him.
"Anything that happens now," he said, "I know I was in a hit."</TE>
<TE>   The buzz over Gayle's "Tin Men" performance earned him other movie
roles and a part in the Showtime cable television series "The Boys,"
about five friends playing cards at a pseudo Friars Club. Gayle also
had an HBO show of his own, "On Location With Jackie Gayle."</TE>
<TE>   The comedian's subsequent motion pictures included Carl Reiner's
"Bert Rigby, You're a Fool," "Joey Takes a Cab," "Mr. Saturday
Night," starring Billy Crystal, and "Bulworth," starring Warren
Beatty and Halle Berry.</TE>
<TE>   Perennially popular on television talk shows and more than 20 of
Dean Martin's Celebrity Roasts, Gayle also won acting roles in
episodes of the television series "L.A. Law," "Murder, She Wrote,"
"Good Advice" and "Stark Raving Mad."</TE>
<TE>   Born Jack Potovsky in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Gayle
became a professional drummer at age 16 and worked for Sally Marr,
Lenny Bruce's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce befriended the youth and urged him to abandon music for
stand-up.</TE>
<TE>   A compulsive joke-teller offstage as well as on, Gayle proved a
natural. He opened the Los Angeles Playboy Club in 1964, and a Times
reviewer wrote of a subsequent performance there:</TE>
<TE>   "Gayle is a shrewd and sensitive observer of our world who
recognizes the Everyman absurdities of life and seizes them.... He
tossed off some really good impressions of the celebrated doing
imaginary television commercials -- [Humphrey] Bogart on Poli-Grip
... Pearl Bailey plumping for Geritol."</TE>
<TE>   Gayle is survived by his wife, Tracy, and son, Justin.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Eden Memorial Park,
11500 Sepulveda Blvd., Mission Hills. A public memorial service will
be held at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial
contributions be sent to the American Heart Assn.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Parker Austin, 65, an interior designer and antique dealer who
helped Hugh Hefner decorate the Playboy mansion, died Nov. 20 of
cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Montclair, N.J., Austin earned a degree in design from
the University of Cincinnati and worked briefly in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
before settling in Los Angeles in 1960. His first design firm, with
Bill Lane, was Austin-Lane, with a showroom on La Cienega Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   In 1969, he formed F.P. Austin &amp; Co., adding an antique shop to
his design business. In 1993, he founded Hampshire House Fabrics &amp;
Furniture to market his original designs. His advice to his celebrity
clients included the suggestion that they study fashion magazines to
help decide what they wanted in color and design.</LD>
<TE>   Austin helped locate the property to build Hefner's mansion three
decades ago and designed the original decor. His clients also have
included Diana Ross, A&amp;M Records co-founder Jerry Moss, Phil Silvers,
Nicky Hilton, Polly Bergen, Herb Alpert and David Geffen.</TE>

<HD>Robert Brentano, 76; Scholar, Author on Medieval History</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Brentano, 76, a scholar and author on medieval English and
Italian history who taught at UC Berkeley for half a century, died
Thursday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley after an asthma
attack. He suffered a stroke two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Evansville, Ind., Brentano earned his bachelor's degree at
Swarthmore College and his doctorate from Oxford University in
England, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He took the first teaching
job that came along -- at UC Berkeley in 1952 -- and was still
teaching at his death. Active in the Academic Senate, of which he was
chairman in 1999, he worked continuously to open the university to
minorities, women, and disabled and poor students.</LD>
<LD>   Brentano, who was related to the family of the publishing and
bookstore chain Brentano but never worked in that business, wrote six
books. Among them was "Rome Before Avignon: A Social History of
13th-Century Rome," published in 1974. Times book critic Robert
Kirsch called the work "elegantly written, erudite, deeply moving."</LD>
<TE>   At Berkeley, Brentano was a highly popular teacher of introductory
history and advanced courses in British history. He was named
California Professor of the Year in 1986 by the Council for the
Advancement and Support of Education. Five years later, he was given
the Clark Kerr Award for Distinguished Leadership in Higher Education
by the Academic Senate.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fernanda Gattinoni, 95, an Italian fashion designer who dressed such
actresses as Audrey Hepburn and Ingrid Bergman, died Tuesday in a
Rome hospital of unspecified causes. She was taken there Monday after
becoming ill while working in her fashion house.</LD>
<LD>   After learning her craft working for the Molineaux fashion house
in London, Gattinoni declined an offer to work for Coco Chanel in
Paris and returned to Italy, where she opened her own company in
1945. She was credited with reviving the high-waist,
flared-silhouette Empire designs.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, her stylish but wearable clothes appealed to
Italian nobility and such foreign style-setters as Argentina's Eva
Peron, Britain's Princess Margaret, American First Lady Jackie
Kennedy and U.S. Ambassador Clare Booth Luce.</LD>
<TE>   Gattinoni came into her own in the 1950s, when Hollywood
executives realized the value of having Italian designers dress their
stars.</TE>
<TE>   She created costumes for on- and off-camera wear by Gina
Lollobrigida, Kim Novak, Angie Dickinson and Anna Magnani, as well as
Bergman and Hepburn. She always said her favorite was Bergman, for
whom she carefully made skirts wide enough to camouflage the actress'
large feet.</TE>
<TE>   The designer was nominated for an Academy Award for her costuming
of Hepburn in the 1956 epic "War and Peace."</TE>
<TE>   The designer liked to describe her creations as "elegant and
sober."</TE>
<TE>   She disapproved of overly revealing gowns, always admonishing:
"Nakedness is not stylish."</TE>

<HD>Eugene Rostow, 89; Yale Dean, Defender of U.S. on Vietnam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Thurber</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eugene V. Rostow, an influential figure in and out of government who
served in the State Department, where he was a strong defender of
U.S. policy in Vietnam, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Rostow, who in his last government assignment was director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under President Reagan, died
Monday at an assisted living facility in Alexandria, Va. The cause of
death was congestive heart failure, family members said.</LD>
<LD>   In the mid-1960s, Rostow -- and his more influential brother, Walt
W. Rostow -- were leading figures in the growing U.S. involvement in
Vietnam. As national security advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson,
Walt Rostow was the architect of much of the U.S. policy in Southeast
Asia. Eugene Rostow defended that policy from his position as
undersecretary of State for political affairs.</LD>
<TE>   His defense of the administration's position in Vietnam was not
based so much on morality as on law, his son Victor told the
Associated Press, including obligations under international treaties
to stop the communist insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene V. Rostow was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., to parents who were
politically active. His father was a socialist who named his son
after Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist Party presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   A Phi Beta Kappa, Rostow graduated from Yale in 1933 and went on
to study economics at King's College at Cambridge University.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Yale to study law and was editor of the
university's law journal. After graduating, he joined a New York law
firm but returned to Yale as a faculty member in 1938. He became a
full professor in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Back problems kept Rostow out of the military during World War II,
but he took a leave of absence from Yale and served in the Office of
Lend-Lease Administration.</TE>
<TE>   During the war, Rostow was an early critic of the Supreme Court's
ruling that supported the internment of Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   He once said that many were being sent to camps "on a record which
wouldn't support a conviction for stealing a dog."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote an influential paper for the Yale Law Review in 1945,
which was subsequently credited with helping fuel efforts to provide
interned Japanese Americans with restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Rostow was named dean of the Yale Law School in 1955. As dean, he
recruited a number of influential legal scholars and, with the aid of
a $1.6-million Ford Foundation grant, helped refocus the school's
curriculum. The new program, which began in 1956, emphasized the
teaching of law as it related to other areas, such as history,
philosophy, politics and sociology.</TE>
<TE>   "Our purpose," Rostow said of the program, "is to train lawyers,
law teachers and public servants who will be capable of constructive
leadership in American life."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Anthony Kronman, the dean of Yale Law School, recalled
Rostow as one the school's "great deans."</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the Yale Law School we now know -- to which we have
become so accustomed by the passage of time -- was built or rebuilt
during Gene's deanship years," Kronman said. "Gene's intellect, will
and character were molding forces in the evolution of the modern Yale
Law School, and his legacy is all about us."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Yale, Rostow was named undersecretary of State in
1966. He held the post until 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he saw our treaty obligations as the fundamental
principle," his son Victor told the Washington Post this week,
explaining his father's support for the U.S. escalation in Vietnam.
"Beyond that, he also believed that if we could establish a breathing
space for South Vietnam that they would govern themselves in a manner
that would be a good deal more pleasant and effective for the people
of Vietnam than what transpired."</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1970s, Rostow focused as a private citizen on nuclear
proliferation issues. He wrote extensively and was a member of the
Committee on the Present Danger.</TE>
<TE>   Though a lifelong Democrat, Rostow joined the Republican Reagan
administration in 1981 as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency. But by 1983, Rostow was forced out of the job after senior
administration officials deemed him insufficiently hawkish.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he served as a fellow at the U.S. Institute
for Peace in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He will be buried in Vermont today.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son Victor and his brother Walt, Rostow is
survived by his wife, Edna, a psychotherapist; a daughter, Jessica;
another son, Nicholas; another brother, Ralph Emerson Rostow; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Warrant Out for Knight Associate</HD>
<DH>Colleague of rap mogul faces attempted-murder charge in
incident that deputies say they saw.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An associate of rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was charged
Tuesday with the attempted murder of a reputed gang rival,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy "Tim Roo" McDonald, 34, was accused of trying to kill a
member of a rival gang last month as revenge for the unsolved murder
of another Knight associate, who was shot to death in South Los
Angeles six days before.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies alleged that they saw McDonald, who was at
large Tuesday, prepare to shoot a suspected gang member in Compton on
Oct. 22. Two deputies said they saw a vehicle pull alongside the
pedestrian. McDonald then pointed a handgun at the gang member,
according to the deputies' report.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald and the driver fled when they saw the deputies. McDonald,
who told deputies he worked for Knight's Tha Row Records, formerly
Death Row Records, was arrested after a short pursuit, but later
released. A warrant was issued for his arrest Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was an influential figure in the development of rap and
hip-hop music. However, he has long been closely associated with the
violence that has claimed the lives of several of its brightest stars
and many of his associates.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against McDonald are the first to come out of a
sheriff's task force investigation into a string of shootings,
primarily involving members of Blood gang factions. McDonald,
according to a sheriff's incident report, is a member of the Blood
faction Mob Town Pirus.</TE>
<TE>   "There are numerous criminal incidents committed by this street
gang being investigated by sheriff's homicide detectives" and gang
investigators, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rifkin of Operation Safe Streets,
the sheriff's gang unit, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin said Knight is not a suspect in the current investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The probe is not related to the unsolved killings of two of rap's
biggest stars, Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (also known as
Biggie Smalls and Notorious B.I.G.).</TE>
<TE>   Investigators allege that McDonald was attempting to retaliate for
the Oct. 16 murder of Henry "Hendog" Smith, 33, a Tha Row Records
employee. Smith designed the firm's logo, a hooded man in an electric
chair. He was waiting in his vehicle while his girlfriend used a pay
phone in South Los Angeles when his assailant walked up, leaned into
the car and fired five or six shots.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's brother was another Knight associate killed this year.
Alton "Buntry" McDonald, 37, was gunned down in April at a gas
station.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators earlier this month arrested -- and then
released without charges -- three other associates of Knight for
allegedly conspiring to kill another reputed gang rival as revenge
for Alton McDonald's death.</TE>
<TE>   The murder June 7 of Eric Letheal Daniel, 29, investigators say,
stems from a rivalry between the Mob Town Pirus and Fruit Town Pirus.
The two Blood factions had a falling out, they say, setting the stage
for the recent violence.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin said vanloads of evidence was gathered from the locations
and investigators still have not had time to sift through it
thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   In early morning sweeps by 175 sheriff's deputies, warrants were
served at 16 sites in Southern California and Las Vegas on Nov. 16,
including Knight's Beverly Hills office and his homes in three
cities.</TE>
<TE>   The raid, sheriff's investigators say, was necessary given the
history of violence of those under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   One of two others picked up during the raids on unrelated drug
possession charges was Darryl "Biggie" Small. He was held in custody
on an out-of-state probation violation.</TE>
<TE>   According to a sheriff's report, Small was driving the car from
which Timothy McDonald pointed the gun on Oct. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies reported that as McDonald pointed the weapon, the man on
the sidewalk at 112th and Vernon Avenue covered his face and ducked.
Small, according to the report, saw the patrol car and alerted
McDonald, who pulled his weapon back into the car.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators say they have not been able to find the
victim, but decided to push for prosecution based on the deputies'
eyewitness statements.</TE>
<TE>   During the early days of Death Row, Knight would brag that his
company hired ex-cons and gang members to give them a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   Knight himself was sentenced to prison in early 1997 for a
probation violation stemming from his participation, along with
Shakur and four reputed members of the Bloods, in a brawl in a Las
Vegas hotel lobby on Sept. 7, 1996. With Knight at his side, Shakur
was mortally wounded three hours later in a drive-by shooting near
the Strip.</TE>

<HD>Davis Fires 1st Salvo at Deficit</HD>
<DH>He orders state agencies to freeze or cut 'nonessential'
travel and other expenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis ordered state agencies and departments Tuesday to
freeze or cut spending for "nonessential" travel, equipment and
outside consulting, the first of many fiscal remedies to follow as
California confronts a projected budget shortfall of more than $21
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also directed the agencies and departments to cancel
contracts for "nonessential goods and services" wherever possible.</LD>
<LD>   The governor called on the Legislature and the judiciary to match
the measures.</LD>
<TE>   Expected savings will probably be less than the $150 million saved
by a similar directive last year, said Davis Press Secretary Steven
Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   The steps are the first slice of $5 billion in cuts and other
savings that the governor will ask the Legislature to consider in a
Dec. 9 special session on the budget, Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a serious message in getting the maximum amount of
savings this year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The order excludes highway projects -- which are financed by the
special-fund portion of the state budget -- and "essential" services,
including protection of public safety and protection of state
revenues and assets.</TE>
<TE>   After a discussion with legislative leaders last week, Davis
warned that the state's budget difficulties will be even worse than
the $21.1-billion shortfall for 2003-04 projected by nonpartisan
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   That includes a projected deficit of more than $6 billion in the
current 2002-03 budget. Davis signed the budget Sept. 5, more than
two months late, after a dispute with Republicans over whether to
raise taxes to fill a $24-billion budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   A reprise of that conflict is looming as California confronts
another enormous gap between tax collections and spending in the
coming year.</TE>
<TE>   "California, like most other states across the nation, is facing
an unprecedented drop in revenues," Davis said in a statement
Tuesday. "Putting the brakes on authorized spending is an important
step toward meeting this fiscal challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, however, chided Davis for not taking the steps
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nicer if we had done it earlier, but every
dollar helps," said Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox questioned
whether Davis would strictly enforce the freeze.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor announced last year that he would impose a hiring
freeze, yet did not live up to that promise," said Peter DeMarco,
spokesman for Cox. "We hope he is more sincere this time in enacting
these directives."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said Davis had taken
a necessary first step.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how you begin stopping the bleeding," said Wesson. "We
still have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his advisors have been meeting with education officials,
business leaders and others to solicit ideas as the administration
prepares a package of cuts and savings for the special legislative
session. Davis must also give the Legislature a balanced 2003-04
budget proposal by Jan. 10, four days after he begins his second
term.</TE>
<TE>   One Davis advisor said the message being given to interest groups
in the discussions was "pick your poison."</TE>
<TE>   California isn't alone in its budget difficulties: The struggling
national economy has spawned "the worst fiscal crisis states have had
since the Second World War," said Raymond Scheppach, executive
director of the National Governors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   About 35 states probably will cut health benefits for lower-income
residents. Many will lay off state employees, raise university
tuition fees and even consider cutting funding for elementary and
secondary education, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most every state has been hit by a dramatic falloff in revenue,"
Scheppach said.</TE>
<TE>   California Republicans have sworn off tax increases as part of the
solution to the Golden State's fiscal hole, but Scheppach said many
states can't avoid higher taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to have to be some tax increases," he said.
"They've done everything already that is moderately difficult to even
more difficult, so from here on it's going to be very, very tough."</TE>

<HD>Holiday Meals a Stretch This Year</HD>
<DH>Hard times bring drop in donations, increase in demand.
Some groups shift resources to help assure Thanksgiving dinners for
the needy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rodney Bosch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dwindling private donations have some area charities scrambling to
feed a mounting number of needy families and homeless for the
holidays.</LD>
<LD>   The shortage has grown so acute this year that one charity had to
turn down dozens of food-basket applicants and another will have to
cut back services elsewhere to feed the hundreds expected to show up
for a meal today.</LD>
<LD>   "Fund-raising has been very slow," said Carol Roberg, executive
director of the Ventura County Rescue Mission in Oxnard. "A bulk of
our funds are raised during Thanksgiving and Christmas -- and we are
down 25%."</LD>
<TE>   Beginning at noon today, the privately funded mission will serve
more than 500 pounds of turkey to its disadvantaged guests.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we served about 600 people," Roberg said. "And the
numbers just keep going up each year."</TE>
<TE>   While Roberg said budgetary shuffling will allow the mission to
feed all its guests today, the drop in funds will hurt elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss of funding will affect our growth," she said. "We simply
will not be able to hire more people and provide as many services."</TE>
<TE>   Like Roberg, other charity workers around the county cited grim
economic conditions as a likely contributor to the shrinking pot of
donations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, those same economic pressures are forcing more county
residents to seek charity, said Pat Esseff of Catholic Charities in
Ventura. Catholic Charities offices around the county spearhead
volunteer efforts to provide food baskets to mostly needy families,
regardless of religious affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an ever-greater need for donations," Esseff said.
"People are so conscious that their dollar just isn't going far
enough, and so they are needing to tap into a service they didn't
have to before."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, volunteers delivered 250 Thanksgiving food
baskets around Ventura, Esseff said. Last year, about 185 food
baskets were distributed. The rising demand for assistance would have
driven this year's distribution much higher, Esseff said, but
resources were quickly tapped out.</TE>
<TE>   A waiting list was formed, but in the end it was left untouched,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the worst part of what we do here, telling someone, 'I'm
sorry, we can't help you,' " she said. "It reaches a point [where] a
waiting list is just a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   Dahlia Bolo, a case manager for Catholic Charities in Oxnard,
cites a similar refrain of ballooning requests for assistance and
enormous pressure on dwindling resources.</TE>
<TE>   But, for the Catholic Charities office in Oxnard, Bolo said, the
cause of diminished resources reaches beyond donor belt-tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Five substantial private donors to the Oxnard office withheld
their contributions this year because of the sexual misconduct
scandals in the Catholic priesthood, Bolo said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had about 150 families seeking assistance that qualified for
the program, but we didn't have the funding to help them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of funding meant that only about 40 Oxnard-area families
received food baskets this week, Bolo said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oxnard-Port Hueneme Salvation Army, a late infusion of
donations from Kiwanis Club members saved the day, said business
administrator Robin Campos.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of funds threatened to prevent the branch from offering its
usual two seatings at the Thanksgiving Day meal service. But instead
of feeding less than 250 people, the branch now expects to serve more
than 500 patrons Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a very nice thought having to turn people down who come
to us on Thanksgiving for their only meal," Campos said.</TE>

<HD>Turf's Up</HD>
<DH>Bailey will try to show why he is one of the best grass
riders of all time this weekend at Hollywood Park</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A visitor to California for the first time 25 years ago, the teenage
jockey did not leave a lasting impression, either at work or with his
neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit Pincay, the sport's all-time leading jockey in terms of
victories and a winner of more than 3,000 races at Hollywood Park,
had no recollection of a long-haired, 19-year-old rider from Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't remember at all," Pincay said. "I can't remember him
being here."</LD>
<TE>   Nor did Jerry Bailey catch the eye of a certain other resident at
the Oakwood Gardens apartments in Marina del Rey, where he lived
during the spring-summer meet he rode at Hollywood Park in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Not until years later did Bailey and former neighbor Suzee Shulik
meet and discover they had been living at the Oakwood Gardens at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   "I met Suzee about seven years later," Bailey said, recalling his
first encounter with the woman who was to become his wife. "She was
working for Sportschannel in New York and she had come to Florida to
cover the Flamingo. I won with Time For A Change and I guess it was
time for a change.</TE>
<TE>   "It came up in casual conversation that we both had lived there at
the same time. She had been in California to do some acting. I don't
think we ever ran into each other. If she saw me, I guess she avoided
me."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged to ride at Hollywood Park that year by the late Arnold
Winick, a prominent trainer, owner and breeder, Bailey arrived on May
12, the 22nd day of the season, and remained until the end of the
meet on July 24.</TE>
<TE>   Although he managed only a dozen wins in 160 mounts, the young
rider was the darling of longshot players. His average win payoff was
$29.60 and he had victories aboard Rocky Trip ($72.60) in the
Typecast Stakes, Beth's Regret ($113.20) and Beau Claire ($67.60). He
rode most of his winners for trainer Randy Winick, Arnold's son.</TE>
<TE>   An inflated price on a Bailey mount is unheard of these days. The
country's perennial leader in purse earnings and on his way to
another Eclipse Award as the nation's top jockey, Bailey will be
making another trip to California this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   He will ride Banks Hill in the $500,000 Matriarch and Royal Gem in
the $500,000 Hollywood Derby on Sunday. Both are trained by Bobby
Frankel, the nation's leading trainer, and Royal Gem is one of three
3-year-olds the stable will start in the Derby. Frankel will also
send out Tates Creek in the Matriarch.</TE>
<TE>   Both Grade I races, the Matriarch and Derby are the most
significant and final two in Hollywood Park's $2.1-million Turf
Festival, which begins Friday with the $200,000 Miesque Stakes and
$200,000 Hollywood Turf Express, then continues Saturday with the
$200,000 Generous Stakes and $500,000 Citation Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Having ridden in Florida and New York most of his career, Bailey
has done well when visiting Inglewood. He has had 16 stakes wins at
Hollywood Park, four of them Hollywood Gold Cup wins, since 1992.
Bailey has won three times in the Turf Festival -- an upset with Duda
in the 1995 Matriarch and wins two years later with Geri in the
Citation and Subordination in the Hollywood Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Picking his spots until he resumes riding full-time Jan. 3 at
Gulfstream Park, Bailey is $402,531 shy of breaking his own earnings
record of $22,597,720 set last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Smith's record of 67 stakes victories in 1994 is also within
reach. Bailey is at 62 and before he arrives at Hollywood Park, he
will be busy at Aqueduct on Friday and Saturday, riding Congaree in
the Cigar Mile and the promising 2-year-old Empire Maker in the
Remsen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to be pretty efficient for the rest of the year to break
that record," said Bailey. "It's not a high priority on my list. It
would be great, but I'm not going to kill myself to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bailey has had success here, he has never considered
making California his home.</TE>
<TE>   "[In 1977], Mr. Winick wanted me to go out there for the Hollywood
Park meet," he said. "I had just gotten over breaking my jaw and, to
be honest with you, I really didn't like California.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt lonely and, for whatever reason, I didn't feel
comfortable. I enjoyed riding, but I never felt comfortable living
out there. I came back to the East Coast and started doing well
enough that I never wanted to leave. After hearing my record for that
one meet, it's no wonder I didn't stay."</TE>
<TE>   His time in a jockey's room that included such legends as Pincay,
Bill Shoemaker, a fellow Texan whom Bailey grew up idolizing, and
Sandy Hawley, did help Bailey learn, however.</TE>
<TE>   Especially helpful was Fernando Toro, a talented jockey who was
best known for his ability on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy I really paid attention to was Toro," said Bailey, who
has become one of the best turf riders in history. "I watched films
of him because I had heard he was such a great grass rider and I
really began to like riding the grass when I got the chance in
Chicago and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "I studied the way Toro sat on the fence, because at the time at
Hollywood Park, when you turned for home, you had a drop-off of about
three or four feet back in to the rail on the turf course. He used to
sit in there all the time and get through, or if the horse on the
lead went in, he would take his spot. I talked to him about that. He
was a real gentleman and helped me as much as he could."</TE>
<TE>   His two-month stay also included a cameo role in a forgettable
made-for-television movie. Taken to Paramount Studios by the late
Times and Herald-Examiner sports columnist Allan Malamud to watch a
day of shooting on "Nowhere to Run," Bailey can be seen briefly,
sitting at a blackjack table in the movie, which starred the late
David Janssen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of fun," Bailey recalled. "But, I made about as big
an impression in the movie as I did at Hollywood Park that year."</TE>

<HD>It's a Week That Goux Would Have Loved</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marv Goux, the former USC assistant football coach who died in July,
always embodied the Trojan spirit. In an interview with WeAreSC.com
in April 2001, he said he'd had three desires in life -- to play
football at a major university, to play against Notre Dame and to
play in the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   His first game against the Irish was in 1952 at South Bend, Ind.</LD>
<LD>   "To walk out for that game and look up at that stadium -- I had
already played in front of 100,000 people and we were going to the
Rose Bowl -- so I said to myself, 'If I die tomorrow, I've lived.' "</LD>
<TE>   True passion: The Daily Trojan's Gloria Rodriguez points out that
Goux could name the entire Irish team he lined up against in 1952,
that he knew the words to the Notre Dame fight song and that he
played it every year on the day USC and Notre Dame met.</TE>
<TE>   Goux, up until his death, often made the trip from his home in
Palm Desert to deliver speeches to USC players before Notre Dame
games.</TE>
<TE>   Senior cornerback Darrell Rideaux said, "It was chilling. You
could hear the passion in his voice. His beady eyes were beamed on
you. He got everybody's attention."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What was the halftime score of the 1974 USC-Notre
Dame game, won by the Trojans, 55-24?</TE>
<TE>   It's not a weekly: Tennis Week publisher Eugene Scott has told
readers that the magazine is scaling back to 11 issues in 2003 to
"better serve our subscribers," according to Romenesko's MediaNews.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine may also want to consider a name change.</TE>
<TE>   Now this: The New York Times, which editorialized that Tiger Woods
should boycott the Masters because women aren't allowed to become
members of Augusta National, last week conducted a poll on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Of 846 adults polled, 55% of the men said they were opposed to a
private club having to change its policies, and the women were dead
even.</TE>
<TE>   And from Tiger: Woods taped an interview with his good friend
Charles Barkley, which will air on Barkley's TNT show, "Listen Up!"
on Thursday at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Said Barkley, "If you boycott Augusta, I'm going to beat the hell
out of you. Martha Burk and Jesse Jackson are really starting to ...
me off. Are you getting frustrated by it?"</TE>
<TE>   Answered Woods, "It is frustrating. Everyone asks the same
question. They are just waiting [for me] to say something
controversial. I would like to see a woman member at Augusta, but
it's not my decision. I'm an invited guest, like everyone else. I'm
not a member."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Notre Dame led at halftime, 24-6. It was 24-0
before Anthony Davis scored shortly before the end of the half.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Lakers put Samaki Walker on the injured list
Tuesday, which should simplify things for announcers Paul Sunderland
and Stu Lantz. Now there's only Soumaila Samake.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe, in a recent column, noted that the
Lakers had been "trying to win games with Soumaila Samake and Samaki
Walker at center."</TE>
<TE>   Wondered Ryan, "Whatever happened to guys named Harry and Joe?"</TE>

<HD>No. 15 Kentucky Zones Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most college basketball coaches will admit they don't like to play a
lot of zone defense. Virginia's Pete Gillen isn't in that group right
now.</LD>
<LD>   Devin Smith made three three-point baskets in the final six
minutes -- one more than Kentucky managed in the game against the
Cavaliers' matchup zone -- and Virginia beat the 15th-ranked
Wildcats, 75-61, Tuesday in the semifinals of the Maui Invitational
at Lahaina, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   "We played it once last year against Georgetown for 38, 39
minutes," Gillen said of the zone defense. "I'm not a zone coach but
sometimes you have to put your ego in your pocket. We kept it basic,
changed a couple of things."</LD>
<TE>   Smith, a 6-foot-5 junior college transfer, was two for seven from
three-point range in the Cavaliers' first two games, but he made
three of four from beyond the arc in the last six minutes Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, every time I was open I hit the shot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia (3-0) will play in tonight's championship game against
No. 19 Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers' matchup zone caused all kinds of problems for
Kentucky (1-1), which went two for 22 from three-point range, missing
its first 17 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some good looks, but I think we settled for outside
shots," Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith said. "Virginia did a good job
going to the zone and then you miss a couple and get tight and the
basket gets smaller."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Stockton hit Kentucky's second three-point basket with 7
minutes 5 seconds remaining to make it 56-53, but after Elton Brown
scored down low for Virginia, Smith scored the Cavaliers' next nine
points on long-range shots. His last one made it 67-59 with 1:24 to
play, and Virginia closed it out from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Billet led Virginia with 15 points each, and Keith
Jenifer had 13 points and six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Estill, Jules Camara and Keith Bogans each had 12 points
for Kentucky, which shot 37% from the field. Estill played only 13
minutes, getting his third and fourth fouls in the first two minutes
of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   In other Maui Invitational games:</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Indiana 76, No. 20 Gonzaga 75 -- Indiana (2-0) almost
squandered its 17-point lead in the final 3:02 but held on to advance
to the championship game. Blake Stepp, who had 11 of his 20 points in
a closing 22-6 run for Gonzaga (2-1), made a three-point basket with
8.4 seconds left to bring the Bulldogs to within 75-73. But after
A.J. Moye made one of two free throws, Stepp's final three-point
attempt missed and Winston Brooks' layup at the buzzer made it 76-75.
Ronny Turiaf had 24 points for Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 101, Chaminade 72 -- Freshman Ike Diogu scored 19
points to lead the Sun Devils (2-1) in a consolation game.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 69, Massachusetts 53 -- Nick Jacobsen scored 14 of his 21
points over the final 11 minutes for the Utes (2-1) in a consolation
game.</TE>
<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Marquette 97, Eastern Illinois 74 -- Dwyane Wade scored 28
points on 13-for-15 shooting to help the Golden Eagles (4-0) win at
Milwaukee and extend their home winning streak to 19. Robert Jackson
scored 18 of his 22 points after halftime for Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   Wade made all 11 of his shots in the first half, along with his
lone free throw, as the Golden Eagles raced to a 54-36 halftime lead
over the Panthers (1-3). Wade's highly anticipated matchup with Henry
Domercant, a senior who was second in the nation in scoring a year
ago with a 26.4-point average, was a mismatch in the first half,
although Domercant finished with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Cincinnati 80, Florida A&amp;M 53 -- Field Williams made six of
11 from three-point range to score 22 points and help the Bearcats
(2-0) win at Cincinnati. Florida A&amp;M (0-2) got within eight in the
second half before Cincinnati pulled away.</TE>

<HD>New Mexico's Carey Can't Move His Legs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>New Mexico guard Senque Carey is unable to move his legs after
injuring his spinal cord during a game Monday against Northwestern
State at home.</LD>
<LD>   Carey appeared to collide with Northwestern State's Byron Allen
with seven minutes 41 seconds left in the first half as Allen drove
to the basket.</LD>
<LD>   Carey barely moved for about 10 minutes while medical personnel
tended to him. He was placed in a neck brace before being put on a
stretcher.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Schenck, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of New Mexico
Hospital, where Carey is hospitalized, said Carey couldn't move his
hands, arms or legs when he was taken to the hospital, but by
Tuesday, had regained motion in his arms and hands.</TE>

<HD>Jazz Leaves Clippers at a Loss</HD>
<DH>For the 15th consecutive time, Utah prevails, turning L.A.
mistakes into a game-ending 15-4 run and a 99-94 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Stockton's shorts are still far too short to be considered
fashionable at any point since, oh, 1985. Karl Malone still takes
roughly 9.99 seconds of his allotted 10 to shoot his free throws. And
the Utah Jazz still owns the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   What else is new?</LD>
<LD>   The Jazz defeated the Clippers, 99-94, in front of a crowd of
15,243 on Tuesday night at Staples Center. That's 15 consecutive
victories for Utah over the Clippers, a streak that seemed destined
to end when Elton Brand made two free throws to give the Clippers a
90-84 lead with 3:39 remaining.</LD>
<TE>   But the Clippers (5-10) missed too many free throws and turned
over the ball to the Jazz far too often and, soon enough, Utah had
pulled out a victory by closing with a 15-4 run.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton and Malone didn't win the game by themselves. In fact,
Calbert Cheaney (early) and Matt Harpring (late) played pivotal roles
for the Jazz, winners of five consecutive games after starting the
season 3-7.</TE>
<TE>   Cheaney had 10 of his 12 points in the first half and Harpring
scored 24 of his 30 in the second half, keeping the Jazz in good
shape for a decisive stretch run. Stockton finished with nine points
and Malone had 17.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller led the Clippers with 21 points and nine assists and
Brand had 19 points and 11 rebounds. But they both missed key free
throws in the fourth quarter that kept the Clippers from building a
bigger lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Clipper reserves were outscored, 25-12, which didn't help
much. With small forwards Corey Maggette (knee) and Lamar Odom
(ankle) on the injured list for at least the next month, the Clippers
need more from their reserves than just Keyon Dooling's 12 points in
19 minutes Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to say," Coach Alvin Gentry said after the
Clippers made only 11 of 18 free throws (61.1%) and committed seven
turnovers in the fourth quarter. "It's another one of those doggone
games we play well enough in and just can't close out. We've got to
make more free throws. We can't turn the ball over. It's basically
the same thing. We play well and get to a point where the game is
going to be decided and we don't make the plays to get us over the
hump."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Padgett got the Jazz's comeback started with two free throws
with 3:24 left. Stockton drove past Miller for a layup. Malone then
lofted a 13-foot jump shot over Michael Olowokandi. Suddenly, the
teams were tied at 90.</TE>
<TE>   Miller would make two of four free throws and Brand made a late
layup for the rest of the Clippers' scoring. Utah would make seven of
eight free throws in the final minute to clinch it.</TE>
<TE>   "The game was right there for us to win," Gentry said. "We didn't
get the job done. We missed free throws. We didn't make shots. We
didn't come up with defensive stops. I don't know. We've got to play
better down the stretch than we have been playing. We've been our own
worst enemy. We've got 10 losses now and we've been our own worst
enemy in seven of the 10 losses."</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the Clippers were off to their customary strong start
followed by their all too familiar fade in the second quarter. Still,
they led, 41-40, despite holding the Jazz to 15-for-36 shooting
(41.7%).</TE>
<TE>   As ever, or so it seems when these teams play, the Jazz cleaned up
against the Clippers at the free-throw line, sinking eight of 13. The
Clippers went to the line four times and made two.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' zone defense kept Malone and Stockton off balance on
the perimeter and unable to run their textbook pick and rolls. So
often during Utah's streak, which dates to March 27, 1999, the Jazz
worked over the Clippers by running an unstoppable pick and roll,
which led to layup after layup.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Gentry decided to try a zone. It paid off in easy
baskets to start Tuesday's game. The Clippers led, 28-19, early in
the second quarter, after Olowokandi made a short jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, the leading scorer for the Jazz was neither Malone
nor Stockton, but Cheaney, who had 10 points.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Maggette Put on Injured List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette wanted to keep playing on his injured right knee until
Lamar Odom, who is sitting out the season's first two months because
of a sprained right ankle, was fit to play again.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette fell about a month short of his goal Tuesday, when the
Clippers put their starting small forward on the injured list.
Maggette, who has missed 16 of his last 19 shots, will undergo
arthroscopic surgery to remove torn cartilage Friday. He is expected
to sit out at least four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "He pushed it to the point where he was losing his effectiveness,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said. "If Corey says he's hurt, he's hurt. He's
not a guy who can't play in pain."</LD>
<TE>   Odom is not scheduled to complete his rehabilitation program until
the final week of December, which means the Clippers have a glaring
void to fill for the next month at small forward. Gentry said the
team would deal with Maggette's absence in the same manner it has
while Odom has been out.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we've got who we've got," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Injuries are part of the NBA. We've just got to play."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Marko Jaric started in place of Maggette against the Utah
Jazz on Tuesday, and the Clippers activated forward Melvin Ely, who
had been on the injured list since the start of the season because of
a sprained left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette suffered swelling in his knee after the Clipper victory
Nov. 3 over the Detroit Pistons. An MRI exam the next day revealed
torn cartilage, but Maggette decided to keep playing.</TE>
<TE>   Another MRI exam Monday indicated no further damage, team doctor
Tony Daly said Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Publisher: Hyperion Books</TE>
<TE>   Price: $22.95</TE>
<TE>   Janet Guthrie was the first and Sarah Fisher is the fastest, but
Lyn St. James has been the most persistent and most durable of the
women who have raced in the Indianapolis 500. She has been in seven
500s, from 1992 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This is not your usual race driver's book, chronicling the ups and
downs of a career. It focuses on St. James' frustrations trying to
find sponsorship for the 2000 Indy 500, then the excruciating moments
trying to qualify -- first hitting the wall and then squeezing into
the field at the final moment -- and finally the embarrassment when
she and Fisher, the only two women in the race, crashed into each
another.</TE>
<TE>   "Major sport sponsorships are a precious finite resource ... we're
all going after a piece of the same size pie, and unfortunately for
those of us in Indy car racing, NASCAR has put a padlock on the
bakery," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   That, she says, forces drivers to become split personalities,
slick pitchmen pounding the pavement for money, and intense athletes
in search of speed.</TE>
<TE>   "One could not exist without the other," she declares.</TE>
<TE>   Her book tells how she did it.</TE>

<HD>Oates Is Cleared to Return</HD>

<LD>Unless center Adam Oates wakes up this morning with a sore left hand,
he'll be in the lineup tonight when the Mighty Ducks play host to
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Oates, who sat out 15 games after breaking two bones in his left
hand Oct. 24 at Vancouver, has been cleared by team doctors to return
to the ice. He participated in contact drills at practice Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Mike Babcock said he would leave it up to Oates to decide
whether he's fit to play.</LD>
<TE>   "He knows better than anyone if he's ready to play," Babcock said
of the 40-year-old Oates, who signed a one-year, $3.5-million
free-agent contract with Anaheim in July. "He practiced but was not
really getting whacked.... We'll have conversations [before a
decision is made]."</TE>
<TE>   Oates, who had three assists in seven games, still feels
discomfort when he uses his backhand, but that's not enough to keep
him sidelined, based on how he felt Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The team has been playing very well and I really don't want to
disrupt that," he said. "My goal is to come in and play at their
level and not subtract from what they've been doing."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are 6-4-2-3 in games without Oates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Look for Duck enforcer Kevin Sawyer to be challenged by the
Coyotes' Darcy Hordichuk, who will return after a 10-game suspension
for bumping a referee Oct. 31. During his suspension, Hordichuk spent
time watching videotapes of Sawyer's fights and told the Arizona
Republic, "I think it's safe to say we'll go."</TE>

<LD>The officiating crew that ruled Washington State quarterback Matt
Kegel threw a backward pass on the final play of the Cougars'
triple-overtime upset loss against Washington on Saturday made the
correct call, Pacific 10 Conference Commissioner Tom Hansen said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Verle Sorgen, the conference's coordinator of officials, reviewed
replays of the controversial call taped by Fox Sports Net and
Washington State. Sorgen told Hansen that the best angle, supplied by
Fox, showed Kegel releasing the ball from the Washington 27-yard line
toward a receiver standing on the 28.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the crew, headed by Gordon Riese, will not be
downgraded for their performance and they remain in position to be
selected for involvement in a bowl game.</LD>
<TE>   "It appeared to be the proper call," Hansen said. "It's a judgment
call and the official who called it [line judge Roger McMinn] was in
proper position."</TE>
<TE>   Kegel's pass was deflected by Kai Ellis and the Huskies recovered
the loose ball, clinching a 29-26 Apple Cup victory that deprived
Washington State of any chance to play in the bowl championship
series title game. If UCLA beats the Cougars on Dec. 7, USC will be
awarded a Rose Bowl berth.</TE>

<LD>As racing faces one of its darkest hours, brought on by the biggest
national public-relations problem since the wave of race-fixing on
the East Coast in the 1970s, the industry is where it frequently is:
badly, sadly polarized.</LD>
<LD>   Doing some pricey cosmetic work last week, the National
Thoroughbred Racing Assn. hired an untested company fronted by former
New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to help with Operation
Bootstrap.</LD>
<LD>   Estimates of what Giuliani's consulting firm is being paid range
between $1 million and $2 million, and while 99% of the NTRA's
membership voted in favor of this expenditure, the glaring exception
was the New York Racing Assn., which operates the three major
racetracks in that state.</LD>
<TE>   NYRA's objection to Giuliani couldn't be more personal: During his
final term, Giuliani green-lighted the sale of the New York City
Off-Track Betting Corp. to Frank Stronach's Magna Entertainment,
rejecting a bid that was made by NYRA in concert with Churchill Downs
Inc. Giuliani said that his decision "was a slam dunk," but the New
York state legislature failed to approve Stronach's offer, which fell
off the table the day Giuliani left office.</TE>
<TE>   NYRA's pooh-poohing of Giuliani came about two weeks after
racing's Big Three -- NYRA, Magna and Churchill Downs -- jointly
announced that they would work together to shore up security at
beleaguered Autotote and the two other totes that service the
industry. With Giuliani's outfit now one of the watchdogs after the
pick-six fiasco at the Breeders' Cup, how dedicated can NYRA be in
honoring the spirit of that agreement?</TE>
<TE>   Because of the way racing is structured -- individual tracks are
beholden to their state racing commissions, and Tim Smith's title of
national commissioner is a papier-mache designation -- Churchill
Downs has been unable to implement a company-wide measure that was to
instill confidence in those edgy bettors who suspect that some horses
are being bet after the races start.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill successfully pushed through an early betting cutoff for
its tracks in Kentucky, Indiana and Florida, but in California the
racing board turned down the same request by Hollywood Park, which is
a Churchill track. The majority of California's commissioners said
that bettors would be inconvenienced; besides, there hasn't been one
documented example of what bookmakers of yore called past-posting.</TE>
<TE>   The California board's problems are trivial compared to what's
before the racing board in Illinois, where the Breeders' Cup was run
on Oct. 26. Although the winning pick-six bets, on races at Arlington
Park, were made in Maryland, via a New York telephone account that
was processed in Delaware, none of those agencies has jurisdiction
over the possible redistribution of the $3 million in winnings.
Seventy-eight tickets with five out of six winners were worth $4,606
on race day, but each of those payoffs will grow, with interest, to
$40,000 more if the perfect pick-six tickets are thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   The Illinois Racing Board may address this issue at its Dec. 9
meeting. Right now the money is sitting in an escrow account in a
Chicago bank. One of the concerns in Illinois is whether a premature
redistribution might prejudice the U.S. government's case against the
three men linked to the winning pick-six bet. So far, only one of
them has entered a guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   Back in California, it seems that the racing board, at a time when
the game should be circling the wagons, could have cut Hollywood Park
some slack last week.</TE>
<TE>   The track's request to preempt betting was in the form of a trial,
for only the last 20 days of the current meet. Other tracks would
hold on to the status quo if they wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, before the vote was taken, almost everyone in the
room lined up against Hollywood. Magna's Jack Liebau, who speaks for
Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows in California, was
not enamored with the idea, even though he had recently visited the
Meadowlands on a night when a horse left the gate at 10-1 and was
almost 16-1 by the time he won the race.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought that Hollywood should have tried to split the
difference, as Aqueduct will soon do, by closing the windows early on
its off-track customers while giving the on-track crowd the chance to
bet until the gate opens. But Rick Baedeker, the Hollywood Park
president, is troubled by that dichotomy.</TE>
<TE>   "That gives the guy on-track an unfair advantage," Baedeker said.
"The whole idea of [simulcast betting] is that there's a level
playing field and everybody has the same chance."</TE>
<TE>   Autotote, to say the least, has some retrenching to do. This is
the company that took over Santa Anita's business 10 years ago, after
AmTote, the longtime holder of the contract, had submitted a lower
bid.</TE>
<TE>   On opening day in 1992, Autotote suffered numerous mechanical
breakdowns, thousands of disgusted bettors went home early and by
conservative estimates about $3 million in handle was lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say that it's not possible that bets could come in after a
race starts," Brooks Pierce, president of Autotote, said last week,
"but after what's happened lately, I guess anything is possible."</TE>
<TE>   It may no longer be very easy for an Autotote employee to come in
on his day off, just to tidy up. Chris Harn, fired by the Newark,
Del., company shortly after the Breeders' Cup, wasn't scheduled to
work the day he rejiggered the six winning tickets after four of the
pick-six races had been run. Password security is expected to improve
too.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Harn, there were 17 Autotote employees who theoretically
could have tapped into the betting network to do what he did.</TE>
<TE>   Just to keep a hand in, Harn and his two friends from college were
counterfeiting tickets for almost a year while they waited for the
big score.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the road from Autotote, at Delaware Park, another of the
tote company's employees was fired in 1999 for attempting much the
same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme three years ago involved hundreds instead of millions
of dollars, but a thief has to start somewhere. The Delaware Racing
Commission didn't learn of the incident until recently.</TE>
<TE>   That's racing for you. In that wonderful film, "Sweet Smell of
Success," Burt Lancaster delivered the line, "My right hand hasn't
met my left hand in years."</TE>
<TE>   The Lancaster character was just being glib. In racing, too much
of the time, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.</TE>

<HD>Fairfax Gets Younger, but Revival Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Jackson and Barry Johnson represent the future for Fairfax
High's football team. Though they never expected it, they are also
the key to the present for the Lions.</LD>
<LD>   When Jackson connected with Johnson for a seven-yard touchdown
pass to lift Fairfax to a 13-12 overtime victory over Crenshaw in the
first round of the City Section Championship Division playoffs, it
exemplified how a team can persevere in the face of adversity.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't see any other team going through as much stuff as we've
been through," said Coach Shane Cox, whose Lions (7-3) play Lake
Balboa Birmingham (8-3) in the quarterfinals tonight.</LD>
<TE>   Had things worked as planned at the beginning of the season,
Jackson, the sophomore quarterback, and Johnson, the freshman wide
receiver, would never have been in that playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax's two best players, senior wide receiver-defensive back
Jason Ferguson and senior quarterback Thomas Herringshaw, haven't
played a down this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, a 5-foot-5 dynamo who impressed college recruiters with
his speed and elusiveness, was lost to an injury after tearing the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in June at UCLA's
football camp. He totaled 3,700 yards and 34 touchdowns the past two
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Herringshaw is following his parents' wishes that he forgo his
senior season of football to concentrate on his academics and obtain
a pilot's license. As a junior, he threw for 2,618 yards and 20
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   A bright student with a 3.4 grade-point average, he admitted it
has been hard to watch the Lions and not be part of their success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to not be out there," said Herringshaw, who still
attends a majority of the team's practices and continues to work out.
"I'm sad that I'm not playing, but I'm happy that the team is
winning. We'd be such a different team if ... "</TE>
<TE>   Cox, however, hasn't had the time to ponder the what-ifs. Other
issues have kept him busy:</TE>
<TE>   * Senior defensive tackle Jonathan Dib hasn't played because of a
heart murmur detected before the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   * Linebacker Sidney Osman is out for the remainder of the season
with a broken elbow.</TE>
<TE>   * Wide receiver Steven Cotton, who was recently shot in the
stomach outside a fast-food restaurant in the Crenshaw district, has
missed the last four games and is unlikely to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   * One of the Lions' assistant coaches resigned in October after a
disagreement with the fourth-year head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Then there have been some bad breaks on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax lost a 22-20 double-overtime game to Westchester when an
official mistakenly allowed a two-point conversion on a blocked
point-after kick.</TE>
<TE>   Other teams may have fallen apart under similar circumstances, but
not this one.</TE>
<TE>   It was only four years ago when the Lions were the City Section's
worst program. Cox, 34, was hired in the middle of a 34-game losing
streak that stretched to 43 games during his first season.</TE>
<TE>   But the former defensive coordinator from Locke is fast gaining
respect as one of the section's top young coaches. The Lions went 8-3
last season, marking their best record since 1991, and their victory
last week was their first Championship Division playoff victory in
the same time span.</TE>
<TE>   Hard work -- particularly off the field -- has been a major part
of the Lions' revival. A room adjacent to the school's gymnasium that
was once used for storage has been converted into a weight room.</TE>
<TE>   Fund raising has allowed Cox to purchase weight equipment each
year. Study sessions are mandatory in Cox's classroom twice a week
before practice.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Ed Vega said Cox is committed to building the
program and doing it the right way.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult in the beginning because you really had to teach
everything from scratch," Vega said. "Shane started out as a
brand-new coach, but he did all the hard work. And he treats the kids
like his children. Kids that like you are bound to be successful
because they're going to work for you."</TE>
<TE>   Cox deflects most of the credit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the coach," he said. "It's the kids. Bottom line, it's
the kids who are the ones that are on the field making the plays."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Jackson and Johnson have done since moving up from the
freshman-sophomore team. And just as running back Derrick Hill and
linebacker Naim Adams have done all season while the youngsters were
gaining experience.</TE>
<TE>   Cox said belief -- in the system, in the coaches, in the program
and in themselves -- has carried the Lions to goals that, at one
time, weren't even imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   "They stuck with me," he said. "A lot of adults, much less kids,
would have quit in similar situations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the most improbable weeks in City Section playoff
history.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson dominated second-seeded Carson, 48-28, despite barely
getting into the Championship Division. Fairfax stunned third-seeded
Crenshaw. Roosevelt scored its first upper-division playoff victory
since 1973, even though it took two nights to beat San Pedro, 14-11.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, of the four Marine League teams that qualified for
the Championship Division, only Gardena will play in the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there'd be no less than two, if not three teams [from
the Marine League] that made it past the first round," Gardena Coach
Marshall Jones said. "I can't remember a year in which the No. 2 and
3 seeds got knocked out in the first round."</TE>

<LD>CITY SECTION QUARTERFINALS</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey (5-6) at Taft (11-0), 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Dorsey Coach Paul Knox saw this coming when the Championship
Division playoff brackets were drawn. After defeating Franklin last
week, Dorsey meets top-seeded Taft in a rematch of last season's
title game, which was won by Dorsey when it recovered a blocked punt
in the end zone on the last play of the game. "I'm sure they're going
to be emotionally excited to play this game given the circumstances
of last season," Knox said. "They're going to be fired up, but for
us, it's a playoff game we have to win to move on. It's probably our
toughest opponent of the season." Taft, The Times' sixth-ranked team,
is the clear favorite to win its second championship, particularly
now that second-seeded Carson and third-seeded Crenshaw are out of
the tournament. Senior quarterback Cary Dove is coming off a
career-high 389-yard performance in a 42-14 first-round victory over
Wilmington Banning. Receiver Steve Smith has 60 receptions for 1,018
yards. Dorsey has rallied from a 1-5 start. Sophomore Jeremiah
Johnson has rushed for more than 100 yards in each of the last three
games. The Dons, with nine starters who are sophomores or juniors,
have gained confidence throughout the season. "Our kids believe that
we're a team that is either in the championship picture or has a say
in the championships because someone has to beat us," Knox said.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt (10-1) at Venice (9-2), 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   These teams have completely different philosophies. Roosevelt
rarely diverts from its traditional wing-T attack and has been the
section's top rushing team the last three years. Venice airs it out
with quarterback Eddie Miller and a host of receivers. Under
fifth-year Coach Jose Casagran, Roosevelt believes it has arrived as
a section title contender and points to its 14-11 first-round victory
over San Pedro. "It wasn't long ago where we wouldn't win that game,"
Casagran said. "It's about building expectations." The Gondoliers
have one of the section's most dynamic offenses. Miller, a senior,
threw for 313 yards and accounted for four touchdowns in last week's
47-17 victory over Fremont. For the season, he has completed 73% of
his passes for 3,399 yards with only six interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax (7-3) at Birmingham (8-3), 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   One thing stood out to Fairfax Coach Shane Cox as he viewed game
film of the Patriots. "Man, they've got speed," Cox said. "Chad Green
is fast." The upstart Lions try for their second consecutive upset.
Behind running back Dennis Keyes' 155 yards and four touchdowns,
sixth-seeded Birmingham opened the playoffs with a dominating 63-14
victory over Van Nuys Grant. Quarterback Ryan Lombardo has thrown for
2,638 yards and 24 touchdowns. Green, a senior wide-receiver and
defensive back, has caught 37 passes for 997 yards. Fairfax has
relied on its ground game to control the ball. Senior Derrick Hill is
among the section's leaders with more than 1,800 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson (6-5) at Gardena (8-3), 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson's 48-28 victory over second-seeded Carson is the story
of the tournament so far. The Democrats took advantage of six Colt
turnovers and got a huge performance from quarterback Ryan Clark, who
ran for 128 yards and two touchdowns and also caught a 50-yard
scoring pass from Gary White. White, who is Jefferson's most
dangerous player, helped the Democrats defeat Gardena earlier this
season with a game-winning 35-yard touchdown reception in the final
minute. "It's on us to prove that we're the better team," Gardena
Coach Marshall Jones said. "They beat us. They made the plays they
had to make and they beat Carson, which we couldn't do." Gardena has
been powered by the running of option quarterback LaFerrell Payne,
who has rushed for a team-high 897 yards. Last week, he scored two
touchdowns in the final 1 minute 29 seconds to help defeat Sylmar. If
Gardena is victorious, it would reach its first Championship Division
semifinal since 1983.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Whieldon, a third-year starting quarterback at Orange Lutheran,
left the team last week and withdrew from school.</LD>
<LD>   Whieldon said his father, Matthew, removed him from the team
because of ongoing philosophical differences they had with Orange
Lutheran Coach Jim Kunau.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a bummer," said Whieldon, a senior who threw for 981 yards
and eight touchdowns in eight games this season, helping the
Vanguards go undefeated in their first season in the Empire League.</LD>
<TE>   Whieldon, who played basketball as a sophomore, said he hopes to
begin classes Wednesday at Orange El Modena, but doesn't plan to
pursue athletic eligibility until this winter.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to continue his football career at the community
college level next fall, most likely at Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran, seeded second in the Southern Section Division VI
playoffs, replaced Whieldon with sophomore Seth Blackamore, who
completed 12 of 15 passes for 115 yards and three touchdowns Friday
in a 45-14 opening-round victory over Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Blackamore, in only his third start this season, also rushed for
81 yards in eight carries.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, El Modena will host Orange Lutheran in a quarterfinal
game Friday.</TE>

<HD>Newport Harbor Aces Way to Second Round</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Newport Harbor opened the Southern California Regional
Division II girls' volleyball playoffs with a 15-4, 15-6, 15-11
victory over Bakersfield Highland on Tuesday night at Newport Harbor
High.</LD>
<LD>   The Sailors (27-6) served nine aces against Highland (10-10),
including three by Alyson Jennings, who closed out the one-hour match
with an ace.</LD>
<LD>   Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said his only concerns were the
lack of familiarity with Highland, the Central Section runner-up, and
the Santa Ana winds that blew through the area the last two days.</LD>
<TE>   Glenn said the dust kicked up by the winds made the court
slippery, and the conditions tend to make players lackadaisical.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are different in the classroom too," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the things you have to think about before a match
like this."</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Newport Harbor has won 12 consecutive matches,
including four sweeps along the way to winning the Southern Section
Division II-AA title.</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors are seeking their fifth state title, having won
Division I titles in 1994, 1998 and 1999, and a Division II title in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   As the top-seeded team in their bracket, the Sailors enjoy
home-court advantage throughout the regionals.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case in the section playoffs, when Newport Harbor
was home only for its opening match.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't have to make a four-hour trip to [Bakersfield] Liberty,
like we did last year," Glenn said.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor will play host to South Torrance in the second
round on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Wilson Works Quickly</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The bus ride in rush-hour traffic took more than twice as long as it
took the Long Beach Wilson High girls' volleyball team to eliminate
host Van Nuys in the first round of the state Division I volleyball
playoffs Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-seeded Bruins, the Southern Section Division I-AA
runners-up, needed only 52 minutes to sweep the Los Angeles City
Section champions for the second consecutive year, 15-2, 15-7, 15-7.</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore Cynthia Barboza, who also plays on the U.S. junior
national and youth national teams, led Wilson (34-3) with 19 kills,
three more than Van Nuys' entire team. Setter Alli Dillon had 29
assists and Meghan MacRae had 13 digs and three aces, one of which
ended the first game.</LD>
<TE>   "They were more offensive than they were when we played them last
year," Dillon said of Van Nuys (31-3). "They concentrated more on
defense last year, but this time they had a couple of solid setters
and tried some different things. But we still had the mind-set that
we would come here and play our game."</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-seeded Van Nuys, which won its second consecutive City title
Friday, led, 4-1, in the second game before Wilson answered with a
12-2 run. The Bruins built a 7-0 lead before Van Nuys managed a side
out in the third game and led, 13-0, before the Wolves scored seven
consecutive points to make the score respectable.</TE>
<TE>   Senior outside hitter Hala Hadawar, who led the City Section in
kills, had three kills and three aces against Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "We were anticipating playing them again," Hadawar said. "We knew
they had big guns. We knew they were better than the teams we've been
playing. Every one of us had to play with heart. I can't believe this
was my last high school match."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson will play Los Alamitos, a 15-8, 15-13, 15-6 winner over La
Costa Canyon, in a second-round game on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Encinitas Torrey Pines 3, Huntington Beach Marina 0 --Torrey Pines
High was not about to let Marina march into its gym and do damage
this time around.</TE>
<TE>   Torrey Pines, which hosted Marina in a 1998 Southern California
Regional girls' volleyball opener in which it was upset, took only 1
hour 15 minutes to dispatch the Vikings, 15-12, 15-4, 15-2, in a
Division I match.</TE>
<TE>   "They took it to us and never let up," said Coach Jeff Caughthran,
who led the Vikings to an upset of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa in the
Southern Section Division I-A championship match last week.</TE>
<TE>   Outside hitter Rachaell Johnson and setter Tyler Bowman had 11
kills each for Torrey Pines (25-6), which upset Carlsbad La Costa
Canyon in the San Diego Section Division I final to earn the right to
host the regional opener. Johnson added five blocks and an ace.</TE>
<TE>   Becky Green, who like Johnson, has signed a letter of intent with
UCLA, had 11 kills for Marina (20-5).</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 3, Escondido 0 -- Mallorie Croal had 15 kills,
11 digs and six aces to lead the second-seeded Monarchs (29-8) to a
15-11, 15-2, 15-11 victory over Escondido (26-7) in a Division II
first-round match at Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   South Torrance 3, Escondido San Pasqual 1 -- Ashley Hardwick had
31 kills and 24 digs to lead the visiting Spartans (23-9) to a 15-12,
15-8, 12-15, 15-8 upset over fourth-seeded San Pasqual (34-5) in a
Division II first-round match.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery 3, La Jolla 1 -- Noelle Quinn had 15 kills and
11 blocks to lead the No. 1-seeded Knights (26-8) to a 15-2, 15-2,
9-15, 15-5 victory over La Jolla (23-13) in a Division III
first-round match at Bishop Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 3, Exeter 0 -- Alexandra Dunphy
had 30 assists and Justine Davidson had 14 kills to lead the
second-seeded Wolverines (28-5) to a 15-11, 15-11, 15-8 victory over
Exeter (30-4) in a Division III first-round match at
Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Marymount 3, Bakersfield Garces 0 -- Stecha Selsky had
10 aces to lead the No.-1 seeded Sailors (27-4) to a 15-3, 17-15,
15-4 victory over visiting Garces (28-11) in a Division IV
first-round match.</TE>
<TE>   Flintridge Sacred Heart 3, Chowchilla 0 -- Kacey Knauf had seven
kills, eight blocks, 12 digs and 26 assists to lead the visiting
Tologs (21-5) to a 15-7, 15-9, 15-12 upset of fourth-seeded
Chowchilla (24-8) in a Division IV first-round match.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Idled by three five-day suspensions, jockey Patrick Valenzuela will
make his first appearance of the Hollywood Park meet today. He has
three mounts.</LD>
<LD>   The leading rider during the spring-summer meet, Valenzuela hasn't
ridden since Nov. 3 at Santa Anita, but he could wind up in the
winner's circle with his first mount.</LD>
<LD>   You Crack Me Up, a 2-year-old gray son of Slew City Slew, could be
the one to catch in the fourth, a 6 1/2-furlong race for $50,000
maidens.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Joe and Lola Sample and trained by Jack Van Berg, You
Crack Me Up will be making his first appearance in a claimer and his
first start on Lasix. This will also be the first time he has broken
from a post other than the rail. In his latest race, on Oct. 13 at
Santa Anita, the gelding pressed a quick pace before tiring and
finishing sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela will come right back in the fifth, an optional claimer
at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf, aboard Sea To See, a 4-year-old Al
Mamoon gelding who has failed to win in five starts in 2002. Owned by
a partnership and trained by Mike Machowsky, Sea To See will be
cutting back to a sprint for the first time in many months.</TE>
<TE>   The jockey will complete his first day back at work on El Fumar, a
3-year-old Smokester gelding who will be making his first start after
being claimed for $25,000 by trainer Nick Canani.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Lake William, a stakes winner, will make his
first start since April for trainer Richard Mandella in Hollywood
Park's fifth, an optional claimer at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Cornelio Velasquez. The jockey won six races Sunday at
Calder to increase his lead in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Chance Rollins. The jockey is 0 for 25 through the
first 15 days of the Hollywood Park fall meet.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Lake William, Thunder
Bullet, Our New Recruit and Teebar in the fifth, Dukester, El Fumar
and Kedington in the sixth, Unfurl The Flag and Martinblestme in the
seventh and singling Orbea in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/35. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $22.60/$192.40. Total money bet: $252.</TE>

<KH>No. 6 USC vs. No. 7 NOTRE DAME</KH>
<HD>Role Player</HD>
<DH>Pain was a big part of why Wisne quit football, but he's
finding it useful in his new gig -- acting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think Notre Dame has changed since last season, you should see
the guy who used to be the starting nose guard.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Wisne was a 295-pound NFL prospect until a serious concussion
-- the last in a series of draining injuries -- persuaded him to give
up the game.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's a lean 190, with chiseled cheekbones instead of chiseled
biceps, and has come to L.A. to try to make it as an actor.</LD>
<TE>   "I basically gave up my identity," Wisne, 24, said. "I don't know
if anyone would recognize me if I went back to Notre Dame. I gave up
everything I took pride in. It's all I ever knew."</TE>
<TE>   A diet of tomato soup and celery -- maybe half a Slim-Fast for
breakfast, a little cold turkey for dinner -- and obsessive exercise
helped him lose 100 pounds in five months.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have been stereotyped in bouncer roles," Wisne said. "I want
to speak a message, not be like Brian Bosworth."</TE>
<TE>   He has traded one longshot field for another.</TE>
<TE>   "Football was my life, I gave my soul to it," he said. "But
everything, year after year, kept building up, emotion-wise, and I
decided I'd had enough -- enough mental and physical frustration."</TE>
<TE>   He went from trying to deny his pain to trying to tap it.</TE>
<TE>   "You have football, where you block everything out. You pretend
pain or emotions don't exist so you can keep going, because if you
become vulnerable to it, you quit or break down emotionally, which
you can't do.</TE>
<TE>   "Out here, you need all that emotion. You need to be available.
When I realized how much I blocked out, the flood gates just opened.
In the acting classes I've taken, the emotion is flowing."</TE>
<TE>   Though he has yet to get his first break, Wisne has an agent and a
manager and has appeared in a small role on "Ally McBeal." He
auditioned for "The Practice," as well as "American Dreams," "Seventh
Heaven" and shows on the WB network.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lots of rejection," he said. "Somebody said you're not an
actor unless you've been rejected 2,000 to 4,000 times."</TE>
<TE>   His manager, Vicki Frantz of Frantz Management LA, tells him he's
doing well.</TE>
<TE>   "In this business, you have to expect you're going to go on quite
a few auditions before you book a role," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has one great connection -- an aunt, Pamela Wisne, works
with David E. Kelley Productions and once was named one of the 100
most powerful women in Hollywood by the Hollywood Reporter -- Wisne
arrived in L.A. with little more on his resume than a couple of
student plays and an appearance on an NBC halftime show. NBC had
featured Wisne and his brother, Jerry, a Notre Dame offensive lineman
who went on to the NFL, and their father, Gerald, a member of Notre
Dame's 1966 national championship team.</TE>
<TE>   His inexperience hasn't seemed much of a drawback.</TE>
<TE>   "He rather quickly has overcome that obstacle with his talent and
his motivation, I think," Frantz said. "He's very talented and very
much the showman, from being around sports and giving a lot of
interviews and being a public figure.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a lot of really good auditions where he's met producers,
so once pilot season comes along, I think you're going to see his
face on TV. I think he's going to do very well."</TE>
<TE>   Wisne won't be in town when the seventh-ranked Irish arrive this
week for Saturday's game against No. 6 USC. Instead, he'll be
visiting his family in Florida for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   When he left South Bend, Ind., after his final exam in an acting
class last December, he told Notre Dame to mail the diploma, and
hasn't gone back.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean he hasn't looked back. The Irish are 10-1 in
Tyrone Willingham's first season as coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to have played for Tyrone Willingham," said
Wisne, whose eligibility was up after last season, when Notre Dame
went 5-6 in Bob Davie's last season.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of Notre Dame games I watched on TV, I broke
down. I gave my whole soul to that game, and it's just over, but I
made the choice. I watch NFL games and I know I could be doing that."</TE>
<TE>   That isn't such a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he would have had the opportunity to play pro football,
had he stayed healthy that whole year, playing like he was early,"
said Greg Mattison, Wisne's defensive line coach at Notre Dame. "He
was a very, very, very good nose guard for us."</TE>
<TE>   But big-time college football -- and the injuries and emotional
demands that came with it -- gradually eroded Wisne's commitment to
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "My Notre Dame experience was tough," he said. "It was very
emotional as I look back on it. I went through a lot of hard times, a
lot of things nobody ever really knew or saw ... as did a lot of my
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember trying mentally to get prepared that you're going to
have to go through a day of hell and hitting each other and getting
yelled at for two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Say it's a Tuesday and you've got to be in meetings at 3:30. It's
all that's on your mind. You're trying to focus in class, or you're
in your dorm room just before you've got to go, and there's guys
across the hall drinking beer and playing Nintendo."</TE>
<TE>   His years in South Bend were far from the Irish norm.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame had losing records in two of Wisne's four seasons, and
though he wears a Fiesta Bowl ring from the 2000 season, much of his
career was spent watching Davie's job dangle by a thread.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel it change," he said. "As the pressure is put on the
coaches, it's a chain reaction, and it's put on us. Coaches love
football, and they really push. And I don't believe they realize what
it does to a lot of players inside."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just that. It was what football was doing to Wisne's
body.</TE>
<TE>   He had a painful deep knee bruise, back problems and
reconstructive surgery on his groin and shoulder. He tried to fight
through injuries when he could.</TE>
<TE>   "When you miss practice you're looked at as weak, or they don't
believe you that you're really hurt," Wisne said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, before a road game against Boston College last October, he
and teammate Darrell Campbell collided too hard during a pregame
hitting drill.</TE>
<TE>   "We had fans behind us screaming, yelling, cussing at us,
everything. It just motivated me. Usually we're about five yards
apart. This time, me and Darrell were about 10 yards apart. We were
both just completely psyched, emotionally on a high, and we ran at
each other full speed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the last thing I remember that day except little
pieces and flashes. They said I got back up and kept doing the whole
pregame warm-up. I don't remember doing that."</TE>
<TE>   The team medical staff examined Wisne and took his helmet away. He
was too dazed to safely play in the game. As it turned out, he never
played another down.</TE>
<TE>   "I just remember standing on the sideline, looking at the
scoreboard, seeing faces just flash. I got really confused and kind
of hysterical. I remember I started to break down and cry. I don't
remember a lot, but I remember that.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, I sat down with my family and they said, 'Andy,
you've had enough.' And I said, 'I know. I can't take all the stuff
I've had to endure.' "</TE>
<TE>   While the Irish finished the season, Wisne started making the
football body he had worked so hard to build disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be an avid user of creatine [a legal dietary
supplement]. I liked creatine," he said. "No steroids. You can't
really get away with that.... Ephedrine, I took it for practice one
time, and I felt like I was about to fall out."</TE>
<TE>   The pounds slipped away. Jerry Wisne -- drafted by the Chicago
Bears in 1999 and signed to a free-agent contract by the St. Louis
Rams on Tuesday -- says if he hadn't known, "I might have thought he
was a long-lost brother or something. I've never seen him that
skinny, even in his youth."</TE>
<TE>   Andy pressed on, driving himself obsessively in the gym as he
tried to recover from the end of his football career as well as the
end of his relationship with his fiancee.</TE>
<TE>   "I was running away from everything. It was a very hard time for
me, very dark," he said. "A lot of times I'd stay in the gym and
people would look at me like I was crazy on the exercise machine, I
was pushing so hard.</TE>
<TE>   "During practice, sometimes, I'd go back to my room and have a
stick of celery or something and feel just utter confusion about
life."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Wisne eventually could have gotten medical clearance after
the concussion to continue his career. But in his mind, he had moved
on.</TE>
<TE>   "My fifth year, I took my first really strong acting class at
Notre Dame and I found out I really have a love to do it," he said.
"After that Boston College game, I made a decision right then and
there, I was going to come out here and act."</TE>
<TE>   Since Wisne arrived in L.A. a little less than a year ago, his
many acting classes have included sessions at the highly regarded
Larry Moss Studio and private coaching with Marnie Cooper of the
Marnie Cooper School of Acting, who calls Wisne "very gifted."</TE>
<TE>   "When you have someone who's so macho, there's usually a front
they put on," Cooper said. "He doesn't do that at all. He's got a
great look, a great presence and a lot of talent. I think what he has
going is his intensity and focus, which I think is something he
learned in sports. He's completely focused, and he doesn't ask why.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it's like when a coach says do it, you do it. He's a
hard worker, I'll tell you that. I definitely think he's going to be
working [in this business]."</TE>
<TE>   For now, he's honing his acting skills, trying to make
connections. He never overlooks a Notre Dame angle or alumni in the
business, and he is pitching a script about the Irish titled "Gipp,"
by writers Bill Fuller and Jim Pond.</TE>
<TE>   The great irony of it all is, he probably couldn't get cast as a
Notre Dame nose guard anymore, not at 190 pounds on a 6-foot-2 frame.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean his years in South Bend meant nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "We do these exercises and tap into emotions," Wisne said. "I
found when I tap into it, there's something very powerful because of
my experiences at Notre Dame. I feel like it's given me so much
power.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I can do this. I know I have the stuff inside of me."</TE>

<HD>Trade Completed for Yushkevich</HD>

<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still trying to plug a hole in their defense created by the July
departure of free agent Philippe Boucher, the Kings traded Tuesday
for defenseman Dmitry Yushkevich of the Florida Panthers, who played
in the 2000 NHL All-Star game.</LD>
<LD>   Dispatched to the Panthers, who play the Kings tonight at Staples
Center, were two younger players who had been slow in developing with
the Kings, defenseman Andreas Lilja, 27, and winger Jaroslav Bednar,
26. The Kings also acquired a fifth-round pick in next year's draft.</LD>
<LD>   Yushkevich, 31, was traded to the Panthers in July after playing
seven seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs, among them three with
King goaltender Felix Potvin and 2 1/2 with King defenseman Mathieu
Schneider.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a solid NHL veteran," Schneider said. "He moves the puck
well, skates well. You can never have enough mobility and experience
on defense. I'm excited. I think it's a really positive step, sends a
message to everyone that we want to win."</TE>
<TE>   Yushkevich, in his 11th NHL season, said it was frustrating to get
traded for the second time in four months, but that he had heard
rumors for weeks that the Panthers were trying to dump his salary.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how good is this Los Angeles Kings' team," said the
Russian, who owns an ice skating rink in Ontario and for the last two
years has lived in Anaheim during the off-season, about 10 minutes
from the Arrowhead Pond. "I've been watching the playoffs the last
two seasons. They've competed at the highest level against Detroit
and Colorado, two of the best teams in the league."</TE>
<TE>   In the final year of a contract that will pay him $2.75 million
this season, Yushkevich becomes the fifth King eligible for
unrestricted free agency next summer, joining Potvin, Aaron Miller,
Bryan Smolinski and Craig Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh, still unable to play after suffering a concussion
Nov. 12 against the Maple Leafs, was put on the injured reserve list,
retroactive to Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   That means he could play as soon as tonight, but Coach Andy Murray
said it was doubtful that Deadmarsh would return before Dec. 5, when
the Kings play the Nashville Predators at Staples Center. Deadmarsh
has been out the last five games after suffering the injury on a hit
by former King Aki Berg.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Rosa was recalled from the Kings' American Hockey League
team at Manchester, N.H., where he had scored 15 points in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ian Laperriere was held out of practice after suffering
a neck injury Saturday night in a collision with Derian Hatcher of
the Dallas Stars. Laperriere's status for tonight's game will be
determined this morning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former King winger Nelson Emerson, cut loose by the club last
summer, has started scouting for the Kings. In advance of Friday's
game against the Mighty Ducks, he'll keep tabs on the Ducks tonight
against the Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>

<HD>Asked and Answered: Walker on Injured List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Already having had five of their frontcourt players on the injured or
suspended list in the first month, the Lakers put forward-center
Samaki Walker on the injured list Tuesday and activated forward Mark
Madsen.</LD>
<LD>   Walker suffered a strained lower back during Sunday night's win
against the Milwaukee Bucks and apparently suggested to the Laker
staff that he'd need at least the five games required on the injured
list.</LD>
<LD>   "We just felt, given his demeanor and his mentality about it, it
was probably best," Coach Phil Jackson said. "We kind of left this
one up to him."</LD>
<TE>   Walker, who had played through an earlier ankle sprain, averaged
8.1 points and 8.3 rebounds in 14 games, 12 of them as a starter, 11
in place of Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen played 14 minutes against the Miami Heat on Tuesday night
and had two points and five rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Brown is the 2004 Olympic team coach and Jackson is,
apparently, relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons I put my name in the ring ... was simply
because I knew there was a chance [O'Neal] would play," Jackson said.
"And if we wanted to bring our best players, he represents the best
of our best."</TE>
<TE>   He grinned and added with mock sincerity, "I was willing to
sacrifice my summers in response to that. It's a relief to both of us
at this time, that we both don't have to serve."</TE>
<TE>   Asked again about the chance he'd play, O'Neal limped away from
reporters, reviving the running joke about the condition of his knee
come 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah," he said. "It's two years from now. A lot can happen in two
years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal holds the Laker record for points against the Orlando Magic
(39, Feb. 18, 2000) and the Magic record for points against the
Lakers (46, March 8, 1995).</TE>
<TE>   Both games were played in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, referee Scott Foster called a lane
violation on O'Neal, who had teetered into the lane after shooting a
free throw....  The Texas Rangers' Alex Rodriguez has attended three
Laker games in three cities (Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami) in the last
10 days, and the Lakers have lost them all.</TE>

Monday and are expected to play. Hill has played in 12 games and
averaged 16.7 points and 5.8 rebounds. McGrady's 31.8 points per game
lead the league. Former Laker Horace Grant (knee) is on the injured
list. After off-season knee surgery, Grant was in the Magic lineup
opening night and hasn't played since.... The Lakers have won seven
in a row in the series, four in a row in Orlando.</TE>

<HD>Laker Losses Are Tenfold</HD>
<DH>Aimless 97-85 defeat in Miami leaves them 5-10 and playing
like lottery team even with Shaq and Kobe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Lakers, perhaps, had just gotten over the notion they were a
lottery team without Shaquille O'Neal, and then they lost Tuesday
night to the dreadful Miami Heat, and so their margin for error
shrunk again.</LD>
<LD>   That's 10 losses before Thanksgiving with the capable Orlando
Magic tonight. Though none of the Lakers dared predict the effect on
extending their three consecutive championships to four, it doesn't
seem to be getting much easier, either, despite O'Neal's well-spent
first weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have any choice but to play through it," Kobe Bryant
said. "These are the cards we have been dealt. It will do us no good
to worry about the end of the season. It is just important to build
our rhythm, so when we get to that point we are playing the best
basketball we can play."</LD>
<TE>   They were 97-85 losers at American Airlines Arena, before a crowd
that included Anna Kournikova and half the Dolphins' roster, though
that appeared coincidental. O'Neal scored 15 points and had eight
rebounds in 32 minutes, then slipped out of the locker room before
reporters were let in. Bryant, limited by foul trouble to nine
first-half minutes, scored 21 points, also in 32 minutes. Kicked in
the right shin by teammate Mark Madsen, he limped from the floor with
46 seconds left, joining O'Neal on the bench as the Lakers (5-10)
watched the time disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The team committed 21 turnovers, a fact that undermined its
advantages in shooting (49.3% to 46.3%) and rebounds (39-33).</TE>
<TE>   "It looked to me like they were playing at a different speed,"
Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "Recovery [on defense], loose balls,
turnovers, it looked like we were behind the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   After the first quarter, they were. Behind on the floor, behind on
the scoreboard, and now behind again on the sense they were gaining
on their first three weeks, spent trying to scrape together enough
game simply to compete.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers could afford the occasional poor game. They just
couldn't afford to lose it.</TE>
<TE>   Considering O'Neal spent more time on the operating table than the
practice floor over two months, perhaps their first nine losses were
unavoidable. But not this.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat had won once in nine games and twice in 12. It has yet to
score 100 points, actually scoring in the 60s as often as it had in
the 90s before Tuesday's game. It had spent the first month of the
season shooting poorly in front of small, disinterested crowds,
without center Alonzo Mourning and therefore without a playoff
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a breakthrough for us," Coach Pat Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Before a rare sellout, Miami generally kept O'Neal from the
basket, got a combined 48 points from guards Eddie Jones, Travis Best
and Mike James, and scored 20 points off Laker turnovers. Brian Grant
did the job on O'Neal, who, still rusty from two months away and
wearing a black sleeve on his right knee, missed 10 of 15 field-goal
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have the bounce," said Derek Fisher, who scored 20
points, "the type of energy he had the first two nights. I think we
were all aware that at some point the adrenaline dies down. The
conditioning is nowhere near where it needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since O'Neal came off the injured list --
granted, only three games, but you wouldn't think they'd become this
jaded this fast -- the Lakers looked less than inspired.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played 14 minutes in the first half before taking his first
rebound -- on a missed free throw -- and had only two in his first 16
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Because of foul difficulties, Bryant played eight minutes in the
first quarter and one in the second, and so the Lakers found
themselves at halftime with a 50-41 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   They drew within five points midway through the third quarter and
seven early in the fourth, but could not hold onto the basketball
long enough to frighten the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't come up with the loose balls," Jackson said. "We
would tap it to one another, and the loose ball would end up in their
hands. There were things that we did that were beyond logic.
Twenty-one turnovers is inexcusable. We tried to do things tonight
that were out of scope."</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons O'Neal's return was going to be splashy was the
way the Laker schedule turned upon his arrival. They went from
playing, among others, San Antonio (twice), Dallas, Portland (twice)
and Boston, playoff teams all, into Chicago, Milwaukee, Miami and
Memphis, among others, playoff teams none.</TE>
<TE>   It was going to be easier.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland forward Ruben Patterson was arrested Monday night on a
felony domestic assault charge, becoming the latest Trail Blazer
player in trouble with the law.</LD>
<LD>   Tualatin police spokesman Sgt. Doug Nafziger said Patterson was
taken into custody after his wife, Shannon, called 911 and said he
assaulted her at their home. Nafziger said that when police got to
the couple's home, they found that Patterson's wife had minor
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Patterson was taken to the Washington County Jail and released
after teammate Derek Anderson posted $1,000 bail, Nafziger said.</LD>
<TE>   Shannon Patterson released a statement through her husband's
agent, in which she said, "I'm embarrassed that it became public and
this is something we are working out privately. I respectfully
request that we be allowed to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 6, the same day
teammates Damon Stoudamire and Rasheed Wallace are scheduled to
appear in court on drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   Nafziger said Patterson could face up to five years in prison and
a $100,000 fine if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Patterson entered a modified guilty plea in Washington
state to attempted rape. He was sentenced to a year in jail, but a
judge suspended all but 15 days of the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the day that Larry Brown was officially named coach of the 2004
U.S. Olympic team, USA Basketball selection committee chairman Stu

group" of eight or nine players to be chosen by early February.</TE>

<HD>Wheeler's Mother Gives Deposition</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Will described her four-hour deposition to a Northwestern
University attorney Tuesday as "one more hurdle behind me," and
maintained her wrongful death lawsuit against the school will become
a resounding victory.</LD>
<LD>   Will's son, senior strong safety Rashidi Wheeler, collapsed during
a summer conditioning drill and died Aug. 3, 2001. Will, who made the
first oral deposition in the case at the Chicago offices of
Northwestern's attorneys, contends "the drill was designed to run
those kids into the ground."</LD>
<LD>   University attorneys argue Wheeler's use of ephedrine-containing
products Ultimate Punch and Xenadrine led to a catastrophic health
event. A medical examiner ruled Wheeler died of exercise-induced
bronchial asthma. He was 22.</LD>
<TE>   Northwestern attorney Eric Quandt addressed the issue of Wheeler's
supplement use with Will, providing a document signed by two
Northwestern trainers that Wheeler and others on the team mixed the
supplements before running the rigorous drill of 28 sprints ranging
from 40 to 100 yards. Quandt also interviewed Wheeler's older
brother, George Wheeler III, for 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Quandt refused to elaborate on the deposition, saying, "[Will] is
a fine lady who's undergone a tragic event." Jim Montgomery, Will's
attorney, said he and partner Johnnie Cochran Jr. plan to take
depositions from defendants, including Northwestern football Coach
Randy Walker and Athletic Director Rick Taylor, and Wheeler's former
teammates, in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   Will said there will be no settlement negotiations until Walker
and assistant Jerry Brown, the man who recruited Wheeler from La
Verne Damien High, are fired.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been warned by
the NFL that assistant coaches who comment publicly about retaliation
against players will be severely disciplined by the league.</LD>
<LD>   The warning came in a memo written by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
following comments by Packer offensive line coach Larry Beightol
after the hit Sunday on Green Bay tackle Chad Clifton by Tampa Bay
defensive lineman Warren Sapp.</LD>
<LD>   The memo was sent Tuesday, said a source in the league who
requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The league has ruled the hit by Sapp was legal. Clifton remains
hospitalized because of a hip injury and could be out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone conversation Monday, Beightol suggested to
Buccaneer defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin that Sapp can expect to
be cut-blocked the next time the teams meet, possibly in the
playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Murray Does Trick for Streaking Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Bruins' top line has been without Sergei Samsonov nearly
all season, but there has been no shortage of production.</LD>
<LD>   Glen Murray scored the fourth hat trick of his career, Brian
Rolston scored two goals and John Grahame stopped 29 shots, and the
streaking Bruins defeated the Calgary Flames, 7-2, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins won their third consecutive game and seventh in a row
at home. Boston is 8-1-1-0 at the FleetCenter this season. The Flames
lost for the seventh time in eight games.</LD>
<TE>   The last time Murray scored three goals in a game was in last
season's regular-season finale, a 7-1 victory over Pittsburgh at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't start off well tonight and we were down 3-0 right
away," said Calgary goaltender Roman Turek, who was replaced by Jamie
McLellan to start the second period. "It's pretty hard to come back
from that."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Washington 4 -- Robert Svehla scored a tiebreaking
power-play goal at 4:52 of the third period at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs have won five of seven games and the Capitals have
won only two of seven.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Atlanta 2 -- Doug Gilmour, Jan Bulis and Saku Koivu
scored at Montreal to help the Canadiens win for the fourth time in
six games and end a two-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's Jose Theodore stopped 25 of 27 shots, including a glove
save on Marc Savard's shot from the slot 51 seconds into the third
period to protect a 2-1 lead.</TE>

<HD>Lack of Vision Keeps Clippers From Greatness</HD>

<LD>The Clippers are a disappointment, and while I realize that's no
great revelation, I've been admittedly slow in coming to that
conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   For the last two years I've found them to be the most entertaining
show in town. I haven't cared about the players' contract whining
because I'm not going to waste a second of my life worrying whether a
23-year-old basketball player earns $8 million a year as opposed to
$11 million. I've seen a young and promising team, while others
regard the young Clippers as stars in the making for other NBA teams.</LD>
<LD>   I've interviewed Donald Sterling -- repeatedly -- and have given
him the benefit of the doubt when Clipper history suggests this is
one sports owner who deserves nothing but a boot out of town.</LD>
<TE>   But now they've lost me with the short-sighted, idiotic decision
to hold out for a better financial deal at the expense of not putting
their games on local TV -- at a time when interest in the Clippers
has never been higher, which isn't saying a lot.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a buzz around this team, the final 16 games selling
out a year ago, raising the curiosity of local sports fans who long
ago had given up on this franchise. But Tuesday night they were
playing the Utah Jazz -- in position to defeat Karl Malone and John
Stockton for the first time after 14 consecutive defeats, and just
the kind of must-see TV a Clipper franchise needs if it's going to
compete for the entertainment dollar in a town that also houses the
NBA champions.</TE>
<TE>   It's 85-84 Clippers with 5:13 left in the fourth quarter; take my
word for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to be able to offer more games on TV or cable, but even
taking into consideration the fans, I just can't give away our
product to Fox or anyone else," said Andy Roeser, who is in charge of
making sure Sterling keeps his stingy reputation intact. "Fox offered
to air our games at a 20% pay cut from last year on the basis of
locking up our games for the next eight years. We don't think that's
good business."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers aren't in position to tell anyone anything about what
is good business. And while Fox is no authority on what good
entertainment is all about as evidenced by what it puts on the air,
this is one of those situations where it appears everyone loses ...
the Clippers again most of all.</TE>
<TE>   It's 90-88 Clippers with 2:22 left, and what a show you're
missing.</TE>
<TE>   Every Laker game is on TV, and then the playoffs start. The
Clippers will have 25 games on KTLA, four on Telemundo, and another
dozen or so on TNT or ESPN. Over the last few years they've averaged
65 appearances a season -- so while improving on the court they are
retreating on the tube.</TE>
<TE>   It's 92-92 with one minute to play, and Staples Center is rocking.</TE>
<TE>   As horrible as the Clippers have been, they should pay to be on
TV, making the short-term investment to keep the fans' interest,
while going for the big payday if they ever make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Ridiculous," said a Clipper official, and I don't think he was
talking about making the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: Jazz 99, Clippers 94. Never mind -- same old losers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Associated Press reporter asked Coach Alvin Gentry before the
game how good the Clippers might be had everyone stayed healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry said, "That's irrelevant. What would I accomplish if I was
married to Halle Berry?</TE>
<TE>   "My wife isn't going to like that so can you keep that out of the
paper?"</TE>
<TE>   No problem, I said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY CALLED the Tropicana first with the intention of having
Christy Martin and Mia St. John wrestle in mud to promote their
pay-per view boxing match. They had no idea the Tropicana was closed.</TE>
<TE>   They thought about staging a press conference at a local strip
joint before they turned their attention to Frederick's of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   They hoped to dress the boxers in lingerie, and then orchestrate a
pillow fight complete with feathers flying everywhere, but
Frederick's rejected the idea.</TE>
<TE>   They finally settled on frozen turkey bowling on the ice in
Pershing Square for the benefit of KTLA and CNN cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to look at us like some kind of freak show, but now
they are taking us more seriously," said Martin after sliding her
turkey across the ice for a strike for KTLA, and an eight for CNN.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't stop laughing long enough to learn when they're going
to fight, where, and for what reason. I'll get back to you on that
when they finish bowling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I JUST love this one: Nebraska Coach Frank Solich and Colorado
Coach Gary Barnett, along with the presidents of both universities,
issued an open letter to football fans urging them to be good sports
at Friday's game in Lincoln. I mean how many people can read in
Nebraska?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU'VE GOT to give Steve Lavin credit; he's consistent.</TE>
<TE>   And I guess you've got to give Bob Toledo credit; he's consistent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KIDZ2FEED E-MAILED to say: "Chris Leak, the consensus No. 1 high
school quarterback from North Carolina will be on the Trojan
sidelines for an official visit Saturday. Please make sure you
introduce yourself to him if you're going to attend the game.
Tennessee, Texas, Florida and Iowa will be forever indebted."</TE>
<TE>   I've got to give the kid credit for being so smart; some people
will do anything to get the chance to watch Notre Dame play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Tony K:</TE>
<TE>   "You talk about Carson Palmer not being worthy of the Heisman.
What planet have you been smoking grass on.... I believe nobody has
played better than this kid. Your ignorance cannot see that. I've
seen you on TV and please get off your high horse. Your very ugly,
out of shape and seem to have this tremendous ego which does not
serve you right.... Listen stop with your ignorance and try something
new. I dont no maybe GOOD sports writing"</TE>
<TE>   I think you're right; I don't think we're from the same planet.</TE>

<HD>AC Milan Impressive in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former champions AC Milan and Real Madrid put on a superb display of
attacking soccer Tuesday before a sellout crowd of 75,777 at Giuseppe
Meazza stadium in Milan as the European Champions League started its
second round of play.</LD>
<LD>   Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko scored the only goal of the
game in the 40th minute, taking a perfectly placed pass from
Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa and firing the ball past Real Madrid
goalkeeper Iker Casillas, to give Milan the 1-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "We were beaten by a very strong Milan side," said Real Coach
Vicente Del Bosque, who led Madrid to the title last season. "Milan
attacked us at the start, but we responded in the right way. It was a
beautiful game between two great sides."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United scored
impressive road victories in Russia and Switzerland, respectively,
while Juventus fought back to earn a tie with Deportivo La Coruna in
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Borussia, which won the German Bundesliga title last season, fell
behind Lokomotiv Moscow on a 31st-minute goal by Sergei Ignasevich
but pulled even two minutes later when Torsten Frings took advantage
of slack defending. Jan Koller scored the winner in the 43rd minute
as Borussia prevailed, 2-1, in front of 20,000 in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United was surprised by Basel when the Swiss team took
the lead after only 31 seconds on a goal by Argentine striker
Christian Gimenez and only in the second half was the English club
able to gain control.</TE>
<TE>   Two goals within a minute by Dutch forward Ruud van Nistelrooy in
the 61st and 62nd minutes and a third by Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer off a Van Nistelrooy pass in the 68th minute were enough to
give Manchester a 3-1 victory before 29,501 in Basel, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   In La Coruna, Spain, meanwhile, Deportivo jumped to a 2-0 lead on
goals by Diego Tristan and Dutchman Roy Makaay in the first 12
minutes, to the delight of its 30,000 fans, but then allowed Juventus
back into the match and had to settle for a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "The only problem was that we started the game 20 minutes too
late," said Juventus Coach Marcello Lippi after the Italian champions
had rallied on goals by Alessandro Birindelli in the 38th minute and
Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved in the 57th.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo in Hospital</TE>
<TE>   Mario "Lobo" Zagallo, a four-time World Cup winner for Brazil as a
player and coach, was reported to be "doing well" at the Hospital
Samaritano in Rio de Janeiro after being admitted for tests because
of an irregular heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo, 71, who won the World Cup as a player in 1958 and 1962,
as coach in 1970 and as technical director in 1994, was tossed into
the air by Brazil's players last week as they celebrated a 3-2
come-from-behind victory over South Korea in Seoul in a game in which
Zagallo served as Brazil's interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   Riquelme Secured</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona exercised its option and completed the purchase of
Argentine national team midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme by paying his
former club, Boca Juniors, an additional $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish team had acquired a part-interest in Riquelme, 24, for
$6 million in July, but now owns the playmaker outright.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong Betting</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong voted to legalize betting on soccer games in an effort
to raise $128 to $640 million a year in tax revenue and also to put
illegal gambling operations out of business.</TE>
<TE>   The right to operate a soccer betting system was awarded to the
Hong Kong Jockey Club, which controls horse racing in the former
British colony. Among Asian nations, Macau, Singapore and China also
permit some form of soccer wagering.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Gets Scare, Then a Win</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach State men's basketball Coach Larry Reynolds got his first
Division I victory Tuesday night, but it was hardly worth
celebrating.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers got a scare from Cal State Monterey Bay -- the same NAIA
Division II team they had feasted on in two previous meetings --
before pulling away late for an 84-73 victory in their home opener
before 1,581 at the Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   Guard Tony Darden scored a game-high 26 points and forward Kevin
Roberts added 16 for Long Beach (1-1), which bounced back from a
28-point loss at Charlotte on Friday night. But Monterey Bay (1-4)
was as close as 65-63 with 5 minutes 22 seconds remaining.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach had won the other two games against Monterey Bay by a
combined 105 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone expects to blow out this team, but I've been at
that level before and those kids play hard and play aggressively,"
Reynolds said. "This was a big game for them."</TE>
<TE>   There were some positives. The 49ers cut their turnovers from 34
at Charlotte to 13 on Tuesday. They made 20 of 26 free throws,
including two by Roberts with 51.6 seconds left to clinch the win.
Reserve forward Antoine Jackson had 12 points and five rebounds in 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But the Otters, who have lost to The Master's and Dominican
University, hung around for most of the game behind their 50.9%
shooting and nine three-point baskets. Point guard Antoine Griffin
had 19 points and seven assists.</TE>

<HD>Roenicke Making Most of Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So this is the way it works with walk-ons. Josh Roenicke understands
that now.</LD>
<LD>   He waited and waited, switched positions, then waited some more.
He made the travel roster for a nonconference game, but got in for
only six plays in mop-up time.</LD>
<LD>   Next thing he knows he's on the field for 20 plays against USC in
front of 90,000 people at the Rose Bowl. And his role could increase
against Washington State on Dec. 7 because of injuries to three
receivers.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm making the most of it," he said. "I feel like everything is
going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, a redshirt freshman, tried out at quarterback last
season, then was converted to receiver in the spring. In practice he
runs good routes, isn't afraid to block and usually catches the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Starting flanker Tab Perry is sidelined because of a sprained
ankle, and backup receivers Ryan Smith (ankle) and Jon Dubravac
(broken toes) also are out, bumping Roenicke to second string.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Bragg is moving from split end to flanker and freshman
Junior Taylor will start at split end. Sophomore Garrett Lepisto and
Roenicke will play in three-receiver sets.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a talented athlete and he's getting better all the time,"
Coach Bob Toledo said. "I'd venture to say that someday he'll have a
scholarship."</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, a teammate of standout Bruin linebacker Spencer Havner
at Nevada Union High, came to UCLA with an impressive pedigree but
little respect.</TE>
<TE>   He is the son of former major leaguer Gary Roenicke and the nephew
of Angel third-base coach and former major leaguer Ron Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   During batting practice before World Series games, Ron talked as
much about UCLA football and his nephew as he did about the Angel
hitters.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is helping pay my tuition, so [getting a scholarship]
would be huge," Roenicke said. "They're really behind me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The concussion suffered by Bragg against USC did not blunt his
disappointment in the 52-21 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dizzy but I still knew they scored 52; I still saw the
score," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bragg, the team's leading receiver, said he would be fine by next
week. In fact, he would prefer to play Saturday rather than have a
bye.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to get the bad taste out of your mouth after a
loss like that and take it out on somebody else as soon as possible,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Long Shots Too Much for Bruins</HD>
<DH>San Diego makes two key three-pointers in overtime, gets 30
points from Keep and No. 14 UCLA is upset in opener, 86-81.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Holland returned to Pauley Pavilion for the first time in 10
years and found that the venerable building hadn't lost its magic. Or
its heart.</LD>
<LD>   Its soul? To Keep.</LD>
<LD>   Holland brought his team, San Diego. Torero center Jason Keep
brought his game, a rough-and-tumbleweed style honed on the plains of
Oklahoma.</LD>
<TE>   And the Toreros left with a shocking, 86-81 upset of No. 14 UCLA
in overtime Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   In their opener, the Bruins were sharper and played with more
energy than they had in two exhibition losses. But their home floor
had no magic for them. And they just weren't good enough to beat San
Diego, a fair-to-middling West Coast Conference operation most years.</TE>
<TE>   "They did everything necessary to win on the road," UCLA Coach
Steve Lavin said. "They established a force inside, they made their
threes and kept their composure down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA did none of the above.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin forward Jason Kapono followed a 13-point first half with
only four the rest of the way. He missed two potential game-winners
at the end of regulation, two shots in overtime and made only one of
eight three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Keep, a 6-foot-10, 280-pound center, scored 30 points and took 16
rebounds. As the game wore on and the guys in UCLA blue and gold
became black and blue, their only recourse was to foul. Keep made 10
of 14 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a poor job of boxing out," said Keep, a senior who sat
out last season after transferring from Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreros (2-0) shot only 40.6%, but outrebounded UCLA, 49-33.
San Diego had 21 offensive rebounds, consistently out-muscling and
out-hustling the Bruins to the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted this one a lot," Keep said. "We wanted it for Coach
Holland because we knew how much it meant to him."</TE>
<TE>   Holland, a former Bruin star from the 1970s and the last player
recruited by John Wooden, had not set foot in Pauley Pavilion since
leaving as a Bruin assistant coach in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Like Lorenzo Romar -- another Bruin assistant who left before
Coach Jim Harrick was fired in 1996 -- Holland must lie awake nights
wondering what if. Had he not departed, first to Cal State Fullerton,
perhaps he would have been in a position to seize the opportunity
Lavin received.</TE>
<TE>   To come back and spend even a few minutes before the game with
Wooden and then beat the Bruins with the legendary coach among the
6,845 in the stands was consolation enough for one glorious day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a fantastic feeling," Holland said. "This was just an
absolutely special night."</TE>
<TE>   Holland was especially pleased that his 10-year-old son, Kyle, was
able to meet Wooden and watch the game in the building where his
father had played.</TE>
<TE>   "The neatest thing was to show him where his old man played,"
Holland said.</TE>
<TE>   "To experience such a big win here, well, that means a lot as a
father right now."</TE>
<TE>   Another son of a former Bruin standout nearly stole the show.
Josiah Johnson, a sophomore forward who played all of 13 minutes last
season, scored seven points in a row to stretch a two-point UCLA lead
to 65-57 with eight minutes left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   But San Diego went to Keep, and Johnson got into foul trouble.
Kapono and guard Jon Crispin fouled out in overtime as the Toreros
repeatedly got to the line, making 25 of 36 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   A basket by Keep with 1:17 left in regulation tied the score,
73-73 but Kapono's miss was followed by a miss by Bruin guard Cedric

<HD>Polamalu Is Thorpe Award Finalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high ankle sprain that forced Troy Polamalu to miss most of two
games and limited his mobility in others did not hinder the senior
safety's national profile.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Polamalu was chosen one of three finalists for the
Thorpe Award, presented annually to the nation's top defensive back.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Doss of Ohio State and Terence Newman of Kansas State are the
other finalists for the award that was begun in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Carrier, who won in 1989, is the only USC player to win the
award.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, an All-American last season, was injured on the first
series against Washington State on Oct. 5 and also missed the next
game against California. He is second on the team with 63 tackles,
including seven for losses, and intercepted one pass.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm playing very well, but we're winning and that
probably makes a difference," Polamalu said. "Receiving the
[All-American] honor last year made me critique myself even harder."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu made a game-high 13 tackles against Stanford on Nov. 9
and played well against Arizona State and UCLA. He moved without
noticeable discomfort during the sixth-ranked Trojans' final
regular-season practice in full pads and is preparing to finish with
a flourish against seventh-ranked Notre Dame on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he's played through the injury and still been a
great contributor in helping us win is remarkable," USC Coach Pete
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows the end is in sight. There's a break for him, so he's
going to push it hard this week. He isn't going to pace himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Derek Graf started the opener against Auburn at guard
because of injuries and he might start the finale against Notre Dame
at center in place of Norm Katnik.</TE>
<TE>   Katnik, who suffered a high ankle sprain against UCLA, performed
agility drills in shorts. He did not participate in contact drills,
but said he expected to play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Graf said he would be ready if called upon despite playing
sparingly since his season-opening start. He replaced Katnik against
UCLA and threw a block that helped spring Hershel Dennis for a
38-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to prepare as if Norm's going to be out," Graf said. "It
was extremely exciting to start the first game and it would be the
same to start the last one."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer took extra snaps from freshman Fred
Matua after practice. Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said it was a
precaution in case Katnik and Graf are unable to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he would not stand in the way of Chow or Trojan
assistant coaches if opportunities arise elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Chow is regarded as a top candidate for the head coaching position
at Utah, but he said again that he has not been contacted by
university officials.</TE>
<TE>   Chow graduated from Utah, coached at Brigham Young for 27 years
and still has a home in Provo, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a likely candidate and a great candidate with all of his
background and knowledge of the area and the people that they
played," Carroll said. "They'd be very lucky to get him. But he has
not expressed an interest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Gregg Guenther, who caught his first career touchdown
pass against UCLA, aggravated a left knee injury and sat out the last
half of practice. Guenther was bothered by pain in the knee before
the game against the Bruins, but said he expected to play against
Notre Dame.... Cy Young Award winners Randy Johnson and Barry Zito,
both of whom attended USC, will be honored in a pregame ceremony on
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Overtime Loss Has USC's Bibby Fuming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Casey</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>KINGSTON, R.I.</DL>
<LD>Henry Bibby said it was for the kids.</LD>
<LD>   That's how the USC men's basketball coach justified his postgame
comments Tuesday night after the Trojans had lost, 73-71, in overtime
to Rhode Island. Bibby said the referees blew the game and wanted the
Rams to win their first game in the Ryan Center, their new
$54-million on-campus arena.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the worst officiated game I've ever seen since I've been
coaching basketball, since 1981," said Bibby, who added he was going
to protest the result. "I'm not looking for anybody to give me a
basketball game. If we deserve to lose the game, then I'll take
losing the basketball game. We learn from those experiences. That's
what you teach your kids. But this was not a life experience in a
positive way."</LD>
<TE>   When Dustin Hellenga, who scored a game-high 26 points, drove to
the left baseline and made a fadeaway jumper with 2.2 seconds left,
giving Rhode Island a two-point lead, most of the Ram roster and many
fans ran on the floor. But time remained.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bibby, referee Joe DeMayo should have called Rhode
Island for a technical foul. Instead, the Trojans inbounded the ball
and found Desmon Farmer open on the left wing. Farmer's shot bounced
off the rim twice and fell in, an apparent game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby raced into the locker room, pointing his right index finger
upward. His team followed. It seemed the Trojans had escaped with a
win, despite committing 25 turnovers and trailing most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was waiting on that shot three plays ago and I finally got it,"
said Farmer, who scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half and
overtime. "There's no question, we were happy."</TE>
<TE>   DeMayo huddled around a television screen, near midcourt. After
watching a replay for a couple of minutes, he ruled that Farmer's
shot was after time expired, causing a second Rhode Island
celebration. The Trojans, in their locker room, heard the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope when we open our new arena out at USC, I can have these
three same officials come out and officiate that game," Bibby said.
"I would pay for those three guys to come out and referee my game."</TE>
<TE>   USC was called for nine more fouls than the Rams and shot 10 free
throws. Rhode Island shot 25 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Would Bibby have protested even if Farmer's shot had counted?
"Absolutely," he said, tersely.</TE>
<TE>   It was a disappointing loss for the Trojans (1-1) against one of
the worst Atlantic-10 teams. Since the Jim Harrick-led Rams advanced
to the NCAA tournament in 1997 and 1998, Rhode Island has regressed.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams went 8-20 last season, their best record in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very young basketball team," Bibby said. "And they're a
good basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   So it went, as Bibby refused to blame his team's woes on the
players' mistakes and missed shots.</TE>
<TE>   USC had a chance to win at the end of regulation. Errick Craven,
who would foul out and missed nine of 12 shots, drove to his left.
But Rhode Island's Dawan Robinson blocked Craven's shot at the
buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, USC committed five turnovers, took no shots from the
field and scored four points.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hutchinson led USC with 17 points. Brian Woodward had 11
points for the Rams (2-0).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not upset," Bibby said. "But I think it's a shame and
disgrace it had to be called that way. It hurts the kids."</TE>

<HD>Female AIDS Cases on Rise</HD>
<DH>U.N. report says women now make up half of all HIV-infected
adults worldwide. Disease is destabilizing the worst-hit nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- As the AIDS epidemic enters its third decade, for
the first time women account for about half of all infected adults,
and the disease has begun to destabilize countries as it leaves large
swaths of people unable to work or care for their families, a U.N.
report said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   This year, 5 million more people have contracted HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, and about 3 million have died from the disease. And
as the epidemic expands in Asia and Europe, its political and
economic consequences may alter the balance of power in entire
regions, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The face of HIV/AIDS has become that of a young African woman --
seven of 10 people living with the disease are in sub-Saharan Africa,
and 58% of infected Africans are female. Of the 38.6 million adults
living with the disease worldwide, 19.2 million are women, the report
said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're far away from the gay white men's disease it used to be in
the '80s," Peter Piot, the executive director of UNAIDS, an alliance
of six United Nations agencies fighting HIV and AIDS, said after
introducing the report Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Young women are especially hard hit because of their lack of
awareness of safe sex practices or ability to demand them, social
vulnerability to older men and greater physical susceptibility to the
virus, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The "feminization" of AIDS has stunning consequences. Because
women usually manage their children's care and education, tend to
ailing relatives and play a major role in agriculture in Africa, the
effect of their absence is magnified in a way that "many generations
ahead have to deal with," said Bernhard Schwartlander, the HIV/AIDS
director of the World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   The disease is changing the demographic landscape of Africa.
Millions of people in their prime are unable to contribute to the
economy. Often, women contract the virus from their husbands or
boyfriends, and ultimately their children are orphaned.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a whole chunk of the population that is disappearing,"
Piot said. "It's something that we have only seen up until now after
wars, but then it was only on the male side. A whole generation of
millions of orphans -- and what will probably be desocialized youth
-- will grow up, and that is going to create some social instability
as well."</TE>
<TE>   As southern Africa is ravaged by famine caused by drought and poor
food policies, the epidemic only exacerbates the region's
devastation. Illness and death hamper people's ability to grow food
or earn the money to buy it. Studies found that people have adopted
survival strategies that put them at greater risk for infection,
including trading sex for food and migrating to slums without
adequate health care.</TE>
<TE>   Piot pointed to such effects as the first signs of the larger,
societywide destabilizing impact of AIDS that was predicted some
years ago. "But frankly," he said, "I didn't think it would occur
that fast."</TE>
<TE>   Although Africa has the greatest concentration of infected people,
the world's fastest-growing epidemic is occurring in Russia, Eastern
Europe and Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The increase -- 250,000 new infections and 25,000 deaths last year
-- has mostly been caused by a sharp rise in the number of young
people who inject heroin and other drugs. Uzbekistan, in particular,
is showing explosive growth: In the first half of this year, there
were nearly as many new HIV infections as had been recorded in the
whole of the previous decade.</TE>
<TE>   China and India are also facing "serious, localized epidemics,"
the report said, with more than 1 million Chinese infected with HIV,
many through the donation and receipt of tainted blood, and 4 million
Indians also infected.</TE>
<TE>   Economy a Victim</TE>
<TE>   As the AIDS crisis shifts from Africa to higher-income and densely
populated countries in Eurasia, the disease could cause a power shift
in the world's economy as well, analysts say. The spread of the
disease in the three of the region's most populous countries --
China, India and Russia -- threatens to derail the economic prospects
of billions of people and alter the global military balance, said
Nicholas Eberstadt, a researcher at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Eurasia is home to the majority of the world's population, its
combined gross national product outweighs that of the U.S. or Europe,
and four out of five of the world's strongest armies are there,
Eberstadt said.</TE>
<TE>   And so, a jolt in Eurasia caused by the unfolding AIDS epidemic
will have major worldwide repercussions -- much greater than the
impact caused by the public health crisis in Africa, Eberstadt said,
citing mathematical models. "The reason more attention hasn't been
paid to sub-Saharan Africa is that it is 'only' a humanitarian
catastrophe, given its relatively minor weight in the overall world
economy," he said. "That's just a cruel fact of modern life, and the
modern constellation of geopolitical forces."</TE>
<TE>   Balance of Power</TE>
<TE>   But if current trends continue unchecked, AIDS could be a factor
in the balance of power within Eurasia in the coming decades -- and
in the relationship between its giant nations and the rest of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   There were some glimmers of good news in the report, however,
suggesting that the infection rates aren't irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   Various prevention campaigns in Africa and Asia are beginning to
work in a handful of countries.</TE>
<TE>   * In Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, infection levels among young
inner-city women have dropped, from 24.2% in 1995 to 15.1% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * In Uganda, a steady drop in HIV infection in young women is
attributed to changes in sexual behavior, including increased condom
use and abstinence and delayed sexual activity -- the results of a
lengthy information campaign.</TE>
<TE>   * In South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV-positive
population, there has been a marked drop in the number of young
pregnant women testing positive for HIV, to 15.4% in 2001 from 21% in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   * In Cambodia, the Asian country with the highest prevalence of
adult HIV infection, rates appear to be stabilizing and high-risk
behavior decreasing. The report credits the improvements to a
campaign persuading sex workers to use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   * In the Dominican Republic, where about 2.5% of the population is
estimated to be infected, HIV prevalence appears to be leveling off
and perhaps declining, apparently because of increased condom use and
fewer sex partners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to cry victory, because prevalence rates are still
extremely high and they continue to go up among older people," Piot
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we build on experience elsewhere. It should be very
encouraging ... that prevention has an impact."</TE>

<HD>Six Terror Suspects Held in Paris</HD>
<DH>Arrests come as officials target a Pakistani- controlled
network that allegedly had ties to convicted shoe bomber Richard
Reid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>On the fifth day of a law enforcement assault on terrorist networks
in France, police Tuesday arrested six suspected associates of
Richard Reid, the Al Qaeda operative convicted of trying to destroy a
Paris-Miami flight with explosives concealed in his basketball shoes.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests in and around Paris were part of an investigation of a
Pakistani-dominated network that allegedly built Reid's shoe bombs
and sheltered, funded and supervised him before the attempted attack
on an American Airlines jet in December. The suspects are North
Africans and Pakistanis, including a Pakistani imam at a suburban
mosque, a top French law enforcement official said.</LD>
<LD>   The latest sweep brought to 17 the number of accused extremists
captured in raids here since Friday. Although the crackdown on three
Islamic networks linked to Al Qaeda grows out of longtime
investigations of a web of plots, it also responds to fears that
terror cells in Europe are regrouping in order to carry out a major
attack.</LD>
<TE>   Those concerns peaked after the Nov. 9 arrests in Britain of three
Algerians suspected of plotting an attack in London. Led by Rabah
Kadre, an accused leader of an Algerian-dominated network in Europe,
the men allegedly scouted the London subway system and other
potential targets, according to law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting close cooperation among European investigators, some of
the raids in Paris targeted the same London-based network to which
Kadre allegedly belonged. The biggest catch of the lot was Slimane
Khalfoui, 27, a Frenchman of Algerian descent who has been on the run
for two years. He is wanted in a failed plot to bomb the cathedral in
Strasbourg during the Christmas holidays in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Like Kadre in London, Khalfoui was a prominent figure in the
Algerian network in Europe, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an important catch," the French law enforcement official
said. "He is as important, or more important, than Kadre in the
network."</TE>
<TE>   Khalfoui had been hiding at his sister's apartment in Montfermeil,
a high-crime suburb northeast of Paris. He was captured Monday when a
contingent of anti-terrorist investigators, backed by riot police and
firefighters, stormed into an arson-scarred housing project where
youth gangs have been known to make common cause with Islamic
extremists and toss Molotov cocktails at police from rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   Khalfoui saw combat with Islamic fighting forces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, authorities said. Like Kadre, he was allegedly a
close associate of Amar Makhlulif, known as Abu Doha, an Algerian
arrested in February 2001 as the accused mastermind in the plot to
attack LAX with a car bomb during millennium celebrations at the end
of 1999. Abu Doha is also suspected of overseeing the Strasbourg
plot.</TE>
<TE>   The raids Monday also produced the arrests of four other men and a
woman, all described as Algerians or French Algerians.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear whether investigators think Khalfoui was involved
in the alleged plot in London. British authorities have said little
more about that case other than to deny media reports that the
suspects were about to unleash a poison gas attack on the subway
there.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources in Europe say some of those reports were
exaggerations. But they also say the London suspects were
"significant players," in the words of one investigator, and that
their apparent preparations for a terrorist act generated legitimate
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Abu Doha network have in the past expressed
interest in using chemical weapons, according to the convicted
would-be bomber in the LAX plot, Ahmed Ressam. He has described
training with such weapons at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Because the networks in that case and others extend from Britain
and France into Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, French
investigators are working with police in those countries as well. The
crackdown, led by Jean-Louis Bruguiere and Jean-Francois Ricard,
France's top anti-terrorist magistrates, began Friday with the arrest
of Redouane Daoud, 25, an Algerian fugitive who broke out of a Dutch
prison June 5.</TE>
<TE>   Daoud allegedly has ties to a Tunisian network in Belgium that
furnished fraudulent passports to two suicide bombers who posed as
journalists to assassinate a leader of the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance in Afghanistan two days before the Sept. 11 attacks. After
catching Daoud, police rounded up four alleged associates Friday and
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   As for the shoe-bomber case, the French law enforcement official
said it is too soon to tell whether the suspects were direct
accomplices of Reid, who received instructions via Internet from
Pakistan while in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Under France's tough anti-terrorism laws, the suspects can be held
for four days without being charged.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making progress," the French law enforcement official
said. "We still have a lot of work to do."</TE>

<LD>   Francoise Ducros, Chretien's communications director, had been

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>As international arms inspectors prepare to fan out over Iraq today,
U.N. and Iraqi officials are at odds over letting reporters tag
along.</LD>
<LD>   The U.N. team is reluctant to have journalists reporting what the
inspectors have or have not found because that may not be clear to
the professionals themselves without data analysis.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want journalists to be with us in the facilities," said
Melissa Fleming of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</LD>
<TE>   But Iraq, which has highly restrictive press policies, is
championing free media access, at least as far as inspections are
concerned, to prove it is weapons-free. "From our point of view, the
press will be granted full access to every single site," an Iraqi
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior inspector Dimitriou Perricos said Tuesday that journalists
could accompany the teams to sites but must stay outside.</TE>

<HD>Mexico, U.S. Agree to Be Patient in Talks</HD>
<DH>Key issues of migration and water debt defy rapid
solutions, Powell says, but both nations declare a commitment to
moving forward.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>In a videotaped speech played at Mexico's presidential residence
Tuesday, President Bush repeated words that, when first uttered
nearly 15 months ago, sent hopes soaring on both sides of the border.
"The United States," he said, "has no more important relationship in
the world than the one we have with Mexico."</LD>
<LD>   This time, the president's declaration sounded more like ritual
than promise. It echoed in a meeting hall as Cabinet officials of
both countries gathered to discuss, and disagree on, the most
pressing cross-border issue facing each of them.</LD>
<LD>   At the two-day meeting, the Bush administration failed to satisfy
Mexican President Vicente Fox's appeal -- in a speech just before
Bush's message from Washington -- for immediate high-level talks to
assure "safe, orderly and legal" migration of Mexicans to the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   And Mexico declined, despite strong urging by U.S. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell, to set a timetable for repayment of its nearly
half-trillion-gallon water debt to the United States, a step that
might have reassured drought-stricken south Texas farmers that there
will be enough irrigation for next year's spring planting.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, both sides made it clear that the two issues, migration
and water, defy rapid solutions and are likely to remain problematic
for years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not something we have to finish before or after anyone's
administration," Powell told reporters, referring to talks on
migration. "If we could both snap our fingers and make all the
problems go away, we would do so this moment. It is not that easy.
But we are committed to moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Fox proposed last year that Washington expand permanent visas and
guest-worker programs for Mexicans and give legal status to about 3.5
million undocumented Mexican migrants who live and work in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries and their like-minded leaders, who got along
famously from the start, were headed for serious negotiation on the
proposal last year. But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks shifted Bush's
focus from open borders to the need for stringent security at home.</TE>
<TE>   This week's annual meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Binational
Commission was the first Cabinet-level review of the relationship
since the attacks. Heading the U.S. delegation here, Powell suggested
that the Republicans' election sweep to control Congress might make
legislative support for migration reform even more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials have read the U.S. election results differently,
believing that Bush is now freer to act.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, sounding impatient, said the two countries have a "window of
opportunity" to advance on migration issues. He insisted that
Mexicans pose no threat to their northern neighbor and that the
United States should "clearly distinguish" between them and
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   About 1.5 million Mexicans are arrested each year trying to cross
the 2,000-mile U.S. border illegally. Fox warned that the migrant
flow would increase unless the two countries take steps to ease the
pain of Mexican farmers after the last protective tariffs on most
agricultural products end Jan. 1 under the North American Free Trade
Agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush agreed that U.S. policies "must treat Mexican men, women and
children with respect and dignity" but offered no sign that migration
reform is a high priority.</TE>
<TE>   Powell suggested, however, that the two countries begin work on a
partial migration deal that would start with less controversial
issues, such as temporary work visas and an expanded guest-worker
program, but not involve legalization of undocumented migrants.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to come up with an agenda that we can pursue over the
next six months to a year, and look first at those items that have
highest probability of success and then work our way into those that
are more difficult to resolve," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda, who led his country's
delegation, accepted that approach, saying Mexico wants "concrete,
specific, punctual agreements on very concrete topics that we can
move on now."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Bush nor Fox mentioned the water feud. But Powell pressed
Castaneda for a repayment schedule, saying the Bush administration is
"committed to addressing the serious plight of south Texas farmers."
Mexican officials said they are constrained by domestic politics in
their own drought-stricken border states but promised that talks
would continue.</TE>
<TE>   A 1944 treaty obliges Mexico to send the United States one-third
of the flow of its Rio Grande tributaries. Its most recent payment
was last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the disagreements, the tone of the meeting and the two
presidents' speeches was positive. Bush and Powell spoke warmly of
Mexico's cooperation on this month's U.N. Security Council resolution
to send weapons inspectors to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the United States pledged $25 million for training and
high-tech equipment to help Mexico patrol its border and screen
U.S.-bound cargo. The United States will also help Mexico improve air
quality in the border region.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries agreed on educational standards that would make
it easier for migrant children to switch between schools in the
United States and Mexico without losing course credits.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 U.S. officials attended the talks, including Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft and U.S. drug czar John Walters. A delegation of
American entrepreneurs came with them, part of the administration's
effort to stimulate private U.S. investment in needy areas of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the two countries announced a treaty modification to
lighten the tax burden on cross-border investors.</TE>

<HD>Israel Kills 2 Militant Palestinian Leaders</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A missile fired from an Israeli aircraft struck a building in the
Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank late Tuesday, killing two local
leaders of Palestinian militant groups, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified as Alah Sabbagh of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade and Imad Nasrti of the Islamic militant group Hamas. They
were in the same room on the first floor of the building when a
missile came through the window and exploded, rescue workers said.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian security sources said both men, Jenin-area commanders
for their respective groups, had been wanted by Israeli security
forces for months.</LD>
<TE>   Israel claims the right to target and kill Palestinians suspected
of planning attacks. Palestinians and human rights groups object to
the practice, calling it summary execution with no judicial process.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, tanks backed by helicopter gunships battled Palestinian
gunmen during an Israeli raid in the Gaza Strip, and troops rounded
up dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank in a sweep for militants.</TE>
<TE>   In political developments, Palestinian officials acknowledged that
it was unlikely that general elections will be held as scheduled on
Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said he was "not hopeful"
the elections for Palestinian Authority president and parliament
would be held as scheduled and blamed Israel, whose troops have been
in control of most West Bank cities since June.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli government has done nothing but obstruct our
efforts," he said. "We haven't been able to register voters or train
people for this huge process."</TE>

<HD>Iraq's Exiles Wait, Maneuver</HD>
<DH>Various factions outside the country jockey for leadership
in the event Hussein falls. But infighting among the groups worries
many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The man who would be king of Iraq holds court in a living room lined
with plush tapestries and mementos of bygone grandeur.</LD>
<LD>   Like other leaders of the Iraqi opposition in exile, Sharif Ali
bin Hussein left his homeland decades ago. His family fled in 1958
after the military massacred his relatives, King Faisal II and Crown
Prince Abdul-Ilah, and other members of a royal clan resented as
colonial puppets of Britain. The memory of the bloody coup makes it
hard to imagine the return of a king even if, as the opposition
claims, the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein is on its last legs.</LD>
<LD>   But the exiled Bin Hussein, head of the Constitutional Monarchy
Movement, has a trait in common with other potential leaders of a
postwar Iraq. He dreams big.</LD>
<TE>   "The monarchy ... is the most viable system to ensure the
functioning of democracy," asserted the 46-year-old former investment
banker.</TE>
<TE>   If President Saddam Hussein falls one day in a battle for Baghdad,
perhaps Bin Hussein and other leaders of the Iraqi opposition will
realize their dream of building a democracy in their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, they have been busy fighting a battle here in
London. Among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since they pledged in August to overcome longtime
differences, the six main groups representing opponents of the Iraqi
president have been trying to organize a landmark conference of
exiles to plan for their country's future.</TE>
<TE>   But renewed infighting forced several postponements, most recently
of a planned gathering in Brussels this month. After U.S. diplomats,
defense and national security officials mediated, the opposition
groups said last week that they would meet next month in London.</TE>
<TE>   The exiles want to declare a common mission and build a framework
for a provisional government. But until they pull off a conference,
the opposition forces will have failed a basic test of unity. This
aggravates doubts about their effectiveness among critics, who say
the opposition groups lack a base inside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of the people in Baghdad won't know their names,"
said Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi-born academic at the Royal United
Services Institute, a London think tank. "You cannot parachute
leadership from outside. In Iraq, there is a state, there are
institutions. It is not like the Taliban in Afghanistan, who were not
really a government."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles, the London-based activists lack neither
experience nor outside clout. They have survived assassination
attempts. They have run spy networks and guerrilla operations, albeit
with mixed results. They have cultivated allies in the State
Department, the Pentagon, Congress and the CIA, a web of shifting
relationships that has created tensions among those branches of the
government.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration recently approved $92 million to provide
combat training for Iraqi exiles, many to be drawn from lists
provided by the Iraqi National Congress, or INC, the most prominent
group. The opposition could be useful intermediaries for a U.S.
government trying to build a postwar power structure in Iraq. The
State Department has held workshops here with the groups to discuss
tasks for a transition, such as democratization and justice reform.</TE>
<TE>   But the stated U.S. commitment to bring democracy to Iraq could
clash with the authoritarian traditions of the Middle East, analysts
say. Most of Iraq's rulers have been soldiers or former soldiers who
gained power by force. A glaring exception: Despite his uniforms and
swagger, Saddam Hussein never served in the military. He rose to the
top as a gunslinging political operative.</TE>
<TE>   Any ruler of Iraq must confront ethnic, religious and tribal fault
lines. The country is about 60% Shiite Muslim and 35% Sunni Muslim,
but the latter dominate the political elite. The Sunnis fear that
mostly Shiite southern Iraq is vulnerable to encroachment by Iran's
Shiite fundamentalist government. Between 15% and 20% of Iraq's
population are ethnic Kurds, who control a semiautonomous region in
the north.</TE>
<TE>   The composition and conflicts of the exile organizations reflect
that mosaic. There are two Kurdish groups, an Islamic Shiite group
and the Iraqi National Accord, which is headed by a Shiite and
includes former military and political officials. This "Group of
Four" has clashed with the INC, which is theoretically an umbrella
coalition of the major players, and with the monarchist party. The
latter two of the Group of Four are a mix of Shiites and Sunnis, many
of them well-off and Western-educated.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics in Europe predict that Saddam Hussein's successor in a
postwar scenario will not be a onetime exile, but rather a military
strongman.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those in U.S. government who see Iraq as a first step
toward democratization in the Arab world," said Remy Leveau, a Middle
East expert at the Institute for Political Studies in Paris. "But the
Americans have only relied on authoritarian figures in the past. They
will continue to do so for fear of Islamic groups winning elections.
An open democratic system is hard to control. There is the temptation
to find a presentable general who makes certain guarantees: not
attacking Israel, access to oil."</TE>
<TE>   A compromise for the U.S. may be to groom a military defector to
work with the armed forces, which Alani argues would be an inevitable
engine of transition.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot jump from absolute dictatorship to absolute
democracy," he said. "There must be a transitional period. You need a
strong central government to rebuild, assert authority. Either you
run the country, take care of rubbish collection, pay salaries, or
you use the only institution that is viable: the military."</TE>
<TE>   The highest-ranking defector is Gen. Nizar Khazraji, 64, a former
army chief of staff who fought with distinction in the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   He fled Iraq in 1996 and lives in Denmark. While keeping his
distance from the opposition, Khazraji has offered to lead an armed
rebellion against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But his prospects plummeted last week when Danish prosecutors
charged him with war crimes. Khazraji had been under investigation
for his alleged role in summary executions, forced relocation and
pillage by forces under his command in Kurdistan, the Kurdish region
of northern Iraq, between 1984 and 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Joining the Iraqi opposition cannot be a 'get out of jail free
card' for mass murder," said Hanny Megally of New York-based Human
Rights Watch. "These charges send the signal that there is no
impunity for former Iraqi officials who may be responsible for
horrific crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Khazraji has denied the allegations. Curiously, Kurdish leaders
had said weeks before the arrest that they had no quarrel with the
general. He has not been jailed but is prohibited from leaving
Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   The civilian opposition disagrees vehemently with the idea that
Iraq needs a providential soldier to hold it together. The exiles are
known quantities to Western and Arab governments.</TE>
<TE>   That is both a strength and a weakness for Ahmad Chalabi of the
INC, a cagey and combative veteran of exile politics. He said the
opposition has been energized by the international community's
confrontation with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "For the groups in exile, the more remote the goal seemed, the
more division there was," Chalabi said in an interview at his
headquarters near London's Hyde Park. Now the groups agree at least
that the time has come to take on Hussein, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition now is being challenged to put together a program
and a structure," Chalabi said. "From our point of a view, it's a war
of liberation. It's a war for Iraq, not against Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi's critics accuse him of maneuvering to promote himself as
a first among equals and sow divisions by refusing to attend the
conference unless it was expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi's advocates say he held out against old-school exile
politicians for an event representing more young and independent
exiles. The proposed size of the conference has grown from 75
delegates to at least 300, with negotiations underway to include an
additional 50.</TE>
<TE>   "The conference in Brussels was a nonstarter," said Zaab Sethna, a
spokesman for the INC. "This is a totally different conference. We
want the process to be open, transparent and democratic. The previous
process would have been smoke-filled rooms."</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi, 57, comes from an elite Shiite family that fled Iraq
after a coup brought the Baath Socialist Party to power in 1968.
Chalabi earned advanced degrees in mathematics from the University of
Chicago and MIT and became wealthy in banking and business.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he built a base of political and financial
support in Washington. He led an armed insurrection based in
Kurd-controlled northern Iraq. But his forces were routed by
Hussein's troops in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Chalabi's relationship with U.S. diplomats and
intelligence officials has worsened. His critics accuse him of
dubious ethics, citing a conviction in absentia for bank fraud in
Jordan in 1992. (He has called it a political setup.) A State
Department audit blocked his U.S. financing this year because of
allegations of abusing funds.</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi says interference by U.S. "kingmakers" has contributed to
the opposition's disarray. Nonetheless, his strong ties to the
Pentagon and congressional leaders make him a force to be reckoned
with as a potential showdown with Iraq approaches.</TE>
<TE>   One of Chalabi's sometime rivals, Iyad Allawi of the Iraqi
National Accord, is also from an upper-class Shiite background. He is
Chalabi's relative by marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Allawi, 57, got his start in Iraq's ruling Baath Socialist Party.
He met Hussein when they were both rising stars in the party.</TE>
<TE>   In jovial and cultivated tones, Allawi recalls riding in a car in
1969 with Hussein, then a chief of the security forces, and telling
him the government was excessively repressive. Hussein, looking
askance, replied: "Doctor, you cannot rule with a soft heart."</TE>
<TE>   Allawi got a brutal taste of that philosophy in 1978 after he went
into exile in London. Attackers believed to be Iraqi agents broke
into his home and gave him a beating that left him hospitalized for a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Allawi later worked for the World Health Organization and in
private business. After the invasion of Kuwait, he formed the Iraqi
National Accord, which has established a presence in Middle Eastern
countries and contacts in the U.S. intelligence community.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi government crushed a coup attempt engineered by his
group in 1996. Critics say the INA has few members and an
undemocratic mentality.</TE>
<TE>   Allawi describes any differences with Chalabi as healthy
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "When we criticize the INC for not having a solid plan of
operations, we don't mean to ridicule them," Allawi said. "They are
in the opposition. We have to be partners. We can work together."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Allawi does not seem especially enthusiastic about
the exile conference, which will take place between Dec. 10 and Dec.
15 if delegates can get visas in time and the U.S.-brokered agreement
holds together.</TE>
<TE>   "It is mainly symbolic," Allawi said. "You cannot discuss these
matters in an open forum. Once Saddam is gone, yes."</TE>
<TE>   The London conference is also being organized by two Kurdish
parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party. Their leaders, Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani,
respectively, have at least temporarily overcome historic enmity and
share authority over Kurdish-held territory in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdish organizations control tens of thousands of troops on
the ground. And that will make them a factor in future coalitions,
negotiations and disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Kurdish groups, the Iranian-backed Supreme Council for
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq is a faction with an armed presence on
the ground. The Iran-based Shiite organization oversees a guerrilla
force in southern Iraq. The Tehran connection has caused the council
to have a wary relationship with other exiles and especially with the
U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   But that could change. The council's leader, Ayatollah Mohammed
Bakr Hakim, will send his brother, a religious scholar, as his
emissary to the London conference.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the supreme council hope that this will contribute not
just to unity among the opposition, but an improved relationship
between the U.S. and Iran as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq will be a good test for the relationship," said Hamid
Bayati, the organization's London representative. "It could be key to
improving relations between the two countries."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Islamic group stayed away from the State Department's
workshops on the future of Iraq here, Bayati on Tuesday praised
American officials for helping the exiles arrive at an understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "Their mediation was good," he said. "Things are improving. There
are differences in our views, which are obvious. But we are trying to
come to an agreement. I hope we can have a successful conference."</TE>

<HD>Bereaved Parents for Peace</HD>
<DH>Palestinians and Israelis who have lost children to the
conflict make use of their moral authority to speak out together
against hatred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>RAANANA, Israel</DL>
<LD>Both Israeli and Palestinian societies bestow a special, if
undesired, status on parents whose children have been killed in
conflict. It is an unhappy collective that has grown tremendously in
a war now staggering through its third year.</LD>
<LD>   Their status gives these families a moral authority to speak out,
and a group of Israelis and Palestinians is using the platform to
fight an atmosphere of hate. Calling themselves the Parents' Forum,
they first came together seven years ago; what is remarkable is that
they continue even now to meet and reach out to an increasingly
resistant audience.</LD>
<LD>   Their message is the antithesis of today's mainstream: No to
revenge. Turn the other cheek. Peace over pain.</LD>
<TE>   Choosing a potent symbol for one of their latest projects, they
gave blood to the other side one day last month: Jerusalem resident
Rami Elhanan and other Israeli parents trudged past their army's
machine guns, across the dust-caked Kalandiya checkpoint, and donated
blood at a Ramallah hospital. Palestinians did likewise at a Red Star
of David emergency-services center in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   When Elhanan, a graphic designer whose daughter was killed in a
suicide bombing five years ago, went on Israeli TV that night to talk
about it, the artist applying his makeup demanded: "How could you
give blood to the enemy?"</TE>
<TE>   That's a typical reaction, said Elhanan, a man of boundless energy
and indomitable spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "In Israel, bereaved families are sacred. We can say anything, do
anything," he said. "We use this admiration to push a new way of
thinking through a narrow hole .... The whole point of this is to
show that if those who paid the price, the ultimate price, can talk
to each other, then anyone can."</TE>
<TE>   To prove the point, Elhanan and Palestinian lumber contractor
Khaled Awwad drove to Ostrovsky High School in Raanana, a
middle-class suburb of Tel Aviv, on a recent sunny morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Parents' Forum had written to dozens of schools offering to
address pupils on the need for peace and reconciliation; only a few
have taken them up on the offer. This was one of them, thanks largely
to the principal, a former combat pilot who supports the project.</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan is relaxed; he has spoken to such groups before. But it is
the first time they'll bring a Palestinian to an Israeli school, and
Awwad is both nervous and exhilarated.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Awwad's brothers -- 14-year-old Said and 30-year-old Yusuf
-- were killed within six months by Israeli soldiers who invaded
their West Bank village of Beit Ummar during the current fighting.
Awwad's mother, Fatima, a 60-year-old stalwart, joined the parents
organization and then drew Khaled into its activities.</TE>
<TE>   Standing before the chalkboard, Elhanan opens his talk to a
classroom of 29 seniors, most of whom will be going into the army in
a few months. They are slumped in their chairs. Most of them have
their arms crossed.</TE>
<TE>   He tells them that on the fourth of September -- 1997 -- Thursday
-- at 3 p.m. -- a Palestinian suicide bomber killed his 13-year-old
daughter Smadar as she shopped for school supplies in Jerusalem's Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall. A friend with her was also killed. Another
was seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   It gets their attention.</TE>
<TE>   'Brother by Fate'</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan introduces Awwad, "my brother by fate."</TE>
<TE>   "Our pain is equal," Elhanan says.</TE>
<TE>   Both men tell the students that the deaths in their families
propelled them to pursue peace and reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   "After my first brother was killed," Awwad says, speaking in
flawless, casual Hebrew, "I didn't want to see Jews anymore. My brain
stopped working. But then I thought, that's not the solution. You
kill me, I kill you -- it's not right. Then my second brother was
killed. I have to tell you, they were my favorites of all my
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "The first days were hateful, but then I calmed down. The solution
is not to kill but to solve the reasons people kill."</TE>
<TE>   The students are unusually attentive for a roomful of pre-lunch
17-year-olds. But they're not really buying the message.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very encouraging to see people like you who want peace, but
there is a minority that doesn't want peace, and they are the ones
running things," says a girl with shoulder-length brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   A boy in a black T-shirt and a headband says: "I know terrorist
attacks don't just happen, that we've done things to them too. But
what are we supposed to do when we get attacked, just sit there?"</TE>
<TE>   The discussion grows heated. Voices are raised when Awwad
describes the routine humiliation Palestinians meet at the hands of
Israeli soldiers at roadblocks. Elhanan -- in calculated provocation
-- compares the actions of a soldier whose recalcitrance forces a
Palestinian mother to give birth at a roadblock to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you say that?" demands the boy with the headband. "That
is your army! That soldier is there to protect you."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, it's humiliating, it's not right," a blond girl tells Awwad.
"If the Arabs want to criticize us, fine, but they don't have to come
and kill us."</TE>
<TE>   Awwad responds: "How can you expect us to live normally when we
have soldiers on top of us?"</TE>
<TE>   A student answers: "Because there are people who want to blow up
my home."</TE>
<TE>   The students come to one overriding conclusion: The visit and the
discussion are interesting, but when will Elhanan and Awwad take the
same message to a Palestinian school, where talk of reconciliation
and tolerance is even more rare?</TE>
<TE>   A good question. Awwad tells the students he has been planning
just such a visit, and he says he is certain that the Palestinian
youths will be receptive. But later, he confides to a reporter that
he won't be able to speak to a school without permission from
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan is enthusiastic but acknowledges that it could take a long
time to make arrangements on the Palestinian side, where schools --
and everything else -- are in utter disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a girl with long brown hair and a white tank top asks
Awwad: "Are there other Palestinians like you?"</TE>
<TE>   He pauses, then answers: "There are many who believe in peace, but
they don't necessarily come out and say it. We have no democracy.
People are afraid of [Islamic radical groups] Hamas and Islamic
Jihad. If you're seen talking with the Jews, you will be seen as a
collaborator."</TE>
<TE>   "So what can you do?" the girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only do what we are doing," he says, "talking a lot and
supporting each other and encouraging people from both sides to come
out. And maybe one day we will have the strength to reach the
decision-makers and to change things."</TE>
<TE>   While Elhanan and Awwad were addressing this group, four other
members of the parents organization -- all Israeli Jews -- spoke to
other classes. Perhaps because a Palestinian was not present, several
of those students chose not to mince words about Arabs. One later
confronted Awwad as he and the Israeli members of the group were
leaving the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't ever have peace with them," the student said loudly. "We
have to throw them all out of here. That's the only solution."</TE>
<TE>   Awwad shrugged it off. Elhanan, a bit chagrined, still sought the
silver lining. If he had raised any doubts or prompted any
questioning in any young mind, or challenged the prevailing myths,
then he had been successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel stronger coming from here," he said. "I'm not fooling
myself. There's a lot to change and a long way to go. But I come away
with some hope."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative to Peacenik</TE>
<TE>   The Parents' Forum is the brainchild of Yitzhak Frankenthal, whose
beloved "blue-eyed, golden-haired" son, a soldier, was kidnapped and
killed by Hamas in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 Israelis and 100 Palestinians are members. Their numbers
were initially swelled by new deaths during the current conflict,
then eroded by feelings of betrayal and hate that have driven even
peace-loving Israelis and Palestinians apart.</TE>
<TE>   Most of its Israeli members come from a tradition of leftist,
secular politics. Not Frankenthal. He is an Orthodox Jew who wears a
large kippa, or yarmulke, atop waves of gray hair. His journey from a
world of pious conservatism to his mission today as a peacenik was a
long one.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not love Palestinians -- they killed my son," he once told
The Times. "But I have respect for Palestinians as a people and give
to them the dignity that I would give to an Israeli."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Frankenthal's spiritual counterpart on the
Palestinian side is Awwad's mother, Fatima. An oft-jailed fighter for
Palestinian rights, her journey was also a long one.</TE>
<TE>   Sorrow from losing a child, she said, became the cement that
bonded the Awwads to Frankenthal, Elhanan and the other Israelis. It
fed not revenge for them, but mutual empathy and yearning for peace.</TE>
<TE>   "All Jews are not the same -- nor are all Arabs," she said in the
living room of her home in Beit Ummar, about 10 miles south of
Jerusalem. Hair covered, and dressed in the embroideries typical of
the southern Judean hills, she smoked steadily and defiantly, an
unusual gesture of independence for a woman of her generation. "Both
families have lost children and can sit together. Maybe that will
help people go toward peace."</TE>
<TE>   It is not necessarily easy, she allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk about peace, it's as if I'm holding a piece of
burning coal in my hand, and I close it tight," she said. "I have to
just put aside the fact that I've lost a son."</TE>
<TE>   About 50 Israeli Jews traveled to Beit Ummar earlier this year to
meet with the Awwads and other bereaved Palestinian parents. Elhanan
and the other Israelis gush over the meeting, an extremely rare
encounter in today's atmosphere. But it created a number of
difficulties for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   For it to take place at all, the Awwads secured permission from
Arafat, and then spoke to representatives of local militias to ensure
the safety of the Israelis. Still, several townspeople protested: How
can you talk to "the enemy" when we cannot even leave our village to
see a doctor? they demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Beit Ummar, a quiet village of 13,000 people famous for its grapes
("as sweet as the women of Beit Ummar"), has been completely cut off
for most of the last two years of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army blocked its entrances to protect a main
north-south road used by Jewish settlers who are the target of
frequent ambushes by Palestinian gunmen. Villagers can only enter or
exit on foot. The eldest Awwad son, Yusuf, was killed when he argued
with Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery where he is buried, in a vault closed by a pile of
stones, is full of such "martyrs," Palestinians killed by Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The Awwads are part of what Palestinian political scientist Khalil
Shikaki calls a "vanguard" who not only speak out but are willing to
join forces with Israelis despite the danger. Though a minority now,
the vanguard will ultimately serve as the basis for any coexistence,
Shikaki says.</TE>
<TE>   The Awwads depend on their family's status as longtime
participants in the resistance to Israeli occupation, and the losses
they've suffered, to protect them from retribution.</TE>
<TE>   "Our family has spent years in the struggle," Khaled Awwad said,
seated next to Fatima. It was the first day he had been home since
the trip to the Raanana school because Israel had closed the roads,
trapping him in Bethlehem to the north. His six children fawned on
their father.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can come and say a word against us," he said. "They cannot
claim that I am doing something against my people. I lost two
brothers. You cannot lose the blood of your brothers and be accused
of collaborating.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ashamed to say I want peace with the Jews. I don't care
if they accuse me of being an informer or a traitor. My brain tells
me, my soul tells me, this is the only way."</TE>
<TE>   An Uphill Battle</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan, speaking later at his home in the comfortable Rehavia
neighborhood of Jerusalem, said the criticism suffered by Israeli
members of the group is nothing compared to what Awwad and the
Palestinian members go through.</TE>
<TE>   Is the whole thing a losing battle? Maybe.</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan invokes a phrase that he uses often, both in his public
speaking and in private conversations. "I'm trying to empty the ocean
with a teaspoon," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan's living room is a shrine to his daughter. Eighteen
photographs of the girl, from babyhood to her 13th and final year,
cover the walls and tabletops. The family wants "to be surrounded" by
her, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Elhanan's wife and Smadar's mother, Nurit Peled-Elhanan, has
emerged as a prominent peace activist. Always an outspoken leftist,
she has used the platform to speak out against Israeli occupation and
for an end to decades of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   She is an unwilling activist in this particular battle, she says,
but she does it because "it's part of being a parent. Nothing more
than that."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Americanism Sweeps South Korea</HD>
<DH>The acquittals of two GIs in the death of a pair of
schoolgirls have sparked protests. U.S. ambassador apologizes on
Bush's behalf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The deaths of the two schoolgirls were particularly gruesome. While
walking along a narrow rural road to a friend's birthday party, they
were crushed by a 50-ton mine-clearing vehicle that was moving during
a U.S. Army training exercise.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, two GIs accused of negligent homicide in connection
with the fatal accident were acquitted in U.S. courts-martial. Ever
since, one of the most intense waves of anti-Americanism in recent
years has swept through South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike demonstrations against President Bush's visit to South
Korea in February, which were staged almost entirely by left-wing
students, the case of the crushed schoolgirls has drawn in a wide
swath of South Korean society.</LD>
<TE>   Since the verdicts, there have been dozens of mostly small
protests daily in Seoul, Pusan, Kwangju and other South Korean
cities. Students have broken into a U.S. Army base, and at least one
restaurant has barred entry to Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Even members of the conservative Grand National Party, which is
considered resolutely pro-American, have called for a public apology
from Bush for the accident and the revision of the treaty governing
U.S. forces in South Korea, one of the United States' most important
allies.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush should apologize to soothe the pain of the Korean
people and to prevent any escalation in anti-American sentiment,"
conservative presidential candidate Lee Hoi Chang told reporters
today.</TE>
<TE>   The protests have focused resentment on a Status of Forces
agreement that in some cases makes the 37,000 U.S. soldiers based
here off limits to Korean law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Punish Murderers," and "U.S. Troops Out of Korea," read the
placards carried by about 50 student activists who cut through a wire
fence Tuesday at the U.S. Army's Camp Red Cloud in Uijongbu, on the
northern outskirts of Seoul. A day earlier, members of the same
student group tossed Molotov cocktails at a U.S. military warehouse
south of Seoul, setting fire to a guard post. There were no injuries
in either incident.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the protests, security has been increased around
all U.S. facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Suffice it to say that we are taking all appropriate steps to
ensure the safety and security of both our personnel and facilities,"
Lt. Col. Steve Boylan, a U.S. Army spokesman, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The accident in which the 14-year-old girls died took place June
13 in Yangju, near the demilitarized zone that separates North and
South Korea, but received scant media coverage at the time, in part
because of the euphoria in South Korea over the World Cup soccer
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But public interest has steadily grown, reaching a fever pitch
last week after the acquittals of Sgt. Mark Walker, 36, the driver,
and Sgt. Fernando Nino, 25, who was in charge of navigating the
vehicle. Throughout Seoul, protesters are displaying graphic
photographs of the crushed bodies of the girls, Shim Mi Son and Shin
Hyo Sun.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans look down on Koreans. We are powerless. How can we
confront them?" said a teary-eyed Shim Su Bo, Mi Son's father, in an
interview taped by activists and made available on one of many
Internet sites devoted to the case.</TE>
<TE>   The furor has brought to the surface cultural and legal
differences between South Korea and the United States. U.S. officials
involved with the case say that the Koreans don't understand the U.S.
criminal justice system with its presumption of innocence, the
concept of reasonable doubt and the right to a trial by a jury of
one's peers.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official here who spoke on the condition of
anonymity complained about his frustration in trying to explain the
case to irate South Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every Korean I speak to says that the verdict should
reflect the feelings of the people. We go to great lengths to
separate feelings from the law. It is a different concept," the
official said. He also complained that many apologies had been
offered, from senior military brass to Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, who spoke to South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Sung Hong.
"In this case, the Koreans just haven't been listening," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   American embassy and military officials have begun a public
relations campaign to calm the rage. The Army today released written
statements from the GIs to express their condolences and regrets. And
at a hastily arranged news conference, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard
extended an apology on behalf of Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, the president sent me a message asking me to convey
his apologies to the families of the girls, to the government," he
said, adding that Bush asked him to express "his sadness and regret"
for the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Jang Hie, a Korean law professor who leads a committee
dedicated to revising the treaty between South Korea and the U.S.
forces, says that the American soldiers almost certainly would have
been convicted in a South Korean court.</TE>
<TE>   He accused the military prosecutors in the courts-martial of being
hesitant in presenting the charges and said because the two were
tried separately, they could deflect blame to the other.</TE>
<TE>   "For a terrible crime like this, somebody must be held
responsible," Lee said. "Korea has a continental legal system which
is somewhat different, and the Americans should respect the spirit of
our system too."</TE>
<TE>   The legacy of colonial domination by Japan and national pride have
made Koreans especially sensitive to perceived affronts to their
sovereignty. The Status of Forces agreement between the United States
and South Korea was revised in 2001 to satisfy Korean demands for
jurisdiction over cases in which U.S. soldiers were accused of
"heinous" crimes, such as murder and rape.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't apply to cases in which the alleged crimes are
committed when soldiers are on official duty -- as was the case when
the girls were crushed to death.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the anti-American sentiments stirred by the case was
evident over the weekend at the entrance to a restaurant in downtown
Seoul, which posted signs saying, "Not Welcome. The Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Other establishments near university campuses were reported to be
similarly barring Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about putting up a sign reading, 'Yankee, Go Home,' but
that seemed too harsh," said Lee Chang Yong, 41, who had put up the
"Not Welcome" sign. Lee said he appreciates the presence of U.S.
troops in defending South Korea but believes that they behave
arrogantly without respect for Korean culture.</TE>
<TE>   "There are cultural things in Korea. When your son does something
wrong, you visit the neighbor's house and apologize, even though it
might not be your fault," Lee said. "In this case, it was the same.
We expected something more than perfunctory diplomatic regrets. If
they apologized properly, it would have been more important than the
verdict."</TE>

<LD>   The contract increases funding levels at the laboratory by about
$200 million a year.</LD>
<TE>   JPL, founded by Caltech in the 1930s to perform rocket propulsion
studies for the Army, was transferred to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in 1958. The laboratory has always been operated
by Caltech.</TE>
<TE>   The only NASA facility not staffed and managed by federal
employees, JPL conducts research on the Earth, the sun, the solar
system, stars, galaxies and the formation and evolution of the
universe. JPL also manages the Mars exploration program.</TE>

<LD>Eight Hells Angels who were denied entry to the Ventura County Fair
this year because of their biker attire filed legal claims Tuesday,
accusing fair organizers of violating their civil rights.</LD>
<LD>   The bikers and their families were turned away from the event in
late July after refusing to remove black leather vests emblazoned
with their motorcycle club's trademark winged skull.</LD>
<LD>   With police standing by, a security guard at the fair told the
Hells Angels that the vests violated a new policy banning gang
attire.</LD>

<HD>Bikers File Civil Rights Claims</HD>
<DH>Hells Angels who were denied entry to the Ventura County
Fair because of their club attire say the new dress code is
discriminatory.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight Hells Angels who were denied entry to the Ventura County Fair
this year because of their biker attire filed legal claims Tuesday,
accusing fair organizers of violating their civil rights.</LD>
<LD>   The bikers and their families were turned away from the event in
late July after refusing to remove black leather vests emblazoned
with their motorcycle club's trademark winged skull.</LD>
<LD>   With police standing by, a security guard at the fair told the
Hells Angels that the vests violated a new policy banning gang
attire.</LD>
<TE>   The bikers responded Tuesday by filing claims against the state of
California, which owns the Seaside Park fairgrounds in Ventura, and
the local governing board that oversees the 12-day event.</TE>
<TE>   An identical claim was filed against the city of Ventura, whose
police officers provided security for the fair and helped draft the
new policy.</TE>
<TE>   The claims, precursors to a lawsuit, seek monetary damages for
unused fair tickets, emotional distress and violation of civil
rights.</TE>
<TE>   At his attorney's office Tuesday, George Christie Jr., president
of the Ventura Hells Angels chapter, said fair promoters falsely
labeled his motorcycle club a criminal street gang when adopting the
new dress code.</TE>
<TE>   Christie called the policy discriminatory and vowed to fight it in
court if the claims are rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "What they did was wrong and they know it," Christie said. "We're
very upset that we weren't allowed to enjoy the fair like everyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   Recent convictions stemming from a massive drug-and-racketeering
case involving Ventura Hells Angels, including Christie, prompted law
enforcement officials to deem the organization a street gang.</TE>
<TE>   Christie and lawyers representing the Hells Angels contend there
is no evidence the biker group meets the legal definition of a gang.</TE>
<TE>   "The Superior Court here has not imposed any gang terms on Hells
Angels," attorney Kay Duffy said. "Any time a Hells Angel has been
charged with a crime and sentenced, those terms have been stricken by
the court."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Christie and seven other bikers, claims have been
filed on behalf of two children and a girlfriend of a prospective
Hells Angel, who were also denied entry.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Board members were in a closed meeting late Tuesday and could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Amy Albano declined to discuss the allegations
because she is named as a defendant. But she stood by the fair policy
and described it as legally sound.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-member Fair Board this year approved a tighter policy on
gang attire in hopes of stemming violence between rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The policy specifically prohibits anyone wearing clothing, visible
tattoos or other articles bearing the name or insignia of a criminal
street gang from entering the 62-acre fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   It identifies 27 local groups as street gangs, including the Hells
Angels and rival Mongols motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The policy changes came three months after a shootout between
warring bikers left three people dead and at least 16 injured at a
Laughlin, Nev., casino where thousands had gathered for a biker
party.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, fair organizers saw a need to firm up their
protocol after a Northern California appellate court struck down as
unconstitutional a similar policy in Sonoma County.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a Hells Angels member
who was denied entry to the Sonoma County Fair and Exposition after
refusing to remove a vest emblazoned with the club name. The
appellate court found the dress code to be vague and overly broad.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in the Sonoma case, Ventura lawyers and police say their
policy is specific, and they are confident it can withstand a legal
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy contends the Ventura policy suffers from the same flaws
cited in the Sonoma case and should be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope [the policy] will be thoroughly investigated," she said.
"However, if for whatever reason the claims are denied, we will take
it to the next level."</TE>

<HD>Avila Requests Another Delay</HD>
<DH>Hearing for Samantha Runnion's accused killer is set for
Monday, but his lawyers want more time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake Elsinore man accused of kidnapping and killing 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion of Stanton is seeking to again postpone a
preliminary hearing that will determine if there is enough evidence
to bring him to trial.</LD>
<LD>   Alejandro Avila's attorneys filed a motion late Tuesday asking for
another delay of the proceeding, now scheduled for Monday, arguing
that they need more time to analyze DNA evidence that allegedly
connects their client to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P.
Briseno granted the defense its first delay, agreeing that Avila's
attorneys needed more time to comb through the 11,000-plus pages of
documents provided by prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   At that time, Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg said defense
experts would need at least until the end of the year to review the
DNA evidence. Her latest motion echoes that request.</TE>
<TE>   "Although defense counsel has diligently provided its experts with
the required data, the necessary analyses and consultations with
counsel have not been completed," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who has been fighting
delays since Avila's arrest, said Tuesday he would "vehemently oppose
this pattern of delay. I intend to invoke the people's right to a
speedy trial."</TE>
<TE>   Briseno will hear arguments from both sides before Monday's
scheduled preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 27, has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, sexually
assaulting and killing Samantha. Prosecutors have said they would
seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend at her
Stanton condominium complex. Her body was found the next day along a
mountain road between Orange County and the Riverside County
community of Lake Elsinore.</TE>

<HD>Blake Hires 2 New Attorneys</HD>
<DH>One is a former public defender, the other an
ex-prosecutor, both in Orange County. Actor is charged in wife's
slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake retained two new criminal defense attorneys with Orange
County ties Tuesday to replace Harland W. Braun, who quit the
high-profile murder case because of "a serious breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship."</LD>
<LD>   Braun, who had represented the 69-year-old actor in the courtroom
and media since Blake's wife was shot to death in May 2001, disagrees
with his former client over the actor's insistence on defending
himself in the media against the charges.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's new attorneys, former Orange County prosecutor Thomas
Arthur Mesereau Jr. and Irvine criminal defense specialist Jennifer
Lynn Keller, declined to comment after court Tuesday in Van Nuys on
whether they would allow Blake to be interviewed.</LD>
<TE>   The actor was charged in April with fatally shooting his
44-year-old wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, as she sat in his car near a
Studio City restaurant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of
murder and conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of soliciting
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Before approving the substitution of attorneys, Superior Court
Judge Lloyd M. Nash asked Blake if he were willing to spend more time
in jail before the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has said he would reconsider setting bail for Blake
after hearing the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing.
Blake has been held without bail since his April 18 arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no choice, your honor. Yes, you're right, I have been
there a long time, and I have to take responsibility for some of the
reasons," Blake said. "It's seven months later, and I'm still sitting
in a concrete box."</TE>
<TE>   Braun, who had defended Blake in the media since the night Bakley
was killed, announced his intention to quit the case last month after
he said his client had scheduled a televised jailhouse interview with
ABC News correspondent Diane Sawyer without the lawyer's knowledge.
The interview was later canceled after Sheriff Lee Baca refused to
lift a ban on cameras in county jails.</TE>
<TE>   Nash set a Dec. 6 hearing to determine how long the new attorneys
would need to prepare for the preliminary hearing, expected to be
held early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's longtime entertainment lawyer, Barry Felsen, said he
learned about Mesereau through Charles Meyer, his partner in the
Century City law firm of Goldman &amp; Kagon. At First African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, Meyer and Mesereau provide free
legal services to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   In the Blake case, Mesereau, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm
of Collins, Mesereau &amp; Reddock, teams up again with Keller, an Irvine
sole practitioner and his friend since the 1970s, when they attended
Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco together.</TE>
<TE>   Mesereau represented Mike Tyson last year in a case in which San
Bernardino prosecutors declined to file rape charges against the
boxer. The attorney also defended former Compton Councilwoman
Patricia Moore, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 33 months in federal
prison for extortion and income tax fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm's Web site says Mesereau, 52, specializes in criminal
defense and business litigation, volunteers at free legal clinics and
"works with community organizations to fight against such civil
injustices as the California three-strikes law." He also volunteers
with the American Bar Assn.'s Death Penalty Representation Project.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Blake, Keller is representing Gerald John Plesetz,
who is charged with sexually abusing a girl who allegedly gave birth
to his child almost 30 years ago, when he was pastor at St. Edward
Catholic Church in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Before launching her own practice, Keller, who is 49, was a senior
research attorney for Justice Edward Wallin of the 4th District Court
of Appeal in Santa Ana, then joined the Orange County public
defender's office.</TE>

panel awarded no financial damages.</TE>

summer.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Man Convicted of Lewd Acts With a Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jia-Rui Chong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After deliberating only three hours, a Superior Court jury Tuesday
convicted a Pasadena man of four counts of forcible lewd acts upon a
child and two counts of child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The jury found Rodney Dion Brown guilty of molesting a 6-year-old
girl in a house where they both were residing. Brown had been out on
parole for only eight weeks at the time of the incident.</LD>
<LD>   There were no other adults in the house at the time because the
girl's mother was visiting her fiance, Brown's younger brother, at
state prison in Chino.</LD>
<TE>   Brown's mother and sister, who also lived in the house, had left
to get breakfast. The girl and her young female cousin had been left
in the care of a 14-year-old male cousin, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, convicted of raping a woman in 1984, also served state
prison time for second-degree robbery. He had been returned to prison
in 2001 for eight months for a parole violation before his release
March 10.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Levitin, Brown's court-appointed attorney, said his client
was accepting of the verdict. On Thursday, Brown had stated that he
no longer wanted to attend court proceedings. "He decided the day he
left that he was going to get convicted," Levitin said.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Clarli Wilson, 73, said there was not much discussion among
jurors before arriving at the guilty verdicts. "The prosecution had
so much evidence. It was pretty damaging."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said she and other jurors were particularly touched by
testimony of the young victim, who cried in response to some
questions posed by Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Carter. When Carter
asked, "Did Rodney touch you?" the girl closed her eyes and did not
speak.</TE>
<TE>   A police officer and a nurse who spoke with the girl May 4, the
day of the incident, testified that she said it was Brown.</TE>

<LD>A rustic plot of land in Sherman Oaks said to be the place that
inspired Edgar Rice Burroughs to write "Tarzan of the Apes" was
purchased Tuesday by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</LD>
<LD>   The 1.7-acre Oak Forest Canyon Natural Area, located at the end of
Camino de la Cumbre near Beverly Glen and Valley Vista boulevards,
was bought for $300,000 from a local developer who had planned to
build homes on the parcel.</LD>
<LD>   "The local residents were against building new homes and helped
with the funding," said Dash Stolarz of the conservancy.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the funds, however, came from the voter-approved state
Proposition 12, the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air
and Coastal Protection Bond Act. "The hardest part was coming up with
the funding, but with the help of locals, we were able to get it,"
Stolarz said. "Now the land will be preserved forever."</TE>
<TE>   The property is adjacent to the 110-acre Fossil Ridge Park, one of
the most prolific paleontological sites in the Santa Monica
Mountains, conservancy officials said. The area is rich with
fossilized remains of marine animals.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs is said to have frequented the canyon, riding on
horseback and picnicking in the area, drawing his inspiration for
Tarzan.</TE>

<HD>Water Plan Left Adrift by Congress</HD>
<DH>Hopes for the CalFed program to restore the San Francisco
Bay Delta now rest with the next session, which will convene in
January.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The joint state and federal effort to restore the San Francisco Bay
Delta -- the source of water for two-thirds of California's
population -- suffered a setback last week when the 107th Congress
adjourned without authorizing the so-called CalFed program.</LD>
<LD>   The survival of the federal support of CalFed now depends on
whether legislators can convince the new Congress, which will convene
in January, that the program is the best way to avoid returning to
the fighting among water agencies that threatened the health of the
delta in previous decades.</LD>
<LD>   Federal support of the massive water system is extremely
important, many public officials say. Without the U.S. government's
planning and coordination of myriad conservation and ecological
programs, the delta's delicate ecology could fall into its previous
disrepair -- with salmon runs withering and streams dirtied.</LD>
<TE>   A failure to improve the quality of the delta could mean further
limits on the amount of water that is available for cities and farms
under such regulations as the Clean Water Act and the Endangered
Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians would be among those bearing the brunt of
the losses because roughly one-third of the region's water flows
through the delta in most years.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that for California and the West there is no
plan B or viable alternative" to fixing the delta, said Stephen Hall,
executive director of the Assn. of California Water Agencies. "We
have no choice but to convince Congress that CalFed is the path to
the solution in California and, we believe, every major stream in the
West," Hall added.</TE>
<TE>   CalFed was formed in 1995, and the program's goal was both simple
and far-reaching: Agricultural, urban and environmental interests
would put aside their many differences and fix a collapsing delta
ecosystem</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, they would find ways to restore salmon runs in the
Sacramento River and its tributaries while increasing water storage
facilities by raising dams, building reservoirs and expanding the
banking of ground water to use in dry years.</TE>
<TE>   Since its strategy was endorsed by the courts in 2000, CalFed has
received the bulk of its funding from the state. That will not change
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the water bond Proposition 50, passed by voters Nov.
5, will eventually contribute nearly $2 billion to CalFed projects.
By contrast, proposed federal funding for CalFed in 2003 was $30
million.</TE>
<TE>   But federal approval of CalFed remains crucial because federal
agencies are so deeply involved in regulating the way California's
water system is operated and only they have the authority to force
the various water agencies to work together.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Quinn, a Metropolitan Water District vice president,
doesn't believe the failure to get a CalFed bill through Congress is
a fatal blow to the program.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "Ten years ago we were in crisis. The fish
populations were crashing, we were water rationing. CalFed has
brought stability and if we let go of that policy framework, there's
no doubt in my mind we'll slip back to that kind of chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the House and Senate CalFed bills spent much of 2002
languishing in Congress for a variety of reasons, including the usual
disdain by other states for California projects and infighting among
CalFed's far-flung agencies over the project's priorities: Was it to
save fish or improve storage?</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) finally got a stripped-down
version of her bill passed the last night Congress met last week,
while Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) saw his CalFed bill in the House
become embroiled in a labor dispute unrelated to water policy. His
bill never came to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Not all environmental groups believe the Bush administration did
enough to push CalFed in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, the reason that CalFed exists is because the
bay-delta was a collapsing ecosystem," said Gary Bobker, the Bay
Institute's program director. "But we clearly don't have a climate
back in Washington that is ... going to defer to home-grown
compromises over California water."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said it supports CalFed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to making CalFed work for the long term, because
I believe we must work many decades into the future when water issues
are involved," Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton said in a speech
last week to the Assn. of California Water Agencies in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what the CalFed program has done, and it's a grand
vision," Norton added.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Wright, CalFed's director, said he believes his agency
ultimately will get approval from Congress for one reason: It's
working.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said one of the brightest examples of CalFed's work is a
$12-million effort to work with farm interests to restore salmon runs
in the Butte Creek watershed, northeast of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, five dams have been removed, four more
have been retrofitted with fish passages, and habitat along the creek
has been restored.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, spring-run chinook salmon returns have averaged 7,650
in the last five years. In the previous decade, they averaged 364.</TE>

<HD>A Heads-Up Approach to Teaching Spanish</HD>
<DH>At Whittier College, a professor brings some razzle-dazzle
to the emerging 'heritage language' philosophy of learning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that professor Rafael Chabran's Spanish class is a language
course is something like saying Tolstoy's "War and Peace" is about
Russia.</LD>
<LD>   The main purpose of the class at Whittier College is to help
students who grew up speaking Spanish at home to perfect their
conversational and writing skills. The course is part of the budding
"heritage language" movement in American education designed largely
for the sons and daughters of immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   But Chabran also uses "Spanish for Bilingual Students" to provide
counseling and support to students who often are the first in their
families to attend college.</LD>
<TE>   He juggles those objectives with an unusual style: The twice
weekly sessions sometimes resemble a gym class. Chabran, 56, a
5-foot-4 1/2-inch bundle of kinetic energy, is a proponent of the
total physical response method of language instruction. It's based on
the idea that language learning is enhanced when it is tied to
movement and activities.</TE>
<TE>   Chabran likes to create that action by tossing around a soccer
ball. Just as keeping your eye on the ball is good advice on the
baseball diamond or golf course, it's absolutamente essential in
Chabran's class. If he tosses you the ball, it's your turn to answer
a question or make a comment.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the fast-paced class -- which is taught immersion-style,
entirely in Spanish -- often begins with Chabran barking, "Dame la
pelota!" (Give me the ball!) When it's time for one of the 12
students to give a classmate a turn to talk, Chabran often commands,
"Pasala!" ("Pass it!")</TE>
<TE>   The ball is passed around frequently, keeping the class moving --
and engaged. "A soccer ball is part of the culture," he explained.
Soccer "is one of the things that ties all Spanish-speaking countries
together."</TE>
<TE>   For students who tend to get drowsy during afternoon classes,
Chabran's 80-minute sessions, which begin at 1:30, are a welcome
antidote. "This technique keeps us going. He's constantly moving,"
said Luciano Cota, a freshman in the class. "He's just everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent class session, the students quizzed Chabran about
his background, then paired off to drill one another on the names of
articles of clothing and parts of the body. Throughout the class,
Chabran avoided what he calls "teacher talk" -- lengthy lectures --
and instead found ways to make the students chat with him or one
another.</TE>
<TE>   When it's his turn to talk, Chabran tries to inspire the students
by telling his own life story. The son of a Puerto Rican father and
Mexican immigrant mother, he earned a doctorate in Spanish literature
at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Learning about his background "really helps me, because I can
relate to him in many ways. We're both Latino, and we struggle the
same way. He shares the struggle he faced while he was in college,
and a lot of that I'm going through now," said sophomore Thelma
Camarena.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Chabran corrects the fluid but error-plagued
Spanish of his students. False cognates -- words that are spelled
similarly in English and Spanish, but have different meanings -- are
a particular problem. During class, he reminded a student who
referred to a mailed letter by saying "letra," that the proper word
is "carta."</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing a Latino student's Spanish, "especially when your
instructor is not from that background, it's really hard," Chabran
said. "That's why I'm teaching this class."</TE>
<TE>   The sensitivity to that issue has paid off for freshman Krystal
Diaz. "In this class I feel totally comfortable in asking him
something if I don't know it. I talk Spanish really funny, and he
doesn't laugh at me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chabran's work extends beyond his own classroom. He is associate
dean for academic advisement and director of a federally financed
project on campus to help students stay in college until they earn
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Language classes like Chabran's are part of the "heritage
language" movement, directed at improving the skills of immigrants
and others who grew up somewhat familiar with a foreign tongue but
who want to advance their skills.</TE>
<TE>   The movement stems from the recognition that standard foreign
language instruction isn't the best way to improve the skills of
people already comfortable with speaking a second tongue. They
typically need help with advanced grammar, sophisticated vocabulary
and writing skills, but they don't need instruction in, say,
greetings or other simple conversation.</TE>
<TE>   To improve such heritage language instruction, a University of
California group on Friday adopted curriculum guidelines for heritage
language classes for all of the system's campuses. At UCLA, which is
emerging as a leader in the field, separate classes already are
available for heritage speakers of Chinese, Korean, Russian and
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the national push is economic. Policymakers have
found that heritage speakers can be brought to levels of high fluency
much more quickly than learners starting in a new language from
scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, there is this recognition that this country
has a huge natural resource in the competence these kids have [in
foreign languages] when they come to our schools," said Russell N.
Campbell, an emeritus professor of applied linguistics at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said heritage language instruction also can improve the
quality of family life in immigrant communities. "We talk about
generation gap in our Anglo population, where we share a language.
Imagine having parents and grandparents not being able to communicate
with their kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Chabran's class, however, a major motivation seems to be
cultural pride. Cota, a native of Arizona, said that when he came to
Los Angeles to attend Whittier it struck him how many American-born
Latinos spoke Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "That motivated me to take a Spanish class to get on the same
track they are," he said.</TE>

<HD>Law Offering Drug Treatment Is Called a Qualified Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A law intended to divert nonviolent drug offenders into treatment
programs instead of prison is reaching fewer people overall and more
hard-core substance abusers than intended, according to a report
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Enacted in July 2001, Proposition 36 requires that people
convicted of possession, use or transportation of drugs for personal
use be offered drug treatment rather than jail. It does not apply to
those convicted of drug sales or to anyone with a prior violent
felony conviction. The measure was intended to save taxpayer money.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Tuesday by the county found that 8,329 people
were sentenced to treatment under Proposition 36 in the first 12
months since its enactment, nearly 7,000 fewer than projected. Of
those, nearly 20% failed to report for treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the report called the measure a success. It is "working
really well" in terms of diverting thousands of people from prison
and into treatment, said Patrick L. Ogawa, director of the county's
Alcohol and Drug Program Administration, which compiled the report.</TE>
<TE>   From July 2001 through June 2002, the report tracked defendants
sentenced under Proposition 36 at several stages, beginning with
their sentencing. The next monitored stage was assessment, in which
the severity of a defendant's addiction was determined, followed by
placement with a treatment center.</TE>
<TE>   The report indicated a substantial drop in participation at each
stage. The result was an overall decline of nearly 50% from the
number of those sentenced to the number of those in treatment as of
June 30, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Michael A. Tynan, a judge who supervises all county drug court
programs, said the law needs to be modified to ensure that defendants
complete treatment programs or face incarceration. Currently, the
defendants are given several chances to complete the program before
they face jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposition 36 was sold to voters as a way to keep true first and
second offenders out of prison," Tynan said. "I think we're wasting
an awful lot of money on people who can't benefit from such a
lightweight program."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 70% of the defendants in treatment were convicted of felony
crimes, mostly felony drug possession. According to the report, "the
level of addiction [in Los Angeles County] has been more serious than
initially anticipated," meaning that although fewer people than
expected are sent to treatment, they tend to require more services
than casual drug users.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a hard-core population overall," said Ana
Maria Luna, a judge who heads a county task force on implementing
Proposition 36. "People that are coming into the system have a higher
level of acuity in terms of their substance abuse problems."</TE>
<TE>   Luna said Proposition 36 has been successful "in terms of moving
large numbers of people into treatment ... given the large geographic
area that L.A. County serves."</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 people have completed drug treatment programs and had
their cases dismissed by a court. But Luna said that, since the
program was designed to last 18 months, the fact that 60 people have
finished early is a good sign.</TE>

<HD>Fair Board Gives Green Light to Ventura Track</HD>
<DH>County panel extends raceway's contract for one year
despite objections to the noise. Fate of fairgrounds director,
however, remains in doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the cheers of racing fans, the Ventura County Fair Board voted
unanimously Tuesday to let the Ventura Raceway operate for at least
another year, despite complaints over noise from downtown residents
and business owners.</LD>
<LD>   The future of the fair's executive director, however, was less
clear. After a two-hour, closed session, the board disclosed that it
would not immediately terminate Roger Gibbs, who was suspended
without public explanation Nov. 12. He will remain on paid leave
until a final decision is made at the board's meeting Dec. 17.</LD>
<LD>   Played out before a passionate crowd of about 50 raceway
supporters and fair volunteers, the issues are among the hottest in
recent memory to beset the fair board, ordinarily a tranquil
political backwater that governs use of the county fairgrounds at
Seaside Park.</LD>
<TE>   Former Ventura Mayor Greg Carson, the board's president, has been
reluctant to support the raceway's contract renewal, saying better
uses could be found for the property.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, downtown resident Rick Lyons invited raceway
supporters to his hillside condominium so they could hear the noise
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't use the balcony," he said. "If I have a dinner party, I
have to keep the windows shut. It's the type of noise that's out
there; it's not music -- it's not anything but annoying."</TE>
<TE>   But Lyons said he was pleased by raceway director Jim Naylor's
promise to curb the commotion further in the next year with high-tech
mufflers, a 10 p.m. curfew and other measures.</TE>
<TE>   Three people spoke against the raceway. Others lauded it as a
living piece of Ventura history and said a group called Save Ventura
Raceway had gathered 15,000 signatures in its defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto racing is as much a part of Southern California as surfing
and skateboarding," said former Ventura Mayor Jack Tingstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the raceway will face similar difficulties when the
contract comes up for renewal again next year may hinge on whether it
is included in a master plan to guide future uses of Seaside Park.
Dozens of racing fans stuck around with fair volunteers to put in a
good word for Gibbs, who has been Seaside Park's director for three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Although fair board members have been silent on Gibbs' suspension,
several said they were upset that other board members had not
consulted them before suspending him.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Gibbs offered a brief statement, saying he had come to
Ventura to "live a dream" and had planned to keep the job for about
five years before retiring. He said he had enjoyed a good rapport
with various boards and wanted a chance to reach an understanding
with board members.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been able to do this for 32 years," he said, "and I should
be able to do it for a few more."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' attorney, Jonathan Light, faulted the board for allegedly
failing to give his client proper notice of his suspension. He said
board members have refused to outline their reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Board members have not publicly discussed Gibbs, calling his
suspension a personnel matter.</TE>

<HD>High Court Lets Stand Rejection of Lawyers' Smog Fees</HD>
<DH>The ruling means claims of $88.5 million will be slashed to
about $24 million. The lawyers successfully challenged a fee for
out-of-state cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a victory for the Davis administration, the state Supreme Court on
Tuesday let stand an appellate court ruling that struck down $88.5
million in attorney fees for lawyers who successfully attacked an
unconstitutional smog "impact" fee on out-of-state vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The award, which amounted to more than $8,000 a hour, was set by a
private arbitration panel on orders of Gov. Gray Davis. It was the
biggest of its kind in California history.</LD>
<LD>   But the size of the fees touched off angry protests from public
officials and citizens alike. They complained that the sum, which
would be paid from public funds, was astronomically too high.</LD>
<TE>   Plaintiff lawyers in the case said Tuesday the issue will go to a
new arbitration panel, which will determine the appropriate level of
compensation for the attorneys, including members of the San Diego
law firm of Milberg Weiss Berhad Hynes and Lerach, which led the
assault.</TE>
<TE>   Under the district court's ruling, said attorney Bill Dato of
Milberg Weiss, maximum compensation for the lawyers will be $18.1
million, plus accumulated interest from July 1998, which would bring
the total to about $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to move forward from here. The court of appeal has
set forth the ground rules and we will proceed on that basis," Dato
said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor said officials were pleased at the
refusal of the high court to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that the final level of compensation for the
attorneys still may be an unresolved issue.</TE>
<TE>   The smog fee law, adopted in 1991 by Gov. Pete Wilson and the
Legislature, imposed a $300 impact fee on out-of-state cars
registered in California. Although advanced as a fee to fight smog,
virtually none of it went for anti-smog programs. Instead, it was
spent to help balance the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   But four motorists who moved to California and paid the fee sued.
In 1999, Superior Court Judge Joe S. Gray of Sacramento ruled the fee
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The judge awarded $321 million in refunds to those motorists who
had shelled out the fee during the previous three years.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys, led by Milberg Weiss, appealed. They argued that
the fees should be refunded to all motorists, going back to 1992, a
contention supported by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis successfully sponsored legislation that
earmarked about $650 million in refunds and interest to motorists hit
by the illegal smog fee.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the legislation was a requirement that lawyers be paid
an unspecified but "appropriate" amount for their work. The issue
then was turned over to the arbitration panel, which devised the
$88.5-million award.</TE>
<TE>   But controversy erupted when the panel, meeting in secret, set the
amount. Davis asked the group to reconsider. It refused and Davis
sued.</TE>
<TE>   One justice of the 3rd District Court of Appeal, Richard M. Sims
III, blistered the award as "completely in outer space [and] totally
over the top."</TE>
<TE>   He said the fact that lawyers had even sought fees of that "absurd
magnitude from the taxpayers is a testament to the unreal world of
greed in which some attorneys practice law in this day and age."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Latinos' Political Feud Marks Generational Divide</HD>
<DH>Rancorous tactics in council race underscore faction's
bitter sense of being shut out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt and Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco wears his resentment like a
badge.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old Eastside councilman often laments the
unwillingness of County Supervisor Gloria Molina and other political
elders in the Latino community to support his first run for council
in 1999, even after he set a course that he believed would please
them.</LD>
<LD>   He marched against the construction of a prison on the Eastside in
the 1980s. He worked in Molina's field office. He went to college,
then law school, then returned home to Boyle Heights to tackle
community problems.</LD>
<TE>   Still, when Pacheco ran for City Council, almost every Latino
leader backed his opponent. "All of them worked against me," he said
in a recent interview. "They should have been mentoring me."</TE>
<TE>   Now, armed with a deeply nurtured sense of personal betrayal,
Pacheco is determined to prove -- as he did four years ago -- that he
can beat the establishment. In this case, his challenger in the 14th
Council District is former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who
is seeking Pacheco's seat after losing the mayor's race last year.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive and personal attacks made by a Pacheco ally in
recent weeks to push Villaraigosa out of the race underscore the
personal intensity of Eastside politics and the bitterness fueling a
new set of ambitious leaders from that area.</TE>
<TE>   Like angry sons, Pacheco and several friends have been bucking the
pillars of the Latino political community for years, using techniques
their critics say are intended to undermine, embarrass or defeat
political heavyweights such as Molina, former city Councilman Richard
Alatorre and ex-state Sen. Richard Polanco.</TE>
<TE>   In their quest for power, Pacheco and his allies have
simultaneously driven a wedge through Latino politics in Los Angeles
and united some old foes in opposition to their brand of rancorous
campaigning. Molina and Rep. Xavier Becerra -- whose relationship had
been frosty since the 2001 Los Angeles mayoral campaign -- held a
joint news conference Monday to denounce negative campaign ads
recently used against Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 6, the day Villaraigosa declared his candidacy for
Pacheco's seat, newly registered voters on the Eastside received an
anonymous flier that accused the former legislator of turning his
back on Latinos at the urging of "white advisors" and "gringos." A
second mailer delivered two days later called Villaraigosa a
"womanizer" and questioned the character of his father and one of his
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   While Pacheco disavowed the mailers, attorney Ricardo Torres, who
went to UC Berkeley and Loyola Law School with Pacheco, said he was
responsible for sending the ads.</TE>
<TE>   Torres said he thinks it's time for politicians like Villaraigosa
to give new Latino leaders a chance to prove themselves. In making
that point, he sounded the messages of generational politics and
resentment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been concerned about Antonio's conscious decision to
wipe out a young generation of elected officials who are now in power
to advance his political career," Torres said. "Antonio feels he
needs to take Nick out because he needs a platform for mayor? He
should work on bringing together the Latino community before he
focuses on destroying young electeds."</TE>
<TE>   But some veteran politicians and strategists say Pacheco has made
it difficult for some prominent Latinos to embrace him.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying hard to get their way and if they don't, they go
bananas," said David Ayon, a political analyst at Loyola Marymount
University. "They make these threats in a theatrical way. The problem
is, they are starting to believe their own propaganda, which is
filled with venom and poison. They have come to hate people like
Antonio and it drives them crazy that they haven't been able to knock
them off."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco, the son of Mexican immigrants, was raised in Boyle
Heights. Although they had few resources, Pacheco's parents pushed
their five children to get a good education. After college, Pacheco
moved back to Los Angeles and got involved in politics. He later
graduated from law school and went to work as a deputy district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   One of his original political role models also has a reputation
for going against the establishment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Molina had put together an impressive resume by working
for various state and federal political causes. She went to
then-Assemblyman Alatorre, a powerful local political figure, and
asked for his endorsement in her campaign for an open Assembly seat.</TE>
<TE>   Alatorre informed the 34-year-old that he had to meet with "the
guys" first, Molina later said in an interview. Later he told her
that it wasn't her turn, and picked his own candidate: Richard
Polanco.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing not to be intimidated, Molina ran anyway. She won the seat,
and she made it clear that she would not forget the people who had
stood in her way. "How many times do you let them sock you in the
face?" she asked during an interview nine years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Molina -- who represents East Los Angeles on the
County Board of Supervisors -- has become an influential political
figure in Los Angeles, one whose endorsement is sought and whose
temper is feared.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said he met Molina during the 1980s while he was on a
break from college. Word had gotten out in his neighborhood that the
state planned to build a prison in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of Molina, then an assemblywoman, Juana Gutierrez
helped organize the community to fight the prison. Gutierrez was the
mother of one of Pacheco's best friends, Martin GutieRuiz.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to the prison evolved into a seven-year battle, as
Gutierrez and her neighbors joined with members of a local church and
community members in protest marches and trips to Sacramento to lobby
against the project. GutieRuiz and Pacheco -- both in their early 20s
-- participated in the protests. Gov. Pete Wilson eventually killed
the proposal in 1992, after negotiations with then-Assemblyman
Becerra, among others.</TE>
<TE>   After the prison fight, Pacheco and GutieRuiz went to work helping
Becerra and Molina further their political careers. Eventually, they
decided to launch their own attempts at public office.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Pacheco helped GutieRuiz in an unsuccessful
challenge to Alatorre, by then a Los Angeles city councilman
representing the 14th District, which includes Boyle Heights and
parts of Eagle Rock and Mount Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Pacheco and Torres ran for different seats on the city's
Charter Reform Commission. Torres lost, but Pacheco prevailed, giving
him a chance to form an alliance with then-Mayor Richard Riordan, who
pushed for charter reform to make government more efficient and to
create a more powerful mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   After another failed run for public office, Torres took on
Alatorre in court. In 1998, he represented Henry Lozano, a longtime
Eastside political strategist, in a custody battle with Alatorre for
Lozano's daughter. Alatorre and his wife had raised the girl, their
niece, since shortly after her mother's death. Lozano charged that
they were unfit caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ultimately ruled in favor of the Alatorres, but not before
Torres had forced the councilman to admit on the stand that he was a
recovering cocaine addict -- a revelation that contributed to the
retirement of the veteran Eastside pol.</TE>
<TE>   About that time, Pacheco was finishing up on the Charter
Commission and set his sights on the seat Alatorre was vacating.</TE>
<TE>   But after working for many Eastside leaders, Pacheco found himself
with only a handful of prominent supporters: Becerra, Riordan and
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Becerra said that Pacheco was surprised that his efforts on behalf
of such politicians as Molina had not been rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that really frustrated Nick," the congressman said. "You
work hard for people, you hear people saying, 'Yeah, we're going to
be with you,' and then they're not."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Molina said the supervisor, close to both
candidates, had been torn about whom to support in the race. She
eventually backed Victor Griego because of his experience and her
dissatisfaction with some decisions Pacheco had made on the elected
city Charter Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hard decision for her," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Pacheco won by fewer than 500 votes. He recalled
telling friends, "There is a God."</TE>
<TE>   Once elected, the new councilman set out to establish his own
political power base to counter the forces he saw arrayed against
him. He created a nonprofit called CAL Inc. to raise money to train
and support new political leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Pacheco went up against Polanco, who had overcome his
early defeat by Molina to become a powerful figure in state and local
politics. He backed council aide Ed Reyes in the campaign against
Polanco for the 1st Council District seat.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous mailer was sent out to voters in the district
accusing Polanco of plotting to use the new Belmont High School site
for a prison.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Polanco abandoned his campaign after someone
circulated a birth certificate showing that, unknown to his wife and
family, the legislator had fathered a child out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco, who also has a daughter born out of wedlock, denied
involvement in those smears, but acknowledged that he had traveled to
Sacramento to try to galvanize opposition to Polanco in an effort to
bolster Reyes' campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With Reyes headed to victory, Pacheco teamed up again with
GutieRuiz to become strong supporters of Becerra's mayoral campaign.
They soon became embroiled in an anonymous phone campaign that
attacked Villaraigosa, who was also running for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the district attorney's office determined that
Becerra's campaign manager had engineered the attack call, in which a
woman impersonating Molina said that Villaraigosa was soft on
criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco's CAL Inc. owned the phone bank that was used to make the
phone calls, and GutieRuiz's political organization, La Colectiva,
was named as the source of the calls. Torres served as La Colectiva's
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Becerra denied any knowledge of the calls.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Pacheco closed down CAL Inc. and sold the phone bank,
amid allegations that he had pressured city lobbyists into giving to
the organization. In an interview at the time, Pacheco expressed fear
that Molina would organize against him. He believed then -- and still
does -- that she was a committed foe.</TE>
<TE>   Molina said she does not know why Pacheco harbors such anger that
she did not endorse him.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that we have not had any kind of working
relationship for the last six years," she said, adding, "I don't
think I owe anything to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Those close to Molina call the situation a "one-way feud" and say
the supervisor tried to mend fences with Pacheco after he won. She
has been surprised and hurt by the extent of his anger toward her,
and especially the role of his staff in an attack phone call that
mimicked her, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether Pacheco's anger will push him to
success, or undermine his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Molina was still debating whom she was going to endorse in the
14th District race, if anyone, when Torres sent out the mailers
slamming Villaraigosa. That persuaded her to back the former Assembly
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   And Sheriff Lee Baca, who persuaded Torres to halt his attack
campaign, has pulled his endorsement of the city councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Political strategist Ayon said he fears that the negative hits
will ultimately undermine Latino politics in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't realize they are doing greater damage here," Ayon
said. "Either way, this tactic will forever define them."</TE>

<HD>Ocean Search for Two Fishermen Called Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Tuesday suspended the search for two sport fishermen
whose boat was found abandoned off Huntington Beach two days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   There was no sign of foul play in the disappearances of Hyong Kum
Kim, 46, of Burbank and Dae Kyu Kim, 35, of Los Angeles, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   A 25-hour, 1,400-square-mile search coordinated by the Coast Guard
failed to find any trace of the men after lifeguards found their
22-foot boat Sunday afternoon outside the surf line at Bolsa Chica
State Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Lifeguards found a wallet and the keys to the boat, which started
up without problems. The seas at the time were calm, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had caught a couple of small fish," said Joseph Milligan, a
Bolsa Chica lifeguard supervisor. "The key was in the ignition, and
we found two cell phones aboard."</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes before the boat was found empty, the men had used
a cellular telephone to call their families, reporting that they were
fishing and were having a good time, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer
Louis Hebert said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said that Hyong Kim, the boat's owner, "was a novice
fisherman who could swim a little," Orange County Harbor Patrol Sgt.
Ron Peoples said. "His friend couldn't swim at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Pure speculation could be that one of them fell over trying to
get bait from the bait bucket tied to the side of the boat, in the
water. The other jumped in to save the first and had trouble
himself," Peoples said. "But we don't know."</TE>

<HD>Geothermal Plant Near Tribal Site Approved</HD>
<DH>Reversal of Clinton-era agreement angers Native Americans
who call the California lake sacred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration gave Calpine Corp. permission Tuesday to
develop a 48-megawatt geothermal power plant beside Medicine Lake in
California's volcanic far north, reversing a 2000 decision that
blocked the project and angering Native Americans who consider the
area sacred.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest
Service said the San Jose-based energy firm now can drill geothermal
wells on a 15-acre site known as Telephone Flat, about a mile from
the lake's edge.</LD>
<LD>   Bush administration officials stressed the project's potential
role in inching the U.S. closer to energy independence. Rebecca W.
Watson, assistant Interior secretary, said geothermal development in
the Medicine Lake Highlands would "help the nation take steps toward
increasing domestic energy supplies, particularly from renewable
sources."</LD>
<TE>   The project involves taking naturally heated water from deep
underground, using it to generate power, then pumping the water back
into the ground to be reheated and reused.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the decision to approve the project, the government
will require some changes which officials said would reduce the
intrusion on Native American sites. One would require that a power
line from the plant be moved several miles to skirt the Medicine Lake
Area Traditional Cultural Places District and the Mt. Hoffman
roadless area.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, spokesmen for local Native American tribes and
environmentalists said federal officials were selling out to big
energy. The project, they said, would produce a meager amount of
electricity while wounding a rugged landscape of conifers and
sparkling hills of obsidian 30 miles east of Mt. Shasta.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Johnson, a member of the Pit River Tribe and executive
director of the California Council of Tribal Governments, said he was
disappointed that tribal concerns were brushed aside. But he was
hardly surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been doing that all along through history," said Johnson,
73. "This whole system is corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Calpine is already drilling exploratory wells on a geothermal site
several miles north of Medicine Lake. But foes had hoped geothermal
development was permanently blocked at Telephone Flat, which is even
closer to the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Robertson, a Calpine spokesman, said test wells started over
the summer produced "promising results." The firm plans further
exploration to determine whether underground pockets of water beneath
the area are hot enough to fuel a $120-million power plant.</TE>
<TE>   If so, it could trigger extensive geothermal development in the
area. Calpine owns 43 federal leases covering 47,800 acres in the
Medicine Lake Highlands.</TE>
<TE>   Native Americans say they worry that the drilling will drain
spiritual energy from a land they've used for hundreds of generations
as a sacred healing place. Many elderly tribal leaders say native
people who dunk themselves in the lake have witnessed miraculous
recoveries from serious illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The government reversal "flies in the face of all efforts to
protect sacred sites over the years," said Gene Preston, Pit River
Tribe chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Berditschevsky, the tribe's environmental coordinator,
said the project wouldn't even help California meet its renewable
energy obligations. Calpine has already sold any electricity from the
site to the Bonneville Power Administration, which does not serve
California.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of lakefront vacation homes likewise expressed dismay and
vowed to sue. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) also weighed in against
the project. "If the project were to proceed," Boxer wrote Bush
regulators, "the unique and sacred character of the Medicine Lake
Caldera will forever be lost."</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes two years after Clinton administration
regulators declared that no geothermal development would be allowed
at Telephone Flat. They said a power plant close to the lake could
trample tribes' cultural values and harm the scenic charm for
recreational visitors.</TE>
<TE>   To settle a $100-million lawsuit by Calpine, Bush administration
officials agreed in April to reconsider the project. Even then,
Calpine retained the right to pursue its lawsuit if federal officials
balked again. Dale Bosworth, U.S. Forest Service chief, said the
decision Tuesday "fulfills the government's 20-year obligation to the
leaseholder."</TE>
<TE>   Geothermal leases in the Medicine Lake Highlands were first sold
in 1982, and renewed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Sivas, director of Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic
at Stanford, who is representing the tribes, said those actions took
place without sufficient environmental review and consultation with
Indians. Tuesday's decision, she said, only makes matters worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has changed since this decision was made a couple years
ago," said Sivas.</TE>

<HD>LAX Victim's Family Dealt 2nd Blow</HD>
<DH>A brother of ticket agent killed in July 4 shootings at
airport dies after an auto accident in Chatsworth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in five months, tragedy has struck the Chatsworth
couple who lost a daughter in the July 4 shooting spree at Los
Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Nimrod Hen, the 18-year-old brother of slain ticket agent Victoria
Hen, died Tuesday of injuries suffered in a Nov. 16 car accident that
is still under investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The teenager's parents, Avi and Rachel Hen, "are in deep sorrow"
after losing two of their three children and do not wish to discuss
the devastating loss they feel, said family attorney Steve Solomon.
"It's just a horrible thing for them." The family has one other
child, a son, Udi, who is in his early 20s.</LD>
<TE>   Victoria Hen, 25, was one of two people slain by Hesham Mohamed
Hadayet, 41, an Egyptian immigrant, in a shooting rampage at the
ticket counter of El Al Israel Airlines in the summer. U.S.
authorities theorized it was an irrational act of anger, while
Israeli officials have labeled it a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Hen, who lived at home with her parents, was the eldest
child. She had worked with El Al for almost two months when she was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, police and the family are appealing for help in determining
the circumstances of the crash that killed one of her brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just inconceivable that you could lose both a son and a
daughter to separate tragedies," said Los Angeles Police Department
Capt. Greg Meyer. "We are united in our commitment to resolve this
case."</TE>
<TE>   Officer Toni Wolfe, who is in charge of the investigation, said
detectives want to talk to the driver who allegedly pulled out of the
driveway of a shopping complex on Mason Avenue near Devonshire Street
in Chatsworth and caused Hen to lose control of his vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point we're not even considering pressing charges," Wolfe
said. "Basically all we want this person to do is come in so we can
interview him or her."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not determined how fast Hen or the other car
was traveling at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit is 35.</TE>
<TE>   Hen was driving a Ford Mustang north on Mason about 4:30 p.m. when
a sedan, described as a silver or gold Buick or Toyota, turned onto
the street from a shopping center parking lot, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Hen missed the car but swerved across oncoming lanes and crashed
into two parked vehicles and a fire hydrant. The driver of the sedan
did not return to the scene, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   The motorist may not have known that a crash occurred, Wolfe said.
California law requires any driver whose actions result in an
accident to stop, exchange information and render aid.</TE>
<TE>   If investigators determine that the motorist saw the crash and
then left the scene, he or she could be charged with felony
manslaughter, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Hen suffered severe injuries, including crushed legs, but was
alert and talking to family members immediately after the crash,
officials said. He was taken to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in
Woodland Hills, but his condition quickly deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, he was declared brain dead, said Linda Quon, a
spokeswoman for the hospital. His death may have been caused by a fat
emboli, a condition similar to a blood clot that sometimes occurs
with serious injuries, officials said. An autopsy is underway to
determine the cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   His passenger, Rashid Rashid, 18, of Chatsworth was recovering at
home from cuts and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   The Hens emigrated from Israel in 1990 and settled in the San
Fernando Valley. Avi Hen built up a small, family-run automotive
parts supply business in the Canoga Park area. Nimrod Hen lived with
his parents and graduated in June from Chatsworth High School, where
he was a popular student who assisted in the dean's office.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very friendly, very outgoing, very well-liked by all his
peers," said a school secretary. "He knew everyone in the offices
here. As soon as he walked in, he would light up and say, 'Hey, how
you doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the family has nothing to say," family spokesman Joseph
Knoller said by telephone from their Chatsworth home. "What can I
tell you except that it's a terrible tragedy?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

contributed to this report.</TE>

Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, is dedicated to providing a safe,
entertaining after-school environment for youngsters from the
surrounding neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to people such as Lantz, the facility also tries to build
understanding between the Police Department and the children, many of
whom come from low-income minority families.</TE>
<TE>   "I love these kids," said Lantz, who usually shows up for work in
her neatly pressed dark blue uniform, complete with badge and
holstered pistol.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids were fearful when they first saw me in
uniform," she said. "Then they started asking questions, and the more
we talked, the more they saw that I'm a regular person."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ashnault, who oversees the centers in 15 of the Police
Department's 18 divisions, said the Devonshire operation is about 13
years old.</TE>
<TE>   Division commanders have freed officers such as Lantz to run the
facilities full time.</TE>
<TE>   The Devonshire center, which depends on outside contributions for
its annual budget of about $165,000, is equipped with arcade games, a
pool table, table games, puzzles and a large assortment of books and
magazines.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen computers are used for games and even an occasional
homework assignment. The center has a band and a drill team that
march in local parades.</TE>
<TE>   Diego Barrios, 18, said he first stopped by about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I peeked through the window, and I saw all the games," he said.
"That looked pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Barrios said he walked in and signed up, and he's been coming back
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing about this place is the police officers," he said.
"They taught me to do the right thing, and that's made a big
difference in my life. If I have kids of my own some day, they'll
come here. I love this place."</TE>
<TE>   Through the end of the year, The Times is highlighting
organizations that have benefited from its annual holiday
fund-raising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's appeal helped 56 charities in Southern California.</TE>

<LD>After Daniel Fox's car accident, when doctors told his mother that
his chances were not good, Toni Fox vowed to bring her child home to
Arcadia no matter what.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night, seven months after a head-on collision in
upstate New York nearly killed him, Daniel, 19, walked through his
front door. His weeping mother was at his side. And so were more than
150 friends, neighbors and even strangers who have kept an electronic
vigil for more than seven months praying for the teenager's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   An hour before he arrived from the airport, they already had lined
the street, holding candles. As the black limousine, rented by
friends, rounded the corner, the Arcadia High School Pep Band -- for
which Daniel had played French horn -- struck up "Jungle Boogie."</LD>
<TE>   People hugged and burst into tears, and Daniel, tottering slightly
on legs that are not yet completely healed, climbed out and blinked
at the crowd, a slow, disbelieving grin spreading.</TE>
<TE>   "Get the boy a French horn!" shouted his uncle, Tod Ruhstaller.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't break him," said his aunt, Sandy Ruhstaller.</TE>
<TE>   On May 3, Fox, a former star member of the Arcadia High School
band, was driving along a dark road near Bard College, where he was a
freshman, when his car crashed head-on into another vehicle, nearly
killing him. The people in the other car survived.</TE>
<TE>   After emergency surgery, he remained in intensive care for more
than three months. He underwent brain surgery and heart surgery,
followed by months of physical therapy. More than 2,500 miles away,
neighbor Mary Ann Luan set up a Web site devoted to his recovery.
Many in town say it brought a little magic.</TE>
<TE>   Part journal of Daniel's recovery, part prayer network, and part
bulletin board for the families and children who knew him while he
was growing up, the site has pulled the community together.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last six months, it has received more than 70,000 hits
and more than 2,000 entries from friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   People who didn't know Daniel began signing the guest book.
Donations for his medical bills, which are approaching $2 million,
poured in. As his return date approached, friends cooked dozens of
meals so the family could relax with Daniel over the next few weeks
instead of cooking.</TE>
<TE>   A network evolved. It included former teachers, such as Kate
Martin, who wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Hi Daniel. Love and thoughts of strength and courage come from
your 'old' kindergarten teacher. You're on my prayer list and that's
powerful!!!"</TE>
<TE>   One day, Luan, whose daughter Mindy was one of Daniel's best
friends, got a call from representative of Arcadia's Chinese
community.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't know Daniel, Luan said, but they had heard about him,
and they wanted to donate plane tickets so his family could fly
across country and visit him.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, Daniel said he had only one more plan for the
evening: He wanted to go to In-N-Out Burger. As for the future, he's
hoping to take a class at Pasadena City College in the spring, and to
get back to Bard as soon as he is able.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see my friends here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the first dark months after her son's accident, Tori Fox
watched as he showed off his scars from heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I would come home with him one way or another," she said.
"He's amazing."</TE>

<HD>Judge Upholds Officer's Indictment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rejecting defense claims that prosecutors withheld crucial evidence
from the grand jury, a judge Tuesday refused to dismiss an indictment
against an Inglewood police officer charged in connection with the
alleged beating of a youth during a videotaped arrest in July.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer for Officer Bijan Darvish, who has been charged with
filing a false police report about how his partner, former Officer
Jeremy J. Morse, allegedly manhandled the teenager, has said the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office failed to tell the grand
jury that Darvish's statement was "literally true."</LD>
<LD>   The defense attorney, Mark Fredrick, argued that if prosecutors
had provided that information and other evidence, the grand jury may
not have indicted Darvish.</LD>
<TE>   Judge William Hollingsworth said he will let the jury decide
whether Darvish was telling the truth, and rejected Fredrick's motion
to dismiss the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish, 25, and Morse, 24, were indicted in August. Morse is
accused of assault under color of law, and was recently fired after
the police chief reviewed the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Videotapes, one recorded by surveillance cameras at a gas station
where the incident occurred and another by an amateur cameraman
nearby, showed police struggling with 16-year-old Donovan Jackson
before handcuffing him.</TE>
<TE>   After Jackson was cuffed, Morse is seen lifting him by the back of
the collar and his beltline, carrying him over to a squad car,
slamming him down on the trunk and then hitting him in the jaw.</TE>
<TE>   Morse has said that Jackson grabbed his testicles and that he had
to hit him to make him let go. Morse's lawyers also have argued that
the officer had to lift Jackson up and place the youth on the car
because Jackson had continued resisting arrest by going limp.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish is accused of lying in a police report about the incident
when he wrote that, after Jackson was handcuffed, "we then assisted
Jackson to his feet and had him stand facing the police vehicle."
Fredrick argued that the videotape does not dispute that statement.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman sharply disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   He said the tape showed Morse slamming Jackson against the car,
not having "him stand facing" it. He said Jackson was bent over
across the trunk -- not standing up -- and Darvish had his arm across
the teenager's back, pinning him against the car. The prosecutor said
Darvish "created that statement out of whole cloth to cover up" for
his partner.</TE>
<TE>   Huntsman also rejected Fredrick's argument that the indictment
should be thrown out because he failed to provide the grand jury with
Darvish's explanation for not reporting that Morse had slammed
Jackson on the squad car.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish has said that he did not see it happen, that he heard a
thud, but was looking in another direction.</TE>
<TE>   Fredrick said prosecutors were well aware that Darvish provided
that explanation to Inglewood Police Department internal affairs
investigators, because they had a transcript of the officer's
tape-recorded interview. Huntsman said a jury will never believe that
Darvish failed to see Morse's treatment of Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said he did not know about Darvish's explanation to
internal affairs investigators during the administrative interview.</TE>
<TE>   Hollingsworth also reviewed the gas station surveillance tapes
before rejecting Fredrick's claim that the district attorney's office
erred in not showing them to the grand jury. Those tapes show police
officers struggling with Jackson and then handcuffing him.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors only provided the grand jury with the tape recorded by
an amateur cameraman showing what happened to Jackson after he was
handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Hollingsworth will continue hearing defense motions on Dec. 20. At
that time, lawyers for Morse are expected to argue that the
indictment against him should be dismissed because prosecutors failed
to present two use-of-force trainers who have said Morse did not use
excessive force against Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   One of those trainers is an investigator for the district
attorney's office who once was a use-of-force instructor for the
Inglewood Police Department.</TE>

<LD>Choked with more than 530,000 vehicle trips a day, the junction of
the Ventura and San Diego freeways in the San Fernando Valley is the
second-busiest interchange in the state and the seventh in the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   But nerve-racked motorists who use the interchange may be about to
get some relief.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss asked his
colleagues to throw their support behind a $40-million freeway
improvement project -- which would include permanently closing the
Ventura Boulevard onramp -- to help ease congestion.</LD>
<TE>   "Right behind me is a twisted interchange ... which had to have
been designed by someone with a twisted mind," Weiss said at a
morning news conference atop a Sherman Oaks parking garage with a
panoramic view of snarled freeway traffic below.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said his proposal would ensure that the city "green-lights
everything that can be humanly done ... to fix this interchange once
and for all." If approved by the council, work on the project could
begin in spring 2004.</TE>
<TE>   For years, motorists who use the Ventura Boulevard onramp to
access the northbound 405 Freeway have had to cut across streams of
cars merging onto connecting ramps to the 101 Freeway. The new
project would end the colliding flow of traffic by replacing the
Ventura Boulevard onramp with one that would funnel cars under the
101-bound traffic.</TE>
<TE>   During construction, work crews also would close two other nearby
freeway on- and offramps at Sepulveda Boulevard for nine months,
Caltrans officials said. Such ramp closures require city approval.</TE>
<TE>   State and city transportation officials have already pledged to
work together to help expedite construction. If all goes as planned,
the project could be completed by summer 2006, said Raja Mitwasi,
Caltrans' deputy district director.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans also has agreed to assist in widening Sepulveda
Boulevard, which would help save Los Angeles $300,000 on an estimated
$800,000 project, said James Okazaki, assistant general manager for
the city's Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing us a favor, and we're doing them a favor," Okazaki
said. "The lesson learned is everyone benefits if we cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   In a similar spirit, leaders of Valley homeowner and business
groups -- some of whom have vehemently opposed other transportation
projects -- turned out Tuesday to show support for the interchange
project.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Betz, treasurer of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said
it's about time something was done about the congested Ventura
Boulevard onramp, where motorists in merging lanes frequently cut
each other off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible situation," Betz said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the ramp closures and ongoing construction are expected to
temporarily create more traffic snarls on city streets, Betz and
others said they believe the project will ultimately reduce
congestion and increase safety for drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Caltrans is in the middle of two other projects at or
near the interchange.</TE>
<TE>   A $10-million project is underway to widen the northbound 405
connector to the eastbound 101. The improved connector, which will be
able to carry twice as many cars, will be completed in spring 2004,
according to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans work crews also are building an auxiliary lane on the
northbound 405 between Mulholland Drive and Greenleaf Street to make
it easier for drivers to merge onto and off the freeway. The agency
expects to finish the $11-million project next summer.</TE>

that Valley commuters have in trying to get from the Valley to the
L.A. Basin," said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), who secured
federal funding in 1998 to study the crossing and propose solutions.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Seeks New Limit on Housing</HD>
<DH>With the city nearing build-out, planners back a 50%
reduction -- to 250 -- in the number of residential units that are
allowed each year.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks, one of the first local cities to set annual limits on
housing construction, wants to cut its 500-unit maximum in half as
the city approaches build-out.</LD>
<LD>   With a landmark city ordinance that regulates the pace of
residential construction expiring Dec. 31, the Planning Commission
voted Monday to extend the measure through 2007 -- and to cut the
city's yearly allotment to 250 dwellings.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very good idea to have something in place to control
growth," said outgoing Chairwoman Claudia Bill-de la Pena, whose
recent election win means she can vote on the issue again Dec. 17
when it comes before the City Council.</LD>
<TE>   The Planning Commission's only real debate before its unanimous
vote was just how far the city should go to slow growth.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Randy Hoffman suggested dropping the annual limit to
100 dwellings, but he was cautioned by a city attorney who said such
a low number would be hard to defend legally and might invite a
lawsuit from developers.</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena, who also favored lower limits, proposed a
compromise: Extend the ordinance for five years, rather than the
proposed 10, to ensure the city carefully monitors the pace of
development to determine whether affordable housing goals are being
met.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Gillette said the council is committed to
slowing the pace of residential construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The lower numbers seem to create a greater comfort level with the
community," said Gillette, adding that he would support a lower limit
if it could be justified. "Establishing unrealistic figures that are
only bait for litigation serves no worthwhile purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Fulton, a Ventura-based planning expert, said Thousand Oaks
is a well-planned affluent suburb that will not be able to limit its
population growth forever.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just trying to stall the inevitable as long as
possible," he said. "I don't blame them, it makes political sense.
... Once you hit build-out, you have to face some very tough
questions about how you accommodate additional growth."</TE>
<TE>   Under state-imposed rules, cities are required to accommodate
certain levels of population growth and include affordable units
among new dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks, a city of 121,000 residents, is now at about 94% of
anticipated build-out. City officials expect about 3,000 more
dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   Of that additional 3,000, about half already have been approved,
so extending the ordinance only affects about 1,500 units, or six
years' worth of allotments.</TE>
<TE>   John C. Prescott, planning division manager, said the remaining
units would be built on about 150 acres. For perspective, the city's
planning area -- including unincorporated county neighborhoods such
as Lynn Ranch and Casa Conejo -- contains 38,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   When initially approved by voters in 1980, Measure A sought to
rein in the city's feverish construction. Thousand Oaks was the
state's fasting-growing suburb of its size in the 1970s, with about
1,500 homes built each year.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A slowed construction and forced developers to compete for
a limited number of housing allotments, a total ratcheted down to 500
per year by 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The law succeeded in limiting the speed of growth and in
heightening competition between builders. That prompted developers to
offer land for open space, parks, schools, bike and equestrian trails
or add units for low- and very-low-income buyers and renters.</TE>
<TE>   Despite today's red-hot housing market, the number of allotments
issued has fallen in recent years. After 468 allotments were granted
in 1998, the city approved 262 during the next two years; 346 last
year, mostly as part of a land-swap deal to acquire 191 acres of
permanent open space; and 37 to date this year.</TE>
<TE>   Prescott's staff members project that the demand will most likely
dip to an average of 100 annually over the next decade. For 2003,
just three housing projects, with a total of 61 units, are expected
to be eligible to apply for allotments, according to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Andy Fox suggested in July that the annual housing
allotment be halved from 500.</TE>
<TE>   But outgoing Mayor Ed Masry said this week that adjusting housing
limits "is just a placebo" that misses the bigger issue -- too much
development being permitted over the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest future threat, he said, comes from about 8 million
square feet of commercial and retail space the city's General Plan
anticipates eventually will be built beyond today's total.</TE>

<LD>If you pushed a pin into a map for every recent shooting in the
killing fields, L. Tolliver's barbershop on Florence Avenue near
Western would be surrounded. So naturally, the crime wave in South
Los Angeles has been all the buzz.</LD>
<LD>   A customer named Bill Layne said he has ordered his 12-year-old
son to stay indoors after dark, and everyone in the shop identified
with his fear.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie Ford, who is the eldest of the barbers at 80 and is fond of
quoting Scripture, doesn't leave the shop at night without his
.38-caliber snub-nose revolver. Lawrence Tolliver, the owner, keeps a
Beretta "very close to me."</LD>
<TE>   "I got mine in the glove box," said Tony Wafford.</TE>
<TE>   It's a short walk from the barbershop to the corner of 83rd and
Western, where a 17-year-old boy was shot dead two weeks ago for no
apparent reason. I went to have a look at the neighborhood, and was
struck as always by the juxtaposition of an ugly crime against a
backdrop of well-kept houses of sun-washed Spanish stucco.</TE>
<TE>   The regulars at Tolliver's live in houses like these, and they,
too, wonder what's wrong with the picture. I've known them for a year
and a half, and I've never seen them so subdued, and talking about
their neighborhood with more fear than pride. The civil rights
movement wasn't fought for them to live like this, carrying guns to
protect them, not from Jim Crow, but from their own wayward children.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver, a generous man with an abiding love for his
community, expressed his anger and frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic that you've got to worry so much about your kids,
because wild animals are out there, ready to prey on anything," said
Tolliver, the father of three, including a son who had a gangbanger's
bullet whiz past his head a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a staunch, staunch supporter of Bernie Parks," Tolliver
added, referring to the black Los Angeles police chief who was
replaced by Bill Bratton, a white man. "But I would join hands and
walk down the street with the new chief in a minute if he could stop
the killing in my community."</TE>
<TE>   One of the best features of the free-for-alls at Tolliver's is
that everyone slides into the fray from a slightly different angle.
This time was no different.</TE>
<TE>   Wafford, an AIDS prevention specialist, was more inclined to point
to the endless rhythms of racial and economic isolation that
contribute to black-on-black crime. The blue-collar factory jobs
along the Alameda Corridor are gone, he noted, and families have
disintegrated in their wake.</TE>
<TE>   A gang offers "love, security and money" to kids who don't find it
anywhere else, Wafford added, and pulling yourself up by the
bootstraps isn't easy "when you ain't got no shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver said he was sympathetic to all of that, but insisted
something at the foundation of modern society is broken in the black
community and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "The rap records make it out like that's the thing to do. Let me
get my gun and go shoot this and shoot that," Tolliver said. "The
horrible part is that we as black folks let them play that garbage in
our community.</TE>
<TE>   "I go up by the junior high to get my food, and I'm so embarrassed
to hear the young girls call each other bitch this and whore that. I
told one of them, 'You think your mother would like to hear you say
that about yourselves?' They need someone to correct them, but you
can't if they're listening to it every day. How do we let that go?"</TE>
<TE>   Allen Humphries, a retired sheriff's sergeant, had an answer.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you have to do is take responsibility, and the
parents are responsible," Humphries said. "These are someone's
children and they're out there running around doing this. If you have
two idiots at home, and you send him to a school where you've got 35
more idiots in the classroom, the teacher's not a teacher, he's a
survivor.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop blaming the schools, saying it's the teachers' fault. It's
the parents' fault. The bottom line is, we stopped giving children
limits, and children don't just need limits, they expect them."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Ford liked what he was hearing, but said it didn't go far
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Spare the rod, spoil the child," he said, eyes ablaze with
passion.</TE>
<TE>   If only it were that simple.</TE>
<TE>   I heard quite a bit of talk of the so-called good old days, when
neighbors looked out for one another and children respected adults.
Guns and drugs have been devastating forces, Mr. Tolliver said,
tearing at the fabric.</TE>
<TE>   True enough. But part of what's at play here is the same
generational disconnect that crosses all boundaries of race and
income. The barbershop guys are at a loss to understand the
generation that followed them, and the Malcolm X banner
notwithstanding, I felt a bit like I was on the set of a conservative
talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "In this African American community, if you really talk to people
on the issues, you'll find that it's just as conservative on law and
order as any group you can name," Mr. Tolliver said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever is happening right now is what we have to deal with,"
Humphries added. "We can't go back to the '50s. We have to deal with
what is, and what never changes is a parent's responsibility to a
child. You have a responsibility to a child, whether you have a job
or not."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Tolliver gave him an amen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sympathetic to those who don't have two parents, don't have
money, but there are kids in the same predicament who don't go the
wrong way," Tolliver said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to have bars on my house. I refuse to have bars on
my house."</TE>
<TE>   We all walked out on Florence together. Wafford showed me the gun
in his glove box, and as I asked what exactly it was, two police cars
approached from the east and barreled past us in a black-and-white
blur, destination unknown.</TE>

<HD>5 More Killings Add to City Toll</HD>
<DH>The homicides continue a recent spate of murders. Two
occurred in Hollywood, two in South L.A. and one on the Eastside.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A double homicide in a Hollywood parking lot late Monday night brings
to five the number of killings in Los Angeles since Sunday as the
recent murder streak continued, police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Antonio Arana Guirrie, 38, of Huntington Park was shot in a lot at
Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue about 11:25 p.m., the Los Angeles
County coroner's office said. The second victim was 49. His name was
not released because his family had not been notified.</LD>
<LD>   A friend, who was not injured, drove Guirrie to his home in South
Los Angeles and then he was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew
Medical Center, where he died, LAPD spokesman Jack Richter said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they had no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Three other killings have been reported in Los Angeles in recent
days, all occurring late Sunday afternoon or evening and none with
any identified suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Manuel Edgardo Palacios, 41, was hit by a stray bullet
as he and his wife returned from a shopping trip Sunday afternoon to
their home in the 1200 block of South Dacotah Street on the Eastside.
He died soon afterward. Police spokeswoman Renee Montoya said the
shots apparently came from a nearby recreation center and that the
crime was gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, 19-year-old Martin Hernandez of South Gate
was fatally shot in the 1200 block of 108th Street in South Los
Angeles, Montoya said, when two men about his age drove by and fired
at him several times.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who was hit in the head, chest and left leg, was taken
to the King/Drew Medical Center, where he died.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the killer and victim in that case may have
been acquaintances and that the shooting was preceded by a dispute.
This killing was not believed to be gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Police in the 77th Street Division, meanwhile, said they
discovered the body of a man identified Tuesday by the coroner's
office as Derek Rene Akins, 34, of North Hollywood. Akins may have
used a wheelchair found near his body late Sunday in an alley in the
1800 block of West Vernon Avenue near Western in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He had been shot twice in the head execution-style, said a police
spokesman, Sgt. Bill Driver.</TE>
<TE>   He said investigators didn't have a motive or suspects in the
case.</TE>

<HD>Firm Under Fire Over Wildflowers</HD>
<DH>Newhall Land destroyed swaths of endangered spineflowers at
a development site. The company says it did nothing wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset and Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newhall Land and Farming quietly destroyed large numbers of
endangered wildflowers that could have complicated its efforts to
construct Los Angeles County's largest residential housing
development, according to court records and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office said prosecutors are continuing to investigate the case,
although they recently said that they were unable to charge anyone
with illegally destroying the flowers because the statute of
limitations had lapsed. She would not elaborate on what other issues
remain under review by prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   A draft analysis of the issues involving the San Fernando Valley
spineflower was given to county planners this month and obtained by
The Times. In it, Newhall officials acknowledged that more than six
acres of spineflowers remain on its property, mostly on land slated
for development. That marks a departure from two years ago, when
Newhall reported finding a single stand of flowers on a 50- to
75-foot stretch of dirt road.</LD>
<TE>   In May, prosecutors and state inspectors served a search warrant
on Newhall's property and found the remains of spineflowers that they
concluded had been killed the previous fall when Newhall graded and
terraced mesas, according to an investigative report filed in
Superior Court in Santa Clarita. Investigators also said in the
report that they suspected that Newhall had spread alfalfa through
areas in which spineflowers were growing, enticing cattle to graze on
the plants.</TE>
<TE>   In its environmental assessment of the spineflower, the Santa
Clarita-based company has said that even if its actions did destroy
flowers, the actions would be legal. Because it is still farming the
land, Newhall argues it has the legal right to destroy the plants in
the course of agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   The company also argues that the law allows it to move ahead with
construction if it maintains a preserve for some flowers.
Representatives of the firm said Newhall has properly notified
officials about the presence of the endangered plant.</TE>
<TE>   "When we announced [the finding of spineflowers] we said we'd be
doing additional surveys in the future to find out whether other
spineflowers might occur," said Marlee Lauffer, a Newhall
spokeswoman. "It's no surprise to anyone that there are a couple of
additional locations."</TE>
<TE>   22,000 Homes</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that the way Newhall has handled the
plants shows that it cannot be trusted. They say that Newhall
officials were aware that the flowers were widely spread on the
company's land two years ago, when they destroyed many during the
grading project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of like they're thumbing their nose at everything,"
said Lynne Plambeck, president of the Santa Clarita Organization for
Planning the Environment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors approved the Newhall Ranch
development in early 1999, clearing the way for construction of
22,000 homes at the edge of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents challenged the project's environmental documents in
court, and a judge ordered the company to revise some findings.
Newhall is expected to release its revised environmental report next
week, and supervisors are scheduled to consider it Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   The spineflower issue is crucial to the company's new
environmental analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Long thought extinct, the spineflower, which can grow to 1 foot
tall, with dime-size blooms, was found on the Ahmanson Ranch
development near Calabasas in 1999. Its discovery intensified
environmental opposition that has since caused numerous delays for
the Ahmanson Ranch project.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the May 2000 discovery of the plant on the 12,000
acres of Santa Clarita Valley land owned by Newhall started a
yearlong game of cat-and-mouse between the developer and state
regulators, complete with secret aerial surveillance and the search
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   That sparring also is detailed in court records involving the
Newhall firm and state and local regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Newhall officials insisted that the plants posed no
obstacle to development on most of the property, saying the stand of
spineflowers along a roadbed was fenced off and protected. They added
that it was possible there were more flowers elsewhere but said they
would only search for them later, when closer to development.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, court records indicate that Newhall notified the
environmental consultants who had discovered the flower -- URS,
Greiner, Woodward &amp; Clyde -- that they had signed a confidentiality
agreement, limiting what those consultants could say about the land
to anyone outside the Newhall company.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the firm, John Gray, later told state
investigators that it was the first time in his career that he had
been directed to obey a confidentiality agreement, according to an
investigative report signed by state Fish and Game Lt. Penelope
Liotta.</TE>
<TE>   Gray did not return calls for comment. Lauffer, Newhall's
spokeswoman, said it is standard procedure for the company to require
consultants to sign confidentiality clauses.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, the state Fish and Game Commission approved the
listing of spineflowers as an endangered plant in California. That
month, Newhall began grading a mesa on its property. Fish and Game
officials came to Newhall on an unrelated visit and spotted the
grading in an area that they believed had a "very high probability"
of being spineflower habitat, according to the investigative report.</TE>
<TE>   Later that fall, Fish and Game investigators flew over the
property, taking photographs to chart the damage on the suspected
spineflower habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall said it was simply terracing the hillsides to start an
agave farm. Fish and Game inspectors noted in court papers that the
agaves would not mature until after development began, and labeled
the farming explanation a ruse Newhall spokeswoman Lauffer called
that suspicion ridiculous</TE>
<TE>   After it was ordered to stop grading, Newhall told Fish and Game
inspectors that they were no longer welcome on the property because
their last visit had resulted in a county citation, according to
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   3-Day Search</TE>
<TE>   In late May, Fish and Game officials returned with a search
warrant and county prosecutors. During their three-day search,
investigators found numerous remains of dead spineflowers on the
graded mesas. The plants apparently had been crushed under tires, the
investigators wrote. They also found that alfalfa had been spread
around areas with spineflowers.</TE>
<TE>   The large number of dead flowers led botanists for Fish and Game
to question how Newhall's environmental consultants could have
discovered only the single stand they reported finding along the road
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   State teams "quickly found numerous other areas within 50 feet or
less from the roadbed area ... and more or less continuous bands of
occupied habitat for hundreds to thousands of feet north and south,"
said the state's investigative report.</TE>
<TE>   In the draft papers given to county planners this month, Newhall
now says that it had indications of more spineflowers than it
initially disclosed. Its consultants, the firm wrote in its new
filing, had also discovered "unconfirmed spineflower locations" in
May 2000. Newhall also acknowledged another previously undisclosed
finding of spineflowers in 2001 by a separate team of environmental
consultants.</TE>
<TE>   In its draft papers filed with the county, Newhall argues that
unless the land is developed, all spineflowers legally could be
destroyed by existing farming.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the specific plan in place... ," Newhall writes, "the
occupied spineflower habitat could be lawfully damaged or destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Though authorities spent more than a year investigating the
destruction of the plants, there has been little legal fallout.
Prosecutors this summer charged the Newhall company with one
misdemeanor count of illegally diverting a streambed in the course of
its grading, a crime to which the company has pleaded not guilty. The
investigative report was filed in connection with that case. But
prosecutors did not file charges for destroying the spineflower, also
a misdemeanor under state law.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said that Fish and Game officials only presented them with the case
on Aug. 30 -- after the one-year statute of limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Fish and Game said his agency's lawyers knew that
the statute had expired in August but that prosecutors had assured
them that they did not see that as an obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   The expiration of the time limit "hadn't been identified as a
problem," spokesman Steve Martarano said.</TE>

<HD>Fierce Winds Topple 40-Foot Tree, Power Lines in Santa Ana</HD>
<DH>Gusts cut power to 1,500 in one part of town and stir fears
of out-of-control brush fire in Coto de Caza. But blaze is put out
fast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strong Santa Ana winds hammered Southern California again Tuesday,
fanning brush fires, felling trees, downing power lines, tipping over
trucks and stirring up a host of miseries for allergy sufferers.</LD>
<LD>   The fires were brought under control, the damage from fallen trees
and tree limbs was generally light, and power was restored in most
areas by nightfall, but residents still faced a massive cleanup, and
thousands of Southlanders were plagued by itchy eyes, sneezes and
sniffles.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, the winds knocked over a 40-foot tree and four
power poles in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   They also ignited fears that a small brush fire near Coto de Caza
would spread out of control, worries that proved to be unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of resources on it due to the wind conditions," said
Capt. Steven Miller, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire
Authority. "It had great potential, but we were able to get ahead of
it and get it under control pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The fire -- which 75 firefighters were able to contain in less
than an hour -- burned only three acres in Riley Wilderness Park,
although at one point it came within 20 yards of a house in Coto de
Caza.</TE>
<TE>   Its cause is under investigation, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, meanwhile, a 40-foot pine tree and several electric
poles went down at 20th and Bush streets. Because of the 9:30 a.m.
mishap, half the units in an apartment building had to be evacuated
while crews from Southern California Edison worked to restore power
to about 1,500 customers, a Santa Ana Fire Department spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to take the people out because the wires were down," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries or damage to the building were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Southern California, clouds of dust and other
particulate matter drifted across the Los Angeles Basin and out to
sea, coating homes and cars with grime and contributing to a
spectacular red sunset.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said the winds, which gusted to more
than 60 mph Monday and Tuesday, should ease a little today and on
Thanksgiving. There is a chance of a few light showers Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's largest fire blackened about 10 acres and damaged a home
in Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   A blaze of unknown origin in the dry Santa Ana River bed near
Norco damaged two homes and scorched more than five acres of brush
and grass, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 big-rig trucks were blown over early Tuesday, at
least a dozen of them on the heavily traveled Interstate 15 in the
Cajon Pass north of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of trees, tree limbs, palm fronds and small signs also
fell during the night, littering streets and yards as well as
knocking down power lines and causing widespread outages.</TE>
<TE>   John Quigley, the 42-year-old Pacific Palisades resident who has
been roosting in a 400-year-old Santa Clarita Valley oak to protest a
developer's plans to remove the tree, had a rough ride but weathered
it.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley lashed himself to a branch to keep from being launched
into the night, and although the limb swayed several feet, he held
fast.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get much sleep, though.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of times that I said some prayers," he said
by cell phone Tuesday afternoon. "It was pretty intense up there."</TE>
<TE>   Advisories warning of unhealthy levels of fine particles in the
air were issued Tuesday for the San Fernando, San Gabriel,
Pomona/Walnut and Santa Clarita valleys and parts of San Bernardino
and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   Similar advisories are expected today and Thursday.</TE>

<KH>Steve Harvey ONLY IN L.A.</KH>
<HD>A Brief in Favor of Virtually Anything That Will Keep
Lawyers Off the Streets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the years, L.A. has been credited (if that's the right word)
with originating innumerable concepts: piped-in coffin music, the
drive-in church, the nude blood drive and the bra museum, to name a
few. Now you can chalk up another: the first entirely virtual law
school.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Daily Journal reports that students at the Concord Law
School read and study traditional hardcover lawbooks but watch
lectures on streaming video over the Internet, attend class in a chat
room setting and take tests online. (Concord is not accredited by the
California Bar.)</LD>
<LD>   So infectious is the online spirit that only eight of the 10
students in the first class attended graduation ceremonies in person
the other day.</LD>
<TE>   And, please, no jokes about lawyers chasing ambulances from the
comfort of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   A surprise in the refrigerator? Charlotte Nolte of Van Nuys shared
an ad for an apartment that was furnished with an unusual item (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: Lambert Moonen of Hawthorne passed along a
shot of a fast-food place that appeared to have a special for infants
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Let's not go postal yet: I'm not sure what to think about this
headlined scientific discovery, but Tom Murray of San Luis Obispo
wonders if it means postal rates will be going up (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Memorable marquee matchups: Joan Kahaleuahi wrote that Santa
Monica High's championship football team had its first playoff game
last year on the day after a holiday (see photo). Was the marquee
writer implying that Santa Monica was playing some turkeys? Well, the
home team did win.</TE>
<TE>   Touting California's attractions: I saw this JetBlue ad for an
L.A.-to-Oakland flight: "From smog to fog."</TE>
<TE>   The accused probably laughed even harder afterward: The police log
in the Canyon Life newspaper in Rancho Santa Margarita said "a Ladera
Ranch resident signed a complaint against a neighbor for talking and
laughing too loudly at an apartment."</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment of another sort: In Santa Monica, writer David Allen
spotted a panhandler sitting near some street performers with a sign
that proclaimed, "No Talent."</TE>
<TE>   Another nonmusical street person held a sign that said: "Will Work
for Marijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Me of little faith ... : My lament about the Lakers' apparent fall
after their three-peat (three straight titles) brought this note from
"Sister Mary": "My response to you is: Four-Peat sake! Why are you
giving up so soon?!"</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: I think I'm ready for the Thanksgiving holiday. The
other night, I had a dream in which I was using an Internet search
engine. I think you'd agree that anyone who starts dreaming about
Google needs a rest. Unless, perhaps, it's a virtual law school
student.</TE>

<HD>Parker Center's Future at Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police commissioners and City Council members clashed
Tuesday over the fate of the Police Department's deteriorating
headquarters, with council members deeming unlikely the commission's
push to relocate Parker Center's 1,200 employees within 90 days.</LD>
<LD>   "We do have the authority to vacate the building. We could order
this building empty," said Police Commission President Rick Caruso
after listening to rental alternatives for police headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   But council members -- who have the power to negotiate leases for
city offices -- said they would not be rushed.</LD>
<TE>   The council voted 12 to 1 Tuesday to instruct the city's Municipal
Facilities Committee to report back in 60 days with a plan for the
near-term relocation of Parker Center employees and for possibly
replacing the 47-year-old building.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden stood opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "With crime being what it is ... and the need for more police
officers, I for one will not put a building in front of the need to
provide additional police officers," he said. Parker Center,
yellow-tagged after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, fails to meet
earthquake safety requirements.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's Police Commission meeting, two consultants laid out
an evaluation of alternatives for the city, saying that renting space
in the soft downtown real estate market would cost little more than
staying in a building most agree would cost too much to renovate.</TE>
<TE>   Whitley Collins of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services
company, said there would be a nominal cost to the city if it
proceeded with abandoning Parker Center and rebuilding on the same
land at a later date. Collins, whose firm worked pro bono on the
issue, said the LAPD occupies about 471,000 square feet of office
space at Parker Center and in other short-term rentals at an annual
cost of about $7.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   He told commissioners his firm's research indicated that the city
could rent less space, used more efficiently in a "B, B-plus or A
building downtown" for close to the same amount. Collins said he also
thought that with the promise of a secure long-term tenant and a
probable seven-year minimum lease with an early out clause, several
real estate agents would be willing to cut the city a check for the
estimated $15 million it would cost to move facilities and configure
new office space.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Kosmont, a consultant who first prepared a report in 1996
detailing the problems facing the boxy Parker Center, called the
building "unfixable."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom LaBonge won council approval to expand the study to
look at moving some police functions into City Hall East, across the
street from Parker Center.</TE>

<LD>Oh, to be young, hip and working at Broadcom. That could have been
the company motto.</LD>
<LD>   If there was a corporate symbol for how Orange County
entrepreneurs saw themselves in the late 1990s, it was the complex of
white buildings on Alton Parkway in Irvine. Yes, there were others
like them -- companies with names that to nontechies sounded like
secret government projects -- but Broadcom was among the most darling
of the darlings.</LD>
<LD>   The buzz had been building for a year when the company, founded in
1991, went public in the spring of 1998. To put it mildly, the stock
offering was a smashing success.</LD>
<TE>   Originally projected to sell at $12 a share, the stock was priced
at $24 on opening day and was selling at twice that by the final
bell. Six months later, the stock had gone up 300%.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom was hot -- and so, by extension, were the fertile
stretches of Orange County turf that sprouted high-tech companies. In
November 1998, The Times quoted a UCLA professor as saying the county
was nothing less than a dynamo.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else said that everything needed to be a player in the
world of 21st century technology was here in Orange County. Unnamed
experts predicted that payrolls in the county would increase by about
142,000 jobs to 1.4 million by 2003, double the projected national
growth rate.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Broadcom announced it was firing 500 employees --
about 16% of its work force -- in a concession to slumping sales.
Stock that sold for around $180 a share at the end of 1998 now sells
for $20. The company signal was but the latest from the high-tech
world that things ain't what they used to be.</TE>
<TE>   So much for Orange County, huh? Surely, the flagging tech industry
would drag the county down with it. Goodbye to all those rosy
predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Surprise. The county is doing fine, thank you, according to Esmael
Adibi, director of an economic research center at Chapman University
in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Adibi jokes that he wasn't one of the "experts" quoted in 1998. "I
was optimistic in '98 about the prospects of technology for the
county, but I wouldn't have been as optimistic as some people were at
the time."</TE>
<TE>   But in the next breath he starts going over figures hot off the
press, and guess what? By the end of this year, the total payroll in
the county should reach 1.42 million, he says, right on the nose of
the '98 forecast.</TE>
<TE>   The falloff in the tech industry (7,000 jobs in Orange County) has
been more than offset by increases in the service sector. But even
that connects to the high-tech industry.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the hectic days of high-tech boom produced spurts in the
manufacturing sector. Once those new products were established, jobs
to design the content and do the hands-on work show up in the service
sector.</TE>
<TE>   Adibi has more numbers, but the point he left me with is that
Broadcom is but the latest poster child from a century of
innovations.</TE>
<TE>   His lesson is not to get too giddy about the Broadcoms of the
world or to let them define us.</TE>
<TE>   He is, however, bullish on Orange County's future -- and throws in
a couple of thoughts for free about the country:</TE>
<TE>   Another Broadcom, most likely in high tech or biotechnology, will
come along and knock our socks off again.</TE>
<TE>   And that euphoria will, at some inevitable but unknown point, be
followed by a sobering up.</TE>
<TE>   Any parting words for our dearly, departed poster child?</TE>
<TE>   No sympathy needed, Adibi says.</TE>
<TE>   "Even Broadcom is not dead," he says. "They're going to come
back."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Seeks Deeper Probes of 3 Shootings</HD>
<DH>The officer-involved incidents, two in the LAPD's Rampart
Division, were called unjustified by corrupt ex-cop Rafael Perez.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton said Tuesday that police
officials are conducting enhanced investigations into three
officer-involved shootings that corrupt ex-Officer Rafael Perez said
were unjustified and covered up.</LD>
<LD>   "We are looking for additional information in all three cases,"
Bratton said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are basically starting from scratch in all three cases," added
Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell.</LD>
<TE>   McDonnell, promoted by Bratton to be the Los Angeles Police
Department's second in command, said he was not in a position to know
why a more extensive inquiry into the shootings had not been done.
Perez made his accusations about the shootings during 1999
debriefings on corruption in the LAPD's Rampart Division.</TE>
<TE>   Confirmation that the cases remain open came the day after Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley announced that he would not pursue 82
Rampart-related investigations because of a lack of credible
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the shootings that LAPD detectives are reinvestigating took
place in the Rampart Division in 1995 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In the first case, Perez said, officers concocted a tale to cover
up a shooting by a scared rookie who shot an unarmed man in the
stomach. Perez, who was not at the scene, said fellow officers later
told him that the young officer, startled when the suspect emerged
from a bedroom, reacted by shooting him.</TE>
<TE>   The officers then helped Officer Daniel Widman come up with a
story that would make the shooting seem more palatable, Perez said.
That story, according to Perez, was that the suspect was holding a
hand mirror at his waistband when he emerged from the bedroom and
that Widman's flashlight beam bounced off the mirror and back into
Widman's face at the same time the bedroom door flew open and made a
loud noise. Because of the loud boom and flash of light, Widman
concluded that he had been shot, so he returned fire, according to
the officers' account.</TE>
<TE>   The city later paid $425,000 to settle a civil lawsuit filed by
the shooting victim. Widman remains on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The second shooting took place early Jan. 1, 1996, when members of
the Rampart CRASH unit allegedly came under fire from New Year's Eve
revelers who had been firing weapons into the air.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official police version of events, the suspects
opened fire on Officers Daniel Lujan, John Collard and Brian Hewitt.
The officers returned fire in self-defense, striking two of the
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who was present immediately after the shooting, said the
officers had actually observed the men firing into the air from a
balcony. He said the officers waited for a break in the shooting and
then opened fire on the suspects without warning.</TE>
<TE>   During the initial investigation into the incident, investigators
were unable to find any evidence that the suspects -- a 51-year-old
man and his two sons, none of whom had criminal records -- had fired
any shots in the officers' direction. Collard and Hewitt have since
been fired for unrelated misconduct. Lujan remains on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a top department official who has since retired,
Assistant Chief David Gascon, told The Times that he was not
satisfied with police inquiries into those two cases as well as a
third case involving an accidental shooting in the 77th Division.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what shooting Bratton was referring to as the third
case that needed to be reinvestigated -- the 77th Division shooting
Gascon had discussed or a 1998 shooting in the Rampart Division.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the district attorney's office said this week that
they are awaiting a referral from the LAPD on the 1998 shooting. In
that case, a man allegedly pointed an unloaded shotgun at Officer
Ruben Palomares and his partner, Officer Frank Galindo in the
basement of an apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Carlos Vertiz, was fatally wounded by the officers.
Perez told investigators that it was widely rumored that Vertiz was
unarmed and that the shotgun had been planted to cover up the
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He said the two officers implied as much to him over beers.
Investigators began to take the case more seriously after Palomares
was arrested while trying to buy 10 kilos of cocaine from an
undercover DEA agent in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Palomares is no longer with the department. Galindo remains on the
job. Bratton said he expects to have reports on the cases within 60
to 90 days.</TE>

<LD>Investigators from the state Division of Occupational Safety and
Health are looking into the death of a man who apparently fell into a
huge vat of sand at a cinderblock manufacturing company in Orange,
police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Ramirez, 37, died Monday after being buried under about 45
feet of the material at Angelus Block Co. in the 1700 block of North
Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   "From what I understand, there's a walkway around the vat that
wouldn't expose you to falling in, and then there's a beam across the
top," said Lt. John Whiteley of the Orange Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   "The only way you could end up in the vat is to circumvent the
beam."</TE>
<TE>   A woman answering the telephone at the company's Sun Valley
headquarters declined to comment or give her name.</TE>
<TE>   Cal/OSHA officials could not be reached for comment, but the
agency routinely investigates workplace accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "He just sank right down," Whiteley said of Ramirez's death.</TE>

<HD>Man Admits Role in Telemarketing Scam</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach man pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal charges
stemming from an Orange County-based telemarketing scam that
authorities say defrauded 12,000 people nationwide out of nearly $4.4
million.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Eugene Carr, 35, is the eighth person to be convicted in
the boiler room operation, which lured victims through newspaper
classified ads offering a toll-free number and the promise of a
lucrative career processing medical bills from home.</LD>
<LD>   For $400, the company -- known variously as Data Medical Capital,
Data-Med and Medco -- promised to deliver computer software,
instructions and the names of doctors looking to hire someone to
process claims.</LD>
<TE>   Salesmen promised callers that the work-at-home business could
bring in $30,000 to $40,000 a year. The company also set up a line
that prospective buyers of the package could call to get
recommendations from satisfied customers.</TE>
<TE>   But the doctors were simply part of a generic listing. And the
recommendations were given by salesmen posing as customers.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, which began in La Habra in July 1998, moved twice
before authorities shut it down in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Five defendants in the case previously pleaded guilty to fraud
charges in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. Two others were
convicted by juries. All are awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Work-at-home scams involving medical billing have been around for
at least five years, said Assistant U.S. Atty. John Early.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is if it sounds too good to be true, then it
probably is," he said.</TE>

<LD>As the final election tally showed Tuesday that San Fernando Valley
cityhood lost by a wide margin, the secession group Valley VOTE finds
itself struggling to maintain its leadership role, with some members
pursuing other interests, including forming separate groups to
advocate for the area.</LD>
<LD>   The final results from the Nov. 5 election on Valley cityhood
released by the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder showed that
66.9% of voters citywide voted against the measure, even though it
won a very slight majority in the Valley. There, the cityhood measure
won 50.7% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   While unsuccessful overall, the majority Valley vote for cityhood
sent a message to city leaders, Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close
said.</LD>
<TE>   "History was made on Nov. 5 -- a majority of Valley residents
voted to form their own city," Close said. "Unless the mayor and City
Council make substantial changes, it will occur. It may take a couple
of years, but it will occur."</TE>
<TE>   Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment held a public meeting
Tuesday night to consider future goals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nearly 60 secession supporters gathered in Mission
Hills, there was a broad consensus to mount another cityhood drive.
Several of those present voiced support for changing state law to
allow elections in which only the Valley would vote on cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain said the makeup of the
Legislature might make such a change in state law difficult so the
effort may have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cracks in the Valley VOTE front have begun to show.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Carlos Ferreyra said he had tentatively
decided to step down from the Valley VOTE board, though later he said
he was reconsidering his decision after other board members asked him
to stay involved.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Scott, another board member, said the group's mission ended
with the election. "I will have to decide whether to reengage with
that particular organization," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several board members, including Scott, treasurer Ricky Gelb and
Bill Powers, have met with Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge),
the top vote-getter for Valley mayor, about forming a new group to
advocate for the Valley.</TE>

<TE>   Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain said the makeup of the
Legislature might make such a change in state law difficult, so the
effort may have to wait or seek an initiative to make the change.
Others said the group should change its emphasis from a ballot
initiative to keeping pressure on City Hall to improve services to
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cracks in the Valley VOTE front have begun to show.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Carlos Ferreyra, one of the three chief
petitioners for Valley secession, said he had tentatively decided to
step down from the Valley VOTE board, though later he said he was
reconsidering his decision after other board members asked him to
stay involved.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreyra, who co-chaired the Valley Independence Committee, the
campaign organization, said the people who received the most votes
for a Valley city mayor and city council should assume a leadership
role.</TE>
<TE>   "The candidates who won the election are the ones who should step
up to the table and carry on the work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Scott, another board member, said the group's mission ended
with the election. "I will have to decide whether to reengage with
that particular organization," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several board members, including Scott, treasurer Ricky Gelb and
Bill Powers, have met with Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge),
the top vote-getter for Valley mayor, about forming a new group to
advocate for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should use the name Valley VOTE anymore," Gelb
said. "It was great in the beginning to get people to vote. There
should be a new group with a new name. We need new leadership, new
blood."</TE>
<TE>   Gelb and Powers said they do not plan to leave the Valley VOTE
board, but Gelb said the group should become dormant until the Valley
determines it should seek another secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said several Valley civic leaders who supported Valley
VOTE have decided the group's history of antagonism with City Hall
and advocacy for breaking away from L.A. hampers the organization
from playing a leading role in urging the city to improve delivery of
services in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a group of 30 former Valley council candidates
and other activists met Monday night to form a third organization to
advocate for improved Valley services.</TE>
<TE>   The group, United Valley Coalition, will serve as a watchdog to
ensure that L.A. city government continues to address Valley concerns
that led to the secession effort.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles County judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bail for
an 18-year-old man charged with abducting and raping several female
victims throughout the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers ordered Andrew Saethong of North
Hollywood to remain in custody at the Twin Towers Correctional
Facility in lieu of $15-million bail. He is charged with nine attacks
on victims from 14 to 26 years old between Dec. 12 and Oct. 18,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson said.</LD>

<HD>State Tax Board Approves Free Electronic Filing</HD>
<DH>The decision follows a three-year battle with software
makers who charge for the service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Millions more Californians will be able to file state income tax
returns by computer at no charge, after a vote by the Franchise Tax
Board on Tuesday that was a blow to the private tax software
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The tax board's decision comes after three years of dispute with
private companies such as Intuit Inc., maker of TurboTax, which call
government-sponsored filing systems an unnecessary intrusion on their
turf. Twenty-five other states already allow direct electronic
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The tax board voted unanimously to launch Web-based versions of
the state's tax forms as quickly as possible. An electronic version
of the 540 2EZ, California's simplest tax form, is already available.
By January the other 540 forms should be too, according to tax board
staff members. More complicated forms, such as those involving a
series of deductions, should be ready by June.</LD>
<TE>   "We accomplished today 100% of the reforms that any activist in
this field imagined would be possible," said state Controller
Kathleen Connell, one of three tax board members.</TE>
<TE>   Of the state's 14 million taxpayers, nearly 9 million are eligible
to use the 540 2EZ or 540 forms.</TE>
<TE>   The tax software industry typically charges $10 to $30 to file a
return and advises taxpayers on how to fill out forms. The free
Franchise Tax Board Web site (www.ftb.ca.gov) will not offer advice.
But it will automatically do math calculations and find the amount of
tax owed without requiring a person to log off the state Web site to
fill in a form.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the tax software industry expressed doubt
Tuesday that California could build a Web-based electronic filing
system for just $100,000 per form, as the tax board staff promises.</TE>
<TE>   "We're skeptical of the ability of the state to pull it off in a
manner that protects California taxpayers and the reputation of
online tax filing," said Jason Mahler, vice president and general
counsel for the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The board asked its staff for quarterly reports on the cost of the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to live by the numbers they've given us,"
Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer advocates praised the board's vote. It reverses the
board's August decision against offering automatic math and tax
calculations because of industry concerns and the fear of some
lawmakers that electronic filing could compromise taxpayer privacy.
The lawmakers said they have been reassured that the tax board cannot
track the keystrokes of individual taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxpayers should have free online filing," said Lenny Goldberg, a
lobbyist for the California Tax Reform Assn. He said the "industry
threw various diversions and roadblocks in the way to keep us from
getting here, but it looks like taxpayers will finally get the
service to which they're entitled."</TE>

<HD>Ridley-Thomas' Elegant Exit</HD>
<DH>In an hourlong salute, the councilman is hailed as a
trailblazer and conscience of the council. He is moving on to the
Assembly.</DH>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council bid farewell Tuesday to longtime
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, toasting the newly elected state
legislator as a tireless public servant who revitalized his 8th
Council District.</LD>
<LD>   Ridley-Thomas, who will be sworn in next week to the state
Assembly, choked back tears as colleagues, even those he sparred with
over the years, stood to honor him.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact of the matter is you're a trailblazer," Councilman Nate
Holden told Ridley-Thomas during an hourlong ceremony. "Since you
have been in office, it's like there is new life in the district.
There are more parks, more recreational facilities, more businesses
and better services."</LD>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, 48, took office in July 1991, when his South Los
Angeles community was racked by recession, and later, civil unrest.
He responded by seeking government funds to redevelop blighted
neighborhoods while working to bring more private sector jobs and
resources to the area.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining that community involvement was the key to progress, he
set up his "Empowerment Congress," an advisory committee that
includes district residents, business leaders, clergy and
neighborhood activists. An accomplished community organizer,
Ridley-Thomas could pack the council chambers with supporters with
only a day's notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark is a very shrewd operator," Councilwoman Ruth Galanter told
her colleagues. "We are going to need another one of those in
Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas became known early in his tenure for his love of the
political game, constantly forming coalitions and alliances to
advance his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   When government funds were scarce, he nevertheless managed to find
money for his district. He fought to ensure that minorities were
given their share of jobs in city government, and pressed for Los
Angeles Police Department reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members said Tuesday that they considered
Ridley-Thomas the conscience of the council.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the moral compass in standing for civil justice,"
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski told Ridley-Thomas. "You stayed the
course and you reminded us time and again about that element we can't
forget."</TE>
<TE>   Others recalled how Ridley-Thomas was legendary for giving lengthy
oratories laced with polysyllabic words.</TE>
<TE>   "You are the slowest talking councilman I've encountered in 24
years, and that covers a lot of council members," quipped Councilman
Hal Bernson. "Seriously, we are losing someone very special here."</TE>
<TE>   While known as a consensus builder, Ridley-Thomas has been on the
losing side of a few key issues over the past year.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he was on the short end of a vote to overturn the
Police Commission's decision to reject Bernard Parks for a second
term as police chief. (Parks is now running to replace
Ridley-Thomas.)</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, he waged many bitter battles against former Mayor Richard
Riordan, arguing that the two-term mayor didn't do enough to reform
the LAPD and advance social causes in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Holden, a state senator more than two decades ago, warned
Ridley-Thomas that even tougher battles await him in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Many have survived, so will you," Holden said. "It's a tough
battleground. You will be tested every day. They will always keep
trying to destroy you, but you will overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Before being elected to the 8th District, Ridley-Thomas headed the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He was elected in a
landslide vote earlier this month to serve as the assemblyman for the
48th District.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman is leaving office before the end of his final term
on July 1. Other veterans forced by term limits to depart by that
date include Holden, Galanter and Bernson.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, who was accompanied by his wife and twin sons, said
he was looking forward to joining the Legislature, but would miss his
City Hall colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been surprised by the level of emotional waves that keep
enveloping me," he said. "I chose to run for the state Assembly
because I wanted to stay in public office. I believed that was a good
thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I still expect to have a significant presence in Los Angeles. I
want to work as diligently as I have in the past. The extent to which
it is fully recognized by my colleagues and constituents, this
motivates me to work even harder."</TE>

<HD>Lesser Tree Crews Would Be Stumped</HD>
<DH>Winds force Irvine maintenance workers to set aside their
usual trimming so they can focus on clearing roads and roofs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every profession has its busy season. For Henry Canales and his crew,
this is it.</LD>
<LD>   Canales, tree maintenance supervisor for the notoriously
well-groomed city of Irvine, rushed from one challenge to another
Tuesday, the second day of high Santa Ana winds that knocked out
power, blew clouds of dust -- and toppled trees.</LD>
<LD>   As Canales tooled around town in a big, white city pickup, his
cell phone bleated constantly with complaints relayed from residents
with limbs drifting in their swimming pools or sprawled on their
lawns. But Canales and his four crews from the city's urban forestry
department were in triage mode, and some things take a higher
priority.</LD>
<TE>   Like the eucalyptus tree with the cracked trunk, swaying in a
median near Northwood Park. Not long after Canales spotted the
problem, the tree was sawed down and fed into a wood chipper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even going to worry about those things until we have the
dangerous jobs out of the way," he said. "Things like that eucalyptus
tree that was breaking -- I don't sleep well at night when I know
there's stuff out there like that."</TE>
<TE>   The workers also made speedy work of branches blown across roads,
limbs strewn over rooftops and a heavy section of a pine tree
drooping into a park, one gust away from plunging 60 feet onto the
jogging trail. In two days, Canales estimated, crews cleared away or
chopped down about 100 small trees, roughly 30 medium-size trees and
half a dozen that neared 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Each windstorm means two to three days of cleanup and months until
fallen trees are replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Although the windstorm justifiably upset some residents, such as
the man whose brand new truck was destroyed when a tree in front of
his house fell on it, others saw the subsequent cleanup as a chance
to take care of some early holiday decorating.</TE>
<TE>   As a crew chopped up the pine by the jogging trail, a woman in
running clothes and a white bandanna wrapped around her head darted
in and out of the bustle. Clutching what appeared to be a foot-long
steak knife, she clipped branches loaded with pine cones until
Canales told her to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "My gosh, these people don't realize how dangerous this can be,"
he said, shaking his head. "Those guys aren't wearing hard hats for
fun."</TE>
<TE>   As the tree was reduced to a pile of chips and the smell of pine
permeated the air, foreman Sergio Macias monitored his crew of six
men, who ordinarily spend their days trimming the city's roughly
54,000 trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be doing something where you know you're really
helping people," he said, as he watched branches sail down from the
sky.</TE>
<TE>   The job does have its dangers for the workers, some of whom were
hoisted 100 feet to chop the uppermost portions of the trees as the
wind buffeted their crane along with the branches.</TE>
<TE>   "It can get pretty hairy," said John Cecconi, who has been working
with Irvine's tree maintenance department for seven years. Cecconi
had just descended from 50 feet, where he had been helping partner
Ken Kanocz fell a tree that had partially collapsed onto the adjacent
house.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the danger presents a thrill that breaks up the monotony of
their normal routine, Cecconi said.</TE>
<TE>   "The faster pace makes the day go by really quickly," he said.
"You don't get a chance to grab a breath, much less get bored."</TE>

<HD>What Made Laguna Kids Sick?</HD>
<DH>Officials seek the source of stomach virus shared by 93
sixth-graders at a Catalina Island camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health officials are investigating what caused 93 Laguna Beach
sixth-graders to fall ill with a stomach virus during a five-day trip
to Santa Catalina Island last week.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 parents met Tuesday with Thurston Middle School Principal
Chris Duddy to separate fact from rumor and to discuss possible
changes when students make the trip next year.</LD>
<LD>   One parent became so worried that he rode to the rescue in his
racing speedboat, zooming across the channel at 100 mph to ferry two
doctors, a nurse and a physical therapist -- all parents of students
at the camp -- from Dana Point to Catalina in about 20 minutes to
treat the children.</LD>
<TE>   When they arrived at Toyon Bay, boat owner Matt Alcone said, they
were greeted by parents and teachers wearing surgical masks and
gloves. Some had been up for 48 hours caring for the sick children.
The arriving medical crew could do little more than what was already
being done.</TE>
<TE>   Several parents at the meeting commended the chaperons for their
care of the youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-graders appear to have been stricken with viral
gastroenteritis, which can be caused by any number of viruses,
according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. It is often
mistakenly called stomach flu, although influenza viruses don't cause
it. The results, though, are the same. The illness can spread through
contact with sick people and by eating or drinking contaminated food.</TE>
<TE>   School officials Tuesday passed out a health care agency
questionnaire to determine if the sick students ate, drank or shared
something else that could have brought on the sickness.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services was checking
the Catalina Island Marine Institute's science camp to make sure
nothing there was contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Iacobo, a spokeswoman for the agency, said officials there
suspect that some kids were sick before they made the trip and spread
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Students went to the Catalina Island Marine Institute to learn
about sea life, and to snorkel and rock-climb. Duddy said the school
had been on the waiting list for the institute for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The trip began Nov. 18, when 217 students, 17 parents and three
teachers were bused to San Pedro to catch the ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Palfreyman, 48, one of the parent chaperons, said students
started getting sick Thursday afternoon. As the day went on, more
children began getting sick at dinner. Chaperons emptied one dorm and
made it a sick ward, filling it with 20 students. Then they turned
another dorm into an infirmary, quickly filling it too.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we had more sick kids than healthy kids, and we were
running out of places to move them," Palfreyman said.</TE>
<TE>   The sickness came on so quickly that students out hiking would
suddenly vomit.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics from Avalon were called; they said the children had the
flu.</TE>
<TE>   Palfreyman said the adults were giving the students drinks and ice
chips to suck on.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parents on the mainland began receiving phone calls
about the epidemic Thursday night. A group of parents tried to
charter a helicopter, but no pilot would make the trip at night.</TE>
<TE>   Alcone, a three-time speedboat national and world champion whose
son was at the camp, knew he had a way to get there quickly. His
boat, he said, could travel 150 mph. He was especially worried, he
said, because of the recent outbreaks of illness among cruise ship
passengers, as well as meningitis cases in schools. He and the other
parents arrived at the camp about 7:15 Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   All of the campers returned home Friday, a couple of hours earlier
than scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Although they found the sight of so many of their friends getting
ill unsettling, many of the students said they had a good time.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd go back again tomorrow, if he could," Dianne LeBon said of
her son.</TE>

<LD>The chairmen of two City Council panels recommended Tuesday that Los
Angeles file a lawsuit to block the Ahmanson Ranch development if the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors approves the project without
changes to address traffic and other environmental concerns.</LD>
<LD>   After a hearing on the proposed 3,050-home development just west
of the L.A. city border, the litigation was endorsed by Ed Reyes and
Nate Holden. Ventura County supervisors are expected to vote on the
project at their Dec. 10 meeting. The recommendations from Reyes and
Holden will be considered by the L.A. council next month.</LD>

<HD>Supervisors Warn Against Overruns</HD>
<DH>Department managers told not to expect any bailouts if they
exceed their budgets this year.</DH>

<LD>Ventura County supervisors warned government managers Tuesday not to
expect a financial bailout if they overrun budgets this year -- even
if it means cutting protected public safety budgets.</LD>
<LD>   With the county already looking for ways to trim another $10
million from its $1.1-billion spending plan, there is little chance
board members would agree to help out individual departments,
supervisors said.</LD>
<LD>   Austerity measures will extend into the next fiscal year because
the state is facing its own fiscal crisis, projecting a $24-billion
shortfall, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to go back to the Depression to find a worse budget,"
Supervisor Steve Bennett said. "The low-hanging fruit has already
been picked."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest cost overruns, about $2.9 million, are in the
Behavioral Health Department. Budget officials attribute the
shortfall to decreased state funding for several programs.</TE>
<TE>   The county's child-support division lost $1.7 million after a
state audit concluded the county had been overpaid by that amount.</TE>
<TE>   But funding requests by the sheriff and district attorney are
expected to garner the most controversy. Dist. Atty. Greg Totten and
Undersheriff Craig Husband said they will fight any attempt to
further trim their programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department is projecting a $1.8-million overrun and
the district attorney is reporting a $128,000 shortfall. Both
departments have requested more funding to close the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and Husband listened to supervisors' warnings without
comment. But outside the board room, both said they would continue to
press for more general fund money.</TE>
<TE>   "Past boards have stated that public safety is a priority in this
county, and we will look to this board to confirm that commitment,"
Husband said.</TE>
<TE>   Totten said he has already cut 25 unfilled positions in his
office, including 14 prosecutors. He has also eliminated two chief
deputy positions, Totten said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be good team players, but we have a primary
responsibility to the public and to public safety," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The board is scheduled to take up budget issues again on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Several supervisors said they are frustrated that the state is
mandating programs for which it fails to provide adequate funding.
One example is the state's requirement that counties offer services
to mentally ill youths through the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Although the county provides the services, the state is more than
$6 million behind in paying for the programs, local officials said.
"It's about time that the counties in the state go to Sacramento and
say we are no longer willing to do this," Supervisor Judy Mikels
said. "Until that happens, we will continue to be trounced."</TE>

<HD>Green Light for Ventura Track</HD>
<DH>Fair board extends raceway's contract for a year despite
noise complaints. But fate of fairgrounds director remains in doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the cheers of racing fans, the Ventura County Fair Board voted
unanimously Tuesday to let the Ventura Raceway operate for at least
another year, despite complaints over noise from downtown residents
and business owners.</LD>
<LD>   The future of the fair's executive director, however, was less
clear. After a two-hour closed session, the board disclosed it would
not immediately terminate Roger Gibbs, who was suspended without
public explanation on Nov. 12. He will remain on paid leave until a
final decision is made at the board's meeting Dec. 17.</LD>
<LD>   Played out before a passionate crowd of about 50 raceway
supporters and fair volunteers, the issues are among the hottest in
recent memory to beset the fair board, ordinarily a tranquil
political backwater that governs use of the county fairgrounds at
Seaside Park.</LD>
<TE>   While noise complaints have been aimed at the raceway for years,
the issue has become more urgent recently.</TE>
<TE>   Former Ventura Mayor Greg Carson, the board's president, has been
reluctant to support the raceway's contract renewal, saying better
uses could be found for the property.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ventura's nearby downtown has undergone a
transformation from a thrift-store capital to an area of trendy
restaurants and stores, with merchants fretting over the effect on
their businesses from the Saturday night "roar by the shore."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, downtown resident Rick Lyons invited raceway
supporters to his hillside condominium so they could hear the noise
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't use the balcony," he said. "If I have a dinner party, I
have to keep the windows shut. It's the type of noise that's out
there; it's not music -- it's not anything but annoying."</TE>
<TE>   But Lyons said he was pleased by raceway director Jim Naylor's
promise to curb the commotion further in the next year with high-tech
mufflers, a 10 p.m. curfew, and other measures.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons was one of three people who spoke against the raceway.
Others lauded it as a living piece of Ventura history and said a
group called Save Ventura Raceway had gathered 15,000 signatures in
its defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto racing is as much a part of Southern California as surfing
and skateboarding," said former Ventura Mayor Jack Tingstrom, adding
that legends of the sport such as Jeff Gordon started out at the
little oval off the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the raceway will face similar difficulties at next year's
contract renewal may hinge on whether it is included in a master plan
to guide future uses of Seaside Park. Board members are in the
process of hiring consultants to help them with the task.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of racing fans stuck around with fair volunteers to put in
a good word for Gibbs, who has been Seaside Park's director for three
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger has delivered 110% of everything he said he would," said
longtime fair volunteer Norm Davis, owner of a feed store in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura resident Sally McNeilan praised Gibbs for encouraging the
2,000 or so volunteers responsible for putting on the fair each
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger makes a point of going out of his way to talk to us," said
McNeilan, adding that she has seen Gibbs in the pens helping
volunteers work with pigs. "Most other managers never got out of the
office."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs directed the Colusa County Fair in Northern California for
16 years. While fair board members have been silent on Gibbs'
suspension, several said they were upset that other board members had
not consulted them before suspending Gibbs.</TE>
<TE>   Some fair volunteers said Gibbs had run afoul of the board,
including Carson and Vice President Ginger Gherardi.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Gibbs offered a brief statement, saying he had come to
Ventura to "live a dream" and had planned to keep the job for about
five years before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had enjoyed a good rapport with various boards that
have employed him for more than three decades and wanted a chance to
reach an understanding with board members.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been able to do this for 32 years," he said, "and I should
be able to do it for a few more."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs declined a request for an interview but produced a sheet
labeled "Accomplishments," which listed 31 items from completing a
fence to developing an understandable budget.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' attorney, Jonathan Light, faulted the board for allegedly
failing to give his client proper notice of his suspension. He said
board members have refused to outline their reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been tremendously interested in what issues there are that
are causing discontent among some board members," Light said. "We
haven't seen anything formal or even informally to explain why
there's this unhappiness."</TE>
<TE>   Light also questioned whether the suspension was legal without the
consent of the full board.</TE>
<TE>   Board members have not publicly discussed Gibbs, calling his
suspension a personnel matter.</TE>
<TE>   The most stinging criticism of the board came from Earl McPhail,
the county's agriculture commissioner and a former board member who
served for 14 years on the panel.</TE>
<TE>   McPhail took the board to task for apparently failing to let Gibbs
know about his perceived shortcomings or provide him with an
opportunity to correct them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't do this, you're doing a disservice to Roger and to
the 785,000 people of Ventura County," McPhail said. "You have a job
to do, and you're not doing it the right way."</TE>

<HD>Winds Down Power Lines and Fan Small Brush Fires</HD>
<DH>Thousands lose their electricity across the L.A. Basin.
Three homes are damaged amid five blazes, which are controlled.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strong Santa Ana winds hammered Southern California again Tuesday,
fanning brush fires, felling trees, downing power lines, tipping over
trucks and stirring up a host of miseries for allergy sufferers.</LD>
<LD>   The fires were brought under control, the damage from fallen trees
and tree limbs was generally light and power was restored in most
areas by nightfall, but residents still faced a massive cleanup job,
and thousands of Southlanders were plagued by itchy eyes, sneezes and
sniffles.</LD>
<LD>   Wind-tossed clouds of dust and other particulate matter drifted
across the Los Angeles Basin and out to sea, coating homes and cars
with gritty grime in many areas and contributing to a spectacular red
sunset.</LD>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said the winds, which gusted to more
than 60 mph Monday and Tuesday, should continue, though easing a
little today and Thanksgiving, with a chance of a few light showers
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday and Sunday are expected to be clear and a little cooler,
with overnight lows dipping into the 30s in parts of the San Fernando
and San Gabriel valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's largest fire blackened about 10 acres and damaged a home
in Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   It took about 150 firefighters, three helicopters and two
SuperScooper planes 90 minutes or so to put out the wind-whipped
blaze, which broke out about 9:30 a.m. among heavy brush in the
foothills near Cloverleaf Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A blaze of unknown origin in the dry Santa Ana River bed near
Norco damaged two homes and scorched more than five acres of brush
and grass.</TE>
<TE>   Flames driven by high winds burned about five acres of brush near
Hansen Dam in the San Fernando Valley. That fire, which started about
4 a.m., burned for three hours before 125 city and county
firefighters brought it under control.</TE>
<TE>   The cause was not determined.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, downed power lines started a small grass fire
that was quickly extinguished near the Golden State Freeway and
Roxford Street in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Several hours later, a brush fire burned about three acres and
briefly threatened several homes in Coto de Caza in south Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 big rigs were blown over early Tuesday, at least a
dozen of them on the heavily traveled Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass
north of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of trees, tree limbs, palm fronds and small signs fell
during the night, littering streets and yards throughout the Los
Angeles Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the toppling trees knocked down power lines, causing
widespread outages that disrupted traffic signals in scattered areas
across Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said about 15,000
customers in the city had been without electricity at various times
early Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison officials said the power failures had
affected about 6,000 of its customers, most of them in the San
Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Power was restored in most areas by sundown Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   John Quigley, the 42-year-old Pacific Palisades resident who has
been roosting in a 400-year-old Santa Clarita Valley oak to protest a
developer's plans to remove the tree, had a rough ride, but he
weathered it.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley lashed himself to a branch to keep from being launched
into the night, and although the limb swayed several feet, he held
fast. He didn't get much sleep, though.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of times that I said some prayers," he
recalled in a cell phone conversation Tuesday afternoon. "It was
pretty intense up there."</TE>
<TE>   The gusty, northeast winds are the byproduct of two large masses
of high atmospheric pressure in the Pacific Northwest. Circulating
clockwise around these highs, the winds dry out by compression as
they sweep down Southern California canyons to the sea, scattering
dust, pollen and ashes that trouble allergy sufferers, asthmatics and
others with respiratory problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dust advisories warning of unhealthy levels of fine particles in
the air were issued Tuesday for the San Fernando, San Gabriel,
Pomona/Walnut and Santa Clarita valleys and parts of San Bernardino
and Riverside counties. Similar advisories are expected today and
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of so little rain, the pollen is just sitting on the
ground," said Dr. Jacob Offenberger, an allergist in the San Fernando
Valley. "The wind stirs it up, people breathe it and those with
allergies and asthma can have a lot of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Offenberger said blowing soot, ashes and dust are causing
respiratory difficulties in communities below areas burned in recent
brush fires.</TE>
<TE>   "There, it's a problem of irritation more than allergies," he
said. "And the low humidity can be an irritant too."</TE>
<TE>   Offenberger said people who find their normal respiratory
medications inadequate should consult their physicians.</TE>

<HD>Officials Probe Illness of Students on Catalina Field Trip</HD>
<DH>Ninety-three Laguna Beach sixth-graders had a stomach virus
on the five-day outing. Parent ferried doctors to the island on his
speedboat.</DH>

<LD>Health officials are investigating what caused 93 Laguna Beach
sixth-graders to fall ill with a stomach virus during a five-day trip
to Santa Catalina Island last week.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 parents met Tuesday afternoon with Thurston Middle School
Principal Chris Duddy to separate fact from rumor and to talk about
possible changes for next year's trip.</LD>
<LD>   One parent became so worried that he rode to the rescue in his
championship speedboat, zooming across the channel at 100 mph to
ferry two doctors, a nurse and a physical therapist -- all parents --
from Dana Point to Catalina in about 20 minutes to treat the
children.</LD>
<TE>   When they arrived at Toyon Bay, boat owner Matt Alcone said, they
were greeted by parents and teachers wearing surgical masks and
gloves. Some of them had been up for 48 hours caring for the sick
children.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-graders appear to have been stricken with viral
gastroenteritis, which can be caused by any number of viruses,
according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. It is often
mistakenly called stomach flu, although influenza viruses don't cause
it.</TE>
<TE>   The results, though, are the same. The illness can be spread
through contact with sick people and by eating and drinking
contaminated food.</TE>
<TE>   School officials Tuesday passed out a health care agency
questionnaire to determine if the sick students ate, drank or
otherwise shared something in common that could have brought on the
sickness.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services was checking
the Catalina Island Marine Institute to make sure nothing there was
contaminated. Maria Iacobo, a spokeswoman for the department, said
agency officials suspect that some pupils were sick before they made
the trip and then spread the illness to the others.</TE>
<TE>   Students went to the institute to learn about sea life, snorkel
and engage in rock-climbing.</TE>
<TE>   The trip began Nov. 18, when 217 students, 17 parents and three
teachers left on a ferry from San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Palfreyman, 48, one of the parents who chaperoned, said
children started getting sick Thursday afternoon. As the day went on,
the numbers rose. One dorm was emptied, turned into a sick ward and
soon filled with 20 children. Another was turned into an infirmary
and quickly filled up too.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we had more sick kids than healthy kids, and we were
running out of places to move them," Palfreyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics from Avalon were called; they said the children had the
flu.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parents on the mainland began receiving phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Alcone, a three-time speedboat world champion whose son was at the
camp, knew he had a way to get there quickly. His boat, he said,
could travel 150 mph. He was especially worried because of the recent
outbreaks of illness among cruise ship passengers, as well as
meningitis cases in schools.</TE>
<TE>   He and the other parents arrived at the camp about 7:15 a.m.
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Group Wins Round on Political Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Tuesday dealt a setback to the government's effort to
enforce the nation's new campaign finance law, ruling that the law's
restrictions on political advertising did not apply to a Hawaii
antiabortion group.</LD>
<LD>   Without ruling on the broader constitutionality of the law, U.S.
District Judge Henry Kennedy granted a temporary injunction clearing
the way for Hawaii Right to Life to air ads in special congressional
elections scheduled for Saturday and Jan. 4.</LD>
<LD>   The group hailed the victory and said it will begin airing the ads
today.</LD>
<TE>   Though the group contends that the new restrictions on political
ads are unconstitutional and would have prevented it from expressing
its views on the elections, it won the injunction by focusing on a
narrower issue.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who was appointed by former President Clinton, agreed
with Hawaii Right to Life and ruled that it was a "qualified
nonprofit corporation" that by law should be exempt from the
government's new political ad restrictions. In doing so, he concluded
that the Federal Election Commission's definition for such nonprofit
groups was too narrow and wrongly excluded the Hawaii group.</TE>
<TE>   He said the antiabortion group qualified for the exemption because
it had received only $50 in corporate contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the issue of constitutionality should be saved "for
another day."</TE>
<TE>   The FEC had argued that Hawaii Right to Life should be treated as
a political issue advocacy group covered by the new advertising
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is a setback for the FEC's effort to begin implementing
the campaign finance law Congress passed earlier this year. The law,
which took effect Nov. 6, puts new limits on campaign donations and
ads.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaii elections are to fill a vacancy created by the death of
Democratic Rep. Patsy T. Mink and are the first conducted under the
new law.</TE>
<TE>   James Bopp Jr., the Hawaii Right to Life lawyer, said, "This is an
important issue to advocacy groups and their role in the political
process."</TE>

<HD>Shoppers Told of Violent Toys</HD>
<DH>'Sniper' action figure, carjacking video game on list by
parents' group of items to avoid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eddy Ramirez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A gun-wielding creature called Sniper, a war-ravaged "playhouse" and
a video game that allows players to hijack police cars and shoot
pedestrians are among the most violent toys and games for sale this
holiday season, a national parents' group said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Released just before the holiday shopping rush, this year's "Dirty
Dozen" list includes toys that, according to the Lion &amp; Lamb Project,
promote violence and aggression as fun and harmless. The group is
urging shoppers to steer clear of these toys and instead buy those
that made their top 20 nonviolent toy list.</LD>
<LD>   "We've lived through the horror of Sept. 11, the war in
Afghanistan, the anthrax scare, the sniper shootings and just
recently the string of unrelated killings in L.A.," said Daphne
White, a parent and executive director of the group. "So the question
is: What kind of toys do we want to give our children during a season
of peace on Earth? Do we give them toys that remind them of terrorism
and violence ... or toys that will make them laugh and make them
think and have fun?"</LD>
<TE>   But some retailers and manufacturers defended the toys, saying
their decisions about which toys to sell or make are based on demand
and the notion that parents will use discretion in choosing what to
purchase for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the government issued a separate warning to
consumers to return potentially dangerous products for children that
they may have already bought but that have since been recalled. In a
report titled "Trouble in Toyland," the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group said balloons and toys with small parts continue to pose the
biggest choking risk to children.</TE>
<TE>   Among the potentially hazardous toys cited by PIRG were:</TE>
<TE>   * About 280,000 toy sponges and about 310,000 stuffed polyester
pool animals, recalled by Dollar Tree Stores Inc. of Virginia,
because they pose a potential choking hazard;</TE>
<TE>   * About 140,000 air-powered toy rockets recalled by Colorado-based
Estes Industries, because defective parts can break off and cause eye
or hand injuries;</TE>
<TE>   * About 152,000 toy tracks attached to children's activity centers
recalled by Graco Children's Products Inc. in Pennsylvania. The
tracks can break into pieces that risk choking young children.</TE>
<TE>   A list of the recalled toys is online at www.toysafety.net</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference held by the Lion &amp; Lamb Project, a
parent-based initiative that aims to halt the marketing of violence
to children, the toys on display included Hasbro's Zoids: Gun Sniper,
a toy figure equipped with "missile-launching side cannons." Also
displayed was "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City," the sequel to the
best-selling video game of 2002. A complete list of toys the group
found violent -- as well as toys it recommends -- is available at
www.lionlamb.org.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Villani, a child psychiatrist at the conference, warned that
toys and video games depicting violence and sexual images might cause
children and teens to engage in risky behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents need to be better armed themselves to resist the
pressures of their children whom marketers are targeting," Villani
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hasbro, the manufacturer of the Zoids game with the sniper figure,
called the Lion &amp; Lamb findings "off-base." In a statement Tuesday,
the company maintained that the sniper toy and another toy that PIRG
deemed a choking hazard in its report are both "appropriate" for
children ages 4 and older.</TE>
<TE>   White and other parents are also pressuring the major toy
retailers to either pull violent toys and video games from store
shelves or separate them by age group. Already, Toys R Us has stopped
selling the Hasbro "sniper" action figure. The company's online
shopping Web site says the toy is out of stock or was discontinued.</TE>
<TE>   John Reilly, a spokesman for KB Toys, which sells some of the toys
on the "Dirty Dozen" list, said the company will continue selling
them as long as they are in demand. The retailer also sells toys
named in the Lion &amp; Lamb's top 20 recommended list.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is this: Parents need to be actively involved in
purchasing decisions," Reilly said.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first 10 months of 2002, video game sales exceeded $6
billion, a 20% increase from the same period a year ago, according to
NPDFunworld, an online marketing information group. Sales are
expected to reach $10 billion, compared to $9.4 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   But other toy retailers are finding that violent toys and video
games are not as popular with younger children. All 169 Zany Brainy
stores, which are owned by FAO Inc., plan to stop selling video games
after the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a whole lot of video games were geared toward our target
customers ages 4 to 10," said spokesman Alan Marcus. "Even if video
games depict playful violence, it really is not what our customers
ask for."</TE>

<HD>It's Time to Implement School Reform Law, U.S. Official
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Banchero</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A top official with the U.S. Department of Education turned up the
heat on public schools Tuesday, saying it's time to stop making
excuses and start implementing the new federal law that lets children
escape bad schools while giving them better teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Undersecretary of Education Eugene Hickok said too many states are
finding bureaucratic ways around the sweeping No Child Left Behind
Act instead of developing creative means to make it work. He said the
department will step up its efforts to ensure that school officials
meet the law's requirements. He did not offer specifics.</LD>
<LD>   "Watch us, we are going to get pretty aggressive," Hickok said in
a teleconference.</LD>
<TE>   Hickok spoke after releasing the final regulations for the new
education bill. The law mandates annual testing of children from
third through eighth grades, insists that all classroom instructors
be certified for the subjects or grades they teach, and sets a
12-year timetable for closing the achievement gaps between minority
and white children as well as poor and more affluent students. It
also includes more federal education spending, which means $240
million more for Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The linchpin of the law is its accountability measure, which
demands that districts allow students to transfer from schools where
large numbers of students fail standardized tests and provide
tutoring for those who remain.</TE>
<TE>   Since the act's passage in January, some school officials have
gotten around it, saying too little space in good schools and too few
qualified teachers hinder implementation.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, more than 160,000 children attend low-performing
schools and, according to the law, should have been able to move to
better ones. But most were not offered an opportunity to transfer. In
Chicago, only 29,000 of the 124,000 eligible students got the chance
to move.</TE>
<TE>   The story was much the same in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia
and Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that this is a considerable challenge and we are
willing to work with state and local districts," Hickok said. "But
the idea that choice should be limited by a lack of capacity runs
counter to the intent of this law."</TE>
<TE>   Hickok challenged school officials to come up with inventive
solutions, such as developing "cyber" schools.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman with the community group ACORN praised Hickok's
comments. ACORN released a study earlier this month charging that
states are ignoring the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome increased vigilance on enforcement, but the federal
government also has to understand that this is a question of
resources," said Doug Timmer with the Chicago ACORN office. "The real
crux is that in some places, such as Chicago, the law is so far from
the current reality that it will take a huge infusion of resources to
make it work."</TE>
<TE>   Kati Haycock of Education Trust also praised the department's firm
stance. "However, tougher accountability by itself does not create
higher achievement," said Haycock, who heads the education research
organization. "We worry about the lack of focus on teacher quality
and public reporting."</TE>

<HD>Rehnquist Has Surgery to Fix Knee</HD>
<DH>The U.S. chief justice tore a tendon in a fall. He is
expected to begin physical therapy soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist underwent surgery Tuesday to
repair a knee injury he suffered in a fall at his home Thursday, a
spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center repaired a torn
quadriceps tendon in the chief justice's right leg, the spokeswoman,
Kathy Arberg, said. Rehnquist, 78, was "resting comfortably" and will
begin physical therapy soon, Arberg said.</LD>
<LD>   The court's nine justices are scheduled to meet for a conference
today, and Rehnquist will participate, Arberg said. Their next
scheduled oral argument session is Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The quadriceps tendon connects the thigh muscles to the kneecap.
If it is torn, the injured person cannot walk normally. The chief
justice had been on crutches since the injury, previously described
as a buildup of fluid in the knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, we consider it a painful injury," said Dr. Randall
Wroble, a Columbus, Ohio, orthopedic surgeon who serves on the public
relations committee of the American Orthopedic Society for Sports
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Wroble said the usual course of treatment after surgery calls for
the patient to be placed in a stiff leg brace, which is loosened
gradually as the knee recovers through physical therapy. Full healing
takes six months, he said, adding that, in a person of Rehnquist's
age, "any sort of major surgery takes longer to come back from."</TE>
<TE>   That could mean limited mobility for Rehnquist through most of the
rest of the current court term, which ends by early July.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Rehnquist's injury is the same one President
Clinton suffered in 1997, when he slipped on stairs while visiting
the home of pro golfer Greg Norman in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Other than back problems, Rehnquist has had no visible health
difficulties of late.</TE>

<HD>White House May Press Saudis on Anti-Terror Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is considering tougher policies against Saudi
Arabia in an effort to force Saudi leaders to do more to crimp the
flow of money to terrorist organizations, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The discussions come as members of Congress have escalated
criticism of the Saudi kingdom, accusing the royal family of
inadequate measures to crack down on militants and cut their
financial lifelines.</LD>
<LD>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer acknowledged the criticism but
insisted that the administration stands by its Saudi allies.</LD>
<TE>   "The president believes that Saudi Arabia has been a good partner
in the war against terrorism," Fleischer said. "But even a good
partner like Saudi Arabia can do more in the war against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the administration had discussed names of
individuals and charities suspected of terrorist ties with Saudi
officials. But he denied a report in the Washington Post that the
administration had prepared a list of suspects for Saudi Arabia and
would issue an ultimatum that the kingdom act in 90 days or face
punitive U.S. measures.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no substance to these reports," said Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell, who was traveling in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said an interagency group on ending financial support
for terrorists has been working to devise new measures to pressure
the Saudis, but those discussions are still preliminary.</TE>
<TE>   The group's efforts have "not even yet risen up to the point of
making recommendations," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials insist they are doing all they can.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is money coming from Saudi Arabia, we want to shut it
off. But we have to start with some facts before we act," said Saudi
embassy spokesman Nail al Jubeir. "We have to have some proof."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say stemming the flow of Saudi money to terrorists is
difficult, in part because it often takes the form of charitable
donations by individuals and flows through informal banking
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's individuals. It's not a question of the nation," Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Relations with Saudi Arabia have been tense since last year's
Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, in part because 15 of
the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Until then, Saudi Arabia was
one of only two countries that recognized the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan, which harbored Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Saudi officials have acknowledged that the wife of
the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Princess Haifa al Faisal,
sent money to a Saudi man in San Diego who was in contact with two of
the Sept. 11 hijackers. The princess believed the money was being
used to treat the man's wife for a thyroid condition.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, a government spokesman, Adil Jubeir, said that if
any of the princess' money given in good faith as charity had reached
the hijackers, it could only be because the princess had been
tricked. He said some Saudi critics in Washington seemed less
interested in the truth than in scoring "political brownie points"
against the Saudi regime.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Middle East, Arab commentators charged that the focus
on the princess' indirect link to the hijackers is part of a campaign
by some U.S. conservatives, frustrated by Arab resistance to Israel,
to smear even the most pro-Western Arab governments.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say the Bush administration feels under pressure to show
that it is leaning hard enough on the Saudis.</TE>

<HD>In Florida, Limit Class Size Now, Pay Later</HD>
<DH>Constitutional amendment seeks to address overcrowded
public schools, but the price tag may reach $27.5 billion over 8
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PEMBROKE PINES, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Welcome to Charles W. Flanagan High School, Florida's biggest. The
prize-winning marching band, at 240 members, is so large it must
rehearse in four separate sections. Between periods, say Flanagan
students, bathrooms are often too crowded to use.</LD>
<LD>   Designed for 2,835 children, the school, in one of Florida's
fastest-growing municipalities, now has more than 5,300, and faculty
members are feeling the strain. Social sciences teacher Oscar
Siflinger has one class of 60 students. If he assigns an essay,
grading the papers might consume an entire evening.</LD>
<LD>   "The class size is destroying us," Siflinger said. "I don't
believe in mass production. We need to make these students think."</LD>
<TE>   The most far-reaching decision by voters in Florida this month
might not have been the reelection of Jeb Bush, a first for a
Republican governor here, but approval of an amendment to the state's
Constitution that will cap the size of classes in the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment establishes statewide ceilings, to be in place by
2010, of 18 students in kindergarten through third grade, 22 in
fourth through eighth grades and 25 in high school. According to
Kathy Christie, vice president for knowledge management at the
Denver-based Education Commission of the States, at least 20 states,
including California, have adopted laws to fix or recommend limits on
class sizes, but Florida is the first to make a cap mandatory under
its Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the most ambitious measure we've seen," Christie
said.</TE>
<TE>   Constructing the thousands of extra classrooms required for
smaller classes, and finding new teachers to teach in them and ways
to pay for all this, is the biggest headache now facing the leaders
of the Sunshine State. Bush, who campaigned hard, and ultimately to
no avail, against the amendment, once warned that the expenses it
carries, combined with other fiscal challenges for Florida, "would
blot out the sun."</TE>
<TE>   In an unguarded moment, Bush also told one campaign audience he
had "devious plans" to subvert the class-size measure if voters
approved it. The president's brother later said he regretted the
remark, and now speaks of the need to craft a "flexible" approach for
implementation.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates for how much it will cost to bring Florida's public
schools into conformity during the eight-year phase-in period range
from $8 billion to $27.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   According to one calculation, 29,000 new classrooms may be needed.
In 2003-04 alone, according to a report from the state Senate,
Florida will need to recruit almost 25,000 more teachers, in large
part because of shrinking class size.</TE>
<TE>   This means colossal new expenditures, at a time when government
revenues have been dwindling because of the economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists for gambling interests have offered themselves as
Florida's financial angels, claiming that if permission is granted
them to place video gambling machines at dog and horse tracks and jai
alai frontons, new tax revenue could reach $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a plan yet," Bush said after the election. The
governor has said he opposes extending gambling, cutting social
services or imposing a tax increase, but that he has a constitutional
duty to comply with the amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Voters, who approved the measure by a 52% to 48% margin, didn't
seem to lose any sleep over how to finance it, said Ken Wald, a
professor of political science at the University of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Florida want lots of services but don't want to pay for
them," Wald said. "We want representation without taxation."</TE>
<TE>   If Floridians are so blithe, they may not be alone. In 1996, the
California Legislature adopted a law providing funding incentives for
smaller classes in kindergarten through third grade, but evidently
did not consider all the consequences. About 20,000 new teachers were
needed, and certification requirements had to be relaxed to fill the
new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In some school districts, there were concerns about the
qualifications of the new hires, as well as a shortage of substitute
teachers. Some schools in low-income areas, meanwhile, reported an
exodus of experienced fourth- and fifth-grade teachers seeking
positions in smaller kindergarten-to-third-grade classes in more
affluent districts.</TE>
<TE>   What did motivate voters, supporters of the classroom cap believe,
is the crowding that has become chronic in Florida's schools as
population growth outpaces the ability, or willingness, of elected
officials to provide services.</TE>
<TE>   "Every major county in the state has school overcrowding and
class-size problems," said Democratic state Sen. Debbie Wasserman
Schultz, co-chair of the pro-amendment Coalition to Reduce Class
Size, and whose district includes Pembroke Pines. "You have a
generation of kids being shuffled and pushed and pulled, and forced
into a learning environment where it is very difficult for them to
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   To finance the building and staffing of new classrooms, Democrats
want to review $24 billion in annual exemptions from the state sales
tax -- including stadium sky boxes, lawyers' fees and escort services
-- and $4 billion in tax reductions under Bush they claim went mostly
went to the state's wealthiest residents.</TE>
<TE>   At Flanagan High, which opened seven years ago, classes now
average nearly 35 students, or as many as 10 children above the new
legal limit. Twenty-eight trailer-like "portable classrooms" already
sit on concrete blocks outside the main two-story, dusty-pink
building to handle the burgeoning student body, and the 1,900
ninth-graders have been spun off to a satellite location.</TE>
<TE>   As she showed a visitor around, Principal Sharton Hill Shaulis
stopped to hear a part of the school band, the Falcon Sound, rehearse
a march from Rimsky-Korsakov, and a chorus, the Madrigals, sing a
number from "A Chorus Line."</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if all these classrooms are already full, where are we going
to put the new classes?" she wondered aloud.</TE>
<TE>   In the bustling lunchroom, teacher Brian Flaherty keeps order as
students chow down in three shifts. "We're at critical mass," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pressure is supposed to be taken off Shaulis and her
335-member staff by the opening of a new high school in this area
inland from Fort Lauderdale next year. It's a belated reaction by the
Broward County School Board to growth in Pembroke Pines, whose
population began soaring when people fled the devastation wrought by
Hurricane Andrew to the south a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be so nice to have only 3,000 students," said Shaulis, 52,
who confides that when she thinks she has it tough, she flips on an
episode of "Boston Public." For now, the halls at Flanagan are so
thronged between classes she has banned the use of lockers, which she
said slow down students, make them tardy and sometimes cause fights.</TE>
<TE>   For many educators nationwide, Florida voters have taken an
important step to better assure the quality of learning given their
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had small, medium and large classes, and I can tell you that
small class size definitely allowed me as a teacher to spend more
time with young people and give them more individualized attention,"
said Reg Weaver, a middle-school teacher from Harvey, Ill., who is
now president of the National Education Assn., a teachers union with
2.7 million members nationwide. "You can give better direction, in
the event you need such. When you have a classroom that is orderly,
it makes it conducive to discipline and learning. Long-term, smaller
class size also helps reduce dropout rates."</TE>
<TE>   However, studies of the effects of class size have led to more
nuanced conclusions. According to Christie, whose organization's
mission is to work with state officials to improve education policy,
a study in Tennessee did indicate smaller class size is important to
children in the lower grades. However, as the age of pupils rises, it
appears to become less influential on what and how they learn.</TE>
<TE>   For older children, "there is no unanimity about the educational
value," Christie said. "Money may be better spent elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   At Flanagan High, the changes will come too late for seniors like
Megan King, 17, editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, the Raptor.
For them, overcrowding will be one of their lasting teenage memories,
along with the Falcons' exploits on the football field and this
month's Homecoming dance.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking through the hallways is insane; it's impossible to get
through all the people," King said. "The student parking lot has 500
spaces, and there are 1,200 seniors. One of my classes, Algebra 2,
has like 40 kids in it. That's annoying, because you don't have as
much individual help."</TE>

<HD>Sniper Tipsters Must Wait for Reward Payout</HD>
<DH>Officials say aiding victims is the priority and that it
will be some time before they can sort out all the claims to the
$500,000 pot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Patrick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The $500,000 in reward money for tipsters in last month's sniper
shootings will remain in limbo until officials go through a long and
involved process to figure out who deserves a share, Maryland
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Though the reward money was collected during the three weeks of
sniper attacks from more than 930 donors, a newly formed panel of law
enforcement officials must decide who contributed to the capture of
the two sniper suspects and how much those contributions are worth.</LD>
<LD>   "Do not be upset if the process takes a while, if it does not take
place immediately. We want to be very careful," said Montgomery
County Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who will head the group. Its
members include officials from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.</LD>
<TE>   Montgomery County Chief Executive Douglas M. Duncan said answering
questions about the disposition of the reward money was less
important than getting money to the victims and their families before
the holidays. Duncan presented almost $116,000 that was raised in
excess of the reward fund's $500,000 cap to the United Way Healing
Fund at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We have suspects in custody, our community is safe again, and
we've got the luxury of time to make sure that we get it right, that
we make the right decisions on who gets the reward money," Duncan
said.</TE>
<TE>   David Weaver, Duncan's spokesman, said the reward panel would be
"an extension of the task force" formed to help capture the sniper
suspects, and it may include local prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement and prosecution representation is deemed
necessary because the reward process faces a number of obstacles.
Officials must decide which of the 60,000 tips were valuable and
which arrived first when the area was terrorized by the snipings.
They are seeking to avoid being accused during trials of paying for
witness testimony. There is also the possibility of lawsuits over the
distribution of the reward.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver said Moose has already heard from lawyers representing
several tipsters.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials would not speculate or discuss specific cases,
beneficiaries could include a Richmond-area parish priest whom one of
the suspects called, the man who alerted police to the suspects'
location in a Maryland roadside rest stop and a Washington state
resident who told investigators that a neighbor had been using a tree
stump for target practice. A caller who reported seeing a car
believed used by the snipers near a shooting could also be in line
for a reward.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to be resolved any time soon," Weaver said,
stressing that reward money would be only for information that led to
the arrest and indictment of suspects John Allen Muhammad, 41, and
Lee Boyd Malvo, 17.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding how to distribute such a large reward fund could be a big
headache, said Richard W. Carter, executive director of Crime
Stoppers International. Crime Stoppers considers the timing of tips
"most important" in cases where there are multiple claims for a
reward, Carter said, providing all information was useful in making
an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said that if a second caller also provided valuable
information to a case he might, for example, consider splitting the
reward 75% to 25% in favor of the first tipster.</TE>
<TE>   Carter added that the size of the reward could lead to more
complications and more claims, including lawsuits, and he said "a
few" large rewards have wound up in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also used Tuesday's announcement to appeal for more
donations for the victims. "In this season of giving, I would ask
that we all find it in our hearts to help the families of those"
affected by the shootings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions to the fund came from 33 states and three foreign
countries, including $151,000 Duncan said was raised by Coachella
Valley, Calif., developer Tim Blixseth, who was present for the
announcement Tuesday in Montgomery County.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we have reached out and touched the heart of
America," Blixseth said.</TE>
<TE>   His donation joined $50,000 that Montgomery County used to start
the fund and $100,000 contributed by the state of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's donation comes on the heels of the disbursement of about
$260,000 to local victims over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Washington-based Victims' Rights Foundation
announced that it had distributed about $18,500 to each of the
snipers' 14 victims or their families.</TE>

<HD>New Law Aids Victims of Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Bush gives victims, their kin the means to collect
judgments against the frozen assets of the seven nations that the
U.S. says sponsor terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Edwena Hegna waited 18 years for a measure of justice in her
husband's slaying by terrorist hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, she finally got it when President Bush signed into law
a bill letting victims of terrorism collect multimillion-dollar
judgments from about $4 billion in frozen assets of suspected
terrorist groups and the seven nations that the U.S. accuses of
sponsoring terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "I know my husband's looking down," she said after attending the
bill signing at the White House. "The sense of relief after 18 years
is just so overwhelming."</LD>
<TE>   The provision was part of a terrorism insurance bill that Bush has
touted as an economic stimulus measure. The core of the bill will
provide federal backup insurance against damage caused by future
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're defending America by making our economy more secure," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the lesser-known provision dealing with the frozen
assets that drew victims of terrorism and their families to the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   "One way to confront terrorist organizations is to hit them in the
pocketbook," said Rep. Vito Fossella (R.-N.Y), a leading sponsor of
the bill in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown how many people are affected by the provision, but
it is estimated to be in the hundreds. The lawsuits range from
terrorist bombings in Israel to kidnappings in Iraq and confinements
in Kuwait and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   Hegna, who is 61 and now lives in Arizona, had written Bush,
reminding him that his father, then the vice president under
President Reagan, had promised that "justice would be served" as the
flag-draped casket bearing her husband's body arrived home in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hegna, 50, father of four and an auditor for the U.S.
Agency for International Development, was flying from Kuwait to
Pakistan when Hezbollah militants hijacked the plane to Tehran. Hegna
was beaten, shot in the stomach and shoved out of the airplane door
to the tarmac. As he lay on the ground, the terrorists shot him
again. Earlier this year, Hegna's family won a $42-million judgment
against Iran in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Congress gave victims of terrorism the right to sue
countries on the State Department list of nations that sponsor
terrorism -- Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
Currently, no Syrian funds are blocked.</TE>
<TE>   However, Americans who have won court cases for attacks on them or
their families have had difficulty collecting.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department resisted releasing the assets, contending
that they can provide an important bargaining chip in U.S. diplomacy.
Officials were also worried that releasing the funds could provoke
attacks on U.S. property abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Assets are blocked in the national interest, so they can be used
as leverage and bargaining chips with states not friendly with the
U.S.," said a State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The assets "are also used to assist our foreign policy in
dealing with successor regimes that turn out to be friendly to the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation is expected to pave the way for release of the
funds, according to the families of victims and their attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, the victims are going to see justice," said Dan Wolf, a
Washington attorney representing Americans who allege they were
seized and used as "human shields" on potential targets in Iraq when
President Saddam Hussein's regime invaded Kuwait in 1990. All were
released shortly before the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf's clients include Jack Frazier, a former Santa Ana resident
waiting to collect $1.7 million 12 years after he was held hostage by
the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we don't get the money by Christmas, it'll still be a
good Christmas present," said his wife, Deanna. "Jack isn't doing
well at all. He will never get over what happened. He sometimes feels
like a forgotten man."</TE>
<TE>   When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Frazier was a field
superintendent for the Bechtel Corp. at an Iraqi oil refinery outside
of Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he suffered from a mild case of diabetes that he
controlled with medication. Iraqi soldiers took away his medicine,
however, and Frazier's condition worsened during his almost three
months in captivity. When he was released in October 1990, he had
lost sight in his right eye.</TE>
<TE>   His medical problems worsened over the years, and he is mostly
confined to a wheelchair and has problems feeding himself, his wife
said. Today, the couple live in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., where
Frazier is in a care facility. "We've gone through gangbusters to get
justice for Jack," said his wife. "We never expected justice from
Hussein. But we also didn't expect our government to side with
Hussein when we tried to collect his award from the court."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was prompted by last year's terrorist attacks,
which have led to insurance claims estimated at $40 billion to $50
billion. Responding to insurance company warnings that they could be
ruined by another attack, the new law makes insurers eligible for
reimbursement of 90% of claims once losses exceed $10 billion in
2003, $12.5 billion in 2004 and $15 billion in 2005. Losses will be
capped at $100 billion, until the program ends in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Should terrorists strike America again, we have a system in place
to address financial losses and get our economy back on its feet as
quickly as possible," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodger S. Lawson, president of the Alliance of American Insurers,
said the law will "spread the risk, stabilize the market, and give
insurers the opportunity to once again provide coverage without the
pending threat of insolvency from a future terrorist act."</TE>
<TE>   In pushing for the legislation in recent weeks, Bush had stressed
that the unavailability or high cost of terrorism insurance had made
it difficult for some construction projects to obtain financing.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans were upset that the bill did not prohibit
individuals injured in an attack from suing businesses for punitive
damages. But Bush said he plans to work with the Congress on stronger
measures to prevent "abusive lawsuits."</TE>

<HD>Investigation of Nuclear Dump Study Is Urged</HD>
<DH>Nevada lawmakers demand probe of allegations that Energy
Department ignored misgivings about Yucca Mountain as a waste site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Nevada's congressional delegation is demanding an investigation into
claims that the Energy Department ignored consultants' misgivings
about the use of Yucca Mountain to store nuclear waste -- and then
punished the critics.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations bolster concerns that the White House is "charging
forward with so [few] facts" in support of the $70-billion project,
Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Scientists who don't agree with the plan are given short shrift,"
Reid said. "It's obvious that Yucca Mountain is on the fast track,
because of the strength of the power industry in this
administration."</LD>
<TE>   President Bush, with congressional support and at the urging of
the nuclear power industry, has championed burying the waste at Yucca
Mountain because storage space is running out at the nation's nuclear
power plants. Nevada has filed various lawsuits to stop the project,
which the government hopes to open in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Reid and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) asked late Monday for a
congressional investigation into the claims that the Energy
Department shrugged off scientific anxieties about the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely concerned about these troubling reports of
significant quality-assurance problems and mistreatment of federal
employees, who have attempted to identify and inform others of these
problems," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Department spokesman Joe Davis said the agency "thoroughly
and completely stands behind our scientific studies."</TE>
<TE>   The final arbiter in assessing the integrity of the studies will
be the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which must license the
facility, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The senators' letter was triggered by a report in the Las Vegas
Review-Journal newspaper that a consulting science engineer on the
project was fired and a quality-assurance manger was reassigned after
raising concerns about studies that led to the selection of Yucca
Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, to store 77,000 tons of
highly radioactive nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   The fired employee, Jim Mattimoe, won a job-reinstatement order
from the Department of Labor that is being appealed by his former
employer. In the meantime, he is working at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The senators said they also had received anonymous letters that
raised the specter that a "significant" amount of project data had
been lost.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he knew of no data loss and that there are several
backups of the computerized data used to generate modeling programs
of Yucca's operations.</TE>
<TE>   The senators asked David Walker, who heads the General Accounting
Office -- the investigative arm of Congress -- to look into "the
treatment of whistle-blowers at the Yucca Mountain project and the
quality-assurance problems raised by these and other
whistle-blowers."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's two House members also weighed in.</TE>
<TE>   "Serious doubts and concerns about Yucca Mountain's suitability
just continue to mount," Republican Rep. Jim Gibbons said. "It is
time to stop the project now, before it's too late."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Democratic Rep.
Shelley Berkley said the reports "make apparent that [the Energy
Department] is covering up persistent problems." She asked for
assurances from Abraham that whistle-blowers "are protected and
treated as a valuable and necessary part" of his staff.</TE>

<HD>Study: Diuretics a Risk to Kidney Patients</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The common practice of using diuretics to treat acute kidney failure
may do more harm than good, according to a new California study.</LD>
<LD>   Patients whose kidneys go into sudden failure are often given
diuretics -- drugs designed to help rid the body of accumulating
fluid. But the study, reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Assn., found that patients given these drugs had a 68% higher
death rate than those who were not.</LD>
<LD>   The authors and several kidney experts stressed that the study
cannot conclude for sure that the diuretics caused the increased
death rate. For example, on average, the patients given diuretics
were older and sicker to begin with, and while the authors tried to
control for such factors, they may not have been able to do so
perfectly.</LD>
<TE>   But the findings add to a body of research suggesting that
diuretics often may do little good for such patients. It suggests
that doctors must closely monitor people with acute kidney failure
and make sure they don't delay other treatments, such as dialysis, if
the patients are not responding to diuretics.</TE>
<TE>   The study examined only patients with acute kidney failure, and it
has no bearing on patients with chronic kidney failure.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by a team of researchers led by Dr.
Ravindra L. Mehta, a professor of medicine and director of the
clinical nephrology and dialysis programs at UC San Diego. The
scientists gathered data from 552 intensive-care patients with acute
kidney failure. Of these, well over half of the patients had been
treated with diuretics.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists found that as well as increased death rates, the
patients who had been given diuretics for acute kidney failure also
had a higher rate of developing chronic kidney failure that required
dialysis.</TE>
<TE>   The death rate was especially high in patients who failed to
quickly respond to the diuretics with an increased flow of urine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this should call for a reappraisal of our frequent use of
diuretics in critically ill patients with acute kidney failure,"
Mehta said. "We are all trying to do our best for patients who have
kidney failure ... but oftentimes, we may not be helping them at
all." Tackling kidney problems quickly is crucial, Mehta said,
because studies show that even a small amount of kidney malfunction
can significantly increase the chance of death for people who are
seriously ill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting study, because it kind of goes against what
almost everybody does in taking care of critically ill people when
their urine output drops," said Dr. Elaine Kamil, clinical director
of pediatric nephrology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and president
of the medical advisory board for the National Kidney Foundation of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Richard Lafayette, an associate professor of medicine and
clinical chief in the division of nephrology at Stanford University,
said the evidence against the use of diuretics is still not strong
enough to warrant a change in medical practice.</TE>
<TE>   Although the research is well done, he said, it can't pinpoint
cause and effect. That would require a clinical trial in which
similar patients are randomly assigned to a group that is given
diuretics and one that is not.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Lay Reform Group, Boston Cardinal Meet</HD>
<DH>Law tells Voice of the Faithful, formed after sexual abuse
scandal, that he has concerns about its motives. But both sides try
to ease tension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholics from the lay reform group Voice of the Faithful met
face-to-face with Cardinal Bernard Law for the first time Tuesday in
an attempt to ease tensions that have simmered for months between the
two sides.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal, leader of the Boston Archdiocese, "squarely told us
he was concerned about who we are and who we aspire to be," said Jim
Post, president of the group.</LD>
<LD>   Four leaders from the group, formed this year by Catholics upset
with the church's failure to rid the clergy of sexually abusive
priests, met privately with the cardinal at the chancery for more
than two hours.</LD>
<TE>   Law twice told the Voice representatives that he wished they had
consulted with him before forming their organization, said Bill
Cadigan, vice president of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw that there are areas that we agree on and others that we
don't," Cadigan said. "We didn't solve all of our problems in this
meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Voice in the Faithful started in a suburban parish this year as
the clerical sex abuse crisis that has plagued the church in 2002
unfolded in Boston. Voice now counts 25,000 members worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The group's critics say Voice of the Faithful is using the abuse
crisis to change church teachings. But Voice leaders say they only
want to help the church become stronger, partly through greater
involvement of the laity.</TE>
<TE>   Law and the group have had a contentious relationship, with the
cardinal refusing to accept its donations and barring new chapters
from meeting on church property. Those were among the topics of
discussion Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Morrissey, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said Law
viewed the meeting as a chance for the group to define its aims and
how it viewed its relationship to the church.</TE>
<TE>   "While the emergence of new groups is a constant in the history of
the church, a proper discernment must always take place to ensure
their compatibility with the faith, discipline and mission of the
church," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey would not detail what was said at the meeting, which she
described as "cordial."</TE>
<TE>   She said Law, who initially refused requests to meet with Voice
leaders, was willing to meet with the group again.</TE>
<TE>   Voice of the Faithful's Compassion Fund has raised about $56,000
and has appealed to Catholics who feel disenfranchised by the sex
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The Voice's funds are earmarked for the same charitable causes
supported by the Cardinal's Appeal, the church's annual fund-raising
drive. However, the Voice fund was set up so no money would go to
archdiocese administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   The group said Law has seemed to view the fund as competition for
his own money-raising efforts. "We reaffirmed we are not in
competition with the Cardinal's Appeal," Post said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Law banned Voice chapters formed after mid-October
from meeting on church property. Voice leaders said Tuesday that the
cardinal said he would keep that directive in force for now.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere Tuesday, the Diocese of Manchester, N.H., announced a
settlement with 62 people who say they were sexually abused by New
Hampshire priests or church workers.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyer Peter Hutchins said the alleged victims settled
for slightly more than $5 million. The church's insurer will provide
$2 million, $900,000 will come from a diocesan fund for unanticipated
expenses and the rest will come from the diocese's savings, church
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement involves accusations against 28 priests, one member
of a religious institute and two lay persons. None of the clergy
remain in active ministry.</TE>

<HD>Osteoporosis Therapy, Drug for Attention Deficit Disorder
OKd</HD>
<DH>Forteo spurs growth of new bone, while Strattera for ADHD
is not a stimulant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. regulators Tuesday approved Eli Lilly and Co.'s new osteoporosis
treatment and its new drug for attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.</LD>
<LD>   Forteo, a once-a-day injection, is the first U.S.-approved
treatment for osteoporosis to stimulate formation of new bone. The
Food and Drug Administration cleared Forteo for treating men and
post-menopausal women who have the bone-thinning disease and a high
risk of fracture.</LD>
<LD>   Later Tuesday, the FDA announced it had cleared Lilly's Strattera,
which the agency said was the first new drug in three decades for
treating the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</LD>
<TE>   Strattera is believed to be a less likely candidate for abuse by
patients than other attention-deficit drugs, because it is the only
FDA-approved treatment for the disorder that is not a stimulant.</TE>
<TE>   It is approved for use by children, adolescents and adults for
control of symptoms of ADHD, a condition that affects about 12
million Americans, including an estimated 8 million adults.</TE>
<TE>   Its symptoms include poor attention and concentration and low
impulse control. Some studies have suggested the disorder can be
inherited. It is estimated that up to 60% of children with ADHD
continue to have symptoms as adults.</TE>
<TE>   Atomoxetine HC1 has not been approved for use by children younger
than age 6. It also is not approved for use with monoamine oxidase
inhibitor, an antidepressant, or in patients with narrow angle
glaucoma.</TE>
<TE>   Forteo is an advance for treating osteoporosis because it works
differently from older drugs that stop or slow bone loss.</TE>
<TE>   Forteo "has the capacity to turn on bone-forming cells ... and to
actually make more bone. That's very appealing in patients with
severe osteoporosis," Dr. Ethel Siris, director of the Toni Stabile
Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, said in an interview. Siris
also is a consultant for Lilly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled. We've been waiting for this," Siris said of
Forteo's approval.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 8 million women and 2 million men in the United
States have osteoporosis, a progressive thinning of the bones that
can increase the risk of spine, wrist and hip fractures.</TE>
<TE>   Forteo, which is known generically as teriparatide, is a fragment
of a natural hormone called the human parathyroid hormone.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly's research showed Forteo increased bone mineral density in
postmenopausal women treated for an average of 19 months. Forteo
reduced the relative risk of spinal fractures by 65% when compared
with a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   Forteo's label will carry a "black box" warning explaining that
animal studies showed an increase in the number of rats developing
osteosarcoma, a rare but serious bone cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "In human studies, no osteosarcomas were reported, but the
possibility that humans treated with [Forteo] may face an increased
risk of developing this cancer cannot be ruled out," the FDA said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Patients also will be told about the issue in a medication guide
to be distributed by pharmacists each time Forteo is dispensed.</TE>

<DL>COOS BAY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>While investigators Tuesday probed the burned out shell of an auto
parts store where three firefighters died, those who survived the
blaze put black mourning bands on their badges and hugged weeping
friends and family.</LD>
<LD>   An impromptu memorial of flowers, balloons and stuffed animals
grew around the firehouse flagpole, which was flying at half staff.</LD>
<LD>   "We're walking in a daze," said firefighter Matt Fare, wiping away
tears for his lost friends. "We're all family."</LD>
<TE>   The deaths Monday afternoon of Lt. Randall E. Carpenter, 46; and
volunteer firefighters Jeffery E. Common, 30, and R. Chuck Hanners,
33, were the first ever for the Coos Bay Fire Department in the line
of duty and marked the worst single loss of firefighters in Oregon,
according to a list kept by the Oregon Firefighters Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge loss for us," said Mayor Joe Benetti. "We just ask
everyone's prayers at this moment."</TE>
<TE>   Fire departments from Portland to Klamath Falls sent crews to
spell the Coos Bay firefighters so they could go off duty to mourn
their friends.</TE>
<TE>   While firefighters talked in small groups in front of the downtown
firehouse, townspeople dropped off mementos, like a sign on the
firehouse which said, "We love you Carp, Jeff, Chuck."</TE>
<TE>   "All three of these people are going to be tremendously missed,"
said Fire Chief Stan Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   Twin investigations led by the State Fire Marshal's Office into
the cause of the fire and Oregon Occupational Safety and Healthy
Administration into the deaths were continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they have no evidence that the fire was
intentionally set.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of Carpenter and Common were found on the mezzanine
after the roof collapsed and Hanners was found at the base of the
stairs leading to the mezzanine, officials said. Hanners died after
being taken to Bay Area Hospital.</TE>

<HD>Police Capture Suspected Killer of Calif. Officer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.</DL>
<LD>A man charged with killing a California police officer last week
surrendered at a New Hampshire hotel Tuesday after a standoff during
which he told a news reporter he shot the officer to protest police
brutality.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew McCrae, 23, walked out of a hotel room after several hours
of negotiations. He is charged in a fugitive warrant with killing
Officer David Mobilio in Red Bluff, Calif., on Nov. 19.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly before he gave up, authorities granted McCrae's request to
talk to a Concord Monitor reporter. Reporter Sarah Vos said the first
thing McCrae told her in a phone conversation was, "I killed a police
officer in Red Bluff, Calif., in an effort to draw attention to
police brutality."</LD>
<TE>   McCrae was ordered held without bail after saying nothing during
his arraignment by video hookup from the Merrimack County Jail. He
had a bandage on his head and a blanket draped over his bare
shoulders during the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Police said there had been a dispute over jail clothing but did
not explain the bandage. Defense attorney Mark Sisti said McCrae had
been injured, but gave no details.</TE>
<TE>   Police indicated they believe McCrae also confessed to the slaying
on a San Francisco news Web site.</TE>
<TE>   In one of two letters posted on the site Monday by a man
identifying himself as McCrae, the writer claims he shot and killed
the officer to protest "police-state tactics" and corporate
irresponsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Mobilio, 31, was shot once in the head as he refueled his cruiser.
He was the first officer killed in the line of duty in Red Bluff, a
city of 13,500 near Sacramento. Hundreds were expected at a memorial
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Scott Murray called the slaying "an ambush, an
execution of a police officer ... to effectuate [McCrae's] political
agenda."</TE>

<HD>FDA Approves 'Microspheres' to Starve Uterine Growths</HD>
<DH>The technique targets fibroids that might otherwise require
extensive surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microscopic spheres that shrink uterine fibroid growths and save
women from more extensive surgery were approved Tuesday by the Food
and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The "microspheres" are used to block blood vessels and, in effect,
starve fibroids, relieving the need to surgically remove the uterine
growths, the FDA said. With no blood supply, the fibroids shrink over
a period of weeks, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Made by Biosphere Medical Inc. of Rockland, Mass., the spheres
will be sold under the brand name Embosphere Microspheres. The
material was approved two years ago for treatment of two other
conditions, the malformation of blood vessels and blood vessel
tumors.</LD>
<TE>   The new use of the microspheres is specifically for treating women
who have troublesome fibroids and who no longer intend to become
pregnant, the FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   Blocking blood flow to treat a medical condition is called
embolization. Such procedures have been used for about 25 years, the
FDA said in a statement, but the Embosphere Microspheres material is
the first approved in the United States specifically for uterine
artery embolization.</TE>
<TE>   Fibroids are benign tumors that form in the uterus, often causing
intense pain, bleeding, cramps and frequent urination. Traditional
treatment has been surgery to remove the fibroids or to remove the
entire uterus.</TE>
<TE>   Only a small incision is required to use the microspheres. The
technique involves inserting a catheter into an artery in the groin
and, using X-rays for guidance, threading its tip to a position
within the blood vessels just upstream from the target fibroids. The
microspheres are then injected through the catheter and into the
blood vessel, where they form a blockage that pinches off the blood
supply.</TE>
<TE>   Clinical studies on 132 women with uterine fibroids showed that
the microspheres reduced bleeding by 50% or more in 65% of the
patients.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said 6% of the women had an allergic reaction to the
microspheres. For 9% of the patients, there was no improvement or
even a worsening of the bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   All the patients reported significant pain for one or two days
after the procedure, and there were four cases where the pain
persisted beyond that period.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA said that patients in the trial were followed for only six
months, so it is not known whether the fibroids will return. The
agency said that Biosphere Medical is to follow patients for at least
three years to answer that question.</TE>
<TE>   Uterine artery embolization techniques have been used extensively
in some other countries, and the FDA said a worldwide search of
medical literature shows there can be serious risks.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said these risks include premature menopause, halting
menstrual periods, pelvic infection, destruction of the uterus,
hysterectomy, pregnancy complications and delayed diagnosis of
uterine cancer that would have been discovered with traditional
fibroid surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 25,000 to 30,000 uterine artery embolization procedures
performed worldwide, the agency said, there have been four reported
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed annually in
the U.S. are for treatment of fibroids, the FDA said.</TE>

<LD>The Arizona Supreme Court on Tuesday denied an injunction request by
dog and horse track owners, opening the way for Gov. Jane Dee Hull to
immediately sign casino agreements with Native American tribes.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third time in three days that the tracks petitioned a
state court for a stay preventing the implementation of Proposition
202, a measure to expand gambling on tribal lands that was approved
by voters Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing oral arguments Tuesday, Supreme Court Justice
Michael Ryan quickly denied the request without comment.</LD>
<TE>   "We're pleased now that three courts have rebuffed the racetracks'
efforts to prevent the signing of compacts," said Scott Bales, a
private attorney representing the state.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 202, the number of slot machines will be
increased, and casinos can add Las Vegas-style, house-banked
blackjack, a game which was not allowed previously.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the tribes will give the state up to 8% of revenue,
depending on how much the tribes take in.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the state gets no money from the 22 casinos run by 15
tribes in Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Peanut Butter May Help Fight Type 2 Diabetes</HD>
<DH>At least a tablespoon five times a week makes onset of the
disease less likely, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Eating nuts or peanut butter may help ward off diabetes, according to
a study of more than 83,000 nurses being published today.</LD>
<LD>   Women who reported eating the equivalent of a handful of nuts or
one tablespoon of peanut butter at least five times a week were more
than 20% less likely to develop adult-onset, or Type 2, diabetes than
those who rarely or never ate those products.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers from Harvard University's School of Public Health
analyzed data on 83,818 women ages 34 to 59 who were followed for up
to 16 years. Researchers said the findings would probably apply to
men.</LD>
<TE>   The findings appear in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Nuts in the past have been considered as an unhealthy food
because of the high-fat content," said Harvard researcher Dr. Frank
Hu. "Conventional wisdom says that high-fat foods will increase
obesity and Type 2 diabetes."</TE>
<TE>   Research in the past decade has shown nuts contain good kinds of
fat as well as other nutrients that can help keep cholesterol at
healthy levels. They also contain fiber and magnesium, which help
maintain balanced insulin and glucose levels. Insulin helps the body
convert sugar into energy. Diabetes happens when the body cannot
produce or properly use insulin.</TE>
<TE>   During the government-funded study, 3,206 women developed
diabetes. Researchers did not determine what kinds of nuts women were
eating.</TE>
<TE>   Nuts and peanut butter -- peanuts are classified as legumes but
have many of the same qualities as nuts -- are among foods sometimes
recommended for diabetics, who are prone to cardiovascular disease.</TE>
<TE>   Some brands of peanut butter, however, may contain high amounts of
sugar or fatty preservatives, so people are advised to check the
label, said Martha Funnell, head of health care and education for the
American Diabetes Assn. and a University of Michigan diabetes
educator.</TE>

<HD>FAA Warns of Overheating Fuel Pumps</HD>
<DH>About 3,500 Boeing jetliners must fly with extra fuel to
prevent possible explosions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration is requiring about 3,500 Boeing
jetliners to fly with extra fuel to prevent fuel pumps from
overheating and possibly causing an explosion.</LD>
<LD>   The FAA has sent airlines three safety warnings about the problem
since August. The latest was issued last weekend after pumps in three
planes overheated, the FAA said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The warning is intended as a precaution while the FAA figures out
what's causing the problem with the pumps, made by Hydro-Aire Inc. of
Burbank.</LD>
<TE>   No serious problems have been linked to the problem. But if a pump
overheats, the right mixture of temperature, oxygen and fuel can
cause an explosion, said James McKenna of Aviation Maintenance
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto said the extra fuel eliminates the
possibility of an explosion. "There's no danger of [the pumps]
igniting fuel vapors if they're covered," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The warning will remain in effect until the agency determines the
cause, Takemoto said.</TE>
<TE>   The order affects about 1,400 planes -- 737s, 747s and 757s flown
by U.S. carriers. The FAA is also sending the advisories to its
counterpart agencies overseas, covering an additional 2,100
jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that an explosion
in the fuel tank of TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747, caused it to crash
off Long Island in 1996, killing 230 people.</TE>
<TE>   Vapors in the partly empty tank probably were ignited by a spark
in the wiring, the safety board said.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the FAA ordered airlines to submerge certain Hydro-Aire
pumps with fuel or, if not, to X-ray them to make sure they were
properly wired. If they weren't, they had to be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Major U.S. carriers said they had few planes in which the suspect
pumps were installed.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the FAA found the problem potentially included every
Hydro-Aire pump and ordered all fuel pumps submerged or X-rayed and
replaced if faulty.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last week, Boeing Co. received reports of overheating in
fuel pumps that had been replaced on a Singapore Airlines 747 and on
a Lufthansa 747. The overheating wasn't caused by faulty wiring,
Boeing spokeswoman Cindy Wall said.</TE>
<TE>   A pump on a third plane had been removed and was found to have
overheated during an inspection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's baffling," she said. "They've been working nonstop 24 hours
a day trying to fix it."</TE>

<HD>Another Section Added to Space Station</HD>
<DH>Cranes, elbow grease used to attach a $390-million girder.
'Life is good,' astronaut says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Astronauts used cranes to attach another expensive piece of
latticework to the international space station Tuesday, and then a
team of spacewalkers went out and wired it up.</LD>
<LD>   "Yee-haw!" John Herrington shouted as he hopped onto the
$390-million girder. "Life is good."</LD>
<LD>   Herrington -- the first Native American in space -- and his
spacewalking partner, Michael Lopez-Alegria, installed clamps,
removed locks and connected electrical cables between the new segment
and the rest of the space station.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first of three spacewalks planned this week to install
the girder that was delivered aboard the space shuttle Endeavour.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy lifting was accomplished with the help of two robot
arms, one on the docked shuttle and an even bigger one on the
station. The crews used the cranes to hoist the 14-ton girder from
the shuttle's payload bay and position it on the space station.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a happy control room down here," Mission Control
radioed.</TE>
<TE>   Once the girder was securely linked to two others on the space
station, shuttle crewmen Herrington and Lopez-Alegria went outside.</TE>
<TE>   The spacewalkers teased each other as they worked 250 miles up.
Lopez-Alegria wanted to take a picture of Herrington and told him,
"Why don't you do some work so your family won't think you're goofing
off up here on vacation?"</TE>
<TE>   By the time their seven-hour spacewalk ended, the astronauts had
gotten everything done, even though they had to struggle at times
with tangled tethers, snarled cables and sticky pins. "We appreciate
your hard work," Mission Control said.</TE>
<TE>   The girder, a thick aluminum beam crammed with wiring and loaded
with the rail cart and radiators, increased the mass of the entire
space station to almost 200 tons.</TE>
<TE>   With the latest 45-foot addition, the space station's framework
stretched 134 feet. By the time eight additional girders are
connected over the coming year, the backbone of the orbiting outpost
will exceed the length of a football field and support giant solar
wings.</TE>
<TE>   Herrington, a 44-year-old Navy commander and space rookie, is a
member of the Chickasaw Nation. Lopez-Alegria, a 44-year-old Navy
captain and veteran astronaut, was born in Spain but moved to the
United States as a toddler.</TE>

<HD>SUV Attacks May Be Eco-Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>More than 30 gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles have been vandalized
in the Richmond area over the last few months, many with an acid-like
chemical, and authorities are investigating whether a radical
environmental group is responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Police and the FBI want to know whether the attacks are the work
of the Earth Liberation Front, an international underground
organization that uses economic sabotage.</LD>
<LD>   Although the culprits left behind notes saying the vandalism was
the work of the ELF, Sgt. Tom Shumate, spokesman for the Henrico
County police, said authorities have not definitively linked the
group to the vandalism.</LD>
<TE>   The ELF did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on the vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five SUVs were damaged at a car dealership in late
September. "Vandals put some type of glass-etching spray on the
windows, an acid-type chemical that tints the glass where you can't
see through it," Shumate said.</TE>
<TE>   The same type of chemical was used to etch "ELF" into the
plate-glass windows at three fast-food restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   In early October, vandals again struck two SUVs. It appeared one
was hacked with a hatchet, and the other was smashed with a sharp
object, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Vandals also have slashed tires on SUVs, the most recent attack
coming Nov. 16, when five vehicles were damaged. There was also a
spate of SUV tire slashings in July in the city's fashionable Fan
District.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Barry, spokesman for the FBI in Richmond, declined to say
Tuesday what the investigation has found.</TE>
<TE>   ELF and its companion group, the Animal Liberation Front, are
responsible for more than 600 cases of eco-terrorism around the
country, ranging from spray-painting buildings and breaking windows
to firebombing fur farms and research centers, according to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The groups have caused an estimated $43 million in damage, the FBI
said. The most destructive attack was a $12-million blaze at a Vail,
Colo., ski resort in 1998, for which the ELF claimed responsibility.</TE>

<HD>105 Shouldn't Have Received U.S. Visas, Inquiry Finds</HD>
<DH>Their names were on government lists of suspected
terrorists. An official says only two made it into the country,
however, and have left without incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Visas were issued to 105 foreign men who should have been prevented
from entering the United States because their names appeared on
government lists of suspected terrorists, congressional investigators
have found.</LD>
<LD>   The visas have been revoked by the State Department. A federal law
enforcement official, speaking Tuesday on condition of anonymity,
said the revocation prevented 100 of the men from entering the United
States, while three others were turned away at the U.S. border. Two
made it into the country but have since left without incident, the
official said.</LD>
<LD>   Officially, the Justice Department said it was reviewing the
matter "to verify the status of each of the visas in question."</LD>
<TE>   Under a security system called "Visas Condor" that was created in
November 2001, State Department applications for visas to enter the
United States from certain national groups were to be checked against
possible terrorist names in FBI and CIA databases. Men in these
groups aged 16 to 45 were required to wait up to 30 days for the
check before a visa could be issued.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Government Accounting Office found that until
recently the name-check system did not work properly because
responsibility for it shifted among the Justice Department and FBI,
the CIA, the State Department and the multi-agency Foreign Terrorist
Tracking Task Force formed by President Bush in October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Few names initially forwarded by the State Department, known as
"cables," were checked by either the CIA or FBI, congressional
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   By April 2002, when the terrorism task force assumed control of
the system, the FBI had a backlog of 8,000 unchecked names from the
State Department. Of the 38,000 Condor applications subsequently
processed through Aug. 1, 2002, about 280 names turned up on the
anti-terrorism lists.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department was given a refusal recommendation for 200
visa applicants, but that came after the 30-day hold had expired --
meaning that the visas had already been issued. Because of misspelled
or duplicate names, GAO officials now believe these visas were
actually issued to 105 men whose names appear on the anti-terrorism
lists.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, U.S. officials say the refusal recommendation was
made simply because there wasn't enough information available about
the applicant. But it remains possible that some of the men had real
terrorist connections.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the information about the situation was made public last
month in a GAO report addressing broader visa questions, but it was
largely overlooked. The Chicago Tribune reported on the matter in
Tuesday's editions.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials had no comment, but in a response to
the GAO report, a senior official said the FBI and the terrorism task
force have taken steps to eliminate the backlog of names and work
more closely with the State Department on streamlining the process.</TE>
<TE>   Under another change that was made in September, the FBI has the
initial authority to check the names, then sends those with a
possible match to the State Department, which has the CIA perform
another screening for terrorist connections.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that our handling of Condor cables will remain
responsive and timely, without sacrificing security," wrote Robert
Diegelman, acting assistant attorney general for administration.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials hope to reduce review time for the
Condor applications for those with no FBI records to 10 days or
fewer.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets Death in Massacre</HD>
<DH>Defendant sentenced for murders of two of five employees
slain at a Wendy's in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The man behind a robbery-massacre at a Wendy's restaurant was
sentenced to death Tuesday, more than two years after he and an
accomplice herded seven employees into a freezer and murdered five of
them.</LD>
<LD>   John Taylor, 38, stood stone-faced as the jury's decision was read
while the victims' families wept quietly in the courtroom. He was
sentenced to die by injection for killing two of the employees, but
prosecutors say he plotted the attack and commanded his mentally
retarded accomplice to kill.</LD>
<LD>   The robbery netted about $2,400, mostly in coins.</LD>
<TE>   A day earlier, Taylor apologized, reciting his victims' names
before expressing remorse.</TE>
<TE>   "I've shamed my family and shamed my children," he said. "I know
you cannot forgive me. I don't expect you to. I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor joins five other men on New York's death row. The state,
which last executed an inmate in 1963, reinstated the death penalty
in 1995. Taylor's sentence was automatically appealed.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Taylor and Craig Godineaux were eating
in the Queens restaurant when Taylor, a former employee, approached
manager Jean Auguste and the two went to the basement. Auguste then
called the employees downstairs and Godineaux followed.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquoine Johnson, 20, one of the two survivors, said he got
downstairs and saw Taylor, standing with a gun and telling everyone
to lie on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Godineaux bound and gagged everyone, and Taylor ordered them into
the freezer. Godineaux pulled bags over their heads and the massacre
began.</TE>
<TE>   Godineaux, 32, pleaded guilty last year to shooting five of the
victims, three fatally. He was ineligible for the death penalty
because he is retarded, and he instead received five life sentences.</TE>
