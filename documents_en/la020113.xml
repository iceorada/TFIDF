<HD>The Other Mark Twain</HD>
<DH>In a documentary on PBS, Ken Burns looks beyond the humor
and finds a tormented side to Samuel Langhorne Clemens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"He was considered the funniest man on Earth--a brilliant performer
on the lecture circuit who could entertain almost any audience--and a
spectacularly inept businessman whose countless schemes to get rich
quick threatened again and again to bring him to ruin."</LD>
<LD>   This inviting phrase commences Ken Burns' new two-part, four-hour
documentary "Mark Twain," which airs Monday and Tuesday on PBS.
Burns' documentary offers a portrait of the complex man born Samuel
Langhorne Clemens but known the world over as Mark Twain, the author
of such landmarks as "Tom Sawyer," "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" and "The Prince and the Pauper." Twain was not above causing
controversy in his day, criticizing organized religion and politics.
And he drew the ire of many when he decided to explore race relations
in "Huckleberry Finn."</LD>
<LD>   "Mark Twain" is also an exploration of heartache. Though Mark
Twain's writing is full of humor, Clemens' life was full of tragedy.
At one point, he even contemplated suicide. Though Clemens and his
wife built a big, beautiful mansion in Hartford, Conn., he nearly
lost everything in bad investments. He had to tour the lecture
circuit to get himself out of debt. A devoted family man, he lost
three of four children and his beloved wife.</LD>
<TE>   Narrated by Keith David, "Mark Twain" features the voice of Kevin
Conway as the author. Among those interviewed in the documentary are
Russell Banks, Dick Gregory, Hal Holbrook--who has performed the
one-man show "Mark Twain Tonight" for more than 50 years--Chuck
Jones, Arthur Miller and William Styron.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, 48, has been making documentaries about America for 20
years, including "Brooklyn Bridge," "Thomas Jefferson" and "Frank
Lloyd Wright." He's best known, though, for "The Civil War,"
"Baseball" and "Jazz."</TE>
<TE>   The award-winning filmmaker recently discussed "Mark Twain."</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is this the first time you have ever done a documentary
on a writer?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes. We dealt with text with Jefferson, but not to the
extent we have done here. I must say I am as proud of this film as
anything I have ever done just because it is really a dual biography,
if you think about it. It is about the rise and rise of Mark Twain
and the rise and fall of Sam Clemens. Who knew there was such a
dramatic roller coaster of a private life to sort of contrast the
funny guy that Twain really is and the great writer he is?</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you know a lot about Clemens' personal life before you
began this documentary?</TE>
<TE>   A: A little bit. That's what I like about these projects. They are
processes of discovery, so instead of telling you what I know, I
share with you what I discovered. It is a big difference. I think the
two biggest surprises were just how dark Sam Clemens' life was and
how great a writer Twain is. You know, they don't give Oscars to
comedies; they think they are not worthy of them. And in so many ways
our full appreciation of Twain is always checked by the first
awareness that he is a humorist. So we get stuck on "Tom Sawyer" and
some funny lines that we like. But if you are as old as I am, you
remember when "Letters From the Earth" came out in the '60s, and you
saw kind of a radical, angry, bitter side [to Twain].</TE>
<TE>   But you forget that he is the beginning, as Ernest Hemingway said,
of all American literature. He was willing to confront race before
anyone else was, to put a human face on an African American for the
first time in all of literature and to then confront, with
unbelievably great writing, every aspect of human behavior. At the
same time, he's utterly American, and he travels well. He's
universal. Czars and kaisers loved him and so did ordinary people. He
touched something universal about human nature.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, for me--who is curious about how my country ticks, who
is interested in the nature of American creativity and American
identity and has had race as a sub-theme running through many of my
films--Mark Twain is heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It seemed, though, at the end of his life that he allowed Mark
Twain to completely overshadow Sam Clemens.</TE>
<TE>   A: He had to, because being Sam Clemens was so lonely and painful.
Can you imagine? I am the father of two daughters. Can you imagine
losing three of your four kids, your wife and your beloved
father-in-law, your own father and three siblings?</TE>
<TE>   Q: With his suicide attempt and his mood swings, it sounds like
Clemens could have been a manic-depressive.</TE>
<TE>   A: I was talking to William Styron and Arthur Miller about it, and
they [think so]. You can't make a diagnosis from 150 years away, but
he had to have been. So many creative people have that
manic-depressive streak.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It must have been amazing to film at Clemens' house in
Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   A: It was so great. I have been to a lot of different historical
sites. This is the house where the ghost of its owner is there. You
feel his presence, in a way. They have done a great job in Hartford
of restoring it. So you just go in there and say, "Oh, my god, he's
here." You expect when you walk up the stairs to see him moving from
one room to another.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Twain" airs Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KCET and KVCR.
The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<HD>Roots in India, Lives in America</HD>
<DH>VINE OF DESIRE: A Novel, By Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni,
Doubleday: 320 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE CIABATTARI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In four books of poetry, two collections of stories and her novels,
Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni has explored the experience of
contemporary Indian women, mostly immigrants to America adjusting to
life in the New World. Like the characters in the Mahabharata, the
ancient Sanskrit epic poem that is one of the pillars of Hindu
culture, her characters have clear-cut human failings and
virtues--and they pay in the end for actions they take.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Vine of Desire," a sequel to the magical "Sister of My
Heart," she continues the story of Sudha and Anju, cousins born in
Calcutta hours apart on the day their mothers learn that the babies'
fathers have died. The two, raised together by their mothers and a
widowed aunt, are inseparable until they are 18 and each enters an
arranged marriage.</LD>
<LD>   "Sister of My Heart" was set in India, where the two girls, who
are so close they can finish each other's thoughts, learn from their
elders that each person is allotted a certain amount of good fortune
at birth--and that people with too much beauty may suffer in other
parts of their lives.</LD>
<TE>   Sudha, who is beautiful, the better cook and embroiderer, and
Anju, who is intellectually curious and adventuresome, follow the
path toward what traditional Indian society defines as
happiness--marriage and motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   But "The Vine of Desire" shows the way is bumpy. The seed of
discord is planted in their double wedding ceremony--Sudha marrying a
man from a socially desirable family and Anju marrying a computer
executive, Sunil, who has an eye for Sudha.</TE>
<TE>   Anju moves to the United States and Sudha stays behind. When Sudha
becomes pregnant, her mother-in-law insists she have an abortion
after a sonogram shows the child is not a son.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to sacrifice her daughter, Sudha risks scandal, leaves
her husband and returns to her childhood home in Calcutta. Meanwhile,
Anju becomes pregnant too but suffers a miscarriage.</TE>
<TE>   Disregarding her husband's misgivings, Anju invites Sudha and her
baby daughter, Dayita, to live with them in the San Francisco Bay
Area. Sudha settles into a housewifely routine, caring for Dayita,
cleaning and cooking, filling the apartment with the spicy fragrance
of garam masala.</TE>
<TE>   Anju regains her strength and returns to college. Sunil commutes
to his job, where he uses the strange new language of Silicon
Valley--"customer interface," "product development," "new virus
alert."</TE>
<TE>   Together, Anju and Sudha experience the jarring encounter with
American life. Anju joins a women's writing group, realizing that
"large chunks of herself will always be unintelligible to them: the
joint-family she grew up in, her arranged marriage, the way she fell
in love with her husband, the tension in her household, that menage a
trois, Indian style."</TE>
<TE>   Sudha, clad in the traditional sari, takes her daughter to the
playground and finds herself envying a new acquaintance, Sara, an
Indian woman in cutoffs and T-shirt who hitchhikes up and down the
coast and makes her own living. Meanwhile, Sunil feels left out--and
again tempted by Sudha's beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, just before Anju and I got married," Sudha muses, "I
was so sad to think that we'd be separated, that I wished we could
love the same man, like women did in the Mahabharata, that we could
all live together...."</TE>
<TE>   When Sunil acts upon his feelings, betrayal divides the two
"sisters." Sudha takes her daughter and leaves to find her first job,
nursing an elderly Indian man who has had a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Anju and Sunil separate, and he takes a job in Houston. Anju
nurtures her talent for writing; her writers' group has told her she
owes it to herself.</TE>
<TE>   For Sudha, the American emphasis on "living for yourself"--instead
of for parents, ancestors, in-laws, children, teachers, society,
God--leaves a terrible emptiness. "Yet I know I can't go back to the
old way, living for others," she says. Independently, she and Anju
search for a compromise between the old ties and the new freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Divakaruni is gifted with dramatic inventiveness, lyrical sensual
language, the ability to interweave many points of view with ease.
(In her world, all of the characters and some inanimate
beings--including the shifting fog that rises from the Pacific before
dawn--come alive.) But she tends toward excess. A rigorous editor
could have pruned some of the overwrought language in this novel and
saved her, for instance, from the head-spinning metaphorical mix in a
single paragraph in the book's prologue, when Anju is suffering the
miscarriage. "He clung to the wet-silk walls of her womb. They
rippled like the muscles of an angry snake.... He curled himself
inward, tight as a peach pit...."</TE>
<TE>   Divakaruni has tendencies like Anju's, whose writing professor
notes on one of her assignments: "You tend to mix your metaphors
unnecessarily and sometimes use too many...."</TE>
<TE>   The sections of the book connected with India seem better
integrated than those drawn from the New World, with its drive-by
shootings and 24-hour news channels, which are more fragmented, less
suited to mythic narrative. And Divakaruni, who spent her first 19
years in India, doesn't always get the proportions right. (At one
point Anju wonders if the help she is giving her cousin by bringing
her to America is a "Schindlerism," one of the hallmark deeds
portrayed in the film "Schindler's List." The reference is so
overblown as to make her seem inflated, which is not in character.)</TE>

<TE>   in World War II, By Eric L. Muller, University of Chicago Press:
230 pp., $27.50</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 2, 1945, an armada of almost 260 Allied warships lay at
anchor in Tokyo Bay. Aboard the battleship Missouri, Allied generals
and admirals, including Douglas MacArthur, William F. "Bull" Halsey
and Chester W. Nimitz, who had led American forces to victory in the
Pacific, awaited Japanese officials who were to sign the surrender
documents. It had been a war fought under a simple dictum suggested
by Halsey as he assumed command: "Kill Japs. Kill Japs. Kill more
Japs." Just ashore, the capital city of Japan lay in charred ruins,
as thoroughly gutted as Japan's imperial ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony itself was heavy with the victor's symbolism. Behind
the triumphant Allied command stood the skeletal figures of American
Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, who had surrendered the fortress island of
Corregidor in the Philippines, and British Gen. Arthur E. Percival,
who had surrendered the "impregnable" island fortress of Singapore as
the war began. Both had just been released from Japanese prison
camps. With a superb eye for the telling detail, Robert Smith
Thompson points out in "Empires on the Pacific" a final small
humiliation for the Japanese: Above them fluttered the old
"thirty-one starred American flag that had flown over the flagship of
Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry," the American who "opened" feudal
Japan to the West in 1853.</TE>
<TE>   Not so long after war's end, Tom Noda arrived in occupied Tokyo
and found work as a Japanese interpreter for U.S. Army court-martial
proceedings. There was irony in this. As Eric L. Muller tells us in
his fascinating "Free to Die for Their Country," Noda had been
through a grim wartime odyssey known to few Americans. A Nisei, or
second-generation Japanese American, he watched his family's ranch go
to a white farmer for a penny on the dollar as West Coast Japanese
Americans prepared for internment during a wartime panic. A teenage
citizen, he soon found himself behind barbed wire, guarded by
soldiers at a "relocation center" in Wyoming, one of 10 internment
camps for Japanese Americans in the West. Later, he dutifully
followed his despairing father, who had requested repatriation to
Japan, to a camp meant to segregate "troublemakers" where, rights and
property gone, he was drafted into the U.S. Army.</TE>
<TE>   Though many Americans know of the bravery of the all-Nisei 442nd
Regimental Combat Team, the Army's most highly decorated unit, next
to none know of the grit of Noda and other young Japanese Americans
who refused to fight for a government that unjustly imprisoned them
and their families. He joined hundreds of Nisei resisters who were
brought to mass trials in Western states and regularly sentenced to
long prison terms. Uniquely in his trial, though, a California judge
found the indictments "shocking to his conscience" and freed "the
American born Japs," as the local paper termed them, to be returned
to their barbed wire camps. ("As courtroom victories go," Muller
comments, "this was a decidedly Pyrrhic one.")</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Noda was among the 20,000 Japanese Americans in those
camps who, with Japan's defeat already inevitable, despairingly or
defiantly requested expatriation or repatriation; and one of 5,000
actually sent to Japan after the war, though he later regained his
U.S. citizenship. Noda and his compatriots were but a few overlooked
casualties among millions of lives destroyed in what Thompson terms
"the struggle for the mastery of Asia."</TE>
<TE>   That struggle was in progress less than a century before Noda's
arrival in Tokyo Bay when Perry's modest four-ship flotilla, backed
by a rising continental power, first appeared off Japan. Perry came
offering trade and threatening war. In the nearly century-long
exchange of goods and blood that followed, oppressive European
empires--Russian, Dutch, French and British--crumbled, Japan's brutal
"Co-Prosperity Sphere" peaked and collapsed, and the Pacific was
transformed into an "American lake."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Perry had already dreamed as much. Pointing to America's
triumph in the Mexican war, he warned his Japanese counterparts,
"Circumstances may lead your country into a similar plight." The
Japanese hardly needed to look to distant Mexico. Only a few years
earlier, the Western powers led by Great Britain had fought their way
into China, turned its great coastal cities into foreign-controlled
"treaty ports" and established the inviolability of Westerners from
Chinese courts. The Japanese took the hint and "opened" their land.
On Perry's return, Thompson tells us, "the press likened him to
Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Captain Cook." And why not? He was an
apt symbol of expansive American dreams that would barely outrace
reality.</TE>
<TE>   By placing the United States among the jostling "empires" of its
title, "Empires on the Pacific" boldly sets out to explain how we
came to be the only superpower on this planet. Thompson brings much
recent scholarly work on Asia and empire into the popular realm. His
goal is to shatter "the most enduring myth" of America's great war in
the Pacific, "that of undiluted American idealism." His America
enters the war weighed down with the territorial baggage of a young
empire--Alaska and Midway, Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines
(America's own pre-war "Raj")--and with an imperial, if home-grown,
mind-set. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, according to Thompson,
was intent on ensuring that the United States would succeed Britain
and foil Japan as the ultimate arbiter in Asia, and he would prove
ready at Yalta to trade off spheres of influence with Russian
dictator Joseph Stalin: the Far East for an East European empire.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific in this account was the place where the greatest of
Great Games has never stopped being played, where from the Nanjing
massacre and the Bataan Death March to Hiroshima, the struggle for
mastery plunged the world into abysmal depths of slaughter and
destruction. Thompson's point is that, whatever its stated ideals,
the United States played with the best of them.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans believe that the Pacific theater during World War
II opened with Pearl Harbor. Not so, Thompson insists; from an Asian
perspective, it began when Japan's invasion of China in the 1930s
turned into the century's first Vietnam. Bogged down on the Asian
mainland and pressed by Americans, the Japanese proved unwilling to
withdraw, leaving "only one choice: preemptive attack." Thompson
refocuses the imperial struggle in the Pacific on China, a vast
disintegrating empire that proved strangely resistant to any imperial
vision of Asia--British, Japanese, Soviet or American. Whether ruled
by warlords, a radical communist regime or a communist bureaucracy in
a burgeoning capitalist state, China has been remarkably
unaccommodating to superpowers of any sort, a crucial point of
Thompson's that is still to be fully absorbed by American leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Thompson's book, which begins so promisingly as a
vivid history of Pacific empires, founders on the shoals of the war
itself. The American victory in the Pacific turns into a dutiful,
slug-'em-out military history of generals and leaders. ("Halsey then
went north.... ") Sadly, given recent scholarly work, Japanese lives
and viewpoints are largely missing and the "natives" whom the
Europeans colonized, the Japanese "liberated" into another kind of
bondage and we then "protected" from communism, are nowhere to be
found.</TE>
<TE>   If Thompson nonetheless offers a more realistic historical
framework for understanding the world's future superpower, Muller and
Greg Robinson suggest new ways of grasping how the clash of Pacific
empires played out at home. Muller moves the history of racial
suffering and resistance into new territory in his tale of how a
minority of internally exiled Nisei dealt with a world in which a
Hearst columnist could write of Japanese Americans, "herd 'em up,
pack 'em off and give 'em the inside room in the badlands. Let 'em be
pinched, hurt, hungry and dead up against it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet like most multicultural histories focused on the powerless,
Muller's doesn't explore power itself. In "By Order of the
President," Robinson focuses not on the internees but on the
president who signed Executive Order 9066 that put them in internment
camps. If internment is now seen as a blot on the Roosevelt era, the
president himself has generally been viewed as above the fray.
Robinson's judicious exploration of the record shows that Roosevelt
was, in fact, deeply involved, his racial attitudes helping to
determine the fates of nearly 120,000 Japanese American internees.</TE>
<TE>   Despite early friendships with elite Japanese students at Harvard,
FDR came to believe that Japanese immigrants were dangerously
unassimilable and, in Robinson's summary of his views, "should be
excluded on racial grounds, from equal citizenship and property
rights with whites." He also came to accept Japan as an imperial foe
and the Japanese American community as a potential source of fifth
columnists. These were commonplace views at the time. Not
surprisingly, when faced with a nasty stew of rumor, innuendo and
misinformation in early 1942 (despite the fact that not a single act
of sabotage had been committed by a Japanese American), the president
was well primed to exhibit what Robinson calls a "deadly
indifference" and "astounding casualness" in the name of pragmatism
and national security, while signing an order violating "all the
democratic principles he so eloquently espoused."</TE>
<TE>   Today, when Arab immigrants languish in detention, military
tribunals loom and, in the name of national security, precious rights
are thrown aside no less casually than under Roosevelt's signed Order
9066, these studies of a long-gone war hold an eerie resonance.
Robinson's book reminds us that panicky acts in a national crisis
that sacrifice rights for which we claim to fight emerge not just
from immediate insecurity but from deeper prejudices and fears.
Muller's tales of resistance to injustice remind us that pragmatic
acts in the present may look like cruel and shameful agendas tomorrow
and that democracy, however loudly hymned, is hardly the unalloyed
experience of Americans in tough times. Thompson's sobering work
suggests that in our world, acts of national altruism and goodness
often take second place to the imperial urge to mastery.</TE>

<DH>SOME WINE FOR REMEMBRANCE: A Novel, By Edmund Keeley, White
Pine Press: 216 pp., $15</DH>

<LD>Wartime ghosts are hard to exorcise, and those from Greece have a
peculiar and disturbing persistence, their smell of blood barely
camouflaged by thyme and oregano or dried out by sunlight beating on
bare rock. The German occupation of 1941-44 was murderous, its
opponents as likely to fight each other as the enemy. Reprisals were
taken, villages burned to the ground, mass executions ordered and
carried out. Who killed or betrayed whom, and why, became anyone's
guess, and food for endless self-exculpatory post-war myths.
Occupation is never a simple business. Official and personal motives
become inextricably intertwined. Survival means compromise of a kind
that in retrospect, all danger past, can embarrass, not least when,
as in Greece, bitter guerrilla rivalry was followed soon after the
peace by an even more bitter civil war.</LD>
<LD>   Few non-Greeks know this scarily ambiguous period better than
Edmund Keeley. A scholar and novelist, he has spent a lifetime
interpreting the endless elusive facets of modern Hellenic
civilization. His translations of, and critical works on, such Greek
poets as Constantine Cavafy, Angelos Sikelianos, Ritsos, Odysseas
Elytis and George Seferis are justly famous.</LD>
<TE>   Keeley is also a shrewd observer of the modern Greek social and
political scene (see his "The Salonika Bay Murder: Cold War Politics
and the Polk Affair"), and his fiction (six previous novels, most
recently "School for Pagan Lovers") explores that fascinating no
man's land where Greek and foreigner meet and interact, with Eros
always lurking in the background to confuse national mores.</TE>
<TE>   "Some Wine for Remembrance" (the title comes from a haunting 1943
poem, "Amorgos," by surrealist poet Nikos Gatsos) is set in
German-occupied northern Greece, near Thessaloniki, and is based on
World War II incidents. Keeley assures us that all his characters are
"of course fictional," but this isn't strictly true. The notorious
Sgt. Fritz Schubert, a sadistic killer who makes the arrogant mistake
of returning to Greece as a post-war tourist and is arrested and
executed, is only too real and a classic example of the "that was
then, this is now" morality. Above all, there is the mysterious but
to me unmistakable villain who, always offstage, like Captain Flint
in "Treasure Island," lurks at the heart of Keeley's novel.</TE>
<TE>   This unpleasant and powerful figure, never present (except in a
couple of creepy scenes), and carefully never even named, remains a
constant brooding obsession for every character throughout. He has a
long nose, large ears and a disdainful, arrogant manner. During the
Greek occupation, he served as a Wehrmacht intelligence officer. His
initial on documents is compared to a Greek omega, which bears some
resemblance to a "W." After the war, he rises to high political
office in his native Austria. Keeley acknowledges a couple of books
he used for research that identify this person, referred to as "the
Big O" by those seeking to prove his participation in wartime
atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Thus what Keeley is attempting in "Some Wine for Remembrance" is
that currently fashionable exercise, promoted most notably by Simon
Schama, the illumination of fact through fiction. The main drawback
of this genre is that though the fiction may profitably fill gaps in
the factual record, it can't rewrite, much less anticipate, the known
course of history. The trouble with the Big O, of course, is that his
likeliest model is still very much at large and a respected senior
statesman in his own country. As a result the investigation Keeley
depicts so brilliantly, with a wealth of persuasive detail and subtly
nuanced insights, lacks tension because we know that, ultimately, the
pursuers can't get their man. As a result the denouement is both
psychologically improbable and something of an anticlimax.</TE>
<TE>   This, though, is my only criticism of a narrative that in all
other respects is the best fiction Keeley has ever written. The two
main hunters--Wittekind, a reformed Austrian ex-Nazi who may or may
not be a count, and his initially reluctant agent Jackson Ripaldo, an
Italian American journalist with Greek connections--make a
wonderfully convincing odd couple of an investigative team. You may
not be able to find the village of Hortiati on a map of northern
Greece, but the fictional massacre and arson that Keeley assigns to
German troops there in September 1944 have all-too-authentic
parallels. The scenes in Vienna and Salzburg also carry instant
conviction. The sense of a dossier is neatly created by a series of
first-person depositions, sometimes conflicting, sometimes
complementary, through which Ripaldo labors to establish what really
happened at Hortiati, who did what and why. As in life, some details
are clarified, but the overall picture remains elusive. So does the
Big O.</TE>
<TE>   It is the depositions that give "Some Wine for Remembrance" its
vividness and dramatic force. Each voice, each personality, is
sharply differentiated: Vassilis Angeloudis, cafe-owner and
professional survivor; his wife, Marina, with her secret and
emotionally volcanic past involving a German soldier; the carefully
self-exculpatory potential deserter Oberleutnant Wolfgang Hertzel;
the retired ultra-rightist officer Max Ebert. There are also the
wartime diary of the sweet-hearted medical orderly Martin Schonbrun,
who may or may not have died at the hands of partisans, and the
evidence offered by Schonbrunn's morally disconcerting Viennese
girlfriend, Lotte Kistner.</TE>
<TE>   Their cumulative testimony builds up a kaleidoscope of hopes,
fears, lies, self-deceptions, passionate emotions, vileness and
decency, public gestures and private beliefs, all intermingled. This,
surely, is how it was: Keeley has achieved an extraordinary dramatic
retrieval. In the end, it's his microcosm of flawed and suffering
humanity, Greek and German both, that stays with us. The Big O
becomes secondary in importance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Some Wine for Remembrance'</TE>
<TE>   ``One old-timer finally warned Ripaldo that he wasn't likely to
get the whole truth out of anybody who had survived the World War or
the Civil War .... Those on the left will tell you that what happened
to the village was all the result of rightist collaborators who had
... set up the whole thing in order to raid the village for booty and
rid the place of what they considered communist sympathizers. Those
on the right will tell you that it was the local communist
sympathizers who had done in the village ... So where was the truth?
The only truth, the old-timer said, anyway the only truth Ripaldo
might find both the left and the right agreeing on, was that the
German medical team and their Greek escort who'd been ambushed at the
aqueduct had to be counted among the innocent. But, he added, don't
say I said so.''</TE>

<DH>ALEX SOOJUNG-KIM PANGTHE FUTURE OF IDEAS: The Fate of the
Commons in a Connected World, By Lawrence Lessig, Random House: 320
pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX SOOJUNG-KIM PANG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acentury ago, Frederick Jackson Turner delivered an address on "The
Significance of the Frontier in American History" that changed the
way America understood itself. Turner cast the frontier's history in
a new light, making it a driver of national history and culture and
its closing a cause for alarm.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence Lessig's "The Future of Ideas" should have been titled
"The Significance of the Electronic Frontier in American History."
Lessig sees the Internet as harboring a unique character that
accounts for its importance and for which it is under attack. Like
Turner's "frontier thesis," "The Future of Ideas" is a dazzlingly
inventive work about familiar things. It deserves to change the way
we think about the electronic frontier.</LD>
<LD>   In Lessig's world, established corporations use any means to keep
challengers down, including rewriting the rules and even outlawing
disruptive innovation. But Lessig sees the Internet as a realm where
the right to innovate (the term Microsoft used to brand its defense
in the federal antitrust suit) has been built-in, much as
constitutional rights are guaranteed to citizens.</LD>
<TE>   It isn't obvious that the Internet should have become such a
hotbed of creativity. For years, the phone system was far more
attractive than the Internet to hackers like Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniak. So why did the Internet become an arena for innovation in
the 1990s? Not because it attracted venture capitalists and
twentysomething CEOs who "got it," but because it is a "commons."</TE>
<TE>   Commons, Lessig explains, are things available to anyone who obeys
the rules governing their use. Streets, highways and parks are
commons open to everyone. The Internet's fundamental design was built
around a common protocol that all computers could use, and it was
designed so that the intelligence resided at the edges of the
network, not in the center. This "end-to-end" architecture is the
reverse of the telephone system, in which dumb devices--your
phone--are connected by an intelligent network. Add the development
of open source software and you have a commons of extraordinary
value. Anyone who obeys the technical rules can develop services that
run on it. No application can be excluded for political reasons or
protectionism. Success is bestowed by the marketplace, not by
government policy or corporate patronage. The phone system couldn't
compete, not despite its centralized power, but because of it. To
paraphrase Stewart Brand, innovation wants to be free.</TE>
<TE>   But the Internet is endangered, Lessig says. The shift from an
Internet running off telecom to broadband running through cable
television wires threatens the open architecture because a cable
company can design its system to work best with its own service
provider, deny access to competitors or break software from other
companies, and it will all be legal; no phone company could have ever
done those things.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in copyright and patent law are also impoverishing the
intellectual commons. Copyright originally lasted 14 years; today it
can last 10 times as long, thanks to efforts by entertainment
companies eager to defend their profits. Patent applicants have to
reveal how their inventions work, but you can patent software without
revealing the source code that would make it comprehensible to
others, and the "fair use" of copyrighted materials is under attack
as publishers develop technology to gain more control over content.</TE>
<TE>   All of these developments are part of a bigger story about the
changing values of ideas and property rights. Museums have jumped
into the deep waters of the marketplace, in search of new riches or
replacement for lost funding. Even universities have mutated from
dreamy spires into incubators of companies and products, thanks to
federal rules allowing them to commercialize discoveries made with
government funds. Corporations patent plants and animals, and
copyright genetic codes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Future of Ideas" concludes with proposals to defend the
digital commons. Given that we live in a world in which intellectual
work is being fenced off and sold, do his ideas stand a chance?
Lessig is pessimistic, but the last 20 years have seen some
remarkable experiments in public policy inspired by iconoclastic
thinkers. His ideas could provide a foundation for real action.
Recent polls suggest that respect for the government and public
services is rising, and few politicians would say they were against
innovation and for special interests. It might be impossible to
recover America's original great commons, the first frontier, but
perhaps the electronic one still has a chance.</TE>

<LD>THE OTHER FACE OF AMERICA: Chronicles of the Immigrants Shaping Our Future,
By Jorge Ramos, Rayo/HarperCollins:  252 pp., $24.95</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after moving to Mexico in 1993, I met a couple in a
village in the west-central state of Michoacan. Their house had two
stories, marble floors, a satellite dish and a large yard, but it was
usually empty. The family lived most of the year in Stockton, where
the man worked in a tomato-packing plant. There they rented a home
near Eighth and Phelps streets, one of the most violent areas in the
entire Central Valley. I'd been a crime reporter there. Shootings,
robberies, carjackings, drug sales--every night it happened at Eighth
and Phelps.</LD>
<LD>   Immigration is a great story because of the beautiful
contradictions you can find within it. My first taste of that was the
surprise that this couple would rent a home amid urban chaos and send
their children to the second-worst high school in Stockton while
building a home in Mexico in which they spent only six weeks a year.
Their dream, the couple told me, was to retire there one day.</LD>
<TE>   That began my fascination with the stories of Mexican immigration
and its essence: the return home. For many immigrants, the American
Dream is not to assimilate but to return home wealthier than they
left. Who would want to assimilate into America? It is lacerating to
cut ties to home. Yet, for most of the last century, geography, the
limits of transportation, war and economic and political turmoil
forced immigrants to cut their ties to, say, Italy or Vietnam or
China. It wasn't fair, but it was necessary. This focused them on
investing in American businesses, educating their children and
leaving areas like Eighth and Phelps.</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans, though, can go home, and they do. Mexico is nearby,
travel is cheap and the country is relatively stable yet poor, so
their dollars buy a lot. These factors keep Mexicans coming to the
U.S. and returning home every year.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration to the United States from other countries has started
and stopped, forcing those immigrants to assimilate. Mexicans alone
have realized the true immigrant American Dream. This constant return
hurts many Mexican immigrants. Proposition 187 in 1994 was possible
because many Mexican immigrants, still yearning for Mexico, hadn't
become U.S. citizens. So politicians like former California Gov. Pete
Wilson didn't need to take them into account. (And I don't believe
investing in a house in Mexico is a great idea if you have to rent a
home at Eighth and Phelps for 20 years to do it.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet it seems popular now to exalt nonassimilation, despite the
harm it does to immigrants. This is one failing of "The Other Face of
America" and "Operation Gatekeeper," two new books dealing with
Mexican immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "The Other Face of America" is a series of vignettes about Latino
immigrants--Mexicans, Dominicans, Central Americans--written by Jorge
Ramos, a Mexican immigrant and prime time news anchorman for the
Spanish-language Univision network in Miami. Only a popular
television anchorman could have persuaded HarperCollins to print a
book this thinly reported. His book is the prose equivalent of
television news. Every page shows that the reporter hasn't spent the
time to make his characters come alive and understand their
contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of delving into immigrant stories, Ramos rants and weeps
for them. On a woman about whom we learn little, except that she
couldn't get into UCLA because she's undocumented, he writes: "Where
are all the names of the legislators who prevented Margarita of
Michoacan from being able to attend UCLA? Who among them would dare
to look her in the face and tell her she does not have the right to
continue studying? Who?"</TE>
<TE>   Weeping for the downtrodden and preaching to the choir, not
challenging it--this is a journalistic tradition in Mexico, where so
many people are poor and working-class. Its real goal is to lift the
crusading reporter in his public's eyes. But it makes for wooden
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos praises Mexican immigrants' deep ties to their native land.
Then he bemoans their lack of political power in the U.S. He doesn't
get it: The former causes the latter. Many Mexican immigrants haven't
become American citizens. They can't vote and thus have no political
power in their new country. Many are American citizens and still
don't vote; the 2001 L.A. mayor's race showed that. But none of this
has much to do with American racism, as Ramos implies.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos' message, he reminds us at least five times, is that the
United States "must admit that it is a multicultural society ...
[and] must accept that reality and fully embrace its diversity."</TE>
<TE>   But no other country on the planet has more generously provided
poor immigrants with opportunities that lead to self-fulfillment.
Moreover, immigrants have the duty and moral responsibility to adapt
to the customs and language of this country, not the other way
around. Nor does Ramos give us any tips as to how this country should
admit its multiculturalism and fully embrace its diversity--more than
it's already done, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two books, Joseph Nevins' "Operation Gatekeeper"--an
indictment of the Border Patrol's enforcement operation at San
Ysidro--is better. However, the prose is thick and splotched with
statistics. The border and the attempts to enforce it beg for an
invigorating story and an imaginative approach.</TE>
<TE>   Nevins' main point--that the enforcement of the border gave rise
to the concept of the illegal alien--is self-evident. He also seems
to think--though dense prose makes it difficult to really know--that
patrolling borders is not a good thing, or that it is hypocritical or
nativist, or at least Gatekeeper is a bad way to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Nevins has put in time and research. And he does provide some good
history of the Tijuana-San Ysidro border. But immigration and the
border are living stories. Where are the coyotes, INS agents, border
residents and immigrants themselves? None shows up in this book. I
wish it were clear that Nevins had spent as much time on the border
as in the library.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration is a story in which everyone is right. Can you fault a
poor young man from Michoacan for seeking a better life here? I
admire his gumption and want him contributing to my country. Can you
blame Americans for being angry at the many Mexicans not learning
English despite 25 years in this country? If millions of Americans
lived in Mexico City, speaking only English, I can tell you that
Mexicans would be boiling in a frenzy of xenophobic rage.</TE>
<TE>   Can you fault the restaurant owner who hires only Mexicans because
American high school students are lazy and show up late? Can you
blame the angry families in San Ysidro who, before Operation
Gatekeeper, lived in a war zone, their yards trampled each night,
helicopters overhead?</TE>
<TE>   Yet neither book takes on these complexities nor reflects the
vitality that makes immigration such an exciting topic. Worst of all,
the authors, especially Ramos, believe that those favoring
enforcement of the border and immigration law are racists. This is
tripe, an ad hominem attack by authors who can't face the nuances of
the issue they've taken on.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican immigrants are my heroes, but I believe the laws and
borders of my country should be firmly enforced. Our country has the
right to let people in or not as we wish. There are decent, nonracist
reasons for believing so. And if I believe that the United States
wins by accepting immigrants, and Mexico loses, I can also believe
that there is nothing "putative" about the costs America shoulders
due to that immigration, as Nevins would have it. I can say too that,
though ugly, Gatekeeper and the steel wall at Tijuana-San Ysidro
cleansed what was once a festering paradise for rapists and thugs.</TE>
<TE>   Much about Mexico's social and cultural life could enrich the
United States. The Mexican town plaza, for example, fosters human
interaction in a very quiet, decent way. In Mexico, life takes place
more in the home and neighborhood, less in the shopping mall. But
little about Mexican politics and economics is worth transplanting.
Political and economic traditions in Mexico keep poor people poor and
reward the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican immigrant assimilation is necessary to keep these nasty
traditions at bay and for the United States to continue being the
kind of place Mexicans wanted to emigrate to in the first place.
Ramos points to Cuban Miami as an example of Latino political power.
I don't know much about Cuban Miami, though I've heard it's like any
other ethnic political machine. I do know that the predominantly
Mexican cities southeast of Los Angeles (such as South Gate and Bell
Gardens) are disturbing examples of Latino political power. The
flouting of rules there, the manipulation of poor Latinos by Latino
politicians--these are warnings: Too little immigrant assimilation
allows devastating Mexican political customs to continue here.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, these books leave important questions unaddressed: Should
America allow entrance to everyone who wants to come? How much
immigration is too much? Why shouldn't we let in immigrants when jobs
are plentiful but keep them out in times of recession? What is the
alternative to Gatekeeper? Why, if we're going to offer amnesty to
illegal immigrants every 15 years, should we have immigration laws at
all?</TE>
<TE>   Unwillingness to confront difficult questions and to draw the full
dimensions of immigrants and the complexities of immigration make
these two books missed opportunities.</TE>

<LD>WILD L.A.: A Celebration of the Natural Areas n and Around the City</LD>
<LD>   By James Lawrence</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Club Books: 192 pp., $40</LD>
<TE>   We need "Wild L.A." in Los Angeles. We need to be reminded of the
nature and wilderness still available to us. Like people who live in
cities everywhere, we need help refocusing, so that we can see the
peregrine falcons flying between buildings or identify the palms
lining the boulevards. We may not have four noticeable seasons, but
we have a jacaranda season and a poppy season, and we have natural
phenomena like the Santa Anas that affect our breathing and our
moods.</TE>
<TE>   James Lawrence has written a celebration. Los Angeles, he writes,
boasts the largest amount of parkland within city limits of any city
in the country. He does not venture very far into the inner city,
East L.A. or South-Central to find the remnants of wildness, or even
to my own neighborhood, Venice Beach ("where the debris meets the
sea"). He hugs the perimeter, where there is, in all fairness, more
wide open space. There is no pollution in these photographs, which
gleam in brilliant blues and verdant greens. One or two sunsets have
that suspiciously brazen range of colors--perhaps the effects of
sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide--but, other than that, porpoises
leap and flowers bloom toward the glistening sun. You might not
recognize the L.A. you know and struggle with, but you will be drawn
to explore it by these beckoning photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence walks us through the Santa Monica Mountains, where
"twenty-six distinct natural communities support a variety of
habitats for more than fifty-three species of mammals and nearly four
hundred species of birds, including thirteen nesting species of
raptors." He dips into the geology, the biology and cultural
histories briefly, as well as some of the environmental struggles
currently underway, such as the Ahmanson Ranch development, north of
Calabasas. Lawrence frequently points out not only areas of
"unscarred purity" but also the miracle of their "accessibility from
nearby Los Angeles." It's important to believe in, and, if we're
lucky, hold a memory of wilderness that is pristine, but the photos,
in all their clean perfection, make these areas seem remote. This
works against Lawrence's point that these areas are close to where we
work and shop and complain about a lack of wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   One chapter on parks along the rim of the San Fernando Valley and
glowing descriptions of Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park (part of the
Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor, 450,000 acres administered by the
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy) open up new horizons in a
commuter's world. Lawrence takes us to the Rancho Mission Viejo Land
Conservancy Wilderness areas; through the Santa Ana Mountains on the
eastern border of Orange County; through the San Gabriel Mountains;
the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve in the San Fernando Valley and
Abalone Cove on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Your own impressions of
these places, however, may not live up to Lawrence's. There have been
times when Abalone Cove was laced with garbage and oil slicks covered
the tide pools, and there have been days when "quaint, lovely" town
of Avalon on Catalina Island was crowded and noisy.</TE>
<TE>   I prefer the photographs of individual species to the broad vistas
perhaps because many of the species echo L.A.'s particular
stylishness. Take the American kestrel, a Southern California raptor
in shades of rust and blue; or the Western ringneck snake, more like
an M.C. Escher print than an animal; or the gnarled oaks and the
smooth-barked, red-skinned manzanita, perched on cliffs and
hillsides. These species, seen so close and splendid, look brazen and
whimsical and full of the light of their particular ecosystems:
desert sun or leafy shadows or coastal fog.</TE>
<TE>   The parks that Lawrence writes about and photographs have been
hard-won, and seem, though some are tens of thousands of acres, like
a precarious necklace on a black velvet background, strung together
by committed conservationists or those wealthy enough to protect
their land.</TE>
<TE>   But Lawrence believes there are still places you can go inside
L.A. and find quiet or go eye-to-eye with a mountain lion who decides
to let you live. Somewhere between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m., it's true,
along the coast, you can hear the surf over street noise. In that one
hour each morning, our ecosystem is as pristine as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   There were many losses in Los Angeles that Lawrence refers to in
the text (companion volumes perhaps to this one, though coffee table
books that serve as records of destruction are probably not all that
popular). These include the L.A. River, the Playa Vista project
underway at the Ballona Wetlands, the Laguna Canyon Toll Road, the
wild parts of Orange County, perhaps more poignant, more tragic,
because of the beauty and diversity they drove away. One worries that
without the images of these losses in our collective memory, we'll
plunge ahead on the road already taken.</TE>

<LD>DON'T MEAN NOTHING : Short Stories of Vietnam</LD>
<LD>   By Susan O'Neill</LD>
<LD>   Ballantine: 252 pp., $22</LD>
<TE>   A lieutenant attempts to feed "genuine Chef Boy-ar-dee pizza" to
the apparition of an old Vietnamese man squatting in a cemetery; a
flatulent pet monkey initiates a series of candy-bar thefts, spreads
lice and inspires bloodlust in an otherwise peace-loving nurse at Chu
Lai hospital; a jones-ing 18-year-old soldier--"Out of hash. Out of
coke. And out of money until Tuesday"--accidentally gasses himself to
death on anesthesia; and an after-hours romp in a hospital chapel
draws two lovers into a roving discussion about sex, God, Vietnam and
altar boys. Subtitled "Short Stories of Vietnam," Susan O'Neill's
debut offers startling glimpses of absurdity and transcendence at
three Vietnam field hospitals where, against a backdrop of blood and
testosterone, young female officers and nurses are made
simultaneously into saviors, survivors and sex objects.</TE>
<TE>   The episodes recorded here have eyewitness immediacy, and, in her
elucidating introduction, O'Neill describes her own hitch in Vietnam
and her long history, as a writer, of coming to grips with it. Noting
that "don't mean nothing" was a popular catch phrase in Vietnam's
combat hospitals, O'Neill offers a damning, if conundrum-like,
update: "I am convinced that, to our government, Vietnam really,
truly Didn't Mean Nothing." Yet, like her predecessors Tim O'Brien,
Thom Jones and Beverly Gologorsky, O'Neill manages to salvage
powerful new meanings from the terrible nothingness, making this
collection, with its "Leaving on a Jet Plane" soundtrack and cast of
eccentrics, as entertaining as it is harrowing.</TE>

<TE>   THE LAKE OF DEAD LANGUAGES</TE>
<TE>   By Carol Goodman</TE>
<TE>   Ballantine Books: 368 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Triangulations abound in Carol Goodman's deeply atmospheric first
novel, set at the Heart Lake School for Girls in the Adirondacks.
There's a trio of present-day Goth chicks studying Latin under
teacher Jane Hudson, who, likewise, was part of a formidable trio of
Heart Lake girls 20 years earlier. From the lake that borders the
school, whose unknowable depths provide much of the book's portentous
aura, jut three sister-like rocks. And when Goodman delves deeper,
into the circumstances of the Heart Lake generation before Jane, we
find a three-tiered story emerging about young women who seem forever
destined to repeat hushed-up outlandish behaviors: attempted (or
faked) suicides, baby swappings, possible murders and mysterious
drownings.</TE>
<TE>   The deepest mystery of all is why Jane would return to her creepy
alma mater, a place where her roommates Lucy and Deirdre--both, like
Jane, overstimulated by their Latin studies--were tragically
swallowed up by the lake in circumstances that only get weirder the
more Goodman reveals. These revelations, too, come in threes: There's
the accepted version, there's the discovery of what really happened
and then there's the final improbable twist designed to take our
breath away. With so much to reveal, and so many ways to reveal it
"The Lake of Dead Languages" threatens to become a drowning pool for
all but the most robustly patient reader. And if this hybrid of "The
Virgin Suicides" and "The Secret History" ultimately ends up
resembling an upscale "Scream," Goodman does float us a few life
buoys: a wonderfully eerie sense of place, deft jabs at prep school
politics and, a rare thing, a cast of characters who know their
datives from their ablatives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GLOW IN THE DARK</TE>
<TE>   By Lisa Teasley</TE>
<TE>   Cune Press: 192 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   This slim story collection from Lisa Teasley is a pocket-sized
gazetteer that ranges from Manhattan's East Village to Santa Monica,
from Jersey City to Paris, from Big Sur down to Baja. Along the way,
we encounter people with names like Boogie, Zen and Jazz--marginal
types who tend to smoke hash, have pink hair, sport ankh tattoos and
have impeccable noses for trouble. Despite the far-flung geography
and a pervasive aura of emotional wanderlust, Teasley's
down-and-outers--many of them of mixed ethnicity--never really get
very far. The title character in "Nepenthe," ends up back in the Big
Sur restaurant where she was allegedly conceived in the restroom.
Marty, in "Baker," is doing well at AA yet has a darker addiction
that's too incriminating for him to seek outside help. And Zasu, in
"Holiday Confessional," flees a brutal Brooklyn crime scene only to
spill the beans to two hipsters in a popular cocktail bar across the
river. It would seem that times are bleak indeed for the contemporary
multicultural bohemian.</TE>
<TE>   But if this gritty tableaux isn't always satisfyingly fleshed out,
and if they seem almost to strain for edginess, Teasley's prose often
saves the day: It brims over with plain-spoken energy, gutsy
observations and neo-beatnik flair.</TE>

<HD>With a Grain of Salt</HD>
<DH>SALT: A World History, By Mark Kurlansky, Walker &amp; Co: 484
pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>'When friends stopped by, I told them the rock was salt, and they
would delicately lick a corner and verify that it tasted just like
salt. Those who think a fascination with salt is a bizarre obsession
have simply never owned a rock like this.'</LD>
<LD>   Mark Kurlansky</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Salt enhances food and aggravates hypertension. But beyond that,
who gives it a second thought? When we go to the supermarket and buy
a box of Morton's, we may think more about its slogan--"When it rains
it pours"--than about what's inside. When we read about insulating
nuclear waste in underground salt caverns or about de-icing roads
after a blizzard, we may be reminded of its versatility, but few of
us know much about its illustrious history. Civilizations have
flourished and fallen upon the fortune of these small white grains.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately Mark Kurlansky knows all about it. As he did in his
best-selling "Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World,"
Kurlansky continues to prove himself remarkably adept at taking a
most unlikely candidate and telling its tale with epic grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt: A World History" reveals all the hidden drama of its
seemingly pedestrian subject. There is even a kind of poetry in the
very chemistry of salt which Kurlansky conveys in his description of
its most common form, sodium chloride: "When sodium, an unstable
metal that can suddenly burst into flame, reacts with a deadly
poisonous gas known as chlorine, it becomes the staple food sodium
chloride, NaCl, from the only family of rocks eaten by humans."</TE>
<TE>   Kurlansky's journey takes him from prehistoric times to the
present day, to places such as China, India, Japan, Egypt, Israel,
Morocco, West Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Germany,
France, England, Scandinavia, the Caribbean and the United States,
currently the world's largest producer and consumer of salt. The
story--or, rather, the many different stories--involving its
production, transportation and use send him in a variety of
directions--technology, geology, trade routes, politics, economics,
anthropology, religion, cookery and chemistry--and make for an
immensely entertaining read.</TE>
<TE>   Though something of a problem for people advised by their doctors
to use less of it, salt is an indispensable element of the human
diet. How much salt the body needs and how much is too much remains
unclear. What is known is that as hunters, humans got all the sodium
they needed by eating meat, but with the switch to agriculture came
the need to add salt to a grain and vegetable diet. (This dietary
deficiency explains why deer and other herbivores gravitate to salt
licks). To ancient agrarian civilizations such as those in China and
Egypt, salt was as vital as water.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, salt came to acquire a totemic significance.
Perhaps because of its association with the teeming oceans, salt has
been associated with fertility. The Romans called a man in love
salax, in a salted state, the origin of the word salacious. In
Germany, brides' shoes were sprinkled with salt, and in Egypt
celibate priests abstained from salt because it was thought to excite
sexual desire.</TE>
<TE>   Just as often (clearly because of its ability to preserve), salt
has been seen as embodying permanence, longevity and loyalty. Because
it inhibits the growth of bacteria, salt is a popular food
preservative, and the ancient Egyptians used it to mummify bodies.
Elsewhere in Africa and in Japan, salt was thought to ward off evil
spirits; in Haiti it was thought to bring zombies back to life.</TE>
<TE>   In language, proverbs using salt suggest reliability and
permanence. The Bible describes God's covenant with Israel as "a
covenant of salt forever...." and in Islam and Judaism, Kurlansky
tells us, "salt seals a bargain because it is immutable." In the
secular realm, a solid, unpretentious, trustworthy person is "the
salt of the Earth." A sensible individual knows to how to take
exaggerated claims "with a grain of salt." A good employee is "worth
his [or her] salt." Indeed, Roman soldiers were paid in salt, the
origin of the word "salary." And we shouldn't forget the salt that
went into "salami" and "salad."</TE>
<TE>   Only in the 20th century did the importance of salt begin to
decrease. Geologists discovered that salt could be found not only in
brine beds and a few salt mines but almost everywhere on Earth and,
thanks to canning, freezing and refrigeration, salt is no longer our
primary means of preserving food. Nowadays, the fate of salt has
taken an ignominious turn, with its primary use de-icing roads.</TE>
<TE>   "Today," Kurlansky philosophizes, "thousands of years of coveting,
fighting over, hoarding, taxing, and searching for salt appear
picturesque and slightly foolish. The seventeenth-century British
leaders who spoke with urgency about the dangerous national
dependence on French sea salt seem somehow more comic than
contemporary leaders concerned with a dependence on foreign oil. In
every age, people are certain that only the things they have deemed
valuable have true value."</TE>
<TE>   And what value salt once had. Throughout much of history, salt
influenced the conduct of wars, the fiscal policies of governments
and even the inception of revolutions. Salt was taxed, from as far
back as the 20th century BC in China. The Roman Republic and Empire
controlled the price of salt, increasing it to raise money for wars,
lowering it to be sure that the poorest citizens could easily afford
this important part of the diet.</TE>
<TE>   An unjust and exploitative system of salt taxes in France, known
as the gabelle, may well have played a big part in engendering the
French Revolution. The gabelle, in addition to making a common,
necessary product unduly expensive (a burden that naturally fell more
heavily upon the poor than the upon the rich), required everyone
older than 8 living in a certain region to purchase far more salt
each year than he or she needed.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the British in India imposed a harsh and onerous salt
policy, enacting laws that forbade Indians not only from
manufacturing but even gathering their own salt. This led to Gandhi's
famous 1930 march to a seaside salt pan to scoop up salt in defiance
of the British. Kurlansky explains that the chief reason behind this
seemingly senseless policy was Britain's desire to protect its salt
industry by forcing Indians to purchase salt imported from
Cheshire--where, ironically, extensive salt mining had actually
eroded the ground to such an extent that buildings and houses were
leaning and sometimes collapsing into the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Although salt throughout history has been a source of wealth, it's
no accident that we still use the phrase "back to the salt mines" to
summon up an image of extremely hard, thankless physical labor. And
indeed, as Kurlansky notes, the lot of those who labored in the salt
mines was seldom a happy one.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, it is quite surprising to read here of some unusual
instances of salt mines that also served as fun spots. The Durnberg
mine in Austria boasted underground lakes with boat rides and offered
visitors a roller coaster-like ride down its sloping mineshaft. The
Polish crown's salt mine in Wieliczka featured huge underground
chambers with elaborately carved salt statues, where royal guests
could dine and dance to music acoustically enhanced by the setting.</TE>
<TE>   If salt receives any attention nowadays, it is usually from people
trying to limit their intake of it to avoid high blood pressure.
Ironically, at the same time, many chefs are expanding their use of
salt in cooking, and some gourmets, bored with the uniform quality
and purity of mass-produced salt, are seeking out irregular, oddly
colored "artisanal" salts, such as fleur de sel and gray salt, for
their novelty value.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in the supermarket, the ubiquitous blue canisters
of Morton's Salt may not be trendy, but the story of how Joy Morton
revolutionized the salt industry, first in 1911 by adding magnesium
carbonate to make salt flow more freely, then in 1924 by adding the
nutrient iodine, is an American success story worth telling, and
Kurlansky saves it for his conclusion. Today Morton is the largest
salt company in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The poet William Blake wrote of seeing the word in a grain of
sand, and over the last few years, authors have used small
commonplace items as lenses to look at the vaster currents of natural
and human history. We've had "Tobacco" by Iain Gately, "Dust" by
Joseph Amato and "Universal Foam" by Sidney Perkowitz. With "Salt,"
Kurlansky adds his name to this list, rising splendidly to the
challenge of showing us the world that can be found in a mere grain
of salt.</TE>

<TE>   Aside from a few malcontents over at the Writers Guild, we are all
auteurists now. The reason is self-evident: Directors are responsible
for the movieness of movies. That is to say, they are in charge of
all the things that are unique to film as an expressive form. As the
senior officer present on any picture, the director gets most of the
credit or blame for its success or failure. More important, he
satisfies the apparently ineluctable human need to attribute personal
authorship to any work of (presumptive) art.</TE>
<TE>   This was not always clearly so. In the first decades of sound
production, when the studios were organized on the factory model, it
was harder to discern how this authority asserted itself in American
films. It required the cunning of a Howard Hawks or an Alfred
Hitchcock to subvert the house manner each studio imposed on its
directors. In those days, too, writers consistently wrote memorable
dialogue, their language competing with visual imagery for space in
our memories. But then, as now, studio executives were careless with
writers: With so many hands contributing to a script, how could any
one writer stake a claim to authorship?</TE>
<TE>   Directing, though, remains a mystery for studio people, who tend
to fall back in awe at those who have mastered the techniques (and
the egos) required to create a movie. It's easy to fire writers,
toiling in anonymity, before much money has been spent on a film;
canning a director once a picture is rolling is a consequential and,
indeed, newsworthy act.</TE>
<TE>   Something of the shamanistic clings to directors in the literature
of film. Full-scale biographies are, on the whole, unsatisfactory.
They run to the hagiographic (two recent ones on John Ford are an
example) or to the sourly gossiping (Frank Capra, Hawks, Hitchcock).
The lives stubbornly refuse to illuminate the work. Surrounding these
tombstones, however, there is a vast sub-literature: critical
studies, collections of interviews and papers, memoirs. The cinephile
community is not a writerly one, but it is beaverish in the way it
collects raw material and places the data before the reader, leaving
the door open for a larger treatment, or not.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, "F.L.," a vast multilingual accompaniment to
last year's international retrospective of Fritz Lang's work, which
regrettably does not include anything resembling a mature critical
consideration of Lang's remarkable oeuvre. Andrew Sarris' brilliant
three-paragraph summary in "The American Cinema" would scarcely have
burdened a 512-page book.</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, it is amusing to read--as one can in these
pages--early German critics as they struggled to find a language
appropriate to Lang's first films, high cultural pomp attuned more to
the loopy intellectual and spiritual pretensions of "Metropolis" or
"Dr. Mabuse" or "Spione" than to the redeeming energy and conviction
of their spectacle. There is, as well, poignancy in the documents
reflecting Lang's efforts to aid and comfort, in his stiff, monocled
way, his fellow exiles from Nazism. That he did so while developing,
in an alien landscape, his great gift for American genre filmmaking
("Scarlet Street," "The Big Heat," "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" ) is
something this book does not notice. It's up to knowledgeable readers
to impute it.</TE>
<TE>   They will have less fun with Sandy Lean's "intimate portrait" of
her husband, David Lean. He once said that if he ever wrote his
autobiography, it would be "a book with a lot of pictures," and this
volume handsomely fulfills that imperative. The widow Lean (she was
his sixth wife) also fulfills the implicit demands of loving memory,
which puts the best possible face on his egocentricity. Because she
entered the director's life late, her stress is on the pictorially
brilliant epics (such as "Lawrence of Arabia") that consumed her
husband's last decades.</TE>
<TE>   These are visually imposing films, much beloved by Lean's fellow
directors. But they have severe problems, notably a dwindling of
narrative power in their second halves, which Sandy Lean doesn't
notice. Her treatment of Lean's early work is similarly vague, though
these films are, I think, much more satisfying. Finally, she treats
as more or less harmless eccentricities his defects of personality:
his silences, his inability to make emotional connections, his abrupt
withdrawals of friendship over largely imaginary slights, his
depressed wanderings in search of the places where he took the
pretty, detached still photos with which this book is
replete--defects of nature that finally became the defects of his
films, with the obsessive formalism of his compositions draining them
of wayward life.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock wore his obsessions more amusingly, though you wouldn't
know that from Peter Conrad's "The Hitchcock Murders." The author
sneaked out of school to see "Psycho" in 1961 and hasn't been the
same since. His apartment, he says, contains 100 Hitchcock movie
posters, and his mind is equally cluttered with a great career's
detritus. His strategy is to isolate Hitchcock's preoccupations--cool
blonds, staircases, keys, voyeurism, physical restraint, religious
iconography, to name but a few--and trace them from film to film
across his 54-year career. This yields some fascinating congruities,
but somehow both the man and his works elude Conrad.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock remained in touch throughout his life with his nervous,
slightly nerdy inner child, and it was the source of his many
compulsions. But he was also a fairly self-conscious modernist--form
almost always trumped "thriller" content in his movies--whose mastery
of his medium grew ever more sophisticated over the years. It's
amusing, even instructive, to see him return to tropes first explored
in his early silents many decades later. But even devoted
Hitchcockians (of which I am one) need a chronology to keep the story
straight, an acknowledgment of recurrent themes larger than his
obsessive tics, a sense of how his technique kept growing in subtlety
and some feeling that the writer is not just looking but judging the
quality of individual works. When, however, you set an
obsessive--even one as observant as Conrad--to catch an obsessive,
you end up with Psycho babble.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Ciment's well-illustrated study of Stanley Kubrick is the
third edition of the work (hence that "Definitive" in the subtitle),
and he has a far more difficult task than Conrad's. Kubrick made only
13 films (as opposed to Hitchcock's 51), but he never repeated
himself. His consistencies were all intellectual. What emerges from
Ciment's work is a portrait of a glum but cinematically brilliant
existentialist. His was a lifelong critique of pure reason, which
was, as he saw it, all we have but never enough. The institutions
charged with defending rationalism were avatars of irrationalism, a
matter Kubrick's war movies ("Paths of Glory," "Dr. Strangelove,"
"Full Metal Jacket") make cruelly clear. Sex, with or without
romance, is a snare and a delusion ("Lolita" in his screen version or
"Eyes Wide Shut"); overt rebellion is doomed ("A Clockwork Orange")
and so is the attempt to get along by going along ("Barry Lyndon").
And, anyway, mortality--the thing Kubrick rebelled most profoundly
against--will soon enough render all efforts to transcend our lot
meaningless. The only bleak hope Kubrick offered us was rebirth
("2001: A Space Odyssey"), and that's always been a pretty dim
prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Ciment is perhaps a little too reliant on high-toned European
literary and philosophical thinkers to support his arguments. But I
like the sobriety of this book, the way it forces us to get outside
the cine-chat box and look freshly at a serious artist, among whose
achievements we must number his ability to go his own way, making
expensive and singular movies within the mainstream. Maybe Kubrick's
rebel protagonists were foredoomed, but he managed his own lonely
life with an elan that actually deserves our awe.</TE>

<DH>JON WIENER STILL ALIVE: A Holocaust Girlhood Remembered, By
Ruth Kluger, Feminist Press: 216 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON WIENER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Holocaust is one of the best-documented events in human history,
and every year hundreds more histories and memoirs are published.
Once in a while, one stands out above the rest. "Still Alive" by Ruth
Kluger is one of these--a book of breathtaking honesty and
extraordinary insight.</LD>
<LD>   Kluger was born in Vienna and deported with her mother to
Thereisenstadt in 1942, just before her 11th birthday, and then to
Auschwitz. But the book hardly deals with the Nazis. "I didn't know
any Nazis," Kluger writes, "but I knew the difficult, neurotic people
whom they oppressed." She refuses to accept the conventional view
that suffering brings people closer together, that it makes them more
generous and more humane; she calls that "sentimental rubbish" and
fearlessly describes what happened in her family: how her mother
early on decided not to send her to safety on the kindertransport
that rescued 10,000 other German and Austrian Jewish children; how
her father tried to escape on his own and failed; how her mother
became increasingly irrational and demanding while waiting for the
knife to fall and then how her mother got the two of them out of
Auschwitz alive.</LD>
<TE>   First came Thereisenstadt, a concentration camp but not a death
camp. "In a way, I loved Thereisenstadt," she writes, one of the
points at which she suggests readers need to "rearrange a lot of
furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust." In Vienna she had
been isolated, lonely and trapped with her disturbed mother; in
Thereisenstadt she lived in a girls' dorm that was full of life,
where young Socialists and Zionists taught her about friendship and
teamwork and ideas. There was good in Thereisenstadt--but no thanks
to the Germans: "The only good was what the Jews managed to make of
it, the way they flooded this square kilometer of Czech soil with
their voices, their intellect, their wit, their playfulness, their
joy in dialogue." She quickly adds, "I hated Thereisenstadt," hated
the filth, the crowding, the powerlessness, the humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   She survived Auschwitz because of the inexplicable act of another
inmate, a young woman working as a clerk to the SS. The scene was one
of the infamous "selections," as naked inmates stood in lines and SS
men pulled some out--usually for the gas chambers. But here Kluger's
mother's instinct kept them alive. She figured out that this
selection was not for the gas but for work. But you had to be at
least 15, and Ruth was only 12.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother told her to tell the SS man she was 15. She thought
that would never work, but the young female clerk also whispered,
"Tell him you are fifteen." Ruth did, and when the SS man expressed
skepticism, the young clerk told him, "She is strong. Look at the
muscles in her legs. She can work." So Ruth and her mother were sent
from Auschwitz to a work camp in rural Poland.</TE>
<TE>   People who heard the story of Kluger's survival were often
disappointed that it wasn't more action-filled, more heroic. She
challenges that view and mobilizes her considerable literary and
analytic power to focus on what happened at that moment when she
stood in line, "a kid sentenced to death," rescued by someone she had
never met: "What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?
Listen to me, don't take it apart, absorb it as I am telling it and
remember it." Her writing is vivid and precise; her observations are
penetrating and sometimes barbed.</TE>
<TE>   Kluger eventually went to New York with her mother, got a
doctorate in German literature, taught at Princeton and recently
retired from UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The book was originally published in Germany a decade ago, where
it was a bestseller and won major literary awards, and was then
translated into French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Czech and Japanese.
Only now has it appeared in English. Kluger felt she couldn't publish
in English until her mother died, and her mother lived to be 95. By
that time, the daughter was almost 70 and still trying to understand
and explain their intense and difficult life together.</TE>
<TE>   Their most glorious moment together came early in 1945, when they
ran away from the work camp "so fast and light" as if it was all
downhill. That moment has marked the rest of her life, she says.
Today she is "a woman who is perennially on the move, changing jobs
and homes at the drop of a hat ... a person who runs away as soon as
she gets nervous, long before she smells danger. Because running away
was the best thing I ever did, ever do. You feel alive when you run
away. It's the ultimate drug, in my experience." We are fortunate
that she stood still long enough to write this amazing book.</TE>

<HD>Bard of Suburbia</HD>
<DH>In 'Storytelling,' filmmaker Todd Solondz answers critics
of his landscapes of alienation and embarrassment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>YONKERS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>"People who are right are never confident, never well loved, never
well liked."</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Todd Solondz is smiling as he says this. He is
delivering the bad news to a crew member that tonight's shoot,
already late, may run even later (it's now past midnight). It's a
weirdly penetrating remark, but then, on the face of it, Solondz is a
weird guy.</LD>
<LD>   Standing on the set of his new movie, "Storytelling," which is
being shot in a former church/ porn studio/school in Yonkers, he's
wearing pale blue slacks, a short-sleeved pink-striped shirt, yellow
Keds and oversized green glasses. On the ground next to his
director's chair is the plastic bag he carries in lieu of a briefcase
or knapsack. What could be in it? A comb? A book? He will use the bag
until it falls apart.</LD>
<TE>   The 41-year-old Solondz's idiosyncrasies, trivial in themselves,
assume a sort of outsized significance because his movies, more than
most others', excite interest in who made them. Solondz is the bard
of suburban embarrassment. He specializes in those moments, sometimes
innocuous, sometimes not, that we'd all rather forget, involving the
kind of rejection that confirms our worst fears about ourselves: that
we are unattractive, dysfunctional and generally unlovable.</TE>
<TE>   "You look so sad," Solondz says, gently teasing one of his actors.
And why not? He's playing a Solondz character.</TE>
<TE>   Solondz's first film was the little-seen "Fear, Anxiety and
Depression" (1990). His second was "Welcome to the Dollhouse," (1996)
which made a far bigger splash. An excruciating examination of
adolescent alienation, it introduced a character whose name has
become synonymous with nerdiness and neediness: Dawn Wiener."</TE>
<TE>   His third film, "Happiness" (1998), was so scandalous that the
studio that financed it, October Films, dropped it (it was ultimately
distributed by Good Machine). The movie featured, among other
attractions, a father-son talk from hell in which Dad, rather than
explaining the facts of life, admits that he's a pedophile and that
he'd find his own boy a turn-on.</TE>
<TE>   "Storytelling," which will be shown at the Sundance Film Festival,
which began last week, does not have quite so many fireworks, which
is not to say it isn't audacious. It may be more so than his earlier
films because it's actually two films that are linked thematically
but in no other way. The first part, called "Fiction," is about the
sexual relations involving Vi (Selma Blair), fellow writing student
Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick) and teacher Gary Scott (Robert Wisdom).
Marcus has cerebral palsy and Gary is black, so the story is loaded
with issues of exploitation and racial stereotyping. These are then
refracted through the stories Vi and Marcus write about each other
(and Gary) for their class.</TE>
<TE>   The second part, "Non-Fiction," is about a would-be documentary
filmmaker, Toby Oxman (Paul Giamatti), who is shooting a film about a
slacker teenager, Scooby (Mark Webber), his upper-middle-class family
(John Goodman, Julie Hagerty, Noah Fleiss, Jonathan Osser)--and, not
so incidentally, their long-suffering maid, Consuelo (Lupe
Ontiveros). Oxman worms his way into the family's confidence and then
proceeds, whether intentionally or not, to ridicule their materialism
and Scooby's aimlessness.</TE>
<TE>   "Storytelling" bristles with issues of exploitation, condescension
and manipulation. Does this sound familiar? It does to Solondz's
critics, and it certainly does to Solondz, because he has often been
accused of being deliberately provocative and taking easy shots at
the suburbs and suburbanites. (European critics of America have
embraced him for the same reasons.)</TE>
<TE>   Rather than ignore these criticisms or make another movie, Solondz
has responded by addressing his critics head-on. In some ways,
"Storytelling" is a Solondz movie about a Solondz movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain scenes function in the film on their own narrative level
but also have some bearing on the responses that my films have
elicited," Solondz says. "Is the film moral or immoral or amoral? Is
the film cynical, misanthropic? Is the film condescending toward its
characters or is there a level of integrity that it accords them?
They are legitimate questions, but I think that my work can be looked
at a little reductively and oftentimes misread or misinterpreted
because the signposts aren't really there about what to think and
what to feel. And so people sometimes have a hard time getting their
bearings."</TE>
<TE>   Solondz describes the film's commentary on his critics as
"playful," and certainly in at least one instance it is. There's a
scene in which Oxman films strikingly unbeautiful street signs and
stoplights, and rhapsodizes in a voice-over about how breathtakingly
lovely the suburbs are--a parody of a similar scene in Sam Mendes'
"American Beauty."</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been very respectful of my peers," Solondz says. "I
always feel it incumbent upon me to never disparage them, but a few
years ago a journalist was telling me how Sam Mendes was criticizing
my film 'Happiness' for being condescending to its characters, so I
felt carte blanche to make my own homage, so to speak, to Mr. Mendes'
work. So there you have it. It's a little thing."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, this being a Solondz movie, there is a lot that is not
so playful or little. The most explosive element is surely what might
be described as the Dylan Baker character (after the actor who played
the sympathetic pedophile in "Happiness.") Here that role is played
by Wisdom, who is merciless with his writing students and keeps a
stack of photographs depicting naked white female students in
bondage. His sexual encounter with Vi traffics in all of the old
stereotypes about the threat black men pose to white women.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, Wisdom had some trepidations about the part but
felt that Solondz was "not just some guy taking on something for
shock's sake." "Basically he was sticking dynamite in all kinds of
places, and I trusted him. A trust that I wouldn't have the NAACP
coming down on me."</TE>
<TE>   Solondz says it was important that the sex scene between Gary and
Vi, which has been described by some of the crew as a rape, not be an
actual rape "because then you would succumb to certain ugly
stereotypes." It was also important that the sex between the two be
uncompromising. To get an R rating, however, which he was
contractually bound to do, he would have to shoot around it.</TE>
<TE>   Solondz resolved this conflict by having written into his contract
with New Line the option to impose a box over the offending material.
(He also contracted to bleep out offending words rather than insert
such timeworn substitutes as "Forget you!," but this turned out to be
unnecessary.) What he really wanted was to place the word "censored"
over the sex scene, but he discovered that the MPAA is "very fearful
of being perceived as censors, and so they censor 'censored,'" he
says.</TE>
<TE>   He was even worried that the MPAA wouldn't allow the box--which
says "censored" just as clearly as the word does--but the only
resistance he met was from New Line, which, he says, agreed to the
clause thinking he wouldn't actually exercise it. After all, why
would a director risk taking the viewer out of an important scene by
grafting a box over part of it?</TE>
<TE>   "I think he expected us to get in a fight about it, and we
didn't," says Marian Koltai-Levine, executive vice-president of
marketing for Fine Line, which is distributing the film. "The biggest
conversation was whether it was going to be black or red."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the audience should know what it's not allowed to see,"
Solondz says. "This is a film for adults, and I think it becomes
something of a statement obviously when you have that red box there.
When you have the Kubrick movie ['Eyes Wide Shut'] coming out with
everything very elegantly digitally removed, no one knows what they
never saw. There's something offensive and depressing about the
notion of the audience never knowing or seeing what the director
intended. So this way it is somewhat comical, I suppose, but there
you have it."</TE>
<TE>   The movie represents what Solondz intended, although that's not to
say it represents what he originally intended--what Solondz, who
refuses to discuss the matter, calls "the not movie."</TE>
<TE>   The "not movie" originally featured "Dawson's Creek's" James Van
Der Beek in the "Fiction" segment as an unappetizing Lothario. He's
now on the cutting-room floor, which in itself is not that unusual,
except that he was one of the few recognizable faces in the film.
According to producer Ted Hope, who also produced "Dollhouse" and
"Happiness," that's the way Solondz works. He finds the film in the
editing room.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd is someone who is driven by his story and his characters,"
Hope says. "We broke our backs--[co-producer] Christine [Vachon],
Todd and I all reinvested the majority of our salary back into the
movie. I would have liked nothing more than to have been able to have
the foresight to say that these scenes had to come out of the film.
If we'd saved that money upfront, I wouldn't have lost my salary. He
certainly knows some things that will definitely push people's
buttons, but it's the film first, and if that means cutting your
biggest star, that's what it means."</TE>
<TE>   Hope says that though this film does more button-pushing, it's not
just about that. It represents a step forward for Solondz. "It's more
thought-provoking, yet it doesn't have the immediate resonance, kind
of hot-button thing, which I think a lot of people would say is a
good thing," he says, citing the Dylan Baker character in "Happiness"
as a "hot-button thing." "It's missing the immediate topicality in
exchange for trying to delve a little bit deeper."</TE>
<TE>   Tell that to the people who see this film, or to Solondz himself.
He's like the guy who can't avert his eyes when confronted with a car
wreck. He has to slow down and take a long look. Solondz has his own
metaphor for what he feels compelled to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a moth, you're drawn to these quote-unquote taboo things not
for the sake of shocking anyone, but to examine why it is that we
have such a strong response to X, Y and Z," Solondz says, smiling.
"What is it that makes us bristle, what is it that makes us cringe or
wince, that moves us in such deep ways when this is mentioned or that
is said. To question why do we feel these things and what meaning is
to be found in this."</TE>

<LD>***CONCRETE BLONDE, "Group Therapy", Manifesto</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles institution opens its reunion album with a
heart-on-the-sleeve homage to Roxy Music and, by extension, to an era
when rock music could be both primal and experimental, flamboyant and
expressive, beautiful and emotional.</LD>
<LD>   If that's an unspoken challenge to itself, the trio meets it
pretty well with a collection that's more moody than aggro. "Group
Therapy" is true to its title, a reflective set whose
self-affirmations and summings-up entwine looks at past failings and
triumphs with a newly earned perspective.</LD>
<TE>   What's lost is the messy urgency of the earlier Concrete Blonde,
although the old rage and feistiness do flare up a couple of times.
But Johnette Napolitano's rough and raspy voice has never sounded
truer than on these confessions of a mid-40s bohemian at a crucial
point in life.</TE>
<TE>   The music is marked by a corresponding freedom. Bassist
Napolitano, guitarist Jim Mankey and drummer Harry Rushakoff strike a
comfort level at which nothing is forced, giving even the grandest
moments an intimacy, and lending quieter ones the easy empathy and
spontaneity of a jazz combo.</TE>

<HD>Stages of Confusion and Change</HD>
<DH>Some Taper subscribers forget 'My Old Lady' is at the
Doolittle, where debate continues on a face-lift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost every night, a few Mark Taper Forum subscribers show up at the
Taper in downtown L.A. to see the current season entry, "My Old
Lady," only to discover that "Flower Drum Song"--which they already
saw--is still playing.</LD>
<LD>   In November, when the hit "Flower Drum Song" was extended through
today, the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood was drafted into service as
a substitute location for "My Old Lady." Letters to subscribers asked
them to return their original Taper tickets for "My Old Lady" to
avoid any confusion, but only 64% did so.</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of whether the Taper tickets were returned, Doolittle
tickets to "My Old Lady"--which opened Jan. 4--were sent out. But
apparently not everyone got the message. Anyone who shows up at the
Taper to see "My Old Lady" is offered the chance to rebook another
performance.</LD>
<TE>   It's not as if the Doolittle is terra incognita for audiences of
the Center Theatre Group, which runs the Taper. The group co-owned
the Doolittle with UCLA in 1985 and 1986, presenting shows there that
included Taper season offerings. After UCLA assumed sole ownership,
Center Theatre Group returned as a tenant, sending its Ahmanson
Theatre subscribers there from 1989 to 1995, while the Ahmanson was
occupied by "Phantom of the Opera" and renovations.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Doolittle was bought by the Ricardo Montalban
Nosotros Foundation, which is turning it into a Latino-oriented
theater. Last year, the Doolittle hosted a production of "Selena"
that paid rent but lost a lot of money. Other tenants who are willing
to risk an extended run in the 1,000-seat theater have been hard to
find.</TE>
<TE>   So when the Taper looked for an alternative site for "My Old
Lady," a move to the Doolittle looked mutually advantageous to Center
Theatre Group and Montalban Nosotros.</TE>
<TE>   It was helpful in more ways than Nosotros President Jerry Velasco
initially envisioned. The Taper brought technical staff members who
knew the facility well and spotted some improvements that needed to
be made: painting, patching, cleaning, carpeting, plumbing. They
replaced an unsafe pipe that crossed the stage, Velasco said.
"Instead of them asking me where things were, I was asking them."</TE>
<TE>   Nosotros paid for a few of the improvements, and the cost of new
carpeting was split, Velasco said. But he estimated that Center
Theatre Group spent at least $40,000 on the improvements. That
organization's general manager, Douglas Baker, said only that the
cost was "significantly more than a few thousand dollars." The
foundation gave Center Theatre Group a discount of one-third off what
it hopes will be its eventual rental rate.</TE>
<TE>   A brief run of "Paquito's Christmas" at the Doolittle was moved
from Dec. 14-24 to Dec. 7-17 to accommodate the "My Old Lady"
schedule, Velasco said, but in return "Paquito's Christmas" was able
to use some of the Taper's lights.</TE>
<TE>   After "My Old Lady," the foundation hopes to renovate the face of
the theater back to its 1927 appearance, when it was called the Vine
Street Theatre. Then the plan is to rename the venue after Montalban,
in time for what Velasco hopes will be the grand opening of a new
production of Luis Valdez's "Zoot Suit" later this year. But "Zoot
Suit" is still just in the talking stage at this point, Velasco said.</TE>
<TE>   Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson disputes the necessity of
redoing the current facade, which dates to the UCLA/Center Theatre
Group takeover of the theater. It provided an improved marquee and,
with its high-tech metallic look, was "a nod to modernity," he
said--even though it drew some critical brickbats.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hoped that if I scraped the walls back, I would find the
look of a wonderful 19th century theater," Davidson said, "but it
isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like all that metal," Velasco responded. "And some people
feel that the original is still there, plastered over." He said that
a new facade might cost $400,000 but said he is confident the sum
could be raised. However, Velasco said the foundation is also
considering a proposal "to put neon on the pipes for an Art Deco
look" that would cost only about $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   PANTAGES FOR "PRODUCERS"?: All current signs point to the Pantages
Theatre in Hollywood as the future home of the L.A. run of "The
Producers."</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "The Producers" refuse to comment, perhaps
because they don't want to appear to be rushing "The Lion King" out
of the Pantages.</TE>
<TE>   However, Center Theatre Group producer Davidson said the Pantages
won the bid over his own Ahmanson Theatre because the grosses would
be higher at the 2,700-seat Pantages than they would be at the
2,100-seat Ahmanson. He said the current desire of the producers of
"The Producers" is to play 30 weeks here--a chunk of time that would
pose some problems not only for the Ahmanson, which has a
subscription season to manage, but also for the 3,500-seat Kodak
Theatre, which is programmed primarily around shorter runs.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, "Lion King" producer Disney Theatrical partitioned
off the rear mezzanine of the Pantages, temporarily reducing capacity
from 2,704 to 2,261, in what it described as an attempt to extend the
run of "The Lion King" for another year by reducing supply--which
could delay the arrival of "The Producers."</TE>
<TE>   COLONY SEASON: The Colony Theatre Company has scheduled more
adventurous programming than usual for its first season using the
full 276-seat capacity of its new home at Burbank Center Stage.</TE>
<TE>   The season will open June 1-30 with the premiere of "Beautiful in
the Extreme," a play about Lewis and Clark, by Leon Martell, best
known for his associations with the Padua Hills Playwrights Festival
and the comedy troupe Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Next will be the L.A. premiere of the recent Broadway revision of
"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown," running Aug. 10-Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. premiere of David Lindsay-Abaire's "Fuddy Meers" is
slated for Oct. 19-Nov. 17. For the last two years in a row, "Fuddy
Meers" was on American Theatre magazine's annual list of the 10 most
produced plays (not counting Shakespeare and "A Christmas
Carol")--and it was the only play on the lists that had not been
scheduled for an L.A.-area production.</TE>
<TE>   "The Laramie Project," based on research in Wyoming after the
killing of Matthew Shepard and seen last summer at La Jolla
Playhouse, is scheduled for its L.A. premiere Feb. 8-March 9, 2003 at
the Colony.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth show, April 12-May 11, 2003, has yet to be picked.</TE>
<TE>   Colony producing director Barbara Beckley said the fact that the
Colony now uses Actors' Equity contracts has opened up the rights to
plays that would not otherwise have been available, such as "Fuddy
Meers" and "The Laramie Project."</TE>
<TE>   URBAN BROADWAY SERIES: David E. Talbert, a writer and producer of
many of the African American touring shows that have played major
markets in recent years, is launching a new Urban Broadway Series
that he hopes will win subscribers in five cities, including L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert will present his shows in theaters owned or managed by
Clear Channel Entertainment, including L.A.'s Wiltern, which has
previously been the site of Talbert's shows. The series will open
with a romantic musical comedy, "Love Makes Things Happen," beginning
in Baltimore and scheduled for April 29-May 12 at the Wiltern.
Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds will be the executive producer, along with
Talbert.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert said that film director Robert Townsend will co-write and
stage "If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time," described as "a
gospel whodunit," which will start touring in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   A subscription series of the next three offerings will begin in
early 2003. The other cities, besides Baltimore and L.A., are
Washington, Philadelphia and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert moved to L.A. last summer because of his increasing
involvement with the Hollywood scene, he said. Another L.A. figure,
not part of the Hollywood scene, is also part of the Urban Broadway
Series. Bishop Noel Jones, an L.A.-based Pentecostal minister, is an
investor and will monitor the content of some of the shows "to make
sure they're spiritual," Talbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert's shows will continue to be nonunion productions, even
though the word "Broadway" in the series title might indicate
otherwise. However, Talbert said tickets to his shows will cost $25
or $35, far below usual Broadway prices, and he said he offers
opportunities to black actors and musicians that are seldom available
on Broadway "unless they're dancing or dressed up like animals in
'The Lion King.'"</TE>

<HD>A Tempest of Success</HD>
<DH>Juan Formell has kept Los Van Van at the forefront of Cuban
music for more than 30 years, but a deal gone bad with a U.S. label
raises doubts about the band's future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been five years since the first U.S.tour by Los Van Van, the
vanguard of dance bands in Cuba for three decades. To fans who
followed its once-banned music like a cult, the group's arrival on
these shores during the winter of 1996-97 felt monumental, like the
fall of the Berlin Wall.</LD>
<LD>   The legendary group swept through Yanqui territory in a six-city
blitz, including New York and Los Angeles, offering performances so
electrifying that fans still buzz about them today. Hard-core
devotees hopped planes to catch the nearest shows by the fun, funky
and influential Afro-Cuban orchestra, founded in 1969 by composer and
arranger Juan Formell.</LD>
<LD>   The thrill of that triumphant tour was heightened by the political
and social breakthrough it represented. For decades, Van Van and
other popular Cuban bands had been barred from performing in the U.S.
by this country's economic embargo of the socialist island.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to the Clinton administration, a new policy toward cultural
exchanges further loosened the old Cold War barriers that had already
started to erode. Van Van's heady, early success raised hopes that
doors would finally open for other progressive Cuban bands, known for
much more challenging and sophisticated music than the formulaic
salsa coming from New York and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van, whose previous albums were sold in the U.S. as imports or
released by small independent labels, made another breakthrough by
signing its first long-term recording contract with a company outside
of Cuba, where the record industry is government controlled. Its new
label, New York-based Havana Caliente, had a distribution deal with
powerhouse Atlantic Records.</TE>
<TE>   After playing to a delirious reception at the 1997 Playboy Jazz
Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, flutist and founding member Gerardo
Miro said, "We hugged and kissed each other because we knew we had
finally arrived. Our feeling was, 'We're finally in the market! Now
let's see what happens.'"</TE>
<TE>   What happened next nobody could have predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van's foray into the U.S. market became mired in setbacks. The
band's music was all but boycotted by Latin radio programmers for
political reasons. In addition, the progressive band was blindsided
by the sudden craze in this country for old-style Cuban ensembles
such as the Buena Vista Social Club, an outfit as different from Van
Van as Dixieland is from Miles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, for nearly two years Van Van has been locked in a dispute
with Havana Caliente and its owner, a Cuban American businesswoman
named Maria Zenoz. The conflict is almost as complex as U.S-Cuba
relations, but the result is that Los Van Van has not been back in
the studio in three years, much longer than fans are used to. To top
it off, several members have left the band in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has survived defections before, Formell is now the
last of Van Van's original key lineup, and his band faces a future
more ambiguous than ever. Instead of expanding their horizons, Van
Van and other contemporary Cuban bands have retrenched on the island,
especially following the Sept. 11 attacks, which led to tour
cancellations in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Juan Formell and Los Van Van reflects the passion and
purpose that for almost a century have fueled popular Cuban music, a
genre whose worldwide influence outstrips its commercial strength.
Yet, the band's struggles for wider U.S. acceptance also highlight
the obstacles facing the island's promising new music, which has
taken much stronger hold in countries such as Spain, England and
Italy with normal trade ties with Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van may have missed its golden opportunity for a breakthrough
in this prized market, a setback that might have demoralized other
bandleaders approaching their golden years. But while Formell may
falter, his persistence keeps alive the prospect that more people in
this country may yet come to appreciate modern Afro-Cuban music,
which bewitches fans once it finds them.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview by phone from his home in Havana, Formell, 59,
says his health is good and he sees a reinvigorated future for Van
Van--including two new albums on the way, one live and one studio
recording with 12 new songs.</TE>
<TE>   "The band is better than ever, according to the public here in
Cuba," he says in his melodic, rapid-fire Cuban Spanish. "We have new
musicians who are very young but better prepared, and who work under
my direction with enormous enthusiasm.... Van Van has a new sound, a
much more professional sound than it had before."</TE>
<TE>   Although skeptics are now counting Van Van out, die-hard
vanvaneros--as followers of the band are known--realize that it's
never a good gamble to underestimate Formell.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rolling Stones sort of rested on their laurels, but Formell,
every few years, he'd get back on the cutting edge and write the
latest thing that was driving everybody crazy," says Kevin Moore, a
Northern California musician, writer and obsessive vanvanero. "The
whole debate is: Does Formell still have it? Is Van Van going to be
able to do it one more time, or is it going to go downhill?</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, how long can this guy stay on top?"</TE>
<TE>   According to a joke circulating in Cuba, Castro dies and returns
to Earth 100 years from now. The Cuban leader is shocked to learn
that nobody remembers his name. He asks a student, a teacher, a
librarian, and they don't know who he was. So he opens the
encyclopedia and looks himself up.</TE>
<TE>   Castro, Fidel: President of Cuba during the time Los Van Van was
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Like all good jokes, this one contains a kernel of truth. Today,
Formell is one of the most influential figures on the island,
culturally if not politically. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he
was the first bandleader to demand payment in dollars rather than
Cuban currency. More than any dry edict, his move signaled Cuba's
gradual, albeit reluctant move away from old-style, centralized
communism.</TE>
<TE>   The message: As Van Van goes, so goes Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The secret to the band's longevity in Cuba's intensely competitive
music scene lies in its ability to reflect the conditions and changes
in Cuban society. Few other songwriters have Formell's populist
knack. In every passing period, his witty songs have captured the
mood and sentiments of the people on the street. His catchy
coros--those repeated call-and-response lines so essential in
Afro-Cuban music--enter into the island's vernacular just like ad
slogans do in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'80s, Van Van had a hit song about a failed romance
called "Se Acabo el Querer," which roughly means "love is gone." It
was a rare composition by singer Pedro Calvo. The harmonized, laconic
coro added the idea that "nobody loves nobody" in this refrain:
"Nadie quiere a nadie; se acabo el querer."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Cubans picked up the coro to express all sorts of
frustrations. If a bus didn't stop to pick up passengers or if
somebody failed to show for an appointment, the disappointed parties
would say, "Bueno, se acabo el querer." You see, there's no more
love.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase became so popular, in fact, that it drew the ire of a
party-line ideologue who wrote a column in an official government
organ denouncing the Van Van tune. The strict critic declared it an
outrage for anybody to say that love has vanished from a socialist
society, because socialism is based on love.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van's simple song had turned into political heresy by its very
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, the band's hits have kept in tune with Cuba's
revolutionary policies. The mysterious and slightly menacing "Que
Palo Es Ese," also from the 1980s, overtly expresses solidarity with
that decade's leftist struggles in El Salvador and Nicaragua, calling
on powerful imagery from an Afro-Cuban religion called Palo, which
also means "stick" or "club" in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The group's occasional politically tinged tune combined with
Formell's prominence in Cuba have fueled a musical backlash from
anti-Castro forces who charge that the band is aligned with the
revolution. This explains why the opposition to Van Van's appearance
in Miami two years ago was so intense, although other Cuban bands had
already performed there with little outcry from exile groups.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van, in short, is special to both its fans and its foes.</TE>
<TE>   The group's odd name added to its revolutionary aura. Literally,
it means "They go, they go," leading some American writers to make
the silly translation: the Go-Gos. The name actually comes from a
phrase that, as Formell has explained, was popular in Cuba during the
late 1960s, when he was first forming his band.</TE>
<TE>   The political connotation attached because the Castro government
used the phrase as a slogan in its campaign to hit a goal of 10
million tons in the sugar crop of 1969-70: "Los 10 millions van ... y
de que van, van." The repetition is for emphasis, to underscore a
sure thing: The harvest will go, and go it will.</TE>
<TE>   Formell now insists he didn't choose the name for political
reasons. He just picked up the popular phrase of the day, as he has
for years in many songs.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba never made its sugar crop goal, but Los Van Van debuted in
Havana on Dec. 4, 1969. Since then, the band has reaped rich musical
harvest year after year.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Formell Cortina was born Aug. 2, 1942, the son of a musician
who doubled as a tailor to make ends meet and discouraged his son at
first from becoming a musician. He received little formal musical
training as a child, in contrast to the next generation of musicians
who would come up through the socialist education system.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, the year Castro came to power, the young Formell got a
job playing bass in the National Revolutionary Police Band. It was
there he met Orestes Lopez, a member of the famous family of bass men
that includes Cachao, who now lives in Miami. Formell learned much
from Orestes about the instrument he would master as the rhythmic
backbone of Los Van Van.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, Formell quickly became known as a skillful
composer, with some of his early songs recorded by romantic vocalist
Elena Burke. Always a restless innovator, Formell was already working
on a new rhythm he called songo, a mix of son and soul, with a dash
of rock and reggae, which would become the trademark beat of Los Van
Van.</TE>
<TE>   At first, nobody knew what to make of Van Van. Its sound was
entirely new, incorporating elements of traditional Latin ballads,
American jazz and British pop.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the band's early music sounds dated and even corny, with
its cheesy reverbs and twangy guitars. But the group was an instant
hit, and soon Van Van was performing in Tokyo, Paris and Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Formell's fearless experimentation and relentless search for new
sounds proved to be the band's greatest appeal. With Van Van, music
lovers never knew what might come next, rhythmically, melodically or
thematically.</TE>
<TE>   "Their sound has never been stagnant, that's why they were able to
stay on top," says Arturo Gomez, music director of public radio
station WDNA-FM in Miami, which used to get threats for playing Van
Van and other music from Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   One constant was the strong songwriting by Formell and pianist
Cesar Pedroso. They wrote hooks and told real-life stories with a
spirit of playful parody, filling songs with characters and
situations people can readily relate to.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van sang about the middle-aged men tempted by younger women to
abandon their sense of social responsibility ("La Titimania"). About
the disorienting drift toward free-market capitalism in the '90s ("Un
Socio"). About the ungrateful guests who drink and eat at weddings,
then knock their host ("La Resolucion)."</TE>
<TE>   For Formell, though, his music's main ingredient is the rhythm,
grounded solidly in Afro-Cuban traditions.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Van Van has kept up with the times, he says, is that
he's always kept one eye on the dancers. When he noticed they needed
a different groove, he'd give it to them. That's how the band
evolved--from the feet up.</TE>
<TE>   Until the recent cultural opening, U.S. fans had followed Van Van
like a secret cult, swapping records with other vanvaneros as if the
albums were precious contraband. Some flew to Cancun, Mexico, to
catch the band at Disco Azucar, a classy nightclub made famous by the
band's song of the same name. The more adventurous made illicit
pilgrimages to Havana to see Van Van at its best, which is live.</TE>
<TE>   Although the general public was oblivious to the band in the early
days, the hippest salsa musicians in the U.S. were picking up on its
sound, partly during tours in Latin America. Several Van Van tunes
were recorded by top salsa bands of the '70s and '80s in New York,
including Tipica 73 ("La Candela"), Ray Barretto ("Guarare") and
Ruben Blades ("Muevete"). In Puerto Rico, meanwhile, the
ultra-progressive Batacumbele was playing songo on its debut 1981
album, and even taking Van Van's emerging style an extra step.</TE>
<TE>   But while U.S. salsa faded and never fully recovered, the Cuban
music scene just kept growing. By the early 1990s, Cuban music had
exploded on the island, with a host of new bands searching hungrily
for new sounds and distinct identities. The music was changing so
fast, people came up with a new name for it. They called it timba,
the pinnacle of polyrhythmic Afro-Cuban percussion combined with
elements of rap and jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Although the roots of the new style can be traced to early Van
Van, the movement was officially born in 1988 with the emergence of
NG La Banda, an enormously influential band started by flutist and
arranger Jose Luis Cortes, a former founding member of Formell's
group.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Van Van was almost 20 years old. Some feared Formell
would be left behind by the movement he helped create.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Van Van recorded a lackluster album, the one containing
"Azucar." Although it had a pair of hits, the work sounded listless
and tedious against the aggressive competition from the young Turks.
It would be the last album featuring Van Van's legendary
percussionist, Jose Luis "Changuito" Quintana, the one most
responsible for developing the group's intricate new drumming using
timbales combined with American drums.</TE>
<TE>   Formell was turning 50, and observers predicted Van Van's demise.
But he soon restructured the band, recruiting his son Samuel as a
surprisingly powerful replacement for Quintana, then adding two
dynamic singers, Mario Rivera and Roberto Hernandez, each with
thrilling improvisational skills.</TE>
<TE>   Around the time of its U.S. debut, the band recorded "Te Pone La
Cabeza Mala," its fourth album of the decade, each better than the
one before. The title cut showed such a mastery of the new aggressive
rhythms that it's now considered a timba template.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van was back with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Havana Caliente was launched in March 1999 with a splashy party at
New York's Bowery Ballroom showcasing another top act from Cuba,
Adalberto Alvarez. It was open bar all night, with dancing waitresses
dressed in miniskirts. For the first time since Columbia Records
released albums by Irakere two decades earlier, a major U.S. company
was putting production quality and marketing know-how behind music
made in Cuba. Van Van's polished and powerful first album for the
label--appropriately titled "Llego Van Van: Van Van Is Here"--was
released in August of that year. It won a Grammy for best salsa
album, an industry laurel that seemed to bestow legitimacy on
musicians reviled by anti-Communist exiles as frontmen for Fidel
Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Zenoz, the Cuban American businesswoman who had worked in New York
as a record promoter and nightclub owner, founded the label with a
partner, Adam Lindemann, heir to a cable and cell phone fortune
amassed by George Lindemann Sr.</TE>
<TE>   The investors made room for their fledgling label in Lindemann's
sumptuous corporate offices, which had spectacular views of Central
Park from the 50th floor of the former General Motors building. The
impression of wealth and power was dazzling, especially for Cuban
musicians accustomed to austerity back home.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the most glamorous offices you've ever seen," says
Veronica Gonzalez, a Los Angeles publicist who worked for the label.
"We were in there with all these Wall Street guys. It was the
craziest thing."</TE>
<TE>   It was quickly going to get a lot crazier.</TE>
<TE>   In less than six months, Zenoz and her partner were engaged in
open warfare over the business. The tension between them would erupt
even during meetings with outsiders, industry sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Lindemann was aggressive about getting a return on his investment.
Zenoz was stubborn about spending what was needed to break the acts,
although Gonzalez says expenses quickly got out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there was somebody there calculating the daily losses
and telling [Lindemann], 'You see, you should have put your money in
soy beans,'" says Elena Pena, a San Francisco-based promoter who
worked with the label on U.S. tours for Los Van Van and other Cuban
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Lindemann did not respond to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Zenoz, who was pregnant at the time, says the stress caused her to
have a miscarriage.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle of the fighting, I lost my child," says Zenoz, who
later gave birth to a daughter fathered by Charlie Dos Santos, Havana
Caliente's record producer, who was also father of the baby she lost.
"Apart from running the company, I had to put up with more than
anyone could ever tell you."</TE>
<TE>   The meltdown came in February 2000, right after Van Van won the
Grammy. The last of the label's small staff was laid off, and Zenoz
says she was shut out of Lindemann's offices.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in and told everybody to get out," says Zenoz, who
dropped from sight for an extended period. "He locked up everything
so we could not operate.... They confiscated all the mail. Listen, to
this day, I don't even have my computer. I never got it back."</TE>
<TE>   The label, launched with such panache and anticipation, had not
even made it to its first anniversary. Zenoz says she can't fully
explain why things fell apart so fast, especially because the label
grossed $1.2 million in less than six months. "I have nightmares over
this," she says. "We had a viable company, good product, we were
doing well. We had just got up to bat. We had the entire game ahead
of us ... and then, phew!"</TE>
<TE>   Zenoz says she has negotiated a split with Lindemann, allowing her
to keep Caliente Entertainment's publishing and recording assets. She
says she now is sole owner of Havana Caliente and its masters,
including "Llego Van Van." And she insists she plans to hold Formell
and other artists to their existing contracts, which she says are
still valid.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zenoz no longer has a distribution deal with Atlantic,
she is planning new releases for 2002, including a new album by Buena
Vista alumnus Barbarito Torres. She says she and Dos Santos plan to
travel to Havana this month to finalize the recording.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether Zenoz can still operate on the island,
where some observers say she has burned her bridges. Cuban officials
still hold a tight rein on the record business, and are capable of
suspending a band's right to perform or withholding its exit visas.</TE>
<TE>   "She wouldn't have a chance in Cuba, because Formell has so much
power there," says Jimmy Maslon, owner of Ahi-Nama Music, the Los
Angeles-based Cuban music label.</TE>
<TE>   Formell's Spanish speeds up even more when asked about his
troubles with Zenoz and Havana Caliente. The bandleader says the
label didn't properly promote the album in the United Sates, and
didn't even make it available in Europe and Latin America. Strangely,
"Llego Van Van" was never officially released in Cuba either, except
as a bootleg, which is like a Beatles album not being released in
Britain.</TE>
<TE>   "They have caused us great harm, and I don't have the words to
explain the job that was done on the Van Van orchestra," says
Formell, who suffers from diabetes. "It was something so dirty, so
ugly, so horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Formell even speculates that anti-Castro exile forces in the
United States may have paid off Zenoz to sabotage the album in order
to neutralize Van Van and thereby deal a blow to the Cuban music
industry. "I don't have any evidence in hand," he says, "but there
must be some sort of underhanded maneuver to destroy the band's
prestige, because I can't think of any other explanation for what
happened. It's a very strange thing, very odd."</TE>
<TE>   In the most surprising twist of a convoluted tale, Formell says
his contract with Havana Caliente is unenforceable because the label
violated the U.S. embargo against Cuba. How? By producing his band's
album in Havana. He says the embargo only allows U.S. companies to
distribute works already in existence, an interpretation that may be
too narrow, according to private and government lawyers familiar with
the law.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Treasury Department, U.S. companies can seek a
license to legally produce music in Cuba. In general, lawyers say,
it's also legal for companies here to distribute records by Cuban
artists signed to firms in third countries. In Havana Caliente's
case, Van Van and the other acts were signed to Harbour Bridge, a
company in Curacao.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Formell's allegation amounts to a wicked boomerang from a
bandleader whose own career has been stymied by the embargo for 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   Zenoz, speaking from her home in Miami, says the label broke no
laws and did everything by the book, with contracts reviewed by a
battalion of U.S. attorneys. She says the label's internal problems
did not hurt the band. She notes that Formell got a generous
six-figure advance, more than Cuban musicians ever dreamed of, and
the album was strongly promoted, with a full-page ad in Billboard,
the industry trade journal, and prominent display at major music
retailers.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, she plans to release a new live package of her own,
featuring Van Van's notorious 1999 Miami concert, which was marked by
violent anti-Castro protests. It's perhaps the last recorded
performance by the group's old lineup, and Zenoz says she plans to
release it as a double CD and video by this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Over his dead body, says Formell. He vows to sue to stop the
album, arguing also that his contract with Havana Caliente is void
because Zenoz failed to exercise the second option for a new release
by last year's deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want is to get out of that company and do my new record in
peace," says the embattled bandleader, "because I have worked all my
career with too much tranquillity for this woman to come at this
stage in my life and ruin it all."</TE>
<TE>   Fusion, says Formell, is the future.</TE>
<TE>   That's an anticlimactic prediction from a man who practically
invented the concept in Cuba three decades ago. Yet, he keeps looking
for that perfect blend.</TE>
<TE>   Van Van's new studio album, to be titled "Van Van en Sol Natural,"
is due out in Cuba next month and will feature a new mix of American
country music, jazz and R&amp;B. Four of the new songs will also appear
on the live album from a summer concert in Havana, "Van Van en La
Piragua," which he says will be released this month in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Formell--who lives comfortably in the Cuban capital with his new
wife, Diana, 34, his Dalmatian, named Songo, and his collection of
frog figurines--says his new music sounds much more international
than before.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure we're going to win more fans, because this is a renewed
Van Van," says Formell, whose school-aged daughter, Paloma, is a
talented pianist.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Van Van can regain its momentum in the U.S. is far from a
sure thing, however.</TE>
<TE>   Formell admits that the band briefly lost its footing when it lost
pianist and arranger "Pupy" Pedroso, who had been a quiet cornerstone
of the group, the Keith Richards to Formell's Mick Jagger. Gone too
is Calvo, the charismatic lead singer who, more than any single
member, had come to symbolize what it meant to be Van Van, with his
husky voice, swaggering sexuality and white, wide-brimmed hat.
Meanwhile, Cubans have not been totally enthusiastic about two new
singers Formell brought on board last year, including Van Van's first
female vocalist, Yeni Valdes.</TE>
<TE>   But Formell now says the recent defectors did the band a favor by
making room again for new blood.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Van Van and its brand of the new Cuban music still
have their fanatical core of followers, but it faces the same
obstacles to airplay and wider acceptance. Many salsa fans offer
myriad reasons for not liking it: The songs are too long, the lyrics
use too much Cuban slang, the coros are too complicated. And worst of
all, they say they can't dance to it because the beat is so different
from the formula salsa played in New York and L.A. clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much happening, musically speaking, the regular person
doesn't understand it," says George Rivera, a retired New York City
policeman and freelance music writer. "It's just not their groove.
There's too much change [within each song]. Too much to remember."</TE>
<TE>   But even in Cuba, where popular tastes are as evolved as the
music, Van Van's fate is not assured.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on what Juan Formell does from here on out," says
Pedro de la Hoz, culture critic for Granma, the official Cuban daily.
"He'll have to find a new record label and shake up his repertoire.
Today, the orchestra is still seen as a living myth, but the same
thing could happen to them as to Orquesta Aragon [the classic Cuban
band from the 1950s that is still together]. That is, Van Van could
start to be seen as a musical artifact, like some archeological
legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it won't be like that."</TE>

<TE>   Los Van Van on CD</TE>
<TE>   Here are some recommended Los Van Van albums. Many are available
from major retailers, but you have to shop around. You can also try
online stores featuring Latin music such as Descarga.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Llego Van Van: Van Van Is Here," Havana Caliente, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The group's best-sounding recording with the best-looking package.
The title cut is an instant classic, and Juan Formell's electrifying,
spoken vocal on "Appapas del Calabar," a primer on secret Afro-Cuban
religious rituals, sounds positively possessed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Te Pone La Cabeza Mala," Metro Blue, 1997</TE>
<TE>   Worth it for the title cut alone, a timba masterpiece. The entire
album is lyrically sophisticated and musically stylish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Ay, Dios, Amparame," Caribe Productions, 1995</TE>
<TE>   The title is an appeal to God for help, taken from the cut "Soy
Todo," a spiritual poem about Cuban identity turned here into a
gripping cry for the country's future. Makes exiled Cubans weep at
concerts. As for the rest of the album, hey, everybody dance and have
a good time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Lo Ultimo En Vivo,"</TE>
<TE>   Obadisc, 1994TDRecorded live at Havana's famous outdoor dance
venue, Salon Rosado, this captures some of the energy of the band's
performances, though under bad technical conditions. The songs are
uniformly strong.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "30 Years of Cuba's Greatest Dance Band," Ashe, 1999</TE>
<TE>   This two-CD set is by far the best of many compilations, from
earliest songs to the latest. Comes with an attractive, 106-page
booklet, but beware of the occasional misspelling and wrong date.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Songo," Mango Island, 1988</TE>
<TE>   Recorded in Paris and contains sparkling versions of hits from the
1980s, less gritty but technically much improved from the originals.
Has the best rendition of "Sandunguera," the band's catchy dance
classic from the era.</TE>

<DH>Let others talk about his legacy. Arthur Mitchell's Dance
Theatre of Harlem has new work to develop.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 25, 2001, Dance Theatre of Harlem opened its season in New
York City with four premieres by choreographers long associated with
the company--by any standard, a lot of new work for a dance program.
Three of those new dances--Laveen Naidu's "Virra," Robert Garland's
"New Bach" and Lowell Smith's "Pas de Deux for Phygia and
Spartacus"--will be performed during the company's engagement Friday
through next Sunday at Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<LD>   The opening-night performance in New York marked another first for
the company: Onstage at City Center, it was announced that Dance
Theatre of Harlem would get a new name, Arthur Mitchell's Dance
Theatre of Harlem.</LD>
<LD>   And no one was more surprised by the announcement than Mitchell,
artistic director and founder of the company. "Oh, yeah, I didn't
know anything about it," he said with a laugh during a recent
conversation with The Times. "Many people said, 'We've very rarely
seen you at a loss for words,' but I was just bowled over."</LD>
<TE>   In 1955, Mitchell became the first African American male dancer in
a major classical ballet company when he joined New York City Ballet,
where he would perform lead roles for 15 years, including several
created for him by company artistic director George Balanchine. Upon
learning of the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968,
Mitchell was moved to jettison his successful performing career to
found Dance Theatre of Harlem, a haven for African American ballet
dancers that has, during the past 15 years, redefined itself as a
multicultural company.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 30 years at the helm, Mitchell, 67, reflected on
how the dance world has changed, how Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theatre
of Harlem has changed, and how the company plans to face a future
rendered uncertain by the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You were busy working on a film project this week. What
was that?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The Balanchine Foundation was filming, or maybe I should
say recording, as many people as they could [talking about] ballets
that were created or choreographed for them. So they asked me about
the "Agon" pas de deux, which was created for me by Mr. Balanchine
and Mr. Stravinsky. Things change over a period of time, and they are
trying to preserve as much of the original choreography as they can.</TE>
<TE>   Q: This year, looking back at your career seems to have become a
theme of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   A: [Laughing] Well, it may be to everyone else, but I am looking
forward to what I am going to be doing! But yes, we have titled our
season "Living the Legacy," exploring how I am passing on the legacy
of dance to the young people here; that was the theme of our season
at City Center.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your legacy will be more apparent now, with the renaming of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   A: Although people have started saying "Arthur Mitchell's Dance
Theatre of Harlem," the actual change of the name has not happened,
because we just have not had the chance to deal with all the changing
of the notes and the bylaws, amendments and resolutions. But it was a
great honor, actually.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The new name raises the question: Can the company live on
beyond you?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, I always planned for Dance Theatre of Harlem to go on
beyond me. Most companies exist primarily to do the choreography of
[the namesake] choreographer. That's never really been my goal. We
have a wide, varied repertoire that needs to be danced; it wasn't
just a haven for me to choreograph my work.</TE>
<TE>   We have the infrastructure [so] that the organization can go on.
We've brought in a CEO, we've got a director of development, a
director of administration and human resources, marketing director,
special events person. Artistically, the company has always been very
well known and very well accepted, but there is a point where I was
doing everything, and they said, "No matter how wonderful you are,
you've got to start putting things in place, because you are 67 years
old." Many people felt that there was too much power in the hands of
one person, and if I got hit by a car, the organization would go
under.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you thinking about retiring?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. It's not even a question.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I read somewhere that you first appeared on stage 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   A: [Laughs] 52.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How has the world of classical ballet changed?</TE>
<TE>   A: The whole world, the whole field has changed. The thing is,
when I started Dance Theatre of Harlem, I was the only African
American male dancer in a major ballet company, that's No. 1. Now, I
do see all of the companies have integrated, whether they've got
Hispanic or Asian or African American dancers in their companies, and
that is a major, major, major step. Then the theory that blacks
couldn't do classical ballet, I think that's been disproven.</TE>
<TE>   About 12, 14 years after I established the company, I realized
again that I was setting up a barrier; I felt that our company should
reflect the society that we live in, so we integrated. The company is
mostly African American, but you will see Caucasian people in the
company, Asian people in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It still doesn't seem like there are very many minority dancers
in classical ballet companies.</TE>
<TE>   A: No. But you see, the thing is, if you have 100 Caucasians
studying dance, 10 will make it. If you only have 10 minority
students studying dance, one is going to make it. That's the natural
ratio of the fallout. I don't think any choreographer, if he sees a
phenomenal dancer, is going to turn him or her down because of color.</TE>
<TE>   Q: We're used to seeing Dance Theatre of Harlem in Los Angeles
every year or so, but it's certainly unusual to see so much new work.</TE>
<TE>   A: We took four choreographers out of the company and they
choreographed the world premieres, and they were presented together
on the opening night in New York. It was a very daring thing to do,
because for some it was their first major, large work, even though
they had choreographed before. But I wanted to show that, aside from
turning out dancers, we also are turning out choreographers, because
there is such a great need for choreographers that are working in the
classical vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   They all have their own look. "Virra," pronounced "Vee-RAH," is
the Sanskrit word for brave. Mr. Naidu did that--that's built on
speed, the use of classical technique and speed. Robert Garland
worked with Bach, but he called it "New Bach," because Bach is one of
the forefathers of jazz and syncopation, and he took some of the
urban street dances that the kids are doing now and coupled that with
classical dancing. So it's a new interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you hope that some of your dancers will become the main
choreographers for the company?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh yes, that's why we're developing them. They know the
dancers, they know each other, they know the working habits of the
organization. Even though we give some young choreographers from
outside a chance, it's wonderful to have some that are inside the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: For the opening night in New York, the tension must have been
high, so soon after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes--because first of all, starting on the 14th of September,
we were to have performed at the World Trade Center. And then two
weeks after the attacks, we were to open our New York City season. We
decided to go ahead with the season, knowing full well that we would
lose an awful of lot of money--but that we felt that was our mission
and mandate, and we must do it. I think seven Broadway shows closed
that weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Funds have been pouring into the Sept. 11 Fund, and it's been a
tremendous hardship on the arts organizations. The tourists that
weren't coming, and grants that were to be looked at in September,
October, November, were being pushed off into May, June and July.
Very few companies have that kind of cash flow to exist. We go from
hand to mouth all the time, so there was a tremendous effect on all
of us, and many of the smallest organizations will just go under. I
know we've lost a lot of money, in ticket sales and sponsorships, but
we're hoping to recoup all that by the end of this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With all these premieres, it must have been a particularly
expensive period too.</TE>
<TE>   A: Right. Going into it, we were depending on sponsorship and
grants and things like that, and they all got changed--I wouldn't say
canceled, but they all got changed at that moment, and so that just
added to the financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   You just have to quadruple your fund-raising efforts. Because
tourism is such a major part of this city, a lot of foundations are
now coming forward and giving money for dance companies to help
support them through these times, so that there will be something for
tourists to see other than ground zero, when they get here.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You don't perform onstage anymore, but do you dance at all?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I had both of my hips replaced a year and a half ago. But I
still move--this morning I was up teaching and moving around, and
everyone says, "My God, you look fantastic!"</TE>
<TE>   And I was very fortunate, in the Olympic torch relay, carrying the
flame from Greece to Salt Lake City, they asked me to carry the
flame--Dick Parsons [Richard D. Parsons, newly named chief executive
of AOL Time Warner] and myself carried it through Harlem, on Dec. 26.
I got caught up in the throes of it, and I was running down the
street, and then in the middle of it, I said to myself: "Wait a
minute, Mitchell, are you crazy?" But that was very exciting. It's
the link with history, with what it represents, and you just forget
about yourself and you start going."</TE>

<HD>Lost From Club to Classroom</HD>
<DH>More jazz artists are emerging from schools, not the school
of hard knocks. But gigs can teach so much the academy can't.</DH>

<LD>Jazz drummer Art Blakey's bands were often referred to by
musicians--affectionately--as "the University of Art" and "the School
of Swing." Steaming caldrons of on-the-job training, they served as
musical incubators for a range of talent stretching from Wayne
Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Jackie McLean to Keith Jarrett, Branford
Marsalis and Terence Blanchard.</LD>
<LD>   Blakey was primarily active from the mid-'50s to the late '80s.
But his methodology was a reflection of a learning curve that reached
back to the earliest days of jazz, when education was an oral, and
aural, process in which mentorship played a crucial role. Players
learned from listening, modeling and imitating; they tested
themselves in the trenches, often supported by older, established
artists, occasionally risking their ire. (One of the most famous,
perhaps apocryphal, jazz stories describes an incident when a young
Charlie Parker, sitting in with some established seniors, had to duck
a flying cymbal, hurled at him by veteran drummer "Papa" Jo Jones as
a commentary on the quality of his alto saxophone playing.)</LD>
<TE>   It was a tough way to learn, but it obviously worked. Consider
that virtually all the great iconic figures of jazz--from Jelly Roll
Morton and Louis Armstrong to Miles Davis and John Coltrane--honed
their craft without the benefit of extended academic training. Yet no
one would question either the richness or the magnitude of their
contributions to the art.</TE>
<TE>   During the past half century or so, however, an academic approach
to the music has gradually become far more prominent. Starting slowly
as early as the '40s, with Len Bowden's pioneering training
activities for African American servicemen at the Great Lakes Naval
Station, educational efforts gradually surfaced in institutions such
as North Texas State University, the Berklee College of Music in
Boston and Los Angeles City College, which were among the first
institutions to offer accredited jazz courses.</TE>
<TE>   The process escalated during the next few decades via summer band
camps and an expansion of programs reaching from the junior high
school level into postgraduate college work. By the end of the
century, there were hundreds of thousands of youth ensembles ranging
from big bands to small combos. And the activities were not limited
to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, the International Assn. of Jazz Educators
concluded its 29th annual conference in Long Beach, with more than
7,000 attendees from 35 countries.</TE>
<TE>   What does all this academic jazz activity mean? Is the music being
more widely heard? Has it become a more significant presence in the
marketplace? Is there evidence of the emergence of more iconic
figures along the lines of Armstrong, Parker and Coltrane?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, unfortunately, is a qualified "no" on all counts.</TE>
<TE>   On radio, jazz is still heard almost exclusively on university and
public stations. With the exception of smooth jazz, that is, which
most observers in mainstream jazz view as instrumental pop. Nor has
jazz gained a larger portion of the CD market, continuing to occupy a
niche similar to that of classical music.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a jazz critic to note that iconic figures have
lately been in short supply. Yes, it's true Wynton Marsalis is the
jazz celebrity of choice. And with good reason, because his work with
Lincoln Center and his own prolific compositions have considerably
enhanced the music's visibility. But for all his skills as a composer
and his fluent ability to cross over to classical music, he would
probably be the first to acknowledge that as an improvising jazz
player, he has not established himself as an influential figure.</TE>
<TE>   So what about all this jazz education? What is it actually doing
for the music--and for the players?</TE>
<TE>   "I think, at the very least, that we're creating a larger, more
musically aware listening audience," says Dr. Ronald McCurdy,
president of the jazz educators group and a faculty member at USC's
Thornton School of Music. "Many of the kids in these programs will
not have ... professional careers in jazz, but they'll be aware and
appreciative of the music."</TE>
<TE>   That's all to the good, obviously. Toward that end, the four days
and nights of the educators' conference illustrated the extraordinary
range of musical experiences being offered in educational settings:
clinics in composing, arranging and improvisation; clinics focusing
on individual instruments, vocalists and rhythm sections;
professional and industry panels discussing every aspect of the
business of jazz; and teacher training.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that four evenings of performances by such world-class jazz
artists as Dave Brubeck, Greg Osby, Gary Burton, Al Dimeola, among
many others, and the role of jazz education as the foundation for the
creation of a wider, more sophisticated listening audience becomes
clear.</TE>
<TE>   But it still doesn't answer the question of what has been lost in
the shift from the on-the-job, mentored learning process to the
classroom teaching model.</TE>
<TE>   Although every musician has to step out of academia and onto a
stage to confront the realities of performance, the music that
emerges at that point is going to be colored, inevitably, by the life
experience that supports it. If there has been anything consistently
noticeable about players who are the product of the
jazz-in-the-schoolroom era, it is that their playing is more
admirable for its technical virtuosity than its emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, jazz--like all types of American popular music--has
been galvanized by a continuing flow of life experience and creative
energy from young African American artists. As rock, soul and rhythm
&amp; blues became commercially viable musical forms, it was almost
inevitable that they would attract talent that might otherwise have
moved into jazz. The increasing success of such subsequent forms as
rap and hip-hop in the '80s and '90s drew even more potentially vital
creative energy from jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Academia is not likely to draw that talent back to jazz. Nor is
the classroom likely to produce the sort of untrained but
spontaneously, explosively creative ideas that have driven jazz into
ever more revelatory areas of expression.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, McCurdy is right in his belief that a growing
audience of listeners familiar with the process of making jazz is
good for the music. In addition, he is correct in his belief, as many
studies affirm, that the presence of this music has distinctly
positive social consequences. And the educators group is right on
target with its efforts to expand those benefits--despite unfortunate
government cutbacks dating to the early '80s--into every area of
education.</TE>
<TE>   But the essential dilemma of jazz as an art poised on the razor's
edge between art and commerce remains. It may be that fact alone that
makes it so difficult to assess the real value of academic education
to the creative process.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz would surely benefit from a more realistic appraisal of its
significance as America's true classical music. The sort of support
provided to European concert music--and the kind Marsalis has
established for jazz at Lincoln Center--would help move the music
into the position it deserves within American cultural life. That
positioning would integrate well with the work being done by the many
dedicated jazz educators around the country (and the world).</TE>
<TE>   But it would be a shame if jazz, by separating itself too sharply
from its roots in the turbulent currents of American urban society,
were to become--as contemporary classical music largely has--a child
of polished academia.</TE>
<TE>   A musician friend once told me, after performing in a concert
theater, "It was cool, man, but--and I hate to say it--I kind of
missed being in a club, with all the talking and the back and forth
with the crowd. Playing to all those people sitting politely in their
seats just didn't get me going."</TE>
<TE>   So let's have the International Assn. of Jazz Educators, the jazz
instructional courses, the play-along records and the video
demonstration tapes. They have their place. But let's not lose the
Art Blakey-style, on-the-job-training bands and the in-the-trenches,
feel-free-to-take-a-chance gigs. For jazz to continue to be what it
can be, it needs both the polish and the grit, the virtuosity and the
emotion, the order and the chaos.</TE>

<HD>Hip-Hop Leaders to Hold Next Summit in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the nation's hip-hop community will hold a "mini-summit"
in Los Angeles on Feb. 13 and 14 to address issues of social activism
and intra-community conflicts as well as to explore how hip-hop
figures can have an effect on the coming off-year elections.</LD>
<LD>   The conclave, being convened by Island Def Jam Chairman Russell
Simmons and Minister Ben Muhammad, is expected to draw Dr. Dre, Suge
Knight and other California hip-hop figures, along with Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles), radio personalities Steve Harvey and Big Boy,
and former gang member-turned-activist Mike Concepcion. The meeting
will lay the groundwork for a larger national-level summit to be held
in L.A. in June as a follow-up to last year's first National Hip-Hop
Summit in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "One thing we're hearing from many artists is that they want to
become more involved in the social and political transformation of
American society, as well as economic," says New York-based Muhammad,
president of the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, a nonprofit entity
developed last year to tackle issues of concern in hip-hop.</LD>
<TE>   Among the initiatives that have grown out of last year's summit
are an urban literacy program sponsored by Sean "P. Diddy" Combs' Bad
Boy Entertainment, mentoring programs for aspiring artists
administered by Def Jam, Bad Boy and other labels, an initiative to
increase and promote parental advisory stickering of CDs, and
advertising and lobbying efforts on 1st Amendment and civil rights
issues. On that issue, the organization also established Nu America,
the first national hip-hop political action committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Muhammad says, hip-hop has been moving toward
more prominent social consciousness in lyrics and artists'
stances--something that has been in its fabric with such rap pioneers
as Grandmaster Flash and Public Enemy, but which often was obscured
by materialistic attitudes. He points to such artists as DMX who have
increased such content in their songs, and the ratings success of the
Simmons-produced HBO "Poetry Jam" series. "DMX, on his 'The Great
Depression' album, has a song that says, 'We don't know who we be,'
and in the lyrics it talks about the importance of challenging
homelessness, challenging the hurt and pain that many who live in
urban centers experience," he says. "And it's about changing it, not
just describing it. This is pivotal." Atypical of hip-hop, though,
Simmons says he hopes these summits, especially the February
gathering, do not draw a lot of media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to put a lot of energy into internal issues of hip-hop
[at the February meeting] and deal with bigger national issues [in
June]," Simmons says. "Some of the issues are integral to the
survival of hip-hop, and it has to be dealt with delicately. The last
summit had more media than we needed. But since that summit there's
been a lot of dialogue among artists, and less conflict because Ben
has been working with the artists on conflict resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of work that has been done since the first summit is
mind-boggling. But there's still a long way to go. Hip-hop can be the
savior in protecting poor people more than people imagine. There's a
new consciousness coming everywhere. We don't expect Snoop Dogg to be
a leader, but we're getting more and more tapes from artists who want
to address these things."</TE>
<TE>   LABOR OF LOVE: In recent years there's been a lot of talk about a
lost spirit in the music business, with all the corporate mergers
changing the tone and goals. But a team built around a core of
veterans of A&amp;M Records (before it was absorbed into Interscope two
years ago) has come together to market and promote an album in that
old spirit--and the team members are all working for free.</TE>
<TE>   The album is "Spirit Touches Ground" by Josh Clayton-Felt, and it
will be released by DreamWorks Records on Feb. 5 with marketing and
promotion provided by various independent consultants. The reason is
that these people had all worked with Clayton-Felt, a Los Angeles
musician who passed away two years ago at 32 from complications of
cancer. He had completed the recordings of what was to be his second
solo album shortly before he was hospitalized for his illness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fair amount of work, but this is what we do," says Diana
Leher, who had been Clayton-Felt's product manager at A&amp;M and now,
with partner Kelly Mills, another former A&amp;M executive, has an
independent music marketing firm called Alchemy. "Josh was one of the
truly nicest people I ever met, and there was no artifice about
that--and there's the fact that we really dug his music. So when we
started working on this project, we rounded up the old troops."</TE>
<TE>   Among other A&amp;M vets involved are former head of artist
development Larry Weintraub, who now has an Internet marketing firm,
and former head of alternative promotion Jack Isquith, now an
independent consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the noted video team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie
Ferris is using old performance footage to create a clip for the song
"Building Atlantis," also for no fee.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Baker, a DreamWorks executive and husband of Clayton-Felt's
sister Laura, notes that funding for the release and marketing is
coming from the family, and much of the sales proceeds are earmarked
for charities including VH1's Save the Music. Baker says that while
there are no delusions of platinum sales, this is no mere token,
sentimental release.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave Joyce Castagnola, the head of sales at DreamWorks, a
budget so she could do retail-store placement buys and listening
posts and such things," Baker says. "And we're hoping for some radio
airplay. The [adult alternative] format is what we're going for, and
so far there's been good feedback."</TE>
<TE>   DAN THE MAN: Musician-producer Dan "the Automator" Nakamura has
made some highly touted albums as the creative prime mover of Dr.
Octagon, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Deltron 3000 and, most
prominently, the Gorillaz with Damon Albarn. But he's never made a
record under his own name.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's getting the chance, signing a deal with MCA Records. As
Dan the Automator, he's recording tracks for an album tentatively due
later this year, with guest appearances expected from Albarn, former
Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha (whose solo
debut--still unscheduled--will feature production by Nakamura), Beck
and Mos Def. The deal also involves distribution for Nakamura's
independent 75 Ark label.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony has reconciled
differences and reunited, with work underway for a first album in
more than two years, due in late spring or early summer from Ruthless
Records. Meanwhile, Ruthless has "Impact of a Legend," a
commemorative CD and DVD package of works by label founder Eazy-E,
due March 26, the seventh anniversary of the former N.W.A rapper's
AIDS-related death.... Skateboard star Tony Hawk is organizing Skate
for Life, an evening of action sports and music April 6 at Universal
Studios. It will benefit the Neil Bogart Memorial Fund (supporting
children's cancer, leukemia and AIDS research) and the Tony Hawk
Foundation (funding public skate parks). Bands for the event are
being recruited by radio station KROQ-FM (106.7).... Grammy nominee
Ryan Adams guests as a songwriter and singer on "While You Weren't
Looking," the solo debut from his former Whiskeytown bandmate Caitlin
Cary. Due March 26, the album will have a limited edition bonus
mini-disc featuring four duets between singer-violinist Cary and
Adams, with the rest of Whiskeytown and members of the Jayhawks and
Superchunk also guesting on the album, produced by former dBs
co-leader Chris Stamey.... Alan Parsons, famed for his Alan Parsons
Project albums and for engineering or producing such sonic landmarks
as Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," has signed a deal with
Immergent Records. In addition to making records of his own, Parsons
will work with Immergent's parent company, the 5.1 Entertainment
Group, to develop, produce and promote ventures using 5.1 surround
sound for the DVD-Audio format.</TE>

<HD>Back to Paint--Thanks to Photos</HD>
<DH>Jenny Saville examined the body beautiful in prints that
reaffirmed her belief in brushwork.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jenny Saville, 31, is one of Britain's young art superstars,
applauded for her wall-sized paintings of monumentally nude women.</LD>
<LD>   Media accounts lend her career a fairy-tale simplicity. Born in
Cambridge, England, the daughter of educators, she was discovered by
influential art collector Charles Saatchi in 1992, shortly after she
graduated from Glasgow School of Art. He commissioned her to paint an
entire show for his London museum in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Saville then accepted a scholarship from a group of American
collectors, who arranged for her to make photographs of women in the
process of having cosmetic surgery in the office of a prominent New
York surgeon. When she returned to England in 1995, the experience
inspired her to do a project with a filmmaker and an award-winning
fashion photographer who did the 1997 Prada campaign. The results are
nude self-portraits, created with Luchford's help, that go on view at
Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills this week.</LD>
<TE>   Although Saville is not fat, she pressed her body against glass to
create a voluptuous effect. The photographs were printed on the scale
of large paintings, some more than 6 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "The photographic experience reinstalled my belief in painting,"
she later said. She subsequently shifted the emphasis to the surface
of the canvas to generate more visceral impact. "Instead of using
paint to illustrate an idea, I want to make you feel your own
body.... I am trying to make paint behave in the way flesh behaves."</TE>
<TE>   She also says that her painting is not so much a critique of the
body-obsessed culture as a demonstration of her affection for the
painting of the Old Masters. "I've always loved how Velazquez and
Rembrandt could make something splendid out of something very
ordinary," she once said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, she had her first commercial exhibition. At the Gagosian
Gallery in New York City, her paintings were sold out before the show
opened--at prices of $100,000 to $150,000. Around the same time, her
paintings were included in "Sensation," the Saatchi-sponsored
exhibition that embroiled the Brooklyn Museum of Art in controversy
over art considered to be sacrilegious or overly sexual. Her nudes,
however, seemed tame compared with much of the work lambasted by
then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Saville lives and works in her London studio with Paul McPhair, a
figurative painter who has been her companion since their student
days. She stopped in New York to see the Alberto Giacometti
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art before coming to Los
Angeles for her show.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Did you find a special connection between your work and
the work of Giacometti?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The paintings stuck with me because I'm just finishing a
painting of [English art critic] David Sylvester. I've been painting
it for 18 months. Giacometti's portrait of him is from 1960. It is
interesting because Giacometti's approach is so different from mine.
I painted him from photographs, and though David is dead now, I
started it when he was alive.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to work on the [artistic] transformation of
someone's flesh who was alive at one point and now is dead. It is
different from Giacometti, where you can see the intensity of the
mark-making over and over, [his] trying to heighten the reality.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But did you find any connection in the fact that you both work
from the human figure?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think the difference is that I am so interested in the flesh,
in the manipulative textures of [paint]. Giacometti was more
interested in the structure and form.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With such strong accolades for your paintings, why did you
detour to make these photographs back in 1995?</TE>
<TE>   A: I didn't make a conscious decision to do [them]. I was in New
York to take photographs of cosmetic surgery. I would see the surgeon
with his fist inside a breast for implant surgery, a real
manipulation and distortion of the body in search of some sort of
beauty. I became interested in what happened in the process. At the
same time, I took photographs of my own body pressed against glass to
make some paintings closely related to the surgery. I was having
problems with the lighting and reflections, and Glen offered to come
sort them out for me. That is when I saw the possibility of the
photographs themselves. We didn't have the intention of doing a
project together, it just grew. We did four sessions over an 18-month
period.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you choose Luchford because of his background in fashion
photography?</TE>
<TE>   A: We talked about it. I was interested in fashion shoots, how
they create the reality that makes up beauty. We had lots of
discussions of how clothes are pinned back to accent the body. He was
interested in the way I approach making art, and I was interested in
how he made these slick images to sell an ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you manage to get yourself smashed onto the glass?</TE>
<TE>   A: I paint [standing] on scaffolding, so I took floor off of it
and put plexiglass where floor was. Gravity pulled my flesh downward
and if I held the edge of the glass I could slide my body across it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you have any idea of what it would look like?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'd been doing it before, but the lighting made an enormous
effect on the undulation of the flesh. The crevices became much
richer. Glen got the serene beauty of fashion as well as something
quite visceral. That was the hope anyway, a mixture of the slickness
of fashion with the way I treat the body.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did you decide not to continue?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is a crucial distinction between painting and
photography. When you look at a painting quite close, you are
standing in the position where the painter, Giacometti or whoever,
made that mark. To me, there is something absolutely thrilling about
that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there something thrilling about painting itself?</TE>
<TE>   A: Absolutely. If I make six marks and something appears as the
corner of a nose or mouth, although [it's] artificial, if you do it
in a certain way, you create a reality. You know it's not a body.
It's pigment and oil on material, but it becomes a suspension of
disbelief. It's a physicality, you can only make a mark at the speed
that your body can move. A photograph is the speed that you set the
shutter. With a painting, it takes a certain time to build up a
visual dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Various critics claim that your paintings are Conceptual and
not a return to representational, figurative painting. What do you
think?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't have this thing of trying to legitimatize a traditional
way of painting, but I have a relationship to tradition. If you make
a nude painting, you carry with you a history of the nude in
painting, you are immediately connected to it. A photograph is not
necessarily art. It might be advertising, it fits in lots of areas.
As soon as you make a painting, you have a relationship to art.
Painting is immediately fixed as traditional art. Sometimes I think
[that's] a hindrance, but I also think it's a real strength that you
have in painting.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What of the critics who feel the need to rescue you from your
allegiance to tradition?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm interested in things to do with science,  tissue
engineering, things that people would not connect to figurative
painting, but for some reason, it has a connection for me. I want a
level of representation in my work, but I don't feel connected to
[English painter] Lucien Freud in the way that everyone thinks I am.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have been painting oversized women for 10 years. Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: To me, oversize is correct. I like bodies that are in the
process of change. A bigger female body has a story of how it got
that large.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you paint from women who are that large or do you embellish?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sometimes I'll do sessions of photographing people or myself in
the studio, then work from composites of those images and photographs
from medical books or pornography. I tend to use bodies that
highlight a kind of humanness.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you feel about your subjects?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think they are beautiful. I have always been visually
attracted to different kinds of bodies. I can look at the body of a
burn victim and find something that is beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As a student, you did feminist studies at Cincinnati University
in 1989. Does that still affect your work?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't want my work to have a political agenda as such. I
don't make paintings for people to say we should look at big bodies
again and say they are beautiful. I think that it's more that they
are difficult. Why do we find bodies like this difficult to look at?</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did this work begin with questions you had about your own body
type?</TE>
<TE>   A: Probably. If you are a woman and live in the West, you can't
avoid it can you? A mixture of things growing up, like looking at
your body in the mirror and some days you feel powerful in your body
and others you want to hide. We are going through a historical phase
where we like to have a lot of self-control.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But the flesh in your paintings is not rosy and sensual. The
pictures are quite tough.</TE>
<TE>   A: They take me a long time and I go through emotional changes in
making a piece of work. I usually make no more than four paintings a
year. I want any contradictions I have--feelings about my body,
looking at other flesh--I want that in the work. I want them to be
full of contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   I have this jarring thing between figuration and feminism, which
most people didn't think would fit together. I had to find a way to
work with these things that seemed to contradict each other. I had
these two notions and thought there must a way for them to coexist or
to find form in both of them.</TE>
<TE>   I think that is the underlying factor in all my work. An attempt
to find out what it means to be female.</TE>

<HD>Surprise--It's Tradition</HD>
<DH>As 'Fiddler on the Roof' nears the 40-year mark, its
creators marvel at its Jewish story's universal appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ISENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sept. 22, 1964, at New York's swank Rainbow Room, producer Harold
Prince read aloud to his opening-night guests from one of "Fiddler on
the Roof's" less than inspiring reviews. "I can't resist reading this
to you," he told them, "because it's so irrelevant."</LD>
<LD>   Nearly eight years and 3,300 performances later, "Fiddler" broke
the record for longest-running musical, and Prince again pulled out
those reviews.</LD>
<LD>   He reprinted, then bound them in a gold-lined, commemorative
program that he gave to everyone in the audience. Noting today that
$1 invested in "Fiddler" in the '60s returned $35.62 by October 2001,
Prince quips that "sometimes you do get the last laugh."</LD>
<TE>   Apparently so. Winner of nine 1965 Tony awards, including best
musical, "Fiddler" has introduced audiences around the world to
Yiddish author Sholom Aleichem's milkman Tevye, his family, poverty
and persecution in turn-of-the-century Russia. Now in the midst of a
44-city tour landing at Beverly Hills' Wilshire Theatre on Tuesday,
"Fiddler" stars Theodore Bikel, who has played family patriarch Tevye
1,800 times in the last 34 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wedding and bar mitzvah planners would be bereft without "Sunrise,
Sunset" and "Tradition." New York's Music Theatre International,
which licenses musicals in schools and community and professional
theater, reports more than 650 productions in the U.S. and Canada
alone in an average year.</TE>
<TE>   On Broadway, where it's already had three revivals, "Fiddler" is
still among the top 10 longest-running musicals. "You don't have to
be a Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe, a milkman and father with
five daughters to relate to this story," says Jed Bernstein,
president of the League of American Theatres and Producers, who
played Tevye in his high school production. "A family struggling, a
marriage that's successful for 35 years--these are things anybody can
plug into and obviously have over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Stein, the show's librettist, recalls his concern and
skepticism when he went to Japan for the show's first foreign
production. "The Japanese producer asked me, 'Do they understand this
show in America?'" Stein says, "And I replied, 'Why do you ask?' He
said, 'Because it's so Japanese.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's been 40 years since a friend sent composer Jerry Bock and
lyricist Sheldon Harnick a copy of Aleichem's book, "Wandering Star,"
with the notion that it might make a good musical. Bock and Harnick,
who had already written the score for the Pulitzer Prize-winning
"Fiorello!" and would eventually write seven scores together before
going their separate ways in 1970, read the book and were intrigued.
They took it to Stein, with whom they'd first worked on the 1958
musical "The Body Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   "Wandering Star" revolved around a group of actors who toured
Russia, says Stein, who didn't think it would make a good musical.
But it reminded him of Aleichem's stories about Tevye, which he'd
heard as a child and which he suggested Bock and Harnick also read.
Written as monologues by Tevye about his daughters, the stories had
already been proved stageworthy in plays adapted by Arnold Perl in
the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Bock, Harnick and Stein all say that the more they talked about
the material, the more excited they became. Equally important, they
all drew on family experiences and memories. Harnick, whose parents
were born in Eastern Europe, talks of a synagogue he attended as a
boy in Chicago and "the gaunt elderly men in prayer shawls who were
praying fervently, then rejoicing afterward with schnapps and cake."</TE>
<TE>   Bock began to hear the music, he says, "as I read the stories and
remembered the lullabies and little melodies my grandmother would
sing to me.</TE>
<TE>   "The environment, flavor, feeling, background and our own
sensitivity to the people in the stories made it more and more
accessible as a project. We started to write it as we would any other
show, but adding those embers that kept burning underneath."</TE>
<TE>   Although Prince did go on to direct Bock and Harnick's next show,
"She Loves Me," he declined to direct "Fiddler." "It was foreign to
me," he says now. "I didn't feel the connection I felt years later
with [the musical] 'Parade' and German Jews in the South."</TE>
<TE>   Prince suggested that they try Jerome Robbins. Not only did
Robbins come from a Russian Jewish background, Prince says, but there
was a second reason: "I said, 'For it to be universal, you need a
choreographer-director' because I thought dance was an easier
language to understand than words."</TE>
<TE>   The original Broadway cast included such now-well-known actors as
Austin Pendleton (as Motel, the tailor), Bea Arthur (as Yente, the
matchmaker) and Zero Mostel as Tevye. Mostel had to finish a film,
and rehearsals were postponed, a circumstance that gave director
Robbins additional time to work on the show with the authors.</TE>
<TE>   They had written almost a complete show by that point, Harnick
recalls, but Robbins wasn't satisfied. "He thought it was warm and
amusing, but felt we hadn't found whatever element it was that gave
the stories their power. His question was always, 'What is the show
about?' and we kept saying, 'This dairy man and his daughters.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then one of us said, 'The change of a whole lifestyle,' and
Robbins' eyes lit up. He said this is about the way traditions were
changing all over Europe, and if that was the case, we have to have
an opening number that shows the audience some of those traditions.
If possible after that, every scene should show or relate to the
changing of tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Their opening number, "We Haven't Missed a Sabbath Yet," was
scrapped for "Tradition," a songwriting task that Bock recalls "came
about through pain and tumult. Robbins envisioned that the piece
start in a circle and end with a circle being broken and splintered,
with everyone going off in different directions."</TE>
<TE>   As they rewrote, he says, Robbins would continually "ask us, 'How
is this song contributing to the overall theme? How is this scene
helping us establish it?' I'm certain that affected our writing
constantly."</TE>
<TE>   Because all of the principals were fairly well known in the
theater, Stein says, they had no problem approaching producers. "But
we were turned down by everybody because they thought it wouldn't
have popular appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "One producer said, 'I really like it, but what am I going to do
for an audience once I run out of Hadassah benefits?' But we believed
in it, and eventually got it to [television, theater and film
producer and director] Fred Coe. It was the first time he ever heard
of the shtetls, but he was enormously intrigued. I thought we had
something really special if somebody like Fred showed interest."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the authors went back to Prince, whom Robbins wanted as
a producer and who could help Coe raise the money. Prince, who had
already made investors happy with such earlier shows as "West Side
Story," "Fiorello!" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum," assembled a budget of $375,000 for a show he estimates would
cost about $10 million today.</TE>
<TE>   "Fiddler" opened first in Detroit, then Washington, before heading
into New York, and the best piece of luck they had in Detroit, Prince
says, is that the newspapers were on strike. But a few of the
reviewers' negative comments made their way to radio, and an
out-of-town review in Variety wasn't too good either.</TE>
<TE>   The night the Variety review came out, recalls actor Pendleton, he
ran into Robbins at the bar across the street from the theater. "I
asked him, 'What are you going to do?' And he said, '10 things a
day.' And that's what he did in Detroit and in Washington--he kept
cutting and heightening and shaping."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, reviews were more positive but still mixed. The
influential critic Walter Kerr, then writing for the New York Herald
Tribune, called "Fiddler" "a near miss," and as reviews were brought
over to Robbins at the opening-night party, the mood chilled.</TE>
<TE>   "The room emptied out fast," Pendleton remembers. "Everybody was
piling into the elevators."</TE>
<TE>   But the next day, something surprising happened, Pendleton says.
"I came in to play the matinee, and you would have thought [we'd
gotten] the reviews of 'My Fair Lady.' There was a line around the
block. This is so easy to say now, but I always knew it was going to
be a hit and a great musical. Even at that first preview in Detroit,
you could just tell the way it gripped the audience."</TE>
<TE>   The show's Broadway success soon led to national tours, still
unusual in the '60s, and in 1967 even a stint at Caesars Palace in
Las Vegas. Cut to 100 minutes with no intermission, "Fiddler" played
there for six months starring Bikel and launching the 34-year
relationship the actor would have with the show.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bikel says he's essentially playing his grandfather
onstage, he and everyone else involved with the show speaks of its
universality. "The better the play, the better it connects with
audiences. Audiences are bright and don't go just for what they are
intimately acquainted with. Non-blacks connect to plays by August

<TE>   "When I played Tevye in Hawaii, I'd come out the stage door and
there would be Asian faces--Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian. I'd ask,
'What does it mean to you? 1905? Jews? Russia?' And they'd say,
'Tradition.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Fiddler" also arrives in Los Angeles with the added baggage of
Sept. 11, 2001. "When people are asked what shows audiences want to
see, 'Fiddler' is always the No. 1 show," says Sammy Dallas Bayes, an
ensemble member who went on to become the original Broadway show's
dance captain, and who is choreographing and directing the show at
the Wilshire. "I thought it was good that 'Fiddler' was going out now
because it gives a sense of something familiar that Americans could
relate to."</TE>
<TE>   Prince agrees. "What the show ultimately celebrated was this
melting pot called America," Prince says. "At the end of the show,
that's where they're going, and it's to America that so many of these
people came.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the strength of this country--its identification with so
many cultures. It's an amazing experiment that worked, and the show
celebrates that."</TE>

<HD>A Fitting Tribute From One Master to Another</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>****MARCUS ROBERTS, "Cole After Midnight", Columbia</LD>
<LD>   Wynton Marsalis long has called Roberts the "J Master" (as in
"Jazz Master"), and with each recording, the pianist reaffirms the
accuracy of Marsalis' assessment. If in previous outings Roberts has
radically reinvented music of George Gershwin, Scott Joplin and Jelly
Roll Morton, among others, this time Roberts finds new layers of
meaning and romance in tunes associated with Nat "King" Cole. Yet
even though Roberts revisits Cole standards such as "Unforgettable"
and "Too Young," Roberts' idiosyncratic interpretations are as
original as if these were newly composed works. Thus "Answer Me, My
Love" unfolds as a hushed solo reverie, "Mona Lisa" as an excursion
into ultra-sophisticated harmony.</LD>
<LD>   The most intriguing piece may be Roberts' own "Cole After
Midnight," a puckishly unpredictable work that emerges as a tour de
force of jazz-trio improvisation. By closing his disc with several
standards by Cole Porter, Roberts not only addresses another Cole,
but also finds fresh ideas where lesser pianists simply recycle
well-worn cliches.</LD>
<TE>   ***ETTA JONES, "Etta Jones Sings Lady Day", HighNote</TE>
<TE>   In October, jazz fans mourned the passing of veteran singer Jones,
who long had been overshadowed by younger, decidedly less
accomplished vocalists. This disc, recorded just a few months before
Jones died, therefore stands as a kind of monument to Jones' art,
albeit an elegiac one.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because she's paying homage to Billie Holiday, Jones leans
toward slow tempos, unadorned phrases and a pervasively melancholy
tone. If some of Holiday's most obvious mannerisms come through
(including certain sighing phrases), Jones nonetheless proves
hauntingly effective on Holiday anthems such as "You've Changed" and
"Fine and Mellow." The soulful cries and expressively bent pitches
that were Jones' stock in trade never were more aptly applied than in
this recording, which was intended as a tribute to Holiday but also
memorializes Jones herself.</TE>
<TE>   ***DAVID MURRAY, "Like a Kiss That Never Ends", Justin Time</TE>
<TE>   Those who have considered tenor saxophonist Murray's work a bit
too hysterical in avant-garde settings should find him more palatable
in this less confrontational recording. For although he squeals and
honks a bit in on the title track, more often he calls to mind
vintage tenor-sax balladeers such as Ben Webster, particularly on Ray
Drummond's "Dedication" and on his own, dance-tinged "Suki Suki Now."
Irresistibly poetic melody is what this recording is all about, with
Murray turning in long and winding lines on every track, including
his up-tempo "Ruben's Theme Song."</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2DANISH RADIO JAZZ ORCHESTRA, "The Power and the Glory",
Storyville</TE>
<TE>   The past couple of years have seen uncounted tributes to the great
Louis Armstrong, but few as direct, unaffected and persuasive as
this. Considering that it features one of the best large jazz
ensembles in Europe performing under the direction of a brilliant
conductor-arranger, Jim McNeely, perhaps that should come as no
surprise. But "The Power and the Glory" has the additional virtue of
trumpet solos by New Orleans stalwart Leroy Jones, who captures the
spirit, fire and energy of Armstrong's playing without descending to
mere mimicry. And check out the ingenious new chart for "What a
Wonderful World," penned by Harry Connick Jr., who is becoming one of
the more skilled arrangers in the business.</TE>

<HD>International Year of the Woman</HD>
<DH>From the U.S., France and Australia, actresses made 2001
theirs with memorable performances that dug deep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMANUEL LEVY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time to acknowledge publicly what some critics have been quietly
observing: 2001 may have been a weak year for mainstream Hollywood
fare, but it was a spectacular year for female performers. Indeed,
it's hard to recall a year in which actresses have made such a splash
on the big screen, in lead and supporting roles, American and foreign
films, comedy as well as drama.</LD>
<LD>   Women delivered the kind of performances that helped make 2001 a
more exciting year than it had the right to be. Here are some reasons
why.</LD>
<LD>   Stunning Performances by Newcomers</LD>
<TE>   No movie year is truly complete if it doesn't feature a stunning
debut or breakthrough performance. Undoubtedly this year the title
belongs to Naomi Watts, heroine of David Lynch's psycho-erotic noir
thriller, "Mulholland Dr." As Betty, the bright-eyed, bisexual
waitress-actress, Watts commands attention from her very first scene
at LAX through the film's spooky and bewildering ending. Watts is not
exactly a newcomer. She's been acting for a decade in TV movies and
modest indies such as "Flirting" (1992), which co-starred fellow
Aussie Nicole Kidman.</TE>
<TE>   Actresses Coming of Age</TE>
<TE>   It's one of Hollywood's long-held truisms that few actors are able
to make a smooth transition from child to adult roles. Yet three of
the year's best performances were given by former child actresses.</TE>
<TE>   Thora Birch has been acting since the age of 4 in commercials, TV
series and movies. In 1999, she garnered critical praise as Kevin
Spacey's rebellious daughter in the Oscar-winning "American Beauty."
As the star of Terry Zwigoff's "Ghost World," she plays a teenage
outsider par excellence, a misfit who's totally out of sync with the
world around her. Investing every gesture, word and thought with a
specificity that makes for a fascinating performance, Birch shines as
a girl whose uncensored commentary spares no one--including herself.</TE>
<TE>   Birch's "Ghost World" co-star, Scarlett Johansson, first attracted
attention in the indie "Manny &amp; Lo" (1996) and in "The Horse
Whisperer" (1998), in which she played a traumatized teen. In Eva
Gardos' autobiographical "American Rhapsody" last year, Johansson
played a bright Hungarian American adolescent who insists on
determining her fate. Johansson conveys in a painfully sensitive way
the psyche of a girl torn between two sets of parents, biological
versus sociological, and two disparate value systems, West versus
East.</TE>
<TE>   Best known as the child vampire in "Interview With the Vampire"
and for her roles in lightweight teen movies, Kirsten Dunst made a
successful leap into a more adult role in "Crazy/Beautiful." Although
basically a contemporary variation of "Rebel Without a Cause,"
"Crazy/Beautiful" benefits immensely from Dunst's stirring
performance as a wealthy liberal politician's messed-up daughter who
falls for a Latino schoolmate (Jay Hernandez). Dunst is a revelation
as a sympathetic loser, drifting along in a sensual haze, pulled this
way and that by desire and need.</TE>
<TE>   Reclaiming the Comedy Genre</TE>
<TE>   Most American comedies of the past two decades have revolved
around men and catapulted their leads into stardom--Robin Williams,
Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey and Mike Myers, to name a few. In 2001,
however, for the first time in years, the genre was defined by
female-centered comedies: the British-made "Bridget Jones's Diary"
with Renee Zellweger as its single, neurotic heroine, and "Legally
Blonde," which reaffirmed Reese Witherspoon's status as a first-rate
comedian.</TE>
<TE>   Zellweger didn't rely on a fat suit to play the chubby protagonist
of "Bridget Jones's Diary," a gimmick that Julia Roberts ("America's
Sweethearts") and Gwyneth Paltrow ("Shallow Hal") opted for. Like her
male peers (Russell Crowe in "The Insider," for example), Zellweger
went the old-fashioned way, gaining 20 pounds by eating pizza. Much
publicity was accorded the fact that an American--and a Texan at
that--was chosen to portray the popular English heroine, but
Zellweger proved she was perfectly cast as the awkward yet endearing
"singleton" who goes from one humiliating experience to another.
Drawing on her reserves of humility and vulnerability, Zellweger
played a real woman with real flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Slick and winsome, "Legally Blonde" was a logical follow-up to
Witherspoon's previous vehicle, "Election" (1999), in which she
played an obnoxiously ambitious high schooler. In "Legally Blonde"
she's a smart but ditzy blond who goes to Harvard Law School to win
back her snobbish boyfriend and, in the process, gains a new
identity. Witherspoon's high comic style harks back to Hollywood of
yesteryear: With the right roles, Witherspoon could become the Carole
Lombard or Judy Holliday of her generation.</TE>
<TE>   Range and Versatility</TE>
<TE>   This year, a number of actresses have expanded their range
considerably, showing new facets of their talent. With two vastly
different performances--as the dying courtesan-actress in Baz
Luhrmann's postmodern musical "Moulin Rouge" and the domineering
matron in the supernatural thriller "The Others"--Nicole Kidman
assumes her place as a front-rank leading lady. With her classic
grace, porcelain beauty, sophisticated manner and intense stare,
Kidman is frighteningly chilling as a headstrong woman and
overprotective mother forced to abandon her beliefs while entering
the realm of the occult. Another breakout performance came from Halle
Berry, who this year showed that her talent goes beyond sheer beauty
in her bravura turn in the interracial drama "Monster's Ball."</TE>
<TE>   Defining a Movie</TE>
<TE>   Without the brilliant Tilda Swinton, Scott McGehee and David
Siegel's neo-noir "The Deep End" would have been just another
technically accomplished thriller. With Swinton, however, the film
assumes a strong dramatic center and emotional resonance that elevate
it beyond a remake of Max Ophuls' 1949 film, "The Reckless Moment."
Persuasive in detailing each of her actions, Swinton plays Margaret
Hall as an ordinary, moral woman who breaks the law (when her gay son
falls for a sleazy lover) because she can't accept any disruption of
the family. Swinton lends credibility to the notion that screen
acting allows the camera to look within a performer's soul.</TE>
<TE>   Still alluring and sensual in her 50s, Charlotte Rampling has been
acting for more than three decades, first attracting attention in
Luchino Visconti's "The Damned" (1969). She had impressive supporting
roles in "Stardust Memories" (1980) and "The Verdict" (1982), but her
loyal fans have been frustrated by her sporadic screen work, mostly
done in Europe. This year, Francois Ozon's "Under the Sand" showcased
Rampling at her coolest and most luminous. Rampling plays Marie, an
English professor at a Parisian college and married for 25 years to a
comforting husband. Their holiday routine is shattered when Marie
dozes on the beach and her husband, having gone for a swim, vanishes.
Refusing to believe he is dead, Marie insists that his case remain
open, a denial that renders her unable to grieve or court other men.
Rampling's focused performance displays the cool restraint, mature
wisdom and tranquil intensity seldom seen in American movies.</TE>
<TE>   The French Mystique</TE>
<TE>   One of the glories of French cinema, past and present, is its
acceptance of the centrality of women's sensibility in the dominant
culture. This explains the large number of intriguing French films,
many by men, about female protagonists--the entire oeuvre of Eric
Rohmer, major films by Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and
most of Andre Techine's work (often starring Catherine Deneuve).
Along with "Under the Sand," French art house hits this year were
Patrice Leconte's "The Widow of St. Pierre" and Techine's "Alice and
Martin," both starring Juliette Binoche, who is far more interesting
in her Gallic than English-speaking films.</TE>
<TE>   This year a 23-year-old French actress, Audrey Tautou, took the
international cinema world by storm with her ravishing performance in
the romantic comedy "Amelie," a huge commercial success in France and
elsewhere. Her intoxicating, uplifting appearance defines a feel-good
movie that bursts with life.</TE>
<TE>   Comeback Performance</TE>
<TE>   This year Sissy Spacek wears the comeback crown. Throughout the
1990s, Spacek was mostly cast in thankless roles, but her beautifully
controlled performance in Todd Field's domestic drama "In the
Bedroom" represents her best work to date.</TE>
<TE>   As Ruth, the prim and proper middle-class music teacher in a small
Maine town, Spacek renders a performance of precise truthfulness that
relies as much on the power of silence as on dialogue. Whenever a
hint of emotion creeps in, Spacek's features seem to clench as if she
were fighting not to feel. Her subtle role is composed of private,
tense, minimalist gestures (such as smoking while watching late-night
TV), mixing rage with self-possession, dignity with inner turbulence.</TE>

<DH>After eight years and a particularly bleak period, Concrete
Blonde clicks again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What did it take to get Concrete Blonde back together after eight
years? A Roxy Music reunion, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist, and some
basic growing up for singer-bassist Johnette Napolitano, guitarist
James Mankey and drummer Harry Rushakoff.</LD>
<LD>   All those things played a role in the creation of "Group Therapy,"
the L.A. band's first new album since 1993's "Mexican Moon." It's due
in stores Tuesday from local independent Manifesto Records (see
review, Page 70). The band, which performed together for the first
time in years in September during a Spaceland benefit for New York
disaster relief, will also start a U.S. tour Friday, coming to the El
Rey Theatre in L.A. on Jan. 25 and the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana on
Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The iconic British art-rockers Roxy Music, who brought a rare
reunion tour to the Greek Theatre last summer, inspired the album's
opening valentine, "Roxy." "Their music was always one of the things
that touched me," Napolitano says, and she was happy to know the band
was back, older but still vital.</LD>
<TE>   As for the psychiatrist, well, the album's title is almost
painfully literal, because making it actually was therapeutic.
Particularly for Napolitano, who last spring found herself in a bleak
state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really cracking up, and I didn't know what was happening,"
she recalls. She had been having nightmares, and she became convinced
that something bad was going to happen. Indeed, when she went to see
Mankey in May, it was not as a former bandmate looking to get
Concrete Blonde back together. All she wanted was a trusted friend to
help her deal with this recurring sense of doom. Sensibly, he helped
her get in touch with a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   "She was feeling bad, and part of her feeling better was getting
together with the old gang," says Mankey, who has known Napolitano
since 1981 when they formed the duo Dream 6, which eventually became
Concrete Blonde.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '80s, Concrete Blonde gained a college-radio following
with a blend of classic rock and gothic moodiness that was more
straightforward than Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees but more extravagant
than the Pretenders.</TE>
<TE>   By turns wistful and tough, Napolitano's lyrics and husky voice
reflected her self-doubts, social conscience and blunt emotionality.
Mankey's noir, blues-edged guitar work gave the band an atmospheric
touchstone, even as its albums became diverse to the point of
distraction, incorporating whatever elements--hip-hop, Spanish folk,
country--the creatively restless Napolitano fancied.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete Blonde gained wider exposure with 1990's "Bloodletting,"
which included the Top 20 hit "Joey." But by "Mexican Moon," the
excitement of possibly making it big had given way to in-fighting and
the ennui of endless touring. The band broke up in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano continued in various groups, including Pretty &amp; Twisted
and Vowel Movement. In 1997, she and Mankey even combined forces with
another L.A. group for the rock-meets-Latin collection "Concrete
Blonde y Los Illegals."</TE>
<TE>   But, the players all say, they never quite clicked as well with
anyone else. And that's really why the reunion happened. "We tracked
down Harry's number and cold-called him," the 46-year-old Mankey
says, laughing. "He was kind of shocked to hear from us. The last
time we talked, we weren't on very friendly terms."</TE>
<TE>   Napolitano and Mankey don't dwell much on past tensions in the
band. When asked, Mankey allows that part of Napolitano's reputation
for being difficult with label executives and managers probably
stemmed from her not being as compliant as women were expected to be.
"But," he says with a deadpan twinkle in his voice, "she was also
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Rushakoff, 42, is even less diplomatic--about himself. "I put
Johnette through a lot," says the drummer, who was replaced on some
early recordings by former Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson. "I'm
pretty lucky she even gave me another whirl." Yet Rushakoff, who was
in rehab when his bandmates first contacted him for the reunion, says
he didn't have a drug or alcohol addiction in those days. It was more
of an attitude problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just stupid things," Rushakoff says. "Like having huge
guest lists, and wanting all [my] friends around to see what a big
shot I was. And I did a lot of flashy drumming, with cymbals behind
me and stick-spinning and stuff like that. Johnette was like, 'Look,
this isn't Judas Priest!'" Once, he would have bristled at such a
comment, but now Rushakoff says he welcomes Napolitano's direction.
"It's not about how groovy I look, but more about what's appropriate
for the song," he says. Mankey concurs. "We've all learned to play
less," he says.</TE>
<TE>   With this newfound spirit of cooperation, "Group Therapy" came
together quickly and was recorded during 10 days in August. The songs
are recognizably Concrete Blonde, but some lyrics reflect a fresh
sense of contentment. "Yes, I am content," Napolitano says. "Not to
be confused with complacent. But I'll be 45 this year, and I'm
grateful. It's really taken a lot to see that the glass is half-full
and not half-empty."</TE>
<TE>   It's enough for her that the band is back together. "We didn't
know if anybody else would care, or how relevant it would all be,"
she says. But one "Group Therapy" track felt eerily prescient in the
wake of Sept. 11: the dark prophecy "Violent," which distills many of
Napolitano's bad vibes from last spring into a warning about the
karmic time bomb of a culture she sees as increasingly
harder-hearted.</TE>
<TE>   It's particularly bad in Los Angeles, says Napolitano, who has
always enjoyed pulling back her hometown's sparkly facade to reveal
its dark underbelly. "It's almost an art form to lie, to cheat, to be
ambitious, to stab somebody's back along the way," she says. "When
you're living in a world where that actually becomes desirable, you
start to feel like you're nuts for not having [those qualities]."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Napolitano wondered if it was wise to throw such
"Violent" lines as "a flood of blood and a burning pain" at
unsuspecting audiences. Again, Mankey and Rushakoff offered soothing
support, encouraging her to perform the tune at Spaceland.</TE>
<TE>   "She does have a way of picking things out of the air," remarks
Mankey, making a "Twilight Zone" sound to acknowledge the song's
strange timeliness. "But it can't be like, 'Don't mention the war!'"</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Napolitano isn't fixating on the role of doomsayer. In
fact, she'd prefer to be seen as an older artist who still has
something to contribute to a youth-oriented culture.</TE>
<TE>   "What does 'alternative' mean, anyway? It's OK as long as you're
20?" she asks. To her, it's obvious now that people in their 40s have
amassed the knowledge, experience and drive to master their work.
"Now is the time to be everything you said you were gonna be when you
were a kid," she says. "And this is absolutely what I wanted to grow
up to be. I'm proud I lived my life the way I wanted."</TE>

"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist." Taking a page from Woody Allen's "What's

<TE>   Female artists from the underground hip-hop scene tend to be
serious or inspirational types. And then there's Princess Superstar.
The New York rapper is the genre's live-wire bad girl with a taste
for bikinis, body paint and bawdy rhymes. As for serious, she writes,
plays her instruments and produces several tracks on her latest
album, "Princess Superstar Is," with guests ranging from Kool Keith
to Beth Orton. She's at the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   A Noise Within's critically acclaimed, 2001 revival of Noel

directed by Art Manke, hapless house guests of the prone-to-emoting,
bohemian Bliss family find their expectations for a romantic country
weekend thwarted by their hosts' squabbles and unorthodox notions of
hospitality. Opens Saturday at A Noise Within in Glendale.</TE>

<LD>**1/2 ALAN JACKSON, "Drive", Arista Nashville</LD>
<LD>   Jackson delivers an honest and accurate self-assessment when he
sings, "I'm just a singer of simple songs/I'm not a real political
man" in the keynote song of his 11th album. Yet that song, "Where
Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)?," proceeds both to
reaffirm and contradict that truth, as he adroitly offers one man's
response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones? Or
pray for the ones who don't know?</LD>
<TE>   Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble? Or sob
for the ones left below?</TE>
<TE>   The series of questions is an astute way of taking on an event for
which there are few answers, and yields a song that reaches
considerably deeper than the Georgia neo-traditionalist's usual
catchy but lightweight fare.</TE>
<TE>   "Where Were You" is an anomaly, dropped amid not one but two love
songs to automobiles, some honky-tonk two-steps (including a jaunty
duet with George Strait), and some earnest but unremarkable ballads.
The question for Jackson the songwriter: Now that he's proved himself
capable of tapping the deep recesses of the heart, will he go there
more often?</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   **JAY-Z,  "Unplugged", Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   Since Jay-Z stands as the virtually unchallenged king of rap, it
seems as though anything the Brooklyn rapper produces achieves
critical and commercial success.</TE>
<TE>   Just three months after releasing the nearly flawless "The
Blueprint" album, he returns with hip-hop's second "Unplugged" album,
recorded during a November session of the popular MTV series.
Although the collection will certainly have retailers smiling, fans
may not have the same reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, Jay-Z's music strikes with magnum force, thanks to his
witty wordplay and unparalleled confidence, as well as robust
production that has been able to satisfy both the streets and
crossover outlets. This time, backed by normally sure-fire hip-hop
band the Roots, Jay-Z seems to have lost some of his spunk, as the
Roots simply don't provide the consistent musical muscle that Jay-Z's
usual sound generates. When they do achieve his level, as on the
rugged "Takeover," the results are strong (though short of the
original). Backup singer Jaguar Wright and guest Mary J. Blige also
give impassioned vocal turns, but for the most part, Jay-Z's
conversational flow and the Roots' tinny, subtle grooves create
little excitement when compared with the versions on Jay-Z's studio
albums.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Jools Holland &amp; His Rhythm &amp; Blues Orchestra, "Jools
Holland's Big Band Rhythm &amp; Blues," Rhino. The former Squeeze
keyboardist --now a TV host and England's less-showy answer to Paul
Shaffer--drew 22 star singers-collaborators for this album. Some
spiritedly adhere to the titular theme (Sting on Willie Dixon's
"Seventh Son," Van Morrison on Louis Armstrong's "Back O' Town
Blues") while others downplay it, but in a collection that also
includes Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, John Cale, Joe Strummer and
Paul Weller, George Harrison's last new song grabs the spotlight, at
least for sentimental reasons. "Horse to Water," co-written by the
ex-Beatle and his son Dhani, bears his familiar minor-key motifs and
gentle, spiritual admonitions. It's an appealing, if not essential,
addition to the Harrison legacy.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>

<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>Once the epitome of L.A. playwrights, John Steppling now
calls Poland home--but his rage remains intact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, if you had asked L.A. theater insiders who was the
quintessential L.A. playwright, John Steppling probably would have
headed the list.</LD>
<LD>   Steppling's bleak, elliptical dramas about the underbelly of the
Southern California dream had been produced often in small L.A.
theaters in the 1980s and early '90s, winning Steppling a Rockefeller
fellowship and awards from the writers' organization PEN West and the
LA Weekly. His work was influential enough that "Stepplingesque" was
sometimes used to describe other writers' plays that seemed to be in
a similar vein.</LD>
<LD>   And that vein was pure L.A. Born and reared here, Steppling wrote
almost exclusively about his home region, and he was little known
outside of it. His only New York production ("Teenage Wedding," 1991)
was either unnoticed or panned by that city's critics. Steppling
appeared to be an only-in-L.A. phenomenon.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, however, Steppling has spread his wings. Although his
new "Dog Mouth," which opened Saturday at the Evidence Room, is set
in the Southwest, it was written in Paris and first workshopped in
London. When he flew to L.A. to stage the play's premiere, Steppling
left behind a temperature of 17 degrees below zero in his new
hometown of Krakow, Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he left L.A. "for good" four years ago, Steppling, now
50, had spent much of the preceding two years in Thailand, correcting
English texts of Thai journalists for the Bangkok Post--which, he
said, "meant guessing what they were trying to say."</TE>
<TE>   Why did he leave his native turf?</TE>
<TE>   "Such a complex of reasons," he began, after introducing his
22-year-old Polish wife, Anna Kuros, in the Evidence Room lobby on
the first day of rehearsals. Steppling looks much as he did when he
lived here, with an intricate tattoo covering his left arm, a couple
of rings in an ear and a rakish goatee.</TE>
<TE>   Before he left L.A., Steppling had been supporting himself by
writing for Hollywood (his favorite credit was "Animal Factory," a
2000 film directed by Steve Buscemi). But it was work that he found
"less and less satisfying. I was being offered teen movies,
reactionary crime stories, and I wasn't making enough money to
justify doing what I didn't like."</TE>
<TE>   He was also tired of seeing his plays produced only in small L.A.
theaters. Any money that he made from them was "incredibly modest,"
he said. "Half the time I ended up putting my own money into them."</TE>
<TE>   Two of his '80s productions, "The Thrill" and "The Dream Coast,"
were under the auspices of the Mark Taper Forum--but at the 99-seat
Taper, Too, not the main stage. "I've known [Taper artistic director]
Gordon Davidson for 20 years. I guess if he was going to put me on
the main stage, he probably would have," Steppling said, at the same
time admitting that he wouldn't want to be "a court eunuch who writes
the kind of plays that make Gordon Davidson happy." American theater,
he said, "is at a place where not much good stuff gets done,
certainly not in the big institutional theaters."</TE>
<TE>   He also felt a wider disaffection with American culture, which he
believes "does not trust art very much. It's thought of as another
way to anesthetize or distract yourself or as therapy. Quality has
been confused with popularity. Art should help awaken you, not numb
you."</TE>
<TE>   In all, he said, "I started to understand the impulse for artists
to leave where they're from. You have a personal history that becomes
burdensome. And that adversarial relationship that artists should
have with their society sometimes is easier to manage from farther
away."</TE>
<TE>   Steppling first chose Paris because of friends there. After a
year, during which he wrote "Dog Mouth," he applied for jobs teaching
English in several countries and finally accepted one in Kielce,
Poland. "Going to Poland to teach in Kielce," he said wryly, "is like
saying you're going to California to teach in Susanville or Red
Bluff."</TE>
<TE>   Steppling met his wife in Kielce, but after eight months there,
they moved to London, where he knew an agent and several producers.
He had received an offer to do a screenplay adaptation. That movie
went nowhere, he said, but he did get a job as a story editor on a
BBC cartoon called "Popetown"--"like 'South Park' meets the Vatican,"
he said. "I deeply suspect it'll never get on the air."</TE>
<TE>   A workshop production of "Dog Mouth" took place in London. But the
city was impossibly expensive, he said, and while he was working to
pay the bills, "there wasn't enough time to do theater." After a
year, the couple returned to Poland, where costs were lower. Kuros
began university studies in Japanese in Krakow, and Steppling
returned to teaching English--which allowed more time to write plays
than did "the hysteria and hustle of the film industry."</TE>
<TE>   Krakow, he said, is home for the near future, although he
acknowledged it's not a perfect fit. "I've always hated cold
weather," he said. "I'm a wimpy Californian. The irony is not lost on
me."</TE>
<TE>   Although Steppling's mother, Hildegarde Bielinski, was the
daughter of immigrants from Poland, Steppling spoke no Polish before
moving there. But he's learning the language, and he reports that
most Poles younger than 25 speak English, which is replacing Russian
as the second language.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, with the incursion of U.S. chain stores and fast
food, satellite dishes and e-mail, "I sometimes feel like I'm in a
very far and very cold suburb of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   One with an invigorating theater scene, he said. "Theater is a
serious art form there, so people go to it with serious intent.
There's a level of respect I don't find very often here." He mentions
the city's long-established Teatr STU, whose leader, Krzysztof
Jasinski, recently staged an "extraordinary 'Hamlet' that featured a
horde of real, trained rats running across the stage, stopping at the
apron and then running down a hole."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds, well, Stepplingesque.</TE>
<TE>   The title character in "Dog Mouth" is the leader of a criminal
gang of hobos who has recently impregnated a young woman less than
half his age. He's also a former trainer of fighting dogs, and "he
has a longing for that part of his life in which he was esteemed for
his excellence in breeding dogs. His reputation now is based on
fear." The play was inspired by a newspaper article and a late-night
tabloid TV documentary about a real-life homeless criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Steppling acknowledged that the relationships between older men
and younger women in his plays and the glimpses of the world of dog
training--which was explored in greater detail in his "Standard of
the Breed"--are themes that resonate in his life; indeed, "I'm
willing to accept that everything I write is autobiographical on some
level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he lived in L.A., he raised Neapolitan mastiffs. Asked if he
had ever bred dogs for fighting, which is illegal, he replied: "I
think I'll refrain from answering that. Let's just say, 'I didn't.'"
He gave up his last dog, a German shepherd, when he left L.A.</TE>
<TE>   One of the characters in "Dog Mouth," a lieutenant in the hobo
gang who is sent by Dog Mouth to do an unsavory deed, is played by
Steppling's cousin Jim Storm. Steppling credits him as "the first
person who mentioned theater to me." When Steppling was passing
through New York in 1971, he visited Storm, who was involved in the
off-off-Broadway scene. (Recalling those times, Storm said Steppling
"passed out on my floor and didn't leave for months.")</TE>
<TE>   While "Dog Mouth" isn't an L.A. play--the first half is set
somewhere in the Mojave Desert; the second half takes place near
Phoenix--it's in the tradition of Steppling's other plays in that
it's very Western, the playwright said. "A truth of American culture
can be found in the western expansion and the nature of the people
who came here. When I was a kid in Hollywood, all of our neighbors
talked about who had just come out from where."</TE>
<TE>   "Dog Mouth" is not designed to placate anyone who has found
Steppling's previous work too dark. "I'm amazed when people say,
'Your plays are so depressing,'" he said. "Just turn on the news, and
see the carnage and suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Steppling returned to L.A. for a workshop of "Dog Mouth" in
December 2000, part of the Taper's New Work Festival. He and Taper
producing director Robert Egan co-directed "Dog Mouth" there.
Steppling said he enjoyed the use of the Taper's support network, and
he thinks Egan is "a great critic and an astute analyst who made some
essential suggestions."</TE>
<TE>   However, he doesn't want to participate in any more Taper New Work
Festivals. He said Egan could have made the same suggestions from
simply reading the play--and in fact "has been helpful on plays that
weren't part of the New Work Festival."</TE>
<TE>   As for the festival itself, "it's a small bone tossed from the
master's table," he said. "And I've seen too many plays ruined by
development, where the original had energy and integrity, but the
corners get rounded off. A play by committee is not a good idea.
There is enough collaboration in the rehearsal process anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences saw the Taper workshops, and "once there is an audience,
it's a performance, but one that's not entirely prepared," Steppling
said. "There's never quite enough time. It's frustrating, and for me
it's a dead end and a waste of time. I know they're not going to put
me on the main stage."</TE>
<TE>   Egan responded that he believes the workshop helped "unearth" the
play. He added that the festival was not a dead end, for the play is
now being co-produced at the Evidence Room and Padua Playwrights
Productions--descendant of the Padua Hills Playwrights Festival,
where Steppling began writing plays in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Egan said, "John's plays are very intimate. I
wouldn't want to see them get swallowed or damaged by an 800-seat
venue like the Taper."</TE>
<TE>   "Insulting nonsense," said Steppling, when told of that last
remark. "That's just a way of justifying the fact that they don't
produce writers like me."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their disagreements, Egan said, "you've got to admire
John's commitment to his own voice. He's not altering or bastardizing
it to suit some producer." Egan called "Dog Mouth" "vintage Steppling
in terms of the form and style. But in terms of the content, there's
a new maturity, a new level of existential introspection that can
come only with age."</TE>
<TE>   Steppling, on the other hand, said his themes remain the same. But
he believes the formal elements of his writing are entering a
different phase. "It has to do maybe with streamlining the
metaphysics and the emotions. It feels like I've zeroed in on the
germane tensions, that the palette has narrowed and intensified."</TE>
<TE>   Steppling has a bottom line on what he hopes to accomplish with
"Dog Mouth" or any play. "Whether the ending is happy or sad,
confusing or poetic, or it just stops with no ending, you should
leave the theater haunted by that experience."</TE>

<HD>Taking Up the Concerto Challenge</HD>
<DH>The form entices newcomers and veterans alike to test their
mettle on new discs ranging from Brahms to Berio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The concerto is always, on some level, a power struggle, which is
surely why it has been such a long-running spectator sport. An
individual confronts a group. The composer sets up an occasion for
conflict and/or cooperation. Another dynamic takes place between
conductor and soloist--who is in charge? Composers challenge
performers with demands for excessive virtuosity. The circumstances
are always complex, and given the number of concerto recordings that
never cease to pour forth, as well as the number of concertos that
continue to be written, the process remains ever fascinating.</LD>
<LD>   **1/2 BRAHMS: Violin Concerto: STRAVINSKY: Violin Concerto,</LD>
<LD>   Hilary Hahn, violin; Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Neville
Marriner, conductor,  Sony Classical</LD>
<TE>   **1/2 BRAHMS: Violin Concerto,  Kyung Wha Chung, violin;</TE>
<TE>   Vienna Philharmonic,Simon Rattle, conductor, EMI Classics</TE>
<TE>   For Brahms, the concerto was an epic form, with the soloist as a
protagonist in a novel interacting with a host of characters (other
instruments in the orchestra) and in a variety of different musical
situations. Hilary Hahn, at 22, may still be a little short on life
experience to be a complete Brahmsian. But no matter, she gives a
considered, serious, eminently musical and altogether satisfying
account of the concerto, beautifully played. Equally luxurious is her
playing of the smaller Stravinsky concerto.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn needs more substantial accompaniment than the facile
background supplied from Neville Marriner and his chamber orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if Hahn had the benefit of Simon Rattle's powerful
accompaniment and the backing of the Vienna Philharmonic, something
special might well occur (as it might when she plays the Brahms with
Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in May).
Unfortunately, Rattle's highly enthusiastic conducting brings out the
worst in Kyung Wha Chung, whose tone is no longer as secure as it
once was and who compensates with raw aggression. Rattle fills out
his disc with a powerfully individual interpretation of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, but most collectors will want to wait for Rattle's
Beethoven complete symphony set with the Vienna Philharmonic, which
will be released this year.</TE>
<TE>   ****BERIO: "Voci",  Kim Kashkashian, viola; Vienna Radio Symphony
Orchestra, Dennis Russell Davies, conductor, ECM</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2BALADA: Piano Concerto No. 3; Concierto Magico; Music for
Flute and Orchestra, Rosa Torres-Pardo, piano; Eliot Fisk, guitar;
Magdalena Martinez, flute; Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National
Orchestra, Jose Serebrier, conductor, Naxos</TE>
<TE>   Soloists love to lead an orchestra in a merry dance, and folk
music has frequently found its way into concertos (the last movement
of Brahms' Violin Concerto is gypsy-inspired). In "Voci" (Voices),
from 1984, Luciano Berio transcribes Sicilian songs and lullabies for
viola, then places the tunes in a thick and sumptuously resonant
orchestral blanket the likes of which only Berio, with his love for
layered sound, can create. Much of the music is eerie to begin with,
and it becomes all the more so once the Italian composer is through
with it. Also on this splendidly performed, recorded and produced
disc, which will be released later in the month, are field recordings
from Sicily of the original folk songs and another folk-infused work
by Berio, "Naturale," for viola, percussion and tape.</TE>
<TE>   Leonardo Balada, a composer who has taught at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh for the past 30 years, also updates folk
sources, though ones from his native Barcelona, in his "Concierto
Magico" for guitar and orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Like Berio, he has found a voice that is excitingly modern yet
rooted in his own culture. Balada's strong style--sensual yet
strikingly percussive--is also readily apparent in his latest Piano
Concerto and the Music for Flute and Orchestra; all three concertos
are from the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   The performances are first-rate, and a budget price is welcome
encouragement for the curious to take a chance on something new.</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 PROKOFIEV: Violin Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, Leila Josefowicz,
violin; Symphony, Orchestra of Montreal, Charles Dutoit, conductor,
Philips</TE>
<TE>   Leila Josefowicz seems to reinvent herself every year or two, and
she is still young enough to get away with it. No more the nice girl
these days, but rather the raw, hard-hitting downtowner. Here, with
Charles Dutoit willing to give her all the rope she wants, Josefowicz
attacks Prokofievian melancholy with a brutally hard edge. Her
bizarre interpretations are intriguing at least the first time
around. She is at least a young player with ideas, even if not always
good ones.</TE>
<TE>   ****RABINOVITCH: "La Triade", Yayoi Toda, amplified violin;
Orchestra of Padova and Veneto, Alexandre Rabinovitch, conductor
Doron Music</TE>
<TE>   Alexandre Rabinovitch is best known as a pianist and conductor who
often performs Mozart, Brahms and Rachmaninoff with his companion,
Martha Argerich.</TE>
<TE>   But he is also a breathtaking Minimalist composer who infuses
Philip Glass-type repetitive rhythmic enthusiasms with a grippingly
intense Russian soulfulness. The half-hour "La Triade" (The Triad),
written in 1998, is a violin concerto as mystic rite. Rabinovitch
calls it a response to an African concept of human nature as made up
of the perishable soul, the body and the imperishable soul. Other
cultures join in, as well. The second movement is trance music,
inspired by the ecstasy of the Hindu god Siva; the third movement's
transfigured stillness proposes a union between St. Teresa of Avila
and the Tao. Amplified solo violin and orchestra each encourage the
other into ever more rapt figures creating a hallucinogenic effect.
Also on the disc is Rabinovitch's choral work "The Tibetan Book of
the Dead," a 45-minute mesmeric excursion into the inner recesses of
the chant "Om mani padme hum."</TE>
<TE>   **** BEETHOVEN: Piano Concertos, Various artists in historic
performances, Andante</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 BEETHOVEN: Piano Concertos, Russell Sherman, piano;
Monadnock Music Festival Orchestra; James Bolle, conductor GM
Recordings</TE>
<TE>   Andante's four-CD set (available through www.andante.com) offers a
marvelous survey of legendary performers playing Beethoven's five
piano concertos. Made between 1939 and 1947, the classic recordings
feature eight pianists (the last three concertos are duplicated in
different performances) and each with a distinct personality. Arthur
Rubinstein plays the Third Concerto with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC
Symphony; Rudolf Serkin, the Fifth (the "Emperor") with Bruno Walter
and the New York Philharmonic. One particularly interesting contrast
is between Walter Gieseking dashing through the Fourth in wartime
Dresden as though without a care in the world and Clara Haskil
playing it with solemn, gracious sensuality in London shortly after
the war. Transfers from the 78-rpm discs are better than they've ever
been.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Sherman's traversal of the five Beethoven concertos,
recorded live at the Monadnock Festival in 2000, is, on the other
hand, a single-minded point of view. A cult figure in the Boston
area, the pianist brings a great deal of sensitivity and
thoughtfulness to these works. At times he can be mesmerizing, but
there are too many dead patches where he doesn't always overcome the
sluggish accompaniments (every movement is played slower than on any
interpretation on the Andante set).</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2 MENDELSSOHN Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, Jean-Yves
Thibaudet, piano;  Gewandhaus Orchestra; Herbert Blomstedt,
conductor, Decca</TE>
<TE>   Mendelssohn's piano concertos have never had the popularity of his
beloved Violin Concerto. But the elfin, melodic first, and the
darker, more robust second are both major works. Jean-Yves
Thibaudet's cool, elegant style, clear tone and rhythmic precision
suit Mendelssohn well, as does Herbert Blomstedt's careful
conducting. The Gewandhaus was Mendelssohn's orchestra in Leipzig and
plays his music as though it still is.</TE>
<TE>   ** TCHAIKOVSKY, Piano Concerto No. 1, Fazil Say, piano; St.
Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Yuri Temirkanov, conductor Teldec
Classics</TE>
<TE>   A vibrant Turkish pianist, Fazil Say is yet another young player
eager to put his stamp on one of the most famous concertos of all.
Ever insistent, he begins Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto by
overemphasizing the crashing chords and then attempts to outdo
himself for the rest of the work.</TE>
<TE>   Yuri Temirkanov, usually a brilliant Tchaikovskian, is curiously
out of step, sometimes all too eager to rhythmically push Say over
the edge, other times panting to keep up. Say fills out the disc with
Liszt's Sonata in B Minor, which is also played with a sense of
breathless excitement and to more entertaining, if not quite
astonishing, effect.</TE>
<TE>   *** LUTOSLAWSKI: Dance Preludes, NIELSEN: Clarinet Concerto,
PROKOFIEV: Sonata, Opus 94 (transcribed for clarinet and orchestra),
Richard Stoltzman, clarinet; Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, Lawrence
Leighton Smith, conductor RCA Victor Red Seal</TE>
<TE>   Clarinetist Richard Stoltzman's playing has never lacked for
personality. His problem as he has matured has been the opposite,
that of jazzy mannerism. Fussiness pervades everything on this disc,
but not always to disadvantage. The Lutoslawski Dance Preludes are,
themselves, character pieces and can withstand every exaggeration
Stoltzman throws at them. The Nielsen concerto is so quirky in its
own right that Stoltzman sounds right at home. But Prokofiev's Flute
Sonata comes out doubly distorted--by Kent Kennan's clumsy turning it
into a clarinet concerto and by Stoltzman's showy playing of it.</TE>
<TE>   *** TANEYEV Concert Suite for Violin and Orchestra, Pekka
Kuusisto, violin; Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Vladimir
Ashkenazy, conductor, Ondine</TE>
<TE>   Pupil of Tchaikovsky, teacher of Scriabin, sometimes called the
Russian Brahms, Sergei Taneyev was a substantial composer and an
interesting one. The movements in his Concert Suite, a large-scale
violin concerto, begin conventionally, but give them a minute or two
and the fantasy begins, especially when played by the late violinist
David Oistrakh. Unfortunately the young Finn Pekka Kuusisto is on the
bland side (although technically impressive) and Vladimir Ashkenazy
is not much help. Nevertheless, the essential qualities of the score
come through, and as a bonus, Ashkenazy conducts the lengthy overture
and one entr'acte from Taneyev's greatest and most ambitious work,
the opera "Oresteya."</TE>

<LD>I commend Agustin Gurza for featuring Lila Downs and her "Border/La
Linea" CD among his top 10 ("A List Without Borders," Jan. 6)</LD>
<LD>   Neither am I Latin nor do I even speak Spanish, and yet this
recording has spoken to me, more eloquently than any other in recent
memory. In various dialects and rhythms, Downs conveys the depth,
complexity, joys and pain involved in the struggle to find and attain
personal and cultural freedom. She does so with a magnificent
five-octave range and sympathetic musical backing.</LD>
<LD>   Lest anyone gets the notion she is some provincial, semi-esoteric
artist, listen to her virtual hip-hop reworking of Woody Guthrie's
"This Land Is Your Land." It not only reveals Guthrie's true intent,
but goes further, exploding Bruce Springsteen's plaintive "The Ghost
of Tom Joad," turning it defiant and relevant.</LD>
<TE>   This recording and the one that preceded it ("La Sandunga")
represent truly transcendent music-making.</TE>

<LD>Sean Penn's hypocrisy, let me count the ways ("Don't Get Him
Started," by Rachel Abramowitz, Jan. 6).</LD>
<LD>   Anything feel-good is baloney. Except when he's in it (see:
"Friends").</LD>
<LD>   America is a comfort-addicted society, yet he gets, having
presumably asked for it, $5 million for a film role so he can live an
obscenely comfortable life.</LD>
<TE>   The Hollywood system is shallow and corrupt, but he throws a fit
over being denied use of a private jet to fly to a premiere.</TE>
<TE>   Go away, Sean Penn. Go far away.</TE>
<TE>   JEFF WEINSTOCK</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor Sean Penn. What a hard life he must lead, married to a
stunning actress with two healthy children and living in a "compound
north of San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   Too bad that he isn't "ahead of the game financially." Otherwise
we wouldn't be subjected to his angry, martyrdom rants and anarchic
desire to eradicate history like a certain someone else who had a
predilection for burning books and entire cultures not so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   In light of current world events, are his comments relevant? In
fact, is Penn even relevant?</TE>
<TE>   PHILIP T. EDGERLY</TE>
<TE>   Crofton, Md.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An insightful interview notwithstanding, Abramowitz, for reasons I
can only guess are personal, felt compelled to write, "The only other
occupants of the bar are an ever-expanding klatch of rich,
blue-haired ladies ... discussing drinking and shopping, their tinny
tones constantly threatening to drown out ..."</TE>
<TE>   Truthful? Probably. Necessary? No. Condescending? Definitely. Had
it been written by a man, it would have been unacceptable. That it
was written by a woman makes me shake my head in acknowledgement that
as women we can be our own worst enemies.</TE>

<LD>Aaron Landy's letter was so hilarious (Letters, Jan. 6), I thought
Phil Hendrie had branched out from radio to print, creating the
"consummate frustrated independent filmmaker": bitter, irate,
principled, artistic, underappreciated, paranoid, underfinanced and
overwrought. If the Big Bad Corporate World "buys" favorable reviews
from respected but corrupt critics (his oxymoron), then why would
they review many small films so positively?</LD>
<LD>   I have been lured to "artsy" movies by rapturous reviews, only to
be frequently disappointed. (But not bitterly; it's only a movie,
after all.)</LD>
<LD>   I don't feel betrayed by a diabolical intellectual conspiracy of
effete critics. Dreck is in the eye of the beholder, but so are the
Machiavellian machinations of greedy, soulless, all-powerful
conglomerates.</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Landy needs to be reminded that glowing reviews by the most
powerful critics cannot create a blockbuster, just as a universal
panning couldn't sink "Titanic." Perhaps "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" was reviewed positively because critics had
read the books, appreciated the adaptation and (horrors!) were
actually entertained.</TE>
<TE>   Dazed in his anti-corporate frenzy, Mr. Landy reacted to the film
("in mute horror") as if the hobbits were drinking Bud Light in the
Prancing Pony.</TE>
<TE>   Most moviegoers older than age 4 know that 15 to 20 minutes of
commercialism and self-promotion precede the main attraction.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the critic's job to analyze "cross-platforming." All
they have to do is tell a potential consumer if the film is good, bad
or a blend of both, and why.</TE>

proliferation of Polaroid images created by significant artists
("Instant Culture for Sale," Jan. 6), I was astonished that Marie
Cosindas was not mentioned anywhere in the piece.</LD>
<LD>   Her amazing Polaroid portraits and imaginative still-life
creations have been bringing their painterly images to the delighted
eyes of this viewer and others for many years.</LD>
<LD>   A hard-bound collection of her work, "Marie Cosindas: Color
Photographs," with a preface by Tom Wolfe (whose likeness she has
portrayed), alas, is now out of print. Cosindas deserves to be

<HD>A Year Later, AOL Struggles to Grow</HD>
<DH>Media: Merged in 2001, the industry giant pins hopes on
broadband and online unit, which hasn't lived up to expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On Monday, Richard D. Parsons, chief executive-designate at AOL Time
Warner Inc., delivered the sour medicine: Revenue and cash-flow
growth for the media giant will be slower this year than it had long
predicted, possibly in the single digits for both.</LD>
<LD>   But just a day later, Robert M. Pittman, co-chief operating
officer, came back with the spoonful of sugar: AOL Time Warner's
"future revenue potential" for its average online customer is $159 a
month--more than six times the $24 it currently gets.</LD>
<LD>   On the cable-TV side, the upside is just as optimistic, Pittman
said: $230 a month per subscriber, versus $52 now.</LD>
<TE>   "AOL Time Warner is a growth company!" Pittman declared to the
audience at an investor conference in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman didn't say when this revenue growth might arrive, or
exactly how the company will get there from here. In an interview
last week, he said he meant for the projections only to illustrate
how the business of broadband, or high-speed Internet connections,
might develop and didn't mean to imply it would "happen immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The story of AOL Time Warner's union always has been about
potential, of course, yet it was odd for Pittman to do such
cheerleading while his future boss' sober words still hung in the
air.</TE>
<TE>   "We will try not to over-promise," Parsons vowed Monday, "and we
will deliver."</TE>
<TE>   The mixed message reflects credibility problems that have dogged
AOL Time Warner from the outset and that Wall Street is looking to
Parsons to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons also must confront the fact that the America Online
division, once thought to be the main engine of future growth for the
company, is showing signs of maturity, although the unit remains the
sales leader. The vaunted Internet division may be subject to the
same swings as the company's more-established units, such as Time
Warner Cable, Time Inc. magazines and Warner Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, AOL Time Warner can look back on a solid 2001:</TE>
<TE>   * It completed the $100-billion merger of AOL Inc. and Time Warner
Inc.--history's biggest media marriage--Jan. 11, 2001, a year and a
day after the deal was announced.</TE>
<TE>   * Amid an economic recession and one of the worst advertising
slumps since World War II, the company generated 6% revenue growth
and 18% growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, also known as EBITDA or cash flow, the most common
earnings yardstick for media companies.</TE>
<TE>   * It named a new management team, led by Parsons, a veteran from
the Time Warner side, who will take over as chief executive when
Gerald Levin takes his early retirement in May.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman, whose roots are in AOL, will become sole chief operating
officer. Wayne H. Pace, former finance chief for Turner Broadcasting
System, has replaced AOL's Michael Kelly as chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   AOL founder Steve Case remains chairman of AOL Time Warner and is
expected to take a more active role after largely staying behind the
scene's during Levin's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   * A string of blockbuster movies, including "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone," "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring" and "Ocean's Eleven" helped the company's Warner Bros. Pictures
and New Line Cinema studio units have a record year.</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" are seen as franchises that
will be minting money for years, from films, games, promotional
tie-ins and a host of other spinoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the news has been positive, however.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's shares closed Friday at $30.69 on the New York
Stock Exchange, about 45% below the post-merger high of $58.51
reached in May and 59% below where the companies stood on the day
before the merger was announced.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has been stagnant for months, despite a rally that has
swept up much of the stock market. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index,
for example, is up 18% from its post-Sept. 11 low; AOL Time Warner is
up 5%.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Monday that it would take a one-time charge of
$40 billion to $60 billion against first-quarter earnings to bring
itself into compliance with new accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   Although the charge does not affect cash operations, it is a
painful reminder of the technology meltdown that followed the merger
announcement. The charge, which will be the largest in U.S. corporate
history if it exceeds $50 billion, reflects the decline in value of
the Time Warner assets that AOL acquired.</TE>
<TE>   The Warner Music Group unit, home to stars such as Enya, Linkin
Park and Jewel, sustained a sharp dropoff in revenue and cash flow
along with the rest of the industry. Analysts said many artists were
reluctant to travel after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons, in his Monday conference call with Wall Street analysts,
said the company isn't counting on a rebound in the economy or the
advertising business this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales Growth Targets</TE>
<TE>   Undergo a Revision</TE>
<TE>   Revenue growth for this year, he said, will be 5% to 8%, and
EBITDA growth 8% to 12%--far below the solid double-digit growth
forecasts that AOL Time Warner had been sticking to for most of last
year.</TE>
<TE>   With the revised targets, AOL Time Warner "set the bar low enough
that even a preschooler could get over it," Jeffrey B. Logsdon, an
analyst at Gerard Klauer &amp; Mattison, said in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   This probably will be another transition year for AOL, Logsdon
said, adding that he wouldn't recommend adding shares now.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the three dozen other analysts who follow AOL have stayed
the course, affirming earlier "buy" recommendations for the battered
shares. Longtime bull Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley, for example,
held to her "strong buy" rating, setting a 12-month "price target" of
$39 to $41 a share.</TE>
<TE>   However, that means that by this time next year, AOL should have
crawled back to within only 30% of its high for 2001--hardly a lofty
goal for a growth stock.</TE>
<TE>   The doubters cite the lack of a "catalyst" to propel sales and
cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Levin and other executives were calling the AOL unit
the "crown jewel" of the company. Lately, the Internet division is
looking a bit tarnished.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of last year, the advertising slowdown had dashed hopes
that the fast-growing online unit would come to the rescue and enable
the parent company to meet its aggressive financial targets. The
company said online advertising revenue grew last year by just 14%,
compared with 91% a year earlier. This fall, online ad revenue had
skidded to an anemic 3% growth rate.</TE>
<TE>   Equally worrisome, average revenue per AOL subscriber is leveling
off despite a 9% price hike last summer and efforts to cross-sell
customers additional services, such as AOL TV and AOLbyPhone. During
the first nine months of 2001, the company collected an average of
$24.15 per customer, compared to $25.75 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always a feeling in the company that the Internet would
make up for everything," said Paul Noglows, analyst at J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co. "They really didn't fully understand the impact of the
advertising recession."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, initial expectations that the Internet unit would
become the dominant force at AOL Time Warner are being replaced by
the realization that the online division is just one of several
high-profile components, including cable-TV and film units.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, AOL unit chairman Barry Schuler agreed that
expectations for the online company were perhaps too high, but he
stressed that his division nevertheless performed well, particularly
in light of the recession, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the
fact that the entire company had just completed a massive merger.</TE>
<TE>   During the first year after the merger, he said the online unit
moved quickly to take advantage of "synergies." AOL boosted its
subscriber base, thanks to referrals from Time Warner magazines, and
shaved its advertising budget by moving its television commercials to
sister cable channels CNN and TNT at discounted rates. Schuler
declined to provide specific numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Company's Hopes</TE>
<TE>   Riding on Broadband</TE>
<TE>   AOL also began its long-anticipated roll-out of broadband service
across Time Warner cable lines, which serve about 20% of the U.S.
cable market.</TE>
<TE>   The potential of broadband was a driving force behind the merger
and will remain a key challenge in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   It is considered pivotal to the future of AOL Time Warner and
other media giants because such high-speed Internet connections will
open the door to a variety of new consumer services, such as buying
music online, downloading movies and playing computerized games.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the sorts of services Pittman was talking about when he
told the Scottsdale audience his dream of $159 monthly fees.</TE>
<TE>   AOL hasn't disclosed exactly how many broadband customers it has
signed up, saying only that the figure is in the "hundreds of
thousands."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculate the number probably is under 500,000. Some
worry that AOL will fall behind cable companies in the race for
broadband customers.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been little visible progress in cutting deals with
other cable companies to allow AOL to offer its high-speed service on
their wires.</TE>
<TE>   Though negotiations are continuing and AOL is conducting a small
test with Cox Communications Inc., the parties still are squabbling
over how to split potential revenue and who should control the
billing relationship with the customer.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to get more aggressive in cutting deals," said Rob
Martin, analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. "Our impression
is that AOL's subscriber count is going to slow based on the lack of
a broadband upgrade path. They still can't deliver [cable] broadband
to 80% of the market."</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials are betting that customer loyalty will help them
prevail in the broadband race, which they say is just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "Until this point, broadband has been for the early adopters [of
technology]," Schuler said. "We think it's really going to kick up
and become mainstream in the coming year."</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner also is the king of cable content, as parent of
Home Box Office, CNN and the Turner networks. Its Time division's
stable of magazines, including Time, Sports Illustrated and People,
reaches 58 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to rolling out broadband on all Time Warner cable
systems this year, Schuler predicted AOL will sign at least two deals
with rival cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Online Division Aims</TE>
<TE>   for Growth Overseas</TE>
<TE>   Growth abroad is another key challenge for the Internet unit,
which already serves about 40% of the maturing U.S. market for online
customers. AOL Time Warner officials say they eventually want to
generate half of the company's revenue abroad, up from less than 20%
today.</TE>
<TE>   So far, AOL Europe has generated mostly losses, some $600 million
last year. And its European partner, Bertelsmann, bailed out of the
venture, exercising an option to sell its 49% stake in AOL Europe to
AOL Time Warner for $6.75 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The international campaign has not been as successful as they
wanted it to be," said Adam Klein, lead partner of the media and
entertainment division of Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's conference call, AOL executives said they hoped to cut
AOL Europe's losses in half this year and tried to put a positive
spin on the Bertelsmann deal, saying fuller control will enable the
company to more easily exploit synergies in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, AOL's subscription growth is starting to slow, though
it is holding its market share against a renewed assault by rival
Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The software giant is directly gunning for AOL customers in its
advertisements and has copied many of AOL's best features for its own
MSN online service. But MSN remains a distant second, with nearly 7
million subscribers worldwide to AOL's 33 million.</TE>
<TE>   AOL and Microsoft are fighting for the upper hand in controlling
how broadband services will be delivered to U.S. households. AOL
hopes its proprietary service will become a major platform, while
Microsoft is betting on its own Windows operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "We both have similar visions of what is going to happen in the
home," Schuler said. "They obviously have designs on that vision, as
do we."</TE>
<TE>   AOL officials said they see plenty of growth potential in the U.S.
market, which they predict could reach 95 million online households
over the next several years, from 62 million now.</TE>
<TE>   AOL, with 25 million U.S. subscribers, already serves a sizable
chunk of those households. The company is betting that it will win
about half of the 6 million new customers expected to come online
each year.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas A. Kass, a longtime AOL short-seller based in West Palm
Beach, Fla., thinks the company is in denial about the fact that it's
in a rapidly maturing business.</TE>
<TE>   Short-sellers like Kass make money by selling borrowed shares,
then returning them to the lender later, after the price has fallen.</TE>
<TE>   AOL already has "picked the low-hanging fruit" among online
subscribers, he said. New subscribers are getting harder to find and
more expensive to recruit, often involving promotional payments to
computer vendors or free offers to consumers, Kass said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that there's ever been any low-hanging fruit,"
Pittman said when told of Kass' remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Competing for subscribers has always been tough work, Pittman
said, and AOL has built its online dominance over years. The same
thing will happen with broadband, he predicted, but not right away.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing ever comes immediately," Pittman said.</TE>

<HD>Tougher Times Forcing Some Cotton Producers to Give Up</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Reduced demand comes amid record-high global
output, but most of California's growers are expected to survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"For Sale" signs mark the farms that surround Fred Starrh's cotton
farm in Shafter, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Years of rising costs for energy, labor, fertilizers and
pesticides, combined with the cost of water and its scarcity during
drought years, already had made it difficult for many of Starrh's
fellow cotton farmers to grow the crop profitably, even with
government subsidies.</LD>
<LD>   Now the problem has gotten worse. Demand for U.S. cotton is
dropping while production has reached record levels, driving prices
to 30-year lows in recent months with little recovery.</LD>
<TE>   With few profitable vegetable crops to switch to, many cotton
growers here in California and across the U.S. South are looking to
get out.</TE>
<TE>   "The market right now is impossible," Starrh said. He plans to
stick it out as long as he can, but is paring back planting until he
can find something else to farm. "There doesn't seem to be any bright
light at the end of the tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the South, California's 80-year-old cotton industry is
in the midst of a serious shakeout as increased production in the
U.S. and China, West Africa and Pakistan has caused a global glut.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton growers in Merced, Madera, Fresno, Tulare, Kings and Kern
counties long have had an edge over most others because of the San
Joaquin Valley's ideal growing conditions for the stronger varieties
of cotton such as Pima that command higher prices. But even that
business has sagged as the recession has hammered demand for fine
dress shirts and sweaters, bedsheets, table linens and towels
produced from these varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Some growers have left the business in recent years, and more are
expected to follow as weaker and less-efficient players are weeded
out, farm economists said.Most growers are expected to survive by
using new technology to cut costs and increase yields. And there
always will be demand for the San Joaquin Valley's world-renowned
crop, analysts said. Cotton ranks as the state's seventh-largest
crop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think California cotton has lost any of its sex appeal
[in the world market]. San Joaquin cotton is held in very high esteem
and buyers traditionally stay with what they feel comfortable with,"
said David Brandon, a senior vice president and cotton specialist
with Salomon Smith Barney in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for much of the last decade, the crop was profitable, with
prices well above the point where subsidies were needed. But in
recent years, as government subsidies and prices declined and costs
rose, it has become hard for most cotton farmers to break even.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton is one of many crops whose growers are suffering from
falling prices and increased foreign competition. One factor that has
made cotton different from other crops such as produce has been
government involvement and price supports. These have encouraged many
growers who have lower production costs to keep planting,</TE>
<TE>   driving prices down even further.</TE>
<TE>   Textile Manufacturers</TE>
<TE>   Reduce Production</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, much of the U.S. textile market is crumbling, rocked by
lower-cost textile producers in Asian countries who--thanks to
devalued currencies that make their products cheaper on world
markets--are grabbing a greater share of the global market.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 U.S. textile mills have closed since 1998, and some
textile industry giants such as Burlington Industries Inc. have filed
for bankruptcy protection, leaving less than 450,000 textile jobs in
this country in 2001, 13% fewer than the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining plants have reduced production as more apparel
manufacturers decide to import their finished goods.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until the year 2000, we ran all our mills seven days a week
except for Fourth of July and Christmas. Now we're running at 84%
capacity," said Duke Kimbrell, chairman of Gastonia, N.C.-based
Parkdale Mills, the country's largest yarn manufacturer. "We stop our
mills once a week to keep inventory from building up."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in textile production has contributed to a plunge in
consumption of U.S. cotton, which hit a 13-year low in November, down
19% from the same time the year before.</TE>
<TE>   That has kept cotton futures prices hovering at 35 cents a pound,
just above the 30-year-low reached in late October and far from its
high of $1.13 in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest hit are cotton growers in the Southeast, who supply U.S.
mills. But the decline also has taken a toll on California growers as
more cotton has been forced onto the export market, the traditional
destination for most of California's crop.</TE>
<TE>   As prices have come down, more of the state's farmers have tried
to grow Pima, the Cadillac of cotton prized for its long fibers. But
it's a difficult crop that doesn't take to all soils, yields less per
acre and requires special handling.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton Growers</TE>
<TE>   Switching Crops</TE>
<TE>   Others have been getting out of cotton entirely, planting trees,
vines and other perennial crops.</TE>
<TE>   California growers planted 870,000 acres of cotton last year, down
10% from the previous year and nearly half a million acres below the
state's peak of 1.3 million acres in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   So many growers have made the switch to wine grapes, almonds and
pistachios that those markets now are glutted, said Ron Vargas, a UC
Cooperative Extension farm advisor in Madera and Merced counties.</TE>
<TE>   "The grape industry has fallen apart this year. We're starting to
see vineyards pulled out because they just aren't economical. It
doesn't pay to grow them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And there are few vegetable crops that growers can turn to and
make money, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the cotton farming industry's problems is the
indecision in Congress over the future of government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton growers receive payments based on the amount they said
would be produced when registering with the government when the 1996
Freedom to Farm Act took effect.</TE>
<TE>   Under that act, they also receive so-called loan-deficiency
payments, often referred to as the federal "safety net" because it
pays growers the difference between the world price and a higher
price set by the government. The payouts were enacted to help the
domestic industry compete with lower-cost foreign producers, who
receive subsidies from their own governments.</TE>
<TE>   However, the U.S. subsidies are set to expire at the end of this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the House passed its version of a farm bill last fall, it
stalled in the Senate in December as legislators argued over how much
support grain and cotton growers should receive.</TE>
<TE>   Banks Cut Back on</TE>
<TE>   Production Loans</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty has made some lenders hesitant. Some banks began
cutting back on production loans last year, and this year some
growers who can't squeeze out as many bales per acre may have trouble
finding financing at all, said Mark Bagby of Calcot, a 1,725-member
cotton cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   "Lenders may be reluctant [to make loans] with market prices where
they are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers are putting their land on the market in hopes of
attracting bids from dairy farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Starrh said he's not ready to get out of the cotton business. He
came close to breaking even last year, and with two sons and a
son-in-law in the business, he wants to try to ride out the
industry's problems. Meanwhile, he's looking into planting other
crops.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to move, but you can't move very fast" in this
business, Starrh said.</TE>
<TE>   Tough as it sounds, analysts don't expect a wholesale exodus of
growers from the San Joaquin Valley. By some estimates, production
will decline in California and Arizona by no more than 15% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, despite its higher costs, California could fare better
than the rest of the Cotton Belt in the industry consolidation, given
the high quality of its Pima and other long-staple cottons.</TE>
<TE>   The trick for growers will be surviving the next several years
until supply and demand are back in balance. In California, survival
will hinge on two factors, Bagby said: water and the fate of
subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Without some kind of government aid, Maricopa Flats cotton grower
George Cappello said, he and the rest of the growers in the state
won't survive. Yet he acknowledged that with subsidies, at least at
current levels, there's often incentive to over-plant.</TE>
<TE>   He would like to see subsidies kick in when prices drop too low.</TE>
<TE>   "We just need a backstop to keep us from going broke," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cappello didn't risk running into the red. He sat out
the season, leaving 400 acres--a third of his land--fallow in cotton
season as the cost of pumping water to his property soared.</TE>
<TE>   This year isn't looking much better. The question is, he said, how
big a loss can he survive?</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's a question of how gutsy do I feel," he said with
a laugh. "If you take your ground out [of production], you know how
much money you're going to lose" in water district costs, dust
control and maintenance. But if Cappello decides to plant
cotton--depending on water costs and production per acre--he could
come out ahead or lose tens of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   For many growers, the break-even point had hovered around 70 cents
a pound in recent years, close to the price they could get for their
crop with government loan payments.</TE>
<TE>   But with the minimum wage rising, and the cost of water and
fertilizer going up, that equation is changing, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Given Cappello's costs to bring water to his property, he
estimates that he needs to get about 90 cents a pound, based on
yields of three bales per acre, to break even and perform the
necessary maintenance on his tractors and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Most years, the returns from his citrus groves, tomatoes and
melons are enough to cover the difference. But this year, he's not so
sure that will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The mid-1980s was pretty bad for agriculture, but this is far
worse," he said. "All you can hope to do [in a great year] is break
even."</TE>
<TE>   Industry Should Survive</TE>
<TE>   and Even Thrive</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Crowder, agricultural economist with Bank of America in
Fresno, is a bit more optimistic about the industry's prospects.
Although times are tough, he said, the industry should survive and
even thrive after some of the weaker, less efficient players are
weeded out.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't put everything into trees and vines," Crowder said,
adding that farmers can't leave hundreds of thousands of acres of
land fallow.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that California growers will continue to adopt more
techniques to cut growing costs, packing cotton rows together more
tightly and using genetically modified seeds to reduce the need for
weeding and pesticides while improving yields.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't continue to do it the same way we've been doing
it," Crowder said. "We have to figure out how to do better for less.
Some producers will have the capacity to do that--others won't."</TE>

<HD>Regulators Set Rules for SBC PacBell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lines Drawn in Battle Over Long-Distance," [Dec. 23] missed the key
point about our application to offer long-distance service:
Regulators set the conditions for SBC Pacific Bell's entry into the
market, and we've met them.</LD>
<LD>   Federal communications law requires that we meet a 14-point
checklist to ensure that our network is open to competition. The
California Public Utilities Commission has added hundreds of
additional conditions since 1998. And we've fulfilled those
conditions, too.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the CPUC is poised to vote on our application, competitors
are desperately trying to spread confusion by raising issues
unrelated to long-distance. For years, they've been trying to keep us
out of the market--at a cost to California consumers of more than $1
billion a year.</LD>
<TE>   The story failed to note that, at recent CPUC public participation
hearings in Los Angeles and San Francisco, dozens of consumer, labor
and business organizations representing thousands of Californians
endorsed our entry into the long-distance market.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony was overwhelmingly in support because these groups
know the track record of long-distance competition that has occurred
in nine other states. When SBC Pacific Bell is allowed into the
market, competition will intensify for residential and business
customers in both local and long-distance services.</TE>
<TE>   The CPUC has spent nearly four years considering this issue--they
raised the bar, and we've cleared it. It's long past time for
California consumers to receive, like more than 75 million other
Americans, the benefits of long-distance competition.</TE>

<TE>   Labels Need Good Albums, Not Just a Hit</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe the record companies are whining that they're
losing money because of their own stupidity ["Labels Singing the
Blues Over Expensive Failures," Dec. 26].</TE>
<TE>   How many employers would give someone an $80-million (most likely
non-recoupable) paycheck before they do anything for them? They
invest millions in new acts that are signed on the basis of looks and
one potential hit, which they build an entire album around.</TE>
<TE>   With the advent of sites like Napster (which the record companies
completely missed the boat on by not cutting a download deal), CD
burners and cable modems, it shouldn't come as a shock that people
download the singles they like for free instead of spending almost
$20 just for one song.</TE>
<TE>   If the record companies really want to get people into the stores,
cater a little more to the people who have the money to spend and put
out an album with 10 or 12 great songs people will listen to from
start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Conley</TE>
<TE>   Morristown, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   I believe the reason CD sales are down is because of the demise of
Napster.</TE>
<TE>   Kids can't sample songs anymore and the only thing left is the
graft that is inherent in the lousy radio we get here in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As a former managing director of the National Academy of
Songwriters, I understand why writers and publishers went after
Napster. But I think, in retrospect, it was killing the goose that
laid the golden egg.</TE>
<TE>   Napster allowed a free exchange of so many "album cuts" and other
oddities, I believe it actually encouraged CD sales. Nobody buys
music because nobody knows what's out there that isn't being promoted
by the "those who think they know what we want."</TE>
<TE>   A smarter move would have been to measure the loss of revenue from
Napster and write it off as "promotional investment."</TE>

<HD>Multiple Accounts Could Be Good News--Or Bad--for Credit
Score</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have obtained quite a few credit cards over the years.
Most of the accounts have zero balances and I don't use them. There
are two opinions about owning too many credit cards. One says your
credit rating will be affected by having so many credit cards. The
other says you have a better rating because you have a very high
total credit line combined from all the accounts and you use only a
small portion. Which is correct? Should I close all these unused
accounts?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Your question is common enough, and the answer complicated
enough, that the rest of this column will be devoted to answering it.</LD>
<LD>   But if you're in a hurry, here's the short version: Both opinions
may be correct, and you may or may not want to close those extra
accounts.</LD>
<TE>   Your ability to get credit is based on many factors, some of which
are used to compute a three-digit figure known as your credit score.
Your credit score incorporates information such as how long you've
had credit, the total credit available to you, how much of that
credit you use and whether you've had trouble making payments, among
other factors, said Craig Watts, head of consumer affairs for Fair,
Isaac &amp; Co., the leading credit scoring company.</TE>
<TE>   If your balances are small and your total credit limit is high,
that indeed could help your score.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the whole picture. Your credit score does not
include information about your income. Many lenders, however, ask how
much you earn when you apply for a loan so they can determine your
ability to repay.</TE>
<TE>   A lender who has access to your income and financial statements
might well decide that all that plastic is a menace, because you
could suddenly decide to max out all your credit limits and be unable
to pay back your obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if you applied for a number of credit cards in a short
period and you haven't had credit for long, lenders probably will see
you as a bigger risk than if you had fewer cards, Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Isaac advises consumers to protect their credit score by
applying for credit sparingly. (That's good advice for protecting
your financial health, as well.)</TE>
<TE>   Once a credit line is open, however, closing it really won't
improve your credit score, Watts said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if you carry a balance on any of your credit cards,
closing accounts can  hurt your score. That's because the credit
score formula looks at the difference between the amount of credit
you've been granted and the amount you're actually using, Watts said.
Suddenly closing off a bunch of credit lines can make the balance you
carry loom larger, and take points off your score.</TE>
<TE>   You also can do damage by closing an account you've had for a long
time. A lengthy history of credit helps your score, so you may want
to hang on to that credit card you had in college, even if you never
use it.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean you should never close a credit card account,
however. Having too many cards can be an invitation to disaster in
other ways.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, it's hard to keep track of more than two or three
credit card accounts. Credit card companies are constantly changing
their terms, and a moment's inattention could lead you into paying
more in interest charges or fees.</TE>
<TE>   More accounts mean more of your financial information is floating
around in the mail as well. Credit thieves love to steal statements
and those pesky "convenience checks" from mailboxes and use them to
run up charges in your name.</TE>
<TE>   Having a lot of department store charge cards may not help your
score much either. These cards tend to be easier to get, which is why
they're a good starter card for people who are building or rebuilding
credit. But they don't help your credit rating as much as
harder-to-get credit cards issued by major lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, having a lot of credit cards could be catastrophic for
someone who has trouble controlling his or her spending. Shutting
those accounts could be the best solution in the long run, even if it
does temporarily ding your credit score.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some things to keep in mind when closing accounts:</TE>
<TE>   * Your best strategy, both for your credit score and your
financial health, is not to carry a balance on any of your credit
cards. If you don't carry a balance on any card, you can close as
many accounts as you'd like without hurting your score.</TE>
<TE>   * If you do carry a balance on any of your cards, make sure you
don't start closing accounts right before you want to apply for a
major loan such as a mortgage or car financing. Wait until after
you're approved.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't cancel an account that still has a balance. Pay it off
first, or transfer it to another card. Wait a month or two to make
sure you get a statement that reports a zero balance to ensure that
you've paid all the interest charges and fees.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't shut off longtime accounts. Opt to close department store
cards and more recent unused lines of credit first.</TE>
<TE>   * Call each credit card company to find out how they want you to
close the account. If you're a good customer, expect the companies to
give you the hard sell in an effort to keep you. You might wind up
with better terms or perks, such as extra frequent-flier miles, that
could change your mind about closing a particular account.</TE>
<TE>   * If you want to go ahead with the cancellation, ask the company
to report to credit bureaus that the account was closed at your
request. Check your credit report in a few months to make sure that
was done.</TE>
<TE>   * After you've closed an account, keep the paperwork the company
sends you showing the account has been shut. You might need it if
there are disputes over the account.</TE>

<HD>Not All Deposits in Banks Insured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors driven to safe havens--such as bank deposits and
certificates of deposit--may be shocked to find that not all bank
deposits are safe.</LD>
<LD>   In the last three years, investors have lost $114 million to bank
failures because they exceeded the $100,000-per-depositor insurance
limit imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</LD>
<LD>   And even as failures such as the collapse last summer of Superior
Bank of Hinsdale, Ill., grab headlines, the estimated amount of
uninsured deposits in U.S. financial institutions has been rising
steadily. Almost 28% of bank and thrift deposits were uninsured as of
last fall, up from 19.7% in 1996, according to the FDIC.</LD>
<TE>   Although some who lost money on uninsured deposits knew they were
taking risks by leaving more than $100,000 on deposit in a single
financial institution, many did not. They thought their funds were
fully insured, until their banks failed and the FDIC informed them
about how much they had lost, regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible to have more than $1 million on deposit in a single
institution and have it completely FDIC insured. However, to do so,
investors must set up their accounts carefully, according to detailed
FDIC rules. Otherwise, any amount over $100,000 per depositor is at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   What do you need to know?</TE>
<TE>   Basics</TE>
<TE>   Federal deposit insurance protects principal and interest of up to
$100,000 per depositor, per bank. However, those who properly title
their accounts can leave significantly more in a single institution
and be fully covered. That's because joint accounts, accounts that
are payable on death to a qualified beneficiary and retirement
accounts are separately insured.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this hypothetical example. Jane Smith deposits $100,000
at her bank in her own name. She also opens a joint-ownership account
with her husband, John, for $200,000. She sets up a $300,000 account
that will go to her three siblings--$100,000 each to Keith, Karen and
Kevin--when she dies. And she sets up a $400,000 account, which is
payable on death to her four children, Mary, Maura, Meg and Michael.
Finally, she has a $100,000 individual retirement account in her own
name. The entire $1.1 million is fully insured by the FDIC.</TE>
<TE>   Tricks</TE>
<TE>   But a tiny misstep can jeopardize that insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, payable-on-death accounts qualify for separate
insurance coverage only if the beneficiary is a child, grandchild,
parent, sibling or spouse of the account owner.</TE>
<TE>   If Jane made the mistake of naming a niece, nephew, in-law or
cousin as the beneficiary of any of those payable-on-death accounts,
the money earmarked for that nonqualified beneficiary would be
aggregated with her individual deposits to determine how much
insurance coverage she had. Any amount above $100,000 could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the beneficiary must have a complete right to the
cash, without condition, at Jane's death. If there are any conditions
on the transfer, such as the child must graduate from high school or
some of the money would go to charity before the named beneficiary
gets the rest, the separate FDIC coverage is lost.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, assets in living trusts rarely qualify for separate
FDIC coverage because these trusts commonly have some condition on
the beneficiary's right to the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some depositors also mistakenly assume that they can get vast
amounts of FDIC coverage by setting up numerous joint accounts.
However, the interest of each individual owner in a joint account is
aggregated with that owner's share of all other joint accounts to
determine insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if Jane sets up joint accounts rather than
payable-on-death accounts for her children and siblings, the amount
of insurance coverage on her accounts would plummet.</TE>
<TE>   She still would have $100,000 in coverage for her individual
account, $100,000 for her retirement account and $100,000 for her
first joint account. But she would not have the additional $700,000
in coverage she would get by designating those as pay-on-death
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Also, even though retirement accounts are a separate category,
garnering separate FDIC coverage, all individually held retirement
accounts are lumped together. (Company retirement accounts do get
separate insurance, however.)</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, a person with a traditional IRA, a Keogh account and
a Roth IRA would have to aggregate all of those accounts to determine
how much was covered. If $100,000 was deposited in each of those
accounts, $200,000 of this individual's retirement money would be at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   Pension and profit-sharing plans get so-called pass-through
coverage. That means a plan with 10 equal beneficiaries could have up
to $1 million deposited in one bank and be fully covered.</TE>
<TE>   Some depositors also mistakenly assume that certificates of
deposit that are purchased from a broker have separate coverage.
However, they are generally aggregated with any similar account that
an individual has at that same bank. If those accounts add up to more
than $100,000, the overage is not insured.</TE>
<TE>   When It Counts</TE>
<TE>   It's worth noting that FDIC insurance coverage kicks in only in
the rare event that a bank fails. However, at that point, the
coverage is invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the agency would arrange for another bank to take
over the insured assets and liabilities of the failed institution.
Depositors and borrowers would suffer little interruption. If a buyer
couldn't be found to assume the assets, the agency literally could
write checks to every covered depositor on the day of the failure for
both the principal and interest in their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   If a single depositor has many accounts adding up to more than
$100,000, there could be a delay while the agency checked account
records to determine whether the amount over $100,000 deserves
separate insurance coverage. At times like these, paying attention to
the details can mean the difference between walking away whole or
losing a fortune.</TE>

<HD>Enron and Ivan Boesky: Symbols of Their Eras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With every financial market boom, then bust, one person or company
often emerges as the symbol of all that went terribly wrong.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1980s and early '90s that symbol was Ivan Boesky, the
stock trader who agreed to pay $100 million to settle insider-trading
charges, and then helped implicate junk bond king Michael Milken and
others in a far wider federal investigation of dirty dealings on Wall
Street.</LD>
<LD>   Today, there is a long list candidates from which to select the
enduring symbol of the late 1990s economic and market boom and the
bust that has followed. But they are mostly general themes rather
than individual names: dot-com companies in aggregate, for example;
manipulated initial public share offerings; brokerage analysts who
never met a stock they didn't like; accounting firms that never met a
"pro forma" earnings statement they couldn't certify.</LD>
<TE>   By last week, however, one individual name was rapidly moving up
the candidate list: Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The former energy-trading giant, which on Dec. 2 became the
largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, may for future generations
summarize in two syllables all of the excesses that marked the
late-'90s boom and helped precipitate the subsequent bust.</TE>
<TE>   Consider: Enron, like dot-com companies, was a "new paradigm"
business that argued (successfully, for a while) that its stock
deserved a premium valuation because there wasn't much brick and
mortar to support it, but rather intellectual assets, financial savvy
and the seeming certainty that the firm's vision of the energy
business' future was the correct vision.</TE>
<TE>   Enron also had virtually every analyst on Wall Street in its
breast pocket, in part because of a take-no-prisoners approach to
those who challenged it. During one investor conference call last
spring, a money manager who dared to ask then-Enron Chief Executive
Jeffrey Skilling for an updated company balance sheet was called an
obscenity by Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   As analysts and investors found out much too late, Enron had
plenty to hide: By October, the company began to reveal the extent of
losses it had racked up doing business with largely hidden
partnerships run by Enron executives. The company's financial
statements were rewritten back to 1997, sharply reducing the earnings
investors had believed were real.</TE>
<TE>   As the company careened toward bankruptcy, and a once $90 stock
became worth pennies, a key question was, "Where were the auditors?"
Why didn't the company's independent accountants raise issues with
Enron's inflated financial results?</TE>
<TE>   Last week the auditing firm, Andersen, detonated a bomb of its
own, announcing that its employees had destroyed a "significant"
number of documents related to Enron audits.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, it still wasn't clear whether the documents had been
destroyed intentionally or by accident. But the outcome may be the
same either way: the demise of Andersen itself, the fifth-largest
U.S. accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the similarities between the Ivan Boesky saga and the Enron
story continue to grow. Both reeked of astounding hubris,
self-dealing and greed.</TE>
<TE>   Boesky, it was argued, ripped off small investors by trading
takeover stocks with inside knowledge, and by manipulating securities
prices to suit his desires. The same was said of Milken and his
brokerage, Drexel Burnham Lambert. Boesky's testimony was key to the
eventual imprisonment of Milken and the bankruptcy of Drexel.</TE>
<TE>   But it was impossible to measure exactly how much small investors
were harmed by the self-dealing of Boesky and Milken. In some cases,
investors who bet on the same takeover stocks that Boesky played may
have profited, thanks to him. (Some defenders of Boesky at the time
argued that his crimes were essentially victimless, and that he was a
piker among Wall Street crooks.)</TE>
<TE>   As for Milken, whose enormous power to manipulate the corporate
junk bond market clearly had corrupted him, his downfall helped at
least temporarily to crush the value of many junk bonds in 1990,
ruining some investors' fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   But Milken's underwriting skills also helped to build up many
legitimate companies in the 1980s (among them: phone giant MCI, now
part of WorldCom, and Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting, now part of
AOL Time Warner), creating thousands of jobs that didn't disappear
when he went off to prison. And the junk bond market quickly
recovered in the early 1990s, and today is larger than ever and a
critical source of financing for many companies.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's collapse, by contrast, took with it the retirement savings
of thousands of employees, and punched serious, and likely
irreparable, holes in the portfolios of many institutional and
individual investors. Many analysts believe it is highly unlikely
that Enron's common shareholders will collect a cent in the
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   (The stock didn't trade Friday, and the New York Stock Exchange
said it will continue to suspend trading pending more details on
Enron's future. The shares closed at 67 cents on Thursday.)</TE>
<TE>   Whether Enron's business concept as an energy trader will prove to
be a lasting legacy for its industry remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the company's name is certain only to remind future
generations of the biggest scandals of the last bull market:
investors' blind faith in the promises of arrogant corporate
managers; Wall Street analysts' (and, perhaps, the financial media's)
inability or unwillingness to question conventional wisdom; and
independent auditors' failures in the process of discovery and
disclosure of companies' true financial positions.</TE>

<LD>Major financial market scandals rightly anger many investors and
undermine confidence in Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   But the greatest damage they may do in the long run is convince
some investors that everything connected to securities markets is a
gyp and that investing isn't worth the effort.</LD>
<LD>   It's an easy blanket argument to make against investing at times
like this, as scandal after scandal dominate the headlines: Enron
Corp.'s collapse; major brokerages accused of manipulating initial
public stock offerings; and even last week's allegation that an
Orange County teen took in $1 million in less than two months via an
Internet-based Ponzi scheme (though that arguably constituted
"investing" only for fools or for people who knew they probably were
being scammed, but took a chance anyway).</LD>
<TE>   Though fear of being ripped off on Wall Street is hardly
unfounded, it may be more dangerous to allow that concern to justify
the idea of playing it completely safe with one's savings, financial
advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's performance over time, after all, will largely
depend on a relative handful of fundamental forces--principally, the
strength of the economy (and thus of corporate earnings) and the
direction of inflation and interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   An investor who in November 1986 was convinced by the Ivan Boesky
scandal of that time that the market was totally rigged missed the
chance to buy stocks when the Dow Jones industrial average was at
1,914.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with the Dow at 9,987, it's obvious that the Boesky
fallout, if any, didn't last long. A decade from now, the same will
almost certainly be said of Wall Street's latest scandals.</TE>

<LD>The Enron</LD>
<LD>   Story Continues</LD>
<LD>   Enron Corp.'s post-bankruptcy plot thickens.</LD>
<TE>   The energy company is now under investigation by the Justice
Department, its auditor, Andersen, acknowledged that some of its
employees disposed of or deleted ''a significant but undetermined
number'' of documents relating to Enron, and the White House says
Enron sought government help to keep the company from collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   The latest revelation in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S.
history followed word from the White House that Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay, a major Bush campaign contributor, called Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's 2000
campaign manager, last fall to warn them of Enron's mounting
financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, lawyers for Enron said it had chosen Swiss bank UBS to
take control of its main energy trading business after a hotly
contested auction.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Making</TE>
<TE>   Big Change in Course</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. said it is cutting 35,000 jobs around the world,
closing five North American factories over the next several years and
taking a $4.1-billion fourth-quarter charge in a massive
restructuring the company called a "painful, but necessary" effort to
return the world's second-biggest automaker to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also said it was discontinuing the low-margin Ford Escort,
Lincoln Continental and Mercury Cougar coupe and Villager minivan as
part of a plan to realize $9 billion in profit improvement by the
middle of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   The plan comes after a wrenching year for Ford, which has been
dogged by red ink, shrinking market share, the Firestone tire recall
and the ouster of its CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Highflying Scheme</TE>
<TE>   Makes Crash Landing</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators accused a Mission Viejo teenager of concocting
an elaborate Internet-based scheme that defrauded investors of more
than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the second such securities fraud case ever filed against a
youth, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Cole A.
Bartiromo, 17, of operating a Web site and message board that
promised "risk-free" returns of up to 2,500% within a few days or
weeks of initial investments.</TE>
<TE>   In a settlement with the SEC, Bartiromo agreed to turn over about
$900,000 that had been transferred to an account at a Costa Rica
casino.</TE>
<TE>   The youth settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt.
Bartiromo declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Market Rally</TE>
<TE>   Stumbles</TE>
<TE>   Stocks suffered their first losing week in the last three as
investors worried that the U.S. economy may not rebound as strongly
as hoped.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell every day and finished the
week off 2.7%, closing below 10,000 for the first time since Dec. 20
and wiping out all of its gains for the new year. The benchmark
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 2.3% and is also now down 0.2% year
to date. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.8% for the week, but is
holding on to a 3.7% gain for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The worries about the economy crystalized Friday, when Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said there are still "significant
risks" that the economic recovery will falter. Bonds, meanwhile,
rallied on hopes Greenspan's remarks may signal another rate cut by
the Fed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Employment Picture</TE>
<TE>   Looks Brighter</TE>
<TE>   California's unemployment rate inched down to 6.0% last month and
job losses slowed to a trickle, signs that the state's hiring
picture, while still weak, may be stabilizing after several months of
heavy losses.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in the jobless rate, from a revised 6.1% in November,
partially reflected the fact that thousands of state residents have
stopped looking for work. California actually lost 600 jobs in
December, capping the worst year for the state's job market since
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Still, economists said December's modest declines were an
encouraging sign after several months of heavy job losses. In
November alone, the state lost 51,200 nonfarm payroll jobs and has
shed nearly 88,000 since September.</TE>
<TE>   New President</TE>
<TE>   for ABC</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. moved to reinvigorate its ABC network programming
by naming a new president of entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Lyne, the network's well-regarded executive for movies and
miniseries, was named head of entertainment programming. Lyne will
assume many of the programming responsibilities of Stu Bloomberg, a
22-year ABC veteran who is stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons ago, ABC was the No. 1 network, due in large part to
the hit game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." But the show ran
out of gas and the ratings for the network have plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Burbank-based Disney plans to cut about half the staff
at its recently acquired ABC Family channel, according to sources at
the company.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 employees at the cable channel's headquarters in
Westwood will be laid off in the next several weeks, according to an
executive at ABC Family who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Has a New</TE>
<TE>   Idea for iMac</TE>
<TE>   Apple Computer Inc. unveiled a stylish new version of its iMac
desktop computer, betting that flat-panel displays and a complete
redesign will shore up its sagging position in a market dominated by
PCs using Windows software from Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs plans to target new computer
users and iMac owners ready to upgrade to a faster, better-looking
system.</TE>
<TE>   Apple followers said Jobs should have little problem with those
audiences with its new model priced at $1,299 to $1,799.</TE>
<TE>   But the new design might not be enough to lure many Windows users,
analysts predict.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Taps</TE>
<TE>   Kodak President</TE>
<TE>   Troubled Lucent Technologies Inc. named telecommunications veteran
and current Eastman Kodak Co. President Patricia Russo as its chief
executive, ending a management search that dragged on for more than a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Russo, 49, spent nearly 20 years at AT&amp;T Corp. and its Lucent
spinoff before leaving in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In April, she became president and chief operating officer of
Kodak, where she has led a campaign to revive sales and refocus the
Rochester, N.Y.-based film maker.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's Faces</TE>
<TE>   Image Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Dave Thomas had been the public face of Wendy's International Inc.
for years. But after Thomas' death from liver cancer at age 69,
Wendy's said it no longer will use the founder in its advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The Dublin, Ohio-based company years ago had started reducing his
ad presence. Now, experts say, the No. 3 burger chain faces the
difficult challenge of transferring goodwill generated by the affable
burger baron into enhancing the company's overall brand image without
him.</TE>
<TE>   Few of the corporate world's public faces are as well known as
Thomas, who founded the Wendy's chain in 1969 and retired from active
management in the early 1980s. He agreed to return as product
pitchman in 1989 and subsequently filmed 800 commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Life Insurance</TE>
<TE>   Boom Slows</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11 jitters still are sending more Americans in search
of life insurance, but applications appear to be trailing off.</TE>
<TE>   Life insurance applications nationwide were up 10.7% in December
compared with the same period a year ago, according to MIB Group
Inc., a Westwood, Mass., research and database firm.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of applications continued to fall from its October
peak, with a 9.9% drop between October and November and another
further 4.6% drop from November to December, the MIB figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the decline in applications could be a brief,
holiday-driven interruption. Some analysts expect life insurance
sales to increase this year, while others said the flurry of interest
in life insurance may be a short-term phenomenon that may have only
temporarily reversed a long-term trend of fewer policies sold each
year.</TE>

<HD>Pay Cap May Weigh on Security Hiring</HD>
<DH>Airports: Government will be competing for top
professionals in the red-hot corporate market, where the salaries are
much higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The embryonic federal airport safety administration's high-stakes bid
to upgrade security hinges on persuading experienced professionals to
work for government wages when they could fetch as much as $550,000 a
year in the super-heated corporate market.</LD>
<LD>   Charged with ensuring all aspects of passenger, baggage and cargo
safety, the new airport security directors will form the backbone of
the Transportation Security Administration, an agency chartered in
the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to restore confidence in
air travel and get Americans flying again.</LD>
<LD>   The TSA will become the largest federal law enforcement agency,
with more than 30,000 employees--95% of them assigned to the nation's
429 airports.</LD>
<TE>   The first step, according to plans unveiled last week, is the
hiring of top-flight security chiefs for the nation's 81 largest
airports by mid-April--an ambitious goal in light of the caliber of
candidates sought and the limited ability of government to compete
with rising private-sector salaries, according to headhunters and
private-security experts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the hot market right now," said Joseph Daniel McCool, editor
of Executive Recruiter News, an industry publication.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations and private-security firms are vying for safety
directors the way dot-coms did for Web masters in the 1990s, pushing
salaries for experienced managers to $250,000 to $550,000.</TE>
<TE>   Korn/Ferry International Inc., the largest executive recruiting
firm, has experienced an elevenfold increase in inquiries for
security professionals since the terrorist attacks, prompting it to
open a homeland defense and security practice in its Washington
office.</TE>
<TE>   Headhunters are scrambling to gather resumes of people whose
military and law enforcement careers have taught them to keep their
names out of databases. Private-security firms, such as Kroll Inc.,
one of the nation's biggest, are hiring to keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   And they are luring high-profile public-sector figures, such as
John F. Timoney, who took over the helm of Beau Dietl &amp; Associates
last week after four years commanding the Philadelphia Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having a good time there, had a lot of public support and
mayoral support," Timoney said. "So there was no push. However, there
was a pull from the private sector."</TE>
<TE>   Intending to stay with the Philadelphia Police Department for at
least five more years, Timoney initially fended off offers after
Sept. 11. But then Dietl &amp; Associates founder Beau Dietl, a former
New York police detective, "made an offer I couldn't refuse."</TE>
<TE>   And companies are dignifying new or expanded safety jobs with
titles such as chief security officer that reflect their broader
scopes of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing both new positions and higher-level positions," said
Ray O'Hara, a vice president for Pinkerton Consulting &amp;
Investigations, a national security firm based in Chicago. "A
director of security was a common title. Now you might see a vice
president of security."</TE>
<TE>   The government will call its new hires federal security directors
and will pay them salaries of no more than $150,000, the federal
salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Is it enough?</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Christopher Kidd, a former officer in the Marine Corps
and a managing director for Korn/Ferry. "The secretary of
Transportation isn't paid a competitive salary either," Kidd said.
"Mr. [Norman] Mineta only makes about $150,000 a year. Do you think
he's worth more than that? Yeah. I'd say so."</TE>
<TE>   The new agency's architects are confident that it will be able to
hire highly qualified candidates by appealing to their sense of
duty--a factor that helped persuade Korn/Ferry to assist in the
search for the first 81 airport security directors for $3.3 million.
That is far less than the firm's typical fee, which is one-third of a
new hire's first year of compensation. Kidd said the competitiveness
of the corporate security market could be an advantage if candidates
from the military and law enforcement view a stint as an airport
safety chief as a steppingstone to more lucrative private-sector
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Within 24 hours of the airport security job posting last week, 275
people had registered on the agency's Web site expressing interest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that someone can do makes a difference every
day, that helps solve what is recognized as a very complex national
problem," said Jim Mitchell, a spokesman for the agency. "We think
we're going to get a lot of people who are going to want to do this,
and we're going to have some good choices."</TE>
<TE>   Others are not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Finding security professionals with the right set of experience
and skills won't be a problem, said Charlie LeBlanc, managing
director of Air Security International, a Houston-based travel
security firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem will be, do we have enough of them?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   LeBlanc said there are few professionals who have the broad range
of skills, including security experience, an understanding of Federal
Aviation Administration regulations and the diplomatic touch
necessary to deal with the public.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to have to be thick-skinned individuals," LeBlanc
said. "Putting all those together, I can name about 50 people in the
U.S. who have that background."</TE>
<TE>   As the highest-ranking safety officer at each airport, federal
security directors will have wide authority, including the power to
unilaterally halt flights and shut down a facility.</TE>
<TE>   Operating with broad discretion, each new federal security
director will be the operational leader of the safety force at his or
her airport, responsible for developing and implementing systems to
prevent threats and manage crises, such as the detection of a hole in
a perimeter fence.</TE>
<TE>   Paul C. Light, vice president of the Brookings Institution and a
longtime critic of government hiring practices, praised the decision
to bring in an outside search firm to assist the recruitment for such
critical positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government is not an employer of first choice, and
it's not a recruiter of first choice, particularly at the senior
level," Light said. "The way you get those jobs is to be next in line
when the person ahead of you retires. So this decision by the
Department of Transportation to retain Korn/Ferry shows somebody at
that agency is thinking outside the box. I think that's a good sign
for traveling Americans."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he believes the agency could run into problems after
it selects the chiefs for the biggest airports if it resorts to
routine government hiring procedures to fill the balance of the
30,000 positions.</TE>
<TE>   "The private sector has known for a long time that you just can't
put out a help-wanted sign and expect the right people to apply,"
Light said.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration spokesman Mitchell said the
agency is attempting to bring innovation and competitive,
private-sector practices to the start-up of what is the largest
federal agency formed since World War II. He pointed to the use of
Korn/Ferry's Internet-based recruiting and screening system as an
example of such innovation.</TE>
<TE>   A click of the mouse from the Department of Transportation's home
page links to the TSA Web site, a state-of-the-art recruiting tool
that feeds information into a candidate-screening database created
and operated by Korn/Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   The job's description and its requirements are followed by an
invitation to sign up for consideration. Another mouse click links to
an application that makes nominating oneself for a job almost as easy
as ordering a book online.</TE>
<TE>   A series of short-answer questions, such as Social Security number
and date of birth, is followed by multiple-choice questions with
boxes to indicate information, such as an applicant's security
experience and educational degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Applicants are asked to indicate whether they would be willing to
relocate, how much they earn and--a requirement of the job--whether
they are U.S. citizens. An e-mail confirms that the application has
been received. Resumes can be uploaded or built at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many organizations that go out looking for 81 senior
executives at one time," Mitchell said. "We didn't need to reinvent
the wheel. We wanted [to hire] a company that had the technology to
identify people, screen the people rapidly who meet qualifications
and to deliver very efficiently qualified people so that it will
simplify our job."</TE>
<TE>   Government work is not new for Korn/Ferry, which helped Mexican
President Vicente Fox find candidates for his Cabinet and has
assisted in smaller-scale searches for other U.S. government
agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Transportation
Department and the Postal Service. But the firm has never conducted a
search for a public or private client with the scope or profile of
the airport security assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is full stand-up," Kidd of Korn/Ferry said. "We're not
replacing people. We're helping to craft the content and the
character of the organization."</TE>

<LD>When the classroom newspaper Weekly Reader conducted a year-end poll
on its Web site, youngsters were asked to vote for the most important
event of 2001. The winner, with 59% of the vote: the release of the
first "Harry Potter" film. A distant second, with 25%: the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Amazing, isn't it?" said Editor in Chief Charles Piddock from the
paper's editorial offices in Stamford, Conn., a hint of amusement in
his voice. "It shows how we're getting through with the important
news, right?"</LD>
<LD>   Admittedly, Harry Potter is a phenomenon. Still, after 25 years
with the Weekly Reader, which in separate issues targets
pre-kindergartners through sixth-graders, Piddock knows youngsters
"are much more interested in their own world than they are in the
world outside." His mission is to create interest in the wider world
among the youngest readers and, with its newer offshoot, Teen
Newsweek (published with Newsweek magazine), to middle school
students.</LD>
<TE>   Now, 100 years after it debuted in an earlier guise, the Weekly
Reader has reached and shaped children who went on to help shape the
world. To help celebrate its centennial, several famous names have
responded to the Reader's request for testimonials on its impact on
them as children.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Carter said that he and wife Rosalyn "remember
with pleasure" getting the newspaper at their school in Plains, Ga.,
and how it "kept us focused on timely issues and helped to shape our
knowledge and attitude toward important aspects of life."</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. senator and astronaut John Glenn weighed in with "fond
memories of Weekly Read- er," noting that when he was a boy in
Concord, Ohio, it provided him with a "window to the world."</TE>
<TE>   TV's Jane Pauley said, in fourth grade, reading the Weekly Reader
was "the high point of the week."</TE>
<TE>   An unsolicited testimonial came Weekly Reader's way in 1994, when
Tom Hanks, accepting the best actor Oscar for his role in
"Philadelphia," said he had learned tolerance from reading the Weekly
Reader in grade school.</TE>
<TE>   Through the generations, youngsters have learned from the Weekly
Reader about such things as politics (including the Bill
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair), war and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A. County, the Weekly Reader is delivered by mail to 1,258
elementary school and 641 secondary school classrooms, public and
private. Nationwide, it reports a paid subscription base of 7
million, which includes schools, individuals and others.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers include Turning Point, a private school in Culver City
where animated seventh-grader Chase Koopersmith, 12, was chosen to be
a Weekly Reader kid correspondent. She made a behind-the-scenes visit
last month to TV's "Entertainment Tonight" and filed a report posted
with photos on the Weekly Reader Galaxy Web site and in Teen
Newsweek.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always fun," Chase said, "but it helps us learn what's
happening in the world." She did, however, rate the fun factor quite
high on her visit to Paramount Studios in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Among her observations: "ET" host Bob Goen is "very funny and
always making jokes"--and he wears a lot of makeup. She learned that
his most embarrassing moment was being mistaken by a fan for Donny
Osmond. And he offered this advice for kids who think they want to go
into TV: "Don't do it because you want to be a star."</TE>
<TE>   These field trips, sponsored by Weekly Reader as extracurricular
learning experiences, have included coverage of the Nickelodeon Kids'
Choice Awards in L.A., a plum for 10-year-old correspondent Maria
Diaz of Los Angeles. The Weekly Reader will send a New Orleans-based
kid correspondent to cover this year's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Chase, chosen by the head of her middle school, is a one-time
Ivory soap baby who has done commercials for M&amp;Ms, Pizza Hut and
others until, she said, "I had an ugly stage with my teeth," which
are now in braces. She likes shopping, Ashley Judd, Brad Pitt and
softball and wants to be a fashion designer. She gets good grades
too.</TE>
<TE>   The Weekly Reader's roots date from 1902, when Charles Palmer
Davis, a newspaperman, inherited a family farm in Agawam, Mass., and
became active in the community, serving on the school board.</TE>
<TE>   Piddock tells the story this way: Visiting a classroom to see how
kids were being taught, Davis found "they'd put on a show for him,
recitations of Greek myths, things like that. He asked them, 'Who is
the president of the United States?' [then William McKinley], and of
this class of 30 or so, only two kids raised their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought, why not start a newspaper that brings the world into
the classroom in a way teachers can use? He called it Current Events.
It took off like wildfire."</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, My Weekly Reader (the "My" was gradually phased
out) has become the best known and most widely circulated of a group
of 17 publications, including Current Events, now owned by New
York-based WRC Media Inc. The others, in addition to Teen Newsweek,
include Read and Current Science.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission," Piddock said, "has always been to bring what's
happening now into the classroom in a form that kids can understand
and teachers can use to reinforce their curriculum. It's not always
fun reading, although we try to make it as much fun as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Because it is delivered by mail, he said, it takes the approach,
"This happened. And these are the reasons why," rather than trying to
be hot-off-the-press news. The attacks of Sept. 11 were reported by
Piddock's staff of 20 writers and editors, who analyzed events for
readers in fourth grade and above. It was considered too disturbing
for younger kids.</TE>
<TE>   "We told the kids what happened, a little bit about the history of
terrorism, a little bit about Afghanistan and tried to explain why
somebody would do something like this," Piddock said.</TE>
<TE>   When writing for kids, he said, "You can't assume any inherent
interest, and you can't assume any background. They don't even know
where Afghanistan is. It's a very tough assignment."</TE>
<TE>   One news story of 2001 that the Weekly Reader chose not to explore
was the Rep. Gary Condit controversy over the disappearance of intern
Chandra Levy because its historical impact was limited. But, Piddock
said, they did choose to cover the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. "Because
of the impeachment, we could not ignore that. We said he had an
improper relationship with an aide. It was a very tense time here,"
deciding just how to phrase it.</TE>
<TE>   The paper's Web site augments the printed version. On it,
youngsters can express opinions, play news quiz games and get daily
current events updates. It is also a forum for teachers and parents
to find material to bolster lessons.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 12, it posted a "Dear Children" letter in which first
lady Laura Bush wrote, "Be kind to each other, take care of each
other, and show your love for each other." Lauren Schneider, a
licensed social worker at Our House, a grief support center in Los
Angeles, contributed advice on helping children cope with the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And the children themselves posted messages that spoke to their
fear, their sorrow, their anger, their coming to grips with death.
One child's to-the-point advice: "Spy and see who the bad guys are,
then shoot them!" Another, more philosophical child wrote, "You can
break our buildings, destroy some lives, but you can't destroy our
faith, freedom and our hearts."</TE>

<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that 300 million Europeans in 12 countries are stuffing euros
into their wallets instead of marks, lire and francs, the currency
conversion has become an inspiration for fashion.</LD>
<LD>   The largest monetary changeover in history has inspired all manner
of tributes. Images of discontinued bills are featured on wrapping
paper while the new streamlined euro symbol has even been shaved into
a haircut.</LD>
<LD>   But the most luxurious souvenir comes from the French fashion
house Celine, which has created an accessories collection that gives
a new twist to the "coin purse" and "money belt." A design team
created La Collection Eurodyssey, a limited edition of bags, change
purses and a belt decorated with coins that will be discontinued.</LD>
<TE>   "The most commemorative items of the currencies are the coins,
which are going to become obsolete," said Dana Lambros, Celine's
spokeswoman. Credit for the idea goes to Celine's president,
Jean-Marc Loubier, who wanted to mark the historic change.</TE>
<TE>   "The French franc dates back to the mid-1300s," Lambros said.
"Fashion almost always refers to things of the past, and this
collection pays homage to centuries of European history.'' The
collection is an update of a fashion idea that has been around for
decades. Fine jewelers make necklaces and earrings out of ancient
coins, and chain belts strung with real or faux coins are classic
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Celine faced some legal limits on the creative use of the coins
because the monarchs and heads of states on the currencies cannot be
shown on items for sale; therefore, the items feature only the tail
side of the coins. The designers used special frames to attach the
coins and had to be careful not to damage the coins and therefore
devalue them.</TE>
<TE>   The chocolate brown leather belt and shoulder bag are studded with
silver frames that hold coins from Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,
Germany, Ireland and more. The change purses feature one coin on the
brown leather zip-top bags. You won't see British pence, or other
coins from Sweden or Denmark, Europe's only holdouts from the
conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping for Europe's luxury goods will be easier for Americans
because the euro has fairly closely tracked the American dollar,
trading for anywhere from about 89 cents to $1.17. But the
easier-to-understand euro doesn't help sticker shock: The Celine belt
sells for about $400, the purse $800, and the pouches $180.</TE>

<LD>"The Three Little Javelinas"</LD>
<LD>   by Susan Lowell</LD>
<LD>   This book was about the three little javelinas that ran away from
the coyote. The coyote was hiding in the saguaro. The coyote saw them
running and kept chasing them. The javelinas wanted to build their
houses, but the coyote didn't let them. Then he blew their houses
down. The second javelina said, "Not by the hair of my chinny
chin-chin!"</LD>
<TE>   I liked this book because it was funny.</TE>

<TE>   "Amber Brown Is Not a Crayon"</TE>
<TE>   by Paula Danziger</TE>
<TE>   I like Amber Brown because she always is being herself. She
doesn't do anything that she doesn't want to do.</TE>
<TE>   Amber Brown's problem is that her best friend is moving, and they
can't decide which one gets their gumball collection. My favorite
part is when Justin's mom invites Amber over for pizza.</TE>
<TE>   I can't tell you the ending because it is so good.</TE>

<LD>Crosby Doe started his career in real estate by knocking on doors. He
cruised the tamed hillsides of Hollywood, where residential
surprises, good and bad, lay around every switchback. One day he'd
discover a little witchypoo cottage nestled between a neo-Palladian
villa and a crumbling stucco hacienda. Another excursion would take
him past mansions festooned like wedding cakes, only to arrive at a
perfectly disciplined Craftsman bungalow. One spring afternoon in
1974, he parked his red Rover sedan in Nichols Canyon, across from a
sleek, flat-roofed box of a house with glass walls. He recognized it
as the work of Richard Neutra, the Viennese architect whose style of
California Modernism has become a brand around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Doe knocked on the spruce wood door, more excited by the prospect
of seeing the home's interior than worried about meeting rejection. A
dapper, soft-spoken man of average height with a sandy pompadour and
a groomed mustache, Doe wouldn't be the type to startle an
unsuspecting homeowner. After spending a few hours with the owner,
choreographer Eugene Loring, who'd lived in the house since it was
completed in 1958, he persuaded Loring to let him sell the house. It
was Doe's first listing, and it sold for $100,000.</LD>
<TE>   That was before real estate prices joined plastic surgery and box
office grosses as a fail-safe small talk topic. Before a star
architect's name on a house could carry as much currency as a
Hollywood pedigree. Before the 1990s, when international tastemakers
like Gucci designer Tom Ford would scour Los Angeles for the right
Neutra, ultimately paying $2 million for a place in Bel-Air he would
spend more than a year restoring. It was just before Doe invented a
marketing niche, concentrating on historic and architecturally
significant properties. It has become his life's great cause, a focus
that is as much crusade as business, and which has helped preserve
the landscape of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I was considered a kook at the beginning, because a lot of
architectural styles that have become popular weren't appreciated
then," Doe says. Yet in the years since he began tracking down houses
listed in a Los Angeles County Museum of Art guide from the '60s, a
number of competitors who once just thought he'd come up with a
useful gimmick have also taken to calling themselves mavens.</TE>
<TE>   Most active among them is Barry Sloane, an Australian-born
television director and producer who bought two homes from Doe, then
decided to make a career change. The pair are now gentlemanly rivals
who've benefited from the steadily growing interest in mid-century
Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   No other American city markets its fine architecture with such
vigor and scholarship. George Ballantyne, executive vice president of
Sotheby's International Realty in New England, has a graduate degree
in architectural history and sells many historic properties, but
that's inevitable in his area, he says, where the bulk of luxury
homes was built before 1900. Leave it to L.A. to elevate all that is
stylish and quirky, to put architects' names above the title, so to
speak. "Six rooms, ocean view" becomes "Gregory Ain beauty in the
hills."</TE>
<TE>   "People who really care about architecture go to Crosby, because
he's the most knowledgeable," says Julius Shulman, the 91-year-old
photographer whose architectural photographs have become iconic.
"Barry is serious, too. But the other firms who are calling
themselves architectural specialists just followed Crosby's lead. He
was a genuine pioneer, and because of him a lot of the high-quality
Modernist architecture has come back."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Radziner, a partner in the Santa Monica-based architectural
firm Marmol &amp; Radziner, which specializes in restoring modern homes,
says, "They have helped build the appreciation for the wonderful
private architecture in this city. It isn't always about money for
them. They care." Doe, 55, and Sloane, 53, serve as high priests to a
congregation of true believers, devout preservationists who recognize
that Los Angeles has the greatest concentration of distinguished
domestic architecture in the country. The cognoscenti have heard all
the snide cliches: that there is no respect for history here; that
whatever culture exists is disposable; that there is a lot of taste
in Los Angeles, all of it bad. Sitting in a serene Bauhaus showplace
or behind the Andalusian gates of a sublime Moorish estate, they know
better.</TE>
<TE>   They understand that Doe and Sloane are businessmen. But they're
also grateful that these specialty real estate agents and the proud
buyers who shun nouveau starter castles on the Westside to seek out
hidden treasures in Silver Lake, Pasadena and Los Feliz have become
custodians of L.A.'s unique heritage.</TE>
<TE>   David Zander, the managing partner of MJZ, a music video and
commercial production company, was a New York transplant who found
real estate in Los Angeles so underwhelming when he moved west in
1991 that he lived at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills for three
years. Doe and Zander had been house-hunting for six months when, in
1996, Doe invited him to look at La Miniatura, a 1923 Frank Lloyd
Wright textile block house in Pasadena that Sloane was selling.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't an ounce of bull in Crosby," Zander says. "He said,
'David, this is one of the great houses in L.A., but it needs work.'
Good old Crosby changed my life. He opened my eyes to the
architecture in L.A. and in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Zander is undertaking a four-year, $4-million restoration of La
Miniatura with Marmol &amp; Radziner. "Crosby had an instinct that I
would be a good baby-sitter for this house. He knows how maniacal I
am. Every bolt, every screw will be replaced. When this restoration
is done, it will last another 200 or 300 years, and that's a good
thing."</TE>
<TE>   When Doe found his calling, Los Angeles was at the beginning of an
unprecedented real estate boom, a period when homeowners throughout
the city would see prices increase 20% a year. (A late '80s joke went
that you could guess someone's net worth in L.A. if you knew the year
they'd bought their house.) Like many bright ideas, Doe's notion that
good design could be a valuable sales tool was forehead-smackingly
simple. It was also the right concept for this city, where
single-family homes have always been more plentiful than apartment
buildings, where a mild climate made the dream of indoor-outdoor
living possible and a frontier spirit fostered stylistic
adventurousness.</TE>
<TE>   "There was always an openness in Los Angeles that encouraged
breaking away from traditional, cluttered spaces," says architectural
historian Alastair Gordon. "In California in the 20th century,
Modernist architects were defining a new American vernacular. It was
a culture in which you could pretty much exercise your fantasies in a
way you couldn't in many other parts of the country, and that was
reflected in people's homes."</TE>
<TE>   The classic Spanish house Doe and his wife, Linda, have lived in
since 1981 could inspire any number of daydreams. Built in 1927 by an
oilman who claimed to have been an Indian scout, it sits atop a knoll
above Lake Hollywood, in command of vistas to the ocean, downtown and
the San Gabriel mountains. The only blight on the view is Madonna's
former house, less than a hundred yards to the southeast. Doe sold
that house, a grand 1924 John de Lario Spanish known as Castillo del
Lago, to three successive buyers who worked to gradually restore it.
Then Madonna and her decorator brother got their hands on it and,
according to Doe, "molested" it.</TE>
<TE>   A perfectionist who would prefer not to have air conditioning in
his house rather than defile its architecture, Doe harbors unbridled
contempt for interior designers and homeowners who don't respect the
integrity of a house.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Pasadena, which was full of fine houses," he says.
"When I decided to specialize in historic and architecturally
important houses, something clicked. Renovation should be banned from
the vocabulary. Half my career has been trying to get people to put
houses back the way they were meant to be. When clients have done
their own thing, to the detriment of a house, I feel I've failed."</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Doe tried to sell his idea to a big,
established firm. None got it, so in 1980 he and fellow architecture
buff Michael Deasy, who had a master's degree in city planning from
Yale, and David Mossler, who'd worked as a talent agent, founded
Mossler, Deasy &amp; Doe. The Beverly Hills-based company now has 15
associates, three of them architects, and they handle a range of
homes. Their calling card is that they maintain a database of 3,500
homes they consider architecturally significant. A few agents who
once worked with Doe left to extend their mentor's franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes what I do tougher, because we're all dealing with a
limited supply," he says. "But the competition is good, and we all
work together. If there are people out there who think these houses
are important enough to be treated as a separate market, it's better
for the houses."</TE>
<TE>   Doe and Sloane have heard the same wish list from prospective
buyers so often they could recite it in their sleep. "What I really
want is a mid-century box with walls of glass by a good architect
with a city view and a pool," say clients who have dreams of living
in a black-and-white Shulman photograph. Only three of the Frank
Lloyd Wright homes in this region are privately owned, so they tend
to be priced about twice as high as other houses of comparable size.
The premium on Neutras is 25% to 50%, Doe says. Then there's the
celebrity premium. Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston bought a
Norman-style Wallace Neff house, so Neff is now in demand.</TE>
<TE>   Both Doe and Sloane have worked with celebrity clients, many of
whom require confidentiality agreements. Doe attracts clients who
share his reverence for good design and authenticity, people in
advertising and the visual arts, studio brats and writers. Sloane
says he has the battle scars to show that handling entertainment
industry folk should be a specialty in itself. He's sold a house to
Eric Clapton and has worked with Ellen DeGeneres, Courtney Love and
two Red Hot Chili Peppers. Many homes by celebrated architects don't
fit the description of luxury dwellings--no maid's rooms or home
gyms.</TE>
<TE>   "A 1,200-square-foot, one-bedroom house in not the greatest
condition, in not the most desirable part of the city, starts at
$500,000 now if it's a Neutra or Rudolf Schindler," Doe says. "In
order to find houses mere mortals can afford, I'm having to go
further afield, to Claremont or La Crescenta. The demand is so great
that the supply has dried up and the prices are accelerating." What's
the upper range? Courteney Cox Arquette recently paid $10 million for
a Lautner on the beach in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, two Schindler houses were torn down in the past year, Doe
complains, as if he were reporting a rape in the neighborhood. "There
have been museum shows and 20 books on Schindler, and that's still
happening!"</TE>
<TE>   With mock self-deprecation, Sloane claims the role of Eve
Harrington in L.A.'s real estate drama, the ingenue in the classic
movie "All About Eve" who insinuates herself into the life of an
established but aging star. Yet Sloane didn't resort to dirty tricks
to gain his share of the market. He worked hard, beginning at
Doulton, Brown &amp; Long in 1988. In 1996, he inaugurated a historical
and architectural properties division at Fred Sands. Two years ago,
he moved to the Beverly Hills office of Sotheby's International
Realty, taking along his carefully assembled mailing list of clients,
art collectors and dealers, real estate groupies and freelance
gossips to whom he regularly sends color postcards, each handsomely
depicting a house described in breathless copy that he writes
himself.</TE>
<TE>   The latest of 15 L.A. houses he's lived in is a dramatic Spanish
Gothic farmhouse built in 1924 on a densely settled Los Feliz street.
It comes by its movie-star style honestly: Sloane bought it from
Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman three years ago. His edgy Contemporary
art collection is displayed throughout the house, even in the
basement billiard room, along with antique religious artifacts and
Louis XV and XVI furniture. With his pencil-thin mustache, vaguely
Anglo accent and wry sense of humor, the lanky Sloane appears David
Nivenesque, the world-weary but all-knowing sophisticate who loves to
dish.</TE>
<TE>   What do Sloane and Doe have in common? A love of houses that makes
them as much matchmakers as salesmen. Songwriter and music producer
Glenn Ballard and his wife, Liv, looked for 10 years before Sloane
showed them a Spanish house built by architect Roy Price in 1926.</TE>
<TE>   "After 30 seconds, I knew this was the place," Ballard says. "It
needed a tremendous amount of structural work, a lot of it
underground. Barry would have been loath to sell it to someone who
would tear it down and put up a vanilla and cream mausoleum. This
house has amazing vistas and secrets you don't find in modern houses.
We're so proud that we saved it."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Guild's interest in modern architecture is so strong that
she opened Patio, a store on La Brea, to sell outdoor furniture that
would complement Modernist houses. Doe found her a neglected 1948
J.R. Davidson house in Silver Lake, which she restored. "Crosby said
to me once, 'I pray that my clients with taste get money and my
clients with money get taste.' He cares so deeply that the right
person gets the right house."</TE>
<TE>   Both men are highly evolved snobs who realize they deal with a
tiny fraction of the house-buying market. The casual observer might
see beautiful old homes lining the streets of Hancock Park. Doe
focuses on the damage wrought by the passion for upholstered walls
and used brick in the '70s. "Maybe one house out of 10 in Los Angeles
has great heart and soul, no matter what its style or price
category," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Sloane sniffs at a Paul Williams house for sale in Encino. "I
wouldn't get the call for that. Neither would Crosby." He handles few
houses under $450,000, he says, "because there isn't anything. You
have to remember that half the real estate that's sold in greater
L.A. is dreadful anyway. The great unwashed out there are very happy
in their tedious houses that I would slash my wrists if I had to live
in."</TE>
<TE>   Like many in real estate, Sloane is a tireless networker, an
expert in the art of the schmooze. "So tell me," he says to an agent
who's called to find out if he knows of anything suitable for some
picky European clients. "Are they POAs?"</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners of architecture: homeowners who feel that the bragging
rights to a house designed by a marquee name are worth the hassles.
Most Schindler houses, for example, are didactic structures that
demand you live in them the way the architect intended. They weren't
meant to be cluttered, and built-in storage and furniture dictate how
the space is used.</TE>
<TE>   John Solomon, an executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, discovered
the same challenge in the 1961 Neutra house in Glendale Doe found for
him, but he's welcomed it. "The house has a certain flow and a
dynamic that you can't really work against," he says. His mother is a
well-known New York art dealer, but most of his extensive art
collection is now in storage.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to edit down my life to its barest essentials when I moved
here. The house helped me decide what I really wanted to live with."
Sitting in his living room, Solomon seems to bask under the branches
of a 300-year-old California live oak tree that dominates the patio.
"This space helps me relax and feel calm. I can tune chaos out."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon acquired the house in mint condition. He expects to
replace the pipes and the roof in the next five years but considers
himself lucky. The dirty secret about many of L.A.'s historic homes
is they can be maintenance monsters. Some can be downright hard to
love, like a Lautner house in the Hollywood Hills whose bedroom can't
be reached from the living room or kitchen without going outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get into any piece of architecture, there are always
some compromises," Doe says. "If you're buying an older home, take it
as you find it and love it. That's my gospel."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Radziner says, "These modern homes were pushing the
bounds of the technology at the time they were built. A lot of these
houses are notorious for leaking, and it's something we can address
now in a more sophisticated way than was possible when they were
built."</TE>
<TE>   It can all be worth it--the scary prices and safaris into
neighborhoods unknown, the absence of bidets and Jacuzzis and the
failings of the experimental materials of yesteryear. The
enthusiastic buyers who have been guided by Sloane and Doe feel
they've uncovered the city's mystery. They are entranced by the
romance of L.A.'s house pride, an infatuation fed by the peculiar
power of a building to convey that the people who live within it are
anything but ordinary.</TE>

<HD>Calling In Sick Is a Job That Should Never Be Left to the
Amateurs</HD>
<DH>Lesson No. 1: There's a difference between being sick-sick
and being work-sick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SHEA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm on hold.</LD>
<LD>   I'm waiting to talk to the boss.</LD>
<LD>   The level of tension is, as might be expected, excruciating.</LD>
<TE>   I'm calling in sick.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that I'm not sick. I am. It's just that whenever I call
in sick, I always feel like I'm telling somebody the check's in the
mail.</TE>
<TE>   I mean, I could be two beeps short of flat-lining, but the minute
the boss gets on the phone, I sound like a guy with a new fishing
pole and another dead grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   I think this is because there is a difference between sick-sick
and work-sick.</TE>
<TE>   Sick-sick is kind of like when you have tickets to, say, a New
York Giants game but are too ill to go even in a chartered ambulance.
This level of sickness is also known as near-death experience.</TE>
<TE>   Work-sick is not as debilitating as sick-sick. Work-sick would
almost never keep you from sitting in the stands at a Giants game in
January with a large blue G painted on your bare chest. Work-sick is
more like you just don't feel up to dealing with work.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of things to consider before calling in work-sick,
chief among them being the thickness of the ice upon which your
career is supported.</TE>
<TE>   Another major factor is whether your boss is male or female,
because men and women tend to define sickness differently.</TE>
<TE>   In general, man-sick is when the upset stomach, congestion or
headache is such that it mandates couch (rather than recliner) rest
and limits television viewing to no more than two sporting events at
a time.</TE>
<TE>   Woman-sick usually involves delirium, loss of consciousness, an
inability to provide more than two side dishes with supper and the
repeated mumbling of either of the following phrases:</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't do this, who will?"</TE>
<TE>   Or:</TE>
<TE>   "Who's going to do this--you?"</TE>
<TE>   (Note: It is not uncommon for this latter raving to be accompanied
by high-pitched, derisive laughter.)</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the illness one is claiming is also gender
sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   When you call in sick to a male boss, the key thing to understand
is this:</TE>
<TE>   Men view illness as a competition. They only want to know what
your symptoms are, so they can try to top them.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, all you have to do is let the big guy win.</TE>
<TE>   Calling in sick to a female boss is much trickier, and it is
imperative that you do your homework. This is because women always
know what's going around. So you don't want to be claiming a sinus
infection when everyone has a stomach virus.</TE>
<TE>   Personally .... (phone click)</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, good morning boss (cough-sniffle-wheeze) .... It's a flu kind
of thing with a ....Wrong bug, huh?</TE>
<TE>   "No problem, I'll get my little red wagon right in there."</TE>

<LD>On StageWith Domingo</LD>
<LD>   The stage of Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was transformed into a
Spanish cabaret for L.A. Opera's "On Stage Gala: A Night of Zarzuela
and Operetta With Placido Domingo and Friends." The black-tie event,
which raised more than $350,000, took its theme from the musical
roots that launched Domingo's career. Zarzuela--a theatrical form,
which is to Spain what Gilbert &amp; Sullivan is to England, operetta to
Vienna, and the Broadway musical to America--was the Domingo family
business.</LD>
<LD>   Eva Stern chaired last Sunday's lavish fiesta, which cost $1,500
to $2,500 per person, for a chance to get up close and personal with
L.A. Opera's poster boy and his amigos: sopranos Julia Migenes and
Virginia Tola and tenor Charles Castronovo. Alberto Vilar acted as
honorary chairman of the doings, which began with a cocktail
reception in the lobby, until pavilion chimes signaled a move to the
stage, where tables with centerpieces of red chili peppers,
pomegranates and roses surrounded a dance floor set beneath the giant
chandelier used in the season's opener, "The Queen of Spades."</LD>
<TE>   Domingo chose an Austro-Hispanic musical menu of works by Strauss,
Lehar and Offenbach along with a medley of zarzuela songs, concluding
with the love duet from "El Gato Montes," in which he starred during
the 1994 season. All were accompanied by the L.A. Opera dancers,
chorus and orchestra, with John DeMain and Miguel Roa conducting. The
maestro also had a hand in choosing the fare created by Chef Joachim
Splichal: Spanish tapas followed by wiener schnitzel and a trio of
desserts: sacher torte, palacinta and arroz con leche; complemented
by bubbly from Gloria Ferrer and wines from Lindemans.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks before dinner, Domingo paid tribute to the late
Peter Hemmings, L.A. Opera's general director from 1986 to 2000, who
died from cancer Jan. 4 at his home in Dorset, England.</TE>
<TE>   "It is to Peter's credit that L.A. Opera exists today," Domingo
said. "He proved that L.A., which never before had its own company,
could become one of the world's premier opera sites.''</TE>
<TE>   In the crowd of more than 400 were the Domingo clan, Stern's
husband Marc, who serves as president of L.A. Opera, Alyce and Spud
Williamson (they underwrote the dance performance), Joan and John
Hotchkis, Margie and David Barry, Kara Fox and Leonard Green,
Elizabeth Hirsch, Jude Green and Bob Feinberg, Lois and Buzz Aldrin,
Annette and Peter O'Malley, Debbie and Mark Attansio, Deborah and

<TE>   Goldsborough, Adieu</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 150 Music Center stalwarts packed the Founders Room of
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to say hail and farewell to Nicholas
Goldsborough, the Music Center's vice president since 1995. He's off
to face the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in Washington,
D.C., where he'll take over as managing director of the Shakespeare
Theatre later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Music Center staffers serenaded their longtime colleague at the
Monday gathering with Broadway tunes reworked just for him, including
Cole Porter's "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" from "Kiss Me, Kate."
Andrea Van de Kamp, chairman of the Music Center Board, praised
Goldsborough for his leadership, particularly his efforts to build
Disney Concert Hall and revitalize dance presentations at the center.
"I arrived here shortly after Nick," she said, "And, boy, was I glad
he was here!"</TE>

<HD>Cocktails and Closed-Circuit Flirting</HD>
<DH>Phones and voyeuristic cameras are just part of the dating
and schmoozing rituals at a Manhattan bar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Perhaps if they were young, hip and single today, Manhattan's Remote
Lounge is where Stanley Kubrick and Michel Foucault would go scouting
for dates.</LD>
<LD>   The latest addition to the recently and frequently titled
"post-apocalyptic" dating culture has arrived on the Bowery--a beacon
for exhibitionists, voyeurs, post-modernists and sci-fi geeks alike.</LD>
<LD>   Occupying what was once an electrical supply store, Remote Lounge
is its own electrical wonder. Tables at the bar each have two video
cameras trained on them, and tableside monitors enable patrons to
watch what's happening on any of nearly 70 closed-circuit channels.
By tuning the monitor to a channel, viewers gain access to the camera
feeding that channel, shifting its gaze with one of the joysticks
mounted conveniently at cocktail level. The bar's cameras survey
every angle of space--including the sink behind the bar and the
street outside. Telephone handsets at each table enable patrons to
call other tables throughout the bar.</LD>
<TE>   "The general public has been promised this type of future for the
last 50 years, and no one before has been able to deliver on it in an
accessible, public way," says partner Leo Fernekes, a self-described
voyeur and exhibitionist. The bar certainly does match up with what
the future looked like to people in bygone eras. The bar is a cavern
of chrome, and its only decorations are rows of endlessly flickering
video monitors and a throng of camera-aware, cocktail-clutching
patrons. It would- n't be entirely shocking to see Roddy Doyle in a
gorilla suit caught on camera at one of the orange and gray vinyl
banquettes.</TE>
<TE>   That's in part because the entire experience of Remote Lounge is
so surreal. More than simply a technological breakthrough in trolling
for dates, it's a bizarre amalgamation of intimacy and detachment.
The cameras allow anonymous, controlled access to crevices and curves
of the human anatomy most people would be slapped for ogling, but at
Remote Lounge, patrons can publicly scope in privacy. A visitor can
have telephone conversations with someone behind a partition less
than a foot away, never being quite sure where that person might be
in the bar. And patrons can intimately witness mating rituals that
are rare to find outside the terrain of late-night HBO or a Desmond
Morris documentary.</TE>
<TE>   This aspect is a sexual anthropologist's dream and seemingly the
greatest pleasure of the lounge's crowd. On a recent night, one
patron, Rashid, noticed a particularly intense flirtation developing
on camera near the bar. "Go to channel four! Everybody, channel
four!" he yelled, jumping up and spreading the word to each table.
Immediately, most of the bar's 100 monitors showed the pair's first
kiss in black-and-white close-up to the spontaneous cheers and
comments of the rapt crowd. "It's totally creepy," says Kate, who
came to the bar out of curiosity one night after calling off a
romance. She's a 29-year-old writer whose cat-eye glasses and
plunging neckline are popular on the monitors this night. Each
glimpse of her image on screen produces a visible shudder. "This
brings out all of my shyness. It's like I'm in my nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Remote Lounge partner Ron Stratton, a former East Village
bartender, scoffs at the notion that this is different from what
people do in lower-tech bars every night. "There's nothing all that
different here behaviorally," he says. "Our concept of voyeurism is
very much along the lines of a normal bar. People are constantly
checking each other out anyway."</TE>
<TE>   He admits, though, that the scoping is intensified by the Lounge's
surveillance paraphernalia. And many people at the bar this night
clearly enjoy the effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it--but then I'm an actress, so I love the camera
anywhere," says 23-year-old Molly. "Give 'em a show, baby!" she yells
at the monitor, which is currently locked on the image of a
midriff-baring friend.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Molly's friend--also an actress--seems to be
eating up the attention. As do many of the female faces (and other
body parts) that flash from monitor to monitor.</TE>
<TE>   While the men here are obviously enjoying the view, many women who
would ordinarily scorn such overt ogling without the high-tech
conduits undo one more button and apply lip-gloss for the camera, on
camera.</TE>
<TE>   "In this environment women are much more empowered to make
spectacles of themselves and flirt in a more outrageous manner," says
co-owner Fernekes--more a student of New York club culture than of
women's studies. "It's a radically different concept," he says, which
he predicts will be the "beginning of a whole new social movement."</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight, a long-haired man dressed in requisite all-black,
sidles up to writer Kate for a rare moment of face-to-face human
interaction. His parting words are the ultimate post-modern pickup
line, suggesting, as Fernekes says, "the future has arrived."</TE>
<TE>   "Find me on screen later," he says with a smirk.</TE>

<LD>"I've got the telescope!" I said.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got the sandwiches," Larry said.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got the blanket!" Dad said. "We're ready for our moon
picnic!"</LD>
<TE>   We spread the blanket on the grass in the backyard and readied the
telescope.</TE>
<TE>   "Make sure it's pointed at the moon," Dad said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know!" I answered.</TE>
<TE>   Usually we take the telescope out at night for a star picnic. We
look up at the stars, the moon, the constellations and all of the
planets, but tonight is extra special. Tonight there is a total
eclipse of the moon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beginning," Larry pointed.</TE>
<TE>   We all turned our eyes skyward and there, with our naked eye, we
could see at the corner of the big full moon a little red shadow.</TE>
<TE>   "An eclipse happens when the full moon passes through the Earth's
shadow," Larry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know it happens only once in a while?" I said. "It's
rare."</TE>
<TE>   "I like outer space," Larry said as he took his turn at the
telescope to get a closer look at the moon.</TE>
<TE>   The Earth's shadow crept across the face of the moon, dimming the
silver glow to a muddy red.</TE>
<TE>   We lay back on the blanket looking up at the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   When the shadow completely covered our nightly neighbor, we
clapped.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure do like our moon picnics, Dad," I said, munching on my
midnight snack.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Larry said, "lets have another one soon."</TE>
<TE>   Author's Note: The next total eclipse of the moon can be seen in
Los Angeles on the night of May 15, 2003. Until then there are still
beautiful things to watch in the night sky. You can have your very
own moon picnic any night of the year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I live in an apartment that is not under rent control. Can
a landlord raise annual rental rates of month-to-month tenancies at
different percentages for different tenants in the same building? Am
I entitled to know how much the others are getting increased?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Landlords can raise rents at different levels
(percentages) for different tenants in the same building at their
discretion.</LD>
<LD>   Unless they are under rent control, landlords are not limited to
"annual" rent increases. Although it is customary to increase rents
only annually, the law does not require it. The law does require
written 30-day notices of rent increases under 10%. Sixty-day notices
are required for rent increases of 10% or more.</LD>
<TE>   You are not entitled to know your neighbors' rent levels or
increase percentages.</TE>
<TE>   Interest Rate on Security Deposits Has Changed</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in Los Angeles in a rent-controlled apartment and was
confused by your Nov. 4 column. It said, "Rent Control Requires 2%
Interest on Deposit." I always understood that interest on deposits
was to be paid at the rate of 5%, not 2%. Which is right?</TE>
<TE>   A: Both are correct; however interest on deposits for
rent-controlled apartments in Los Angeles is, as of Jan. 1, 2002,
1.5%. It was lowered again by the Los Angeles City Council to more
accurately reflect the amount of interest apartment owners receive on
deposit money. As of Jan. 1, 2001, interest on deposits was lowered
from 5% to 2% for calendar year 2001. Before 2001, the rate was at
5%.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Wants Tenant to Give Up Garage Space</TE>
<TE>   Q: I recently closed escrow on a five-unit property (one house and
two duplexes) in Los Angeles that is under rent control. I live in
the house.</TE>
<TE>   One of the tenants has been using the garage to store personal
belongings. The rental agreement with the previous owner made no
mention of the garage.</TE>
<TE>   I told the tenant that the garage is not covered by the rental
agreement, and I want him to move his belongings out of it. He has
refused to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Am I legally able to file an unlawful detainer (eviction) action
against this tenant? Can I just call the police and have his stuff
tossed? Is there anything special that I must do to get the tenant to
vacate the garage under the prior ownership?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have no grounds on which to file an eviction action as you
have no just cause for an eviction, as required by the Los Angeles
rent control law. You also cannot call the police about this civil
dispute (at least it wouldn't do you any good). Most importantly, you
cannot just toss the tenant's belongings out unless you want a Small
Claims Court judge to order you to pay for it, which is very likely
to occur if the tenant sues you.</TE>
<TE>   You can get the tenant to vacate the garage, but there are some
things you must do to accomplish this. Even though the garage is not
referenced in the tenant's rental agreement with the prior owner, if
he had the use of it during his tenancy with the owner, he is in
legal possession of it. It doesn't matter that the garage is not
referenced in the rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   To regain possession of the garage, you must serve the tenant with
a 30-day notice to vacate the garage and, under Los Angeles city rent
control, you also must reduce the tenant's rent by the value of the
"service" being reduced to him, the service being the loss of the use
of the garage.</TE>
<TE>   To find out the value of the garage, call the Los Angeles Rent
Stabilization at (213) 367-9099. It has assigned precise dollar
values to a number of such reductions of service.</TE>
<TE>   When 30-Day Move-Out Notices Begin and End</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am managing some rental property in Orange County, and I have
a question regarding 30-day notices. When a tenant gives you a 30-day
notice to vacate, is it strictly counting 30 days from the date of
the notice, or is every month considered to have 30 days? For
example, I have been told that every month is considered to have 30
days when a landlord is prorating rents. Therefore, by the same
logic, if I give a tenant a notice on the third of a month, I expect
them to vacate by the second of the following month, whether the
month has 28, 30 or 31 days. Is this correct?</TE>
<TE>   A: You are right about prorating of rents. All months are all
considered to have 30 days for the purposes of prorating rents.</TE>
<TE>   You are not correct when you assume that the same standard applies
to 30-day notices to vacate. With notices to vacate, 30 days is
strictly interpreted to mean 30 calendar days.</TE>
<TE>   You are also incorrect when you count the day you are given the
notice as Day One of the notice, as you indicate in your letter. The
day following the day you are given the notice is counted as the
first day of the notice.</TE>

<HD>Help Making the Leap to Homeownership</HD>
<DH>Assistance* Various government programs provide down
payments, low-interest mortgages to qualifying buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite seven years of pinching pennies, Andrew Tasker despaired of
ever being able to sock away enough money to make a down payment on a
home. But just in time for Christmas, he picked up the keys to his
very own three-bedroom home in Glendora.</LD>
<LD>   "I still can't believe it," said the 36-year-old manager of a
Pomona manufacturing company. "With the help of the city, I was able
to get the ball rolling. I learned that [home buying] was not out of
reach."</LD>
<LD>   With mortgage interest rates at historically low levels, more and
more eager buyers like Tasker are taking advantage of the dozens of
government home-buying programs available to those seeking financial
and other assistance. Programs specifically designed for teachers,
police officers and families of varying income levels are available,
if you know where to find them.</LD>
<TE>   Tasker learned about the Glendora First-Time Home Buyers program,
for example, after attending a home-buying class at North American
Mortgage Co., a division of Washington Mutual in West Covina.</TE>
<TE>   The single Glendora resident, who moved in with his mother several
years ago after an accident left him disabled, knew that he could
afford the monthly payments on a home, but sought assistance with the
down payment. He learned in the home-buying class that he qualified
for a loan and was eligible for the city of Glendora's assistance
program.</TE>
<TE>   The federally funded program, which provides "silent seconds" to
qualified applicants, provides a 30-year, $25,000 loan. During the
first five years of the loan, no interest accrues and no payments are
made. Thereafter, simple interest accrues at 3% per year. Borrowers
do not have to pay back the loan until they sell the house.</TE>
<TE>   Like participants in most home-buyer assistance programs, Tasker's
income had to fall within the limits imposed by the city from which
he borrowed the money. In Glendora, where home prices are higher than
some areas of Los Angeles County, program participants may not earn
more than 120% of the area median income. The annual income for a
family of four there, for example, cannot exceed $65,400; for an
individual, $45,800.</TE>
<TE>   Most home-buyer assistance programs in the Los Angeles set an
annual income limit of $43,600 for a family of four, because median
home prices there are lower. Income-level requirements vary city to
city and county to county.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that these programs can mean the difference
between affording or not affording a home," said Miguel Don, manager
of North American Mortgage Co.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case for Marcia Elayne, a single mother who took
advantage of the Los Angeles Housing Department's HOMEWORKS! program,
after a lifetime of apartment living.</TE>
<TE>   The city program, in partnership with Freddie Mac and
participating lenders, currently offers "soft seconds"--interest-free
loans--of up to $75,000 to low-income home buyers who need assistance
to purchase and rehabilitate homes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Under the HOMEWORKS! guidelines, Elayne was able to buy a $150,000
Van Nuys home with the $35,000 the city lent her. She came up with 3%
toward the down payment, and a portion of the city loan provided the
other 17% of the down. The remainder of the loan was used for
rehabilitating the home, a program requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the HOMEWORKS! program, Elayne will pay no
interest on the 30-year loan. She will repay the loan in full only
when she sells the house, refinances her loan or, 30 years from the
onset of the loan, with a balloon payment. To qualify, she had to
prove she did not own another home at the close of escrow and that
she earned $34,900 or less annually.</TE>
<TE>   "This program was a blessing for me," said Elayne, who works as a
clerical assistant for the Los Angeles Housing Department. "I'm the
only homeowner in a family of six siblings, so now they can stay with
me when they need it, or when they're in transition."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the HOMEWORKS! program, Los Angeles offers HOMEBUY,
which provides down payment assistance for low-income households to
purchase newly constructed or newly rehabilitated homes built by
developers working with the city of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Also available are the city's Mortgage Credit Certificate program,
which issues certificates allowing home buyers to claim up to 20% of
the annual interest paid on their mortgages as a federal income tax
credit, and Mortgage Revenue Bond program, or MRB, which offers
below-market interest rate loans to qualified borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   The latter program also provides home buyers with a gift of 3.5%
of the loan amount to be applied toward the down payment, closing
costs or prepaid items. MRBs also may be combined with the city's
down-payment and gap-financing programs, if the borrower's income
falls below 80% of the area median income.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, fully credentialed teachers who work at low-performing
schools, purchase homes in Los Angeles and are first-time buyers can
qualify for the city's Extra Credit program. This program provides
30-year loans at a fixed 6.5% rate, plus $7,500 toward a down payment
and closing costs assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "These programs make dreams come true for people who couldn't
afford to buy a house, and that's a huge population in the city of
Los Angeles," said Doug Smith, manager of the Los Angeles Housing
Department's homeownership unit. "Our program helps between 500 and
1,000 families a year."</TE>
<TE>   The County of Los Angeles Community Development Commission
sponsors homeownership assistance programs for residents buying in
the unincorporated areas of the county. Individual cities verify the
borrowers' eligibility and supplement the main county program with
local dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach, Glendale, Burbank and Culver City each sponsor
separate programs that have different eligibility rules from most
county programs. Potential borrowers should consult the local
housing, community development or redevelopment agencies of the city
in which they are considering buying a home to check out the
individual programs.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County also provides a host of home-buying assistance
programs, including a rebate program that provides up to $5,000 for
home improvements to qualified participants, second-mortgage
assistance, mortgage credit certificates, the Police Residence
Assistance Program and the Homebuyer Assistance Program.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which
provides the bulk of funding for most government home-buying
assistance programs, also sponsors the Teacher Next Door program for
qualified, certified teachers, and the Officer Next Door program for
full-time law enforcement officers who work for a city, county, state
or federal law-enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   HUD also oversees the Federal Housing Administration, which
insures a type of mortgage financing that allows lenders to ease
credit guidelines for marginal borrowers and provide lower down
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of mortgage money, is a
partner in 65 homeownership programs in Los Angeles and Orange
counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeownership is how people send kids to college, start small
businesses, retire," said Barbara Zeidman, Fannie Mae's director of
the Los Angeles Partnership office. "If we want those good things, we
have to invest in the future of our communities."</TE>
<TE>   Secondary lender Freddie Mac also is a partner in many
homeownership programs. Their Affordable Gold 97 and Community Gold
programs allow borrowers to buy a home with minimal down payments.
The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco offers their Individual
Development and Empowerment, or IDEA, program, which provides
matching subsidies to lower-income households saving to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   "These programs offer economic advantages to those of us who never
thought we could own our own homes," said Elayne, the Van Nuys
homeowner. "More importantly, my daughter now has a backyard to play
in.You can't place a money value on that."</TE>

<HD>Study Says Race Plays a Role in Value of Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>African American homeowners receive less value for their homes than
white homeowners in areas with a high degree of racial segregation,
according to a recent study by the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings
Institution.</LD>
<LD>   "The great majority of white home buyers don't buy homes in black
neighborhoods," said study author David Rusk, former mayor of
Albuquerque, N.M., and a consultant on urban and suburban policy. "If
there is less competition for a home that comes on the market, that
is likely to keep the price down."</LD>
<LD>   Rusk analyzed the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas and
compared the wealth-creating potential of homeownership for different
ethnic and racial groups. He found black homeowners received 18% less
value for their homes than white homeowners did. For every dollar of
income, white homeowners owned $2.64 worth of house while black
homeowners owned only $2.16 worth of house.</LD>
<TE>   The study, "The Segregation Tax, the Cost of Racial Segregation to
Black Homeowners," is based on 1990 U.S. Census data and other
research.</TE>

<HD>State Farm Raises California Insurance Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Inman News Features</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The State Farm affiliate providing homeowners insurance in California
has announced an average statewide rate increase of 6.9% for its
policyholders.</LD>
<LD>   Woodland Hills-based State Farm General Insurance Co.'s new rates
have been approved by the California Department of Insurance and will
take effect Feb. 9 for new customers. Existing State Farm customers
in California will face these increases when their policy comes up
for renewal.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners' rates are based on projected costs and reflect trends
in the number of California homeowner claims and the cost to pay
those claims and rate changes for individual customers will vary
depending on such factors as claim experience, location of the home
and policy coverages, according to State Farm.</LD>
<TE>   State Farm increased rates for California homeowners by 3.9% in
1999, then cut rates 0.2% overall in April 2001.</TE>

<LD>It is easy to insulate walls, ceilings and floors when you know a few
simple tricks.</LD>
<LD>   Although there are several choices, fiberglass insulation is the
best. It is lightweight, inexpensive, relatively easy to install and
holds up as well as, if not better than, all the other types. The
paper-faced type acts as a vapor barrier, yet still breathes. This is
important because you don't want to build a barrier that can become a
condensation chamber--something that can happen with foil-faced
insulation.</LD>
<LD>   Get the kind of insulation that comes in 16- and 24-inch-wide
rolls and precut lengths called batt insulation. Batts are easier to
handle than the type that consists of thousands of tiny chunks known
as loose-fill insulation. Also, batts stay in place better than
loose-fill. After years in a wall cavity, loose-fill insulation can
settle and become compacted. Insulation stops working in this
condition because the air spaces between the fibers are the actual
insulators.</LD>
<TE>   In an attic there is a tremendous amount of pressure developed as
air enters through the eave vents and travels upward to exit through
the upper portion of the roof. All of this air movement can push
loose-fill insulation into piles, leaving some areas unprotected.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a technique to remember: Fluff your insulation as you
install it. Before putting each piece in place, simply shake it out
gently. The tendency is to forcibly stuff insulation in place--the
"more is better" theory. With insulation you want a lot, but you want
it to be as fluffy as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Another tidbit: If you want to figure how much insulation you will
need, multiply the length times the width of the area to be insulated
and divide the result by the number of square feet shown on the
package of insulation. Let's say the ceiling is 12 feet long and 12
feet wide. Twelve times 12 equals 144 square feet. If the insulation
you choose comes in a 100-square-foot package, you will have to
purchase two packages.</TE>
<TE>   If the insulation is faced, be sure that the face of the
insulation is placed on the house side:</TE>
<TE>   * For ceilings the face goes down.</TE>
<TE>   * For floors the face goes up.</TE>
<TE>   * For walls the face goes on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   These rules of thumb apply in every case. Also, if you are adding
insulation, don't worry about what kind exists or what condition it
is in. Your new insulation can be applied over any other type or
brand. All types of insulation are compatible. Some might last
longer, work better or install easier than others. Color doesn't make
a difference either.</TE>
<TE>   In an attic you must be especially careful about insulating around
recessed light fixtures. A recessed light fixture can easily overheat
if covered with insulation. This is a big issue that is scrutinized
closely by building officials during insulation inspection. Most
insist on some kind of baffle between a recessed light fixture and
the end of the insulation.</TE>
<TE>   There are two kinds of recessed light fixtures--regular and IC. IC
fixtures have a housing built around them that prevents insulation
from coming into contact with the hot part of the light can--a
five-sided space. If you don't have IC fixtures, make sure to keep
the insulation at least 6 inches away from recessed light fixtures.
That's another reason why we don't care for loose-fill insulation.
Air currents in the attic can easily cover recessed cans and create a
major fire hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Note: If you have recessed light fixtures that shut off after
being on for a while, then turn back on again after a while, chances
are they are overheating. On modern recess light fixtures there is an
onboard fuse called a thermocouple that shuts the fixture off when it
overheats.</TE>
<TE>   When the fixture cools, the fuse resets and the light will come on
again by itself. This could indicate the insulation condition we have
just described, and warrants a jaunt into the attic.</TE>

<HD>Realtors' Add-On Fees Invite Trouble From HUD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--The top lawyer for the nation's 800,000-plus members of
the National Assn. of Realtors has just issued an unusual warning to
realty brokers: Be careful if you charge home sellers or buyers any
extra fees beyond your standard commission. You could be inviting
trouble from the federal government or private lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Laurie Janik, general counsel for the trade group, said the
growing number of brokerage firms that charge extra fees--typically
ranging from $250 to $595--may draw "unwanted attention" from federal
regulators and consumers. In particular, Janik said, regulators from
the Department of Housing and Urban Development might view these
burgeoning charges as "unearned fees" if they are not accompanied by
"bona fide" services performed on behalf of the consumers asked to
pay them.</LD>
<LD>   The extra charges, often labeled "transaction fees," "processing
and handling" or "regulatory compliance" on buyers' and sellers'
settlement sheets, are popping up across the country. Janik said some
brokers are imposing additional fees on top of their regular
commissions "in reaction to increasing costs and pressure to reduce
commission rates."</LD>
<TE>   Some brokers confirm that part of their motivation for imposing
add-on transaction fees is purely economic: To retain their most
productive sales agents, they are under increasing pressure to share
higher and higher percentages of the commission dollar. Some firms
give agents 90% to 100% of the commission proceeds, a huge change
from the 50/50 or 40/60 splits commonplace 10 to 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Janik says the question marks now surrounding these add-on fees
arise from a policy statement issued by HUD last October. In that
statement, the agency said that federal law prohibits charges imposed
by any settlement-service provider for which nominal, duplicative or
no work is performed. The same holds for fees charged that exceed the
reasonable value of the goods, facilities or services provided.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest issue of the realty association's monthly magazine,
Janik warned members that HUD "may challenge your company if it
adopts a commission-plus-flat-fee form of compensation." Whether
HUD's view of the law ultimately will be upheld in a court test is
somewhat unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Janik cited two federal cases that disagreed with the agency's
underlying position. In Echevarria vs. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., a
title company marked up recordation charges to consumers. An
appellate court held that the federal settlement procedures law does
not specifically ban such practices, since no split of the extra
charge was shared with another participant in the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   That decision provoked HUD to "reiterate" its position on all
forms of home real estate settlement-cost markups. The agency said no
markups are permitted unless accompanied by extra services, goods or
facilities commensurate with the extra charges. HUD officials have
not issued specific written guidance to Realtors on the increasing
imposition of transaction and processing fees on their
commission-paying customers. But Janik thinks HUD's overall policy
could be construed to cover these add-on fees, and that firms which
charge them risk regulatory entanglements that could prove costly.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in one recent settlement, a prominent mortgage
banking company admitted no wrongdoing but paid $50,000 to the
federal Treasury and put aside an additional $35,000 for refunds to
customers. HUD investigators alleged that the firm, headed by John A.
Courson, incoming chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America,
illegally marked up credit report charges on hundreds of its loan
applicants from 1998 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Although HUD also found that many other borrowers were
undercharged by the firm on credit reports during the same period,
Courson decided to settle rather than fight a federal agency in
court, with attendant high costs and unfavorable publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Implicitly, the same arguments could be made on the Realtor
transaction fees flagged by Janik. Brokers say they have legitimate
reasons for charging the fees. But do they want to fight the federal
government over them? Aggressive federal regulators have the odds on
their side, according to legal experts.</TE>
<TE>   Janik advised realty firms that until HUD's position is either
upheld or reversed in court, "brokers must carefully examine the
justification for any charges to consumers" beyond their traditional
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "To play it safe," said Janik, "brokers should be sure they aren't
charging consumers additional fees for services that have
traditionally been provided as part of the base compensation."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for consumers: Be aware that "transaction fees"
and other add-ons are increasingly being charged by brokers, but that
even the Realtors' top legal authority wonders if they're a smart
idea.</TE>

<LD>Tennis champ Pete Sampras has purchased a Beverly Hills home in the
mid-$8-million range, according to real estate sources not involved
in the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The house wasn't on the market, but Sampras was said to have been
drawn to it by its quiet tennis court.</LD>
<LD>   The five-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot-plus house on slightly more
than an acre with a swimming pool was described as being in need of
refurbishing. The house, with seven bathrooms, was built in the
1930s.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras owns a smaller but newer home with a tennis court on 1.5
acres in Benedict Canyon, where he and his wife, actress Bridgette
Wilson, were married in fall 2000. Sampras, 30, bought that property
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He has been called the greatest tennis player of the '90s. He has
won a record 13 Grand Slams, but, last year, he had his worst season
in a decade, finishing at No. 10, his lowest ranking since 1989.
Sampras was one of the top three players in the world for nine
straight years before 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Last year was also the first since 1992 that he didn't win at
least one major championship, but he had a strong run at the U.S.
Open when he became the first player to beat three former champions
consecutively at the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He recently changed coaches and now plans to play in the Davis
Cup. He also signed up as an investor and spokesman for the Tennis
Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "Wheel of Fortune" hostess Vanna White has purchased a home in the
Beverly Hills area for close to its $4.8-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1992, the three-story villa, in a gated community, has
two guest suites, three bedrooms and a master suite. The home, on 1.3
acres, also has five fireplaces, large verandas and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   White, 44, separated from her husband, restaurateur George Santa
Pietro, in November. They were married Dec. 31, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   White has been a hostess and letter-turner on "Wheel of Fortune"
since 1982, when Merv Griffin chose her from more than 200 other
hopefuls for the job. Last March she signed another contract to
extend her run on the show through 2006. She also appears on the Home
Shopping Network.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Lee Majors has sold his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., penthouse for
$1 million and moved into his new Las Vegas condo with his fiancee,
model Faith Noelle.</TE>
<TE>   Majors had been living in Fort Lauderdale since 1991. He moved
back to the West to be closer to his work, sources have said. His
mother, who lived in Boca Raton, died last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas condo is in a high-rise Turnberry Place development.
The asking price for a unit comparable to Majors' is $650,000.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest two-bedroom homes in the project, the
2,200-square-foot unit has a spa and a private wrap-around glass
balcony with a view of the Strip. Each condo in the project has a
private elevator entry.</TE>
<TE>   Majors' unit is one of 185 in the first of four 40-story towers to
be built. The two- to four-bedroom condos range from $500,000 to more
than $5.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Majors, best known for his starring roles in the ABC series "The
Six Million Dollar Man" (1973-78) and "The Fall Guy" (1981-85),
appears in the recently released movie "Out Cold," a comedy for
Spyglass/Disney studios, and in the upcoming "Big Fat Liar" for
Universal Films. "Big Fat Liar" is due out Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set yet for a wedding to Noelle, 27. She has been
Majors' companion for about seven years.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Walton family, heirs of the late Sam Walton
(founder of Wal-Mart), has purchased a property adjacent to a Bel-Air
home she bought in October for $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   The property has a house on it that was described as "basically a
teardown." The buyer was known to want the 1.7-acre site, which she
purchased for $6 million, as a buffer to give her more privacy.</TE>
<TE>   The home she bought in October had belonged to Freddy DeMann,
Madonna's former manager and co-founding partner of Maverick Records,
and his wife, Candy.</TE>
<TE>   The Art Deco-style home has five bedrooms, including a
2,000-square-foot master suite, in 20,000 square feet. The house,
with a pool and a tennis court, is on three acres with city-to-ocean
views.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Collins of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills East,
represented the Walton heir in buying, sources said, and Joe Babajian
and Kyle Grasso of Prudential Estate Properties, Beverly Hills,
represented the seller of the adjacent property.</TE>
<TE>   Brian K. Roberts, a prolific TV director and editor who also
co-wrote the book "L.A. Shortcuts: A Guidebook for Drivers Who Hate
to Wait," has listed his Hollywood Hills home at $839,000.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts bought the house when he was single. Now married with
three children, he and his wife, Danielle, have decided to move to a
larger home in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   The mid-century modern-style home in the Hollywood Hills has three
bedrooms in slightly more than 1,500 square feet. The remodeled home
has an updated kitchen, expansive walls of glass and a free-form pool
with spa. The property has canyon and mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has directed episodes of "Everybody Loves Raymond," "The
Drew Carey Show" and "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch." He was an editor
on "The Best of the Tracey Ullman Show" (1990) and for an episode of
"The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Bergevin and Tess Nelson of Prudential John Aaroe &amp;
Associates, Los Feliz, have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   David Barenholtz, owner of Apex Fine Art (a Los Angeles gallery
specializing in 20th century American photojournalism), and his
partner, Randy Arnold, vice president of advertising and direct
marketing for Universal Studios Home Video, have sold the Nichols
Canyon home they bought last year from actress Milla Jovovich.</TE>
<TE>   Jovovich sold the home to them for $730,000. It sold this time for
slightly more than $1 million after an extensive refurbishing by
Barenholtz and Arnold.</TE>

<HD>Weigh the Signs of Mold</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Mold" by Diane Wender, Dec. 16, and other letters
following the article: Some of the comments have been pretty scary.
For homeowners and home buyers, don't think that as soon as you see
mold, it will cost you a fortune. It may not.</LD>
<LD>   However, you should have it checked out by a qualified home
inspector or inspection company. Being a real estate agent, more than
once I have begun a transaction on a home that has mold, most
recently in a condo association, and the association is taking care
of the remediation. There is liability if the issue is not addressed.</LD>
<LD>   Buyer beware. When you are looking to buy a home, two sure signs
of mold are smelling it and seeing it. If the house smells moldy, get
it properly inspected by a qualified professional. Do not rely on the
disclosures provided by the seller.</LD>
<TE>   Seller beware. If you are a seller, before you put your home on
the market make sure you do not have mold. If you have mold, hire a
professional and eliminate the mold before listing your home for
sale. If you have mold and choose not to eliminate it, make sure you
provide that information and any information on testing you have done
to the buyer. Failure to do so could open the oor to legal problems.
After mold remediation, I even advise my sellers to advise the buyer
of the mold and its removal. Better safe than sorry.</TE>

<HD>Not All Fees Are Bogus</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Junk Fees Are What's Behind That Great 'Low Rate'" (by Kenneth R.
Harney, Dec. 16) appalled me. It started out somewhat informative and
then turned into a misinterpretation of so called "junk fees."</LD>
<LD>   The blanket interpretation of junk fees for third-party
professional services is biased. I agree that there are some fees
that fit under the category of pure junk fees, however, most are not.</LD>
<LD>   Someone has to pay for Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac requirements
that apply to the majority of conforming and nonconforming loans.
These are third-party vendor services, which can include appraisals,
credit reports, escrow services, title insurance and notary services
fees, among others. These are not free services. On a typical
$150,000 loan, this can easily amount to much more than $1,500.
Brokers don't pocket these fees. How can anyone call a third-party
service fee a junk fee?</LD>
<TE>   Some of the other fees noted in the article as junk fees apply to
a reasonable profit and overhead expenses. Mortgage brokers make a
living at providing a needed service to homeowners and potential
buyers by charging an origination fee. Why do you think we originate
the majority of all loans in the United States? It's low interest
rates and need, not greed. And who is going to process the loan or
underwrite it? If the broker doesn't, the lender will.</TE>
<TE>   All lenders charge some sort of lender fee to the broker for
underwriting the loan risk and validating the borrower's
documentation.</TE>
<TE>   A junk fee does absolutely nothing for the borrower. Such fees to
look out for are application fees, funding fees, administration fees,
warehousing fees, among others. These fees are charged to the
borrower for no reason but pure profit.</TE>

<HD>A Premium for Sound Homes?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, the California Building Industry Assn. is complaining that too
many homeowners are suing builders who build and sell unsafe homes,
which raises builders' insurance premiums ("Builders Sound the Alarm
on Insurance Premiums," Dec. 30).</LD>
<LD>   If builders want to avoid lawsuits for shoddy construction--and
subsequent increases in insurance premiums--they should build homes
safely.</LD>
<LD>   When they make mistakes, they should promptly and completely
repair their mistakes to avoid further, and more expensive, damage.</LD>
<TE>   We hear from homeowners throughout California who have spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars on new homes only to discover severe
leaks that lead to toxic mold, unsecured chimneys that render
fireplaces unsafe, beetle-infested studs and other consequences of
unsafe construction.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who discover safety problems due to shoddy construction
face a financial Catch-22: They generally can't afford to fix the
problem having just scraped together the cash to buy their new home;
they can't afford to move out and pay their mortgage and rent; and
they can't sell their homes for full value because they must disclose
the construction defects. Often, their only recourse is a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Builders who repeatedly flout health and safety codes should pay
additional insurance premiums [because] they raise the cost of doing
business.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance premiums act as an incentive to obey the law and take
responsibility. Builders of the most expensive consumer product most
of us will ever buy should be held to a higher standard, not lower.</TE>

<HD>She's Sleeping Easier</HD>
<DH>Creative refinancing gives a condominium owner her bedroom
back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa Marie Griffin had been sleeping on her sofa for nearly three
years after giving up her condominium's spacious master bedroom and
bath to a roommate. For the 36-year-old single mother, the $525
monthly rent from the roommate was the only way she could make the
$1,190 payment for her Yorba Linda condo.</LD>
<LD>   But after three roommates, Griffin and her 14-year-old son,
Nathan, want to try to go it alone.</LD>
<LD>   "I would eat beans first before I had another roommate," Griffin
said, recalling roommates who would borrow cooking supplies and never
return them or leave half-eaten jars of food in the refrigerator for
months. "And sharing a closet and a bathroom with a 14-year-old boy
is not exactly cool. He wants his space too."</LD>
<TE>   To make it, Griffin--who earns about $23,000 annually and has
worked for 12 years in maintenance at Disneyland--must find a way to
make up the lost rental income. Although she's working toward a
bachelor's degree that she hopes will help her increase her income in
about two years, there's little chance for a raise in her current
position. So she's considering a second job or selling her 2000 Honda
Civic and getting a less expensive used car for her 25-minute commute
to work.</TE>
<TE>   But the solution to Griffin's dilemma may be as easy as
refinancing, according to Roland Weedon, founder and president of
Essex Mortgage in Orange, who said his refinancing business doubled
in the last quarter of 2001 when interest rates fell.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Griffin's perfect credit and long work history, Weedon
was able to qualify her for a new $155,000 loan called a temporary
2-to-1 buydown. This type of loan, he said, is easy to qualify for
because initial monthly payments are low. The loan is offered with a
below-market interest rate for two years in exchange for paying more
closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   In Griffin's case, the $155,000 30-year loan that Weedon
recommended would have a 3.875% interest rate in the first year;
4.875% in the second year and a 5.875% interest rate in years three
through 30. Instead of paying $1,190 a month for her mortgage, her
monthly payment would be $728 the first year and $820 the second. In
the loan's third year, the mortgage would stabilize at $916 a
month--still $274 a month less than what Griffin currently pays.</TE>
<TE>   The two years' worth of lower payments, Weedon said, would give
Griffin time to make it on her own without a roommate while she
finishes her degree. In year three, when the higher interest rate
kicks in, Griffin hopefully would have graduated and be earning more.</TE>
<TE>   While a 2-to-1 buydown may look similar to a variable loan, it's
not. Variables have interest rates that adjust over time and can cap
at 6% higher than where they started, Weedon said. With a 2-to-1
buydown, the interest rate varies a predetermined amount in years one
and two and then remains the same.</TE>
<TE>   Not only would the refinance eliminate Griffin's need for a
roommate, but the loan would also allow her to pay off the four years
remaining on her car, a $2,000 balance on a credit card and put a few
thousand dollars in her pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds really too good to be true," Griffin said.</TE>
<TE>   The downside to a 2-to-1 buydown is that estimated closing costs
are higher than with a conventional loan. In Griffin's case, her
anticipated closing costs on the $155,000 loan would be $8,900
compared with $5,000 for a standard fixed rate loan. But the closing
costs would be financed as part of Griffin's loan, Weedon said.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of Essex Mortgage clients finance their homes using the
2-to-1 buydown option, according to Weedon. Typically, he said, the
loan is a good choice for young couples or professionals just
starting out who expect their incomes to increase in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope [the loan] doesn't put Griffin back on the couch in
the third year," Weedon said. "Even then, she'll have the higher
mortgage but with no car payment and no credit card payment and
she'll still be paying less than she does now without a roommate."</TE>
<TE>   An option that Griffin could consider instead is taking the equity
she has accumulated in the condo and buying another home. To find out
the condo's worth, Stephanie Wisner-Abrego with Tarbell Realtors'
Yorba Linda office pulled "comps"--short for comparables--of what
other condos in Griffin's complex have sold for during the past six
months. She found that Griffin's condo has appreciated about 48%
since 1994, when her parents bought the property for $145,000. Her
unit is now valued at about $215,000.</TE>
<TE>   But other properties that Griffin might consider have similarly
risen in price. Wisner-Abrego was not able to find any that would
work for Griffin in Yorba Linda or Aliso Viejo and Irvine--areas
where Griffin would be willing to relocate. In fact, she was able to
locate only four properties in Mission Viejo that met Griffin's
criteria of two bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Although the properties ranged in price from $156,000 to $169,000,
they were older and didn't offer the design elements that today's
condos provide, such as a spacious floor plan and the New England
architecture that Griffin currently enjoys. Griffin's condo is also
in an excellent school district.</TE>
<TE>   By not moving, Wisner-Abrego said Griffin would save herself an
estimated $17,000 in selling costs and $3,000 in purchasing fees."I
think if she is able to stay put she should," Wisner-Abrego said.</TE>
<TE>   That was a relief to Griffin, who is finally getting comfortable
now that she has reclaimed her old space. Not only has she moved back
into her room, but she's spruced it up with new curtains and an
antique chaise longue.</TE>
<TE>   "I've put a stamp on the place like it's mine again," she said.
"This feels good. It feels like I can ... move on with my life."</TE>

<TE>   This Month's Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner: Lisa Marie Griffin, 36</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Theme park operations, Disneyland</TE>
<TE>   Gross monthly income: $2,000 a month</TE>
<TE>   Goal: Eliminate the need for a roommate.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Without a roommate, Griffin--who is already on a
tight budget--will need to find some creative ways to come up with
$525 a month without taking on a second job. She loves where she
lives and does not want to relocate.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Take advantage of low interest rates and refinance with a new
loan called a 2-to-1 buydown--an easy-to-qualify-for loan that offers
a below-market interest rate in exchange for more upfront closing
costs.</TE>
<TE>   * Finance the additional closing costs required for a 2-to-1
buydown.</TE>
<TE>   * Take advantage of a higher loan amount with today's lower
interest rates and pay off other such monthly expenses as a car loan
or credit card debt to make the higher payments in year three of the
loan more manageable.</TE>

<HD>Deal of the Week: Hobbit Tour</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Air-hotel packages to Australia and New Zealand can often be had for
little more than the air fare alone. Putting a Hollywood twist on the
deal, Los Angeles-based Newmans South Pacific Vacations is offering a
package called "Journeys to Middle-Earth" featuring New Zealand sites
where the movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"
was filmed. For prices starting at $1,199 per person, double
occupancy, during the winter low season (May 1 to Sept. 2), you get
round-trip air fare on Air New Zealand between LAX and Auckland;
seven nights' lodging; and a compact, manual- transmission rental car
for eight days. Airport taxes and car insurance are extra. By
comparison, the regular round-trip air fare in that period is $1,118,
according to Newmans. You can use vouchers to reserve hotels as you
go, or book in advance, a spokeswoman said. The company provides
suggested itineraries with sites such as Matamata (a set location for
Hobbiton) and Wellington, home to the studios of "The Lord of the
Rings" director Peter Jackson. (800) 416-0667,

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--New York tourism received a double dose of good news last
week as Mayor Michael Bloomberg presided over the reopening of a big
hotel near the site of the former World Trade Center, and the Queen
Elizabeth 2 cruise ship arrived for its first Manhattan port call
since the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Marriott Financial Center Hotel is the first of four
big hotels near ground zero to reopen since the attacks. The hotel,
two blocks south of the site on West Street, was used as a center for
recovery workers.</LD>
<LD>   Only 125 of the hotel's 504 rooms were ready for use, and just 70
rooms had been booked for the reopening night, Marriott Vice
President Roger Borsink said. Discounted rates were $189 a night for
weekdays and $120 a night for weekends, rather than the usual $300
for this time of year, he added.</LD>

<HD>Zipping Through Security Checkpoints at Airports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several airlines are putting their frequent fliers in the fast lane
for security screening. American, Delta, Northwest and United have
recently set up separate, expedited lines at some airport security
checkpoints limited to certain frequent fliers or business- or
first-class customers. Who gets in varies by airline and airport.</LD>
<LD>   United, for instance, operates the expedited lines at Los Angeles,
San Francisco and O'Hare (Chicago) international airports, said
spokesman Chris Brathwaite. At the first two, you must be a
first-class or full-fare business-class passenger or a frequent flier
who logs at least 50,000 miles or 60 paid segments per year to
qualify. O'Hare has similar rules, except its cutoff for frequent
fliers is only 25,000 miles or 30 paid segments.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest, as of last month, operated the special lines in Los
Angeles, Seattle, O'Hare, Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tenn.
They're open to first-class and business-class passengers and
frequent fliers who travel at least 50,000 miles per year in the
program.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a ticket to hog heaven that you can find right in the airport:
motorcycles for rent.</LD>
<LD>   EagleRider Motorcycle Rental, which rents Harley-Davidsons in more
than 20 cities including Los Angeles, its headquarters, and in Spain,
claims its new motorcycle rental outlet at Palm Springs International
Airport is the only one at any U.S. airport.</LD>
<LD>   These are not cheap thrills. Renting a full-size motorcycle costs
$166.88 per day, or $136.57 during the current special, through Jan.
31. That rate includes CDW insurance (about $20), airport fees and
sales taxes. Smaller-size bikes go for $50 to $75 per day, plus taxes
and insurance. You can also rent bikes one way, with drop-off fees
that start at $100 in California, said company co-owner Don Herborn.

<HD>Airport Security Alerts Numerous Since Sept. 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Security scares at U.S. airports and abroad have made the news
regularly since the Sept. 11 attacks. But really, how bad has it
been?</LD>
<LD>   Pretty bad, according to statistics from the Federal Aviation
Administration. Giving numerical heft to traveler insecurities, the
numbers show 30 airport terminals were evacuated on orders of the FAA
between Oct. 30 and Dec. 31. The evacuations caused 1,180 flight
delays, 464 flight cancellations and 15 diversions of planes to other
airports, said FAA spokesman William Shumann. And those statistics
cover only the evacuations ordered by the FAA, he notes. LAX, for
instance, ordered several evacuations in the same period, a
spokeswoman said, although there were no FAA-ordered evacuations
there.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the evacuations, FAA agents ordered people off 434 flights
because of possible problems in security screening, Shumann added.
The FAA began tracking delays and cancellations due to security
concerns on Oct. 30 and has been regularly updating them.</LD>
<TE>   There were fewer fatal airliner accidents worldwide in 2001 than
average--in fact, the fewest since 1946, according to the Aviation
Safety Network, which compiles statistics on the subject. Because of
the Sept. 11 attacks, however, the number of deaths caused by such
accidents set a record, it added. The network reported 34 fatal
airliner accidents in 2001, versus an average of 48 per year from
1991 through 2000.</TE>

<HD>Camera-Ready Inside Joshua Tree</HD>
<DH>In the desert, developing photo skills and an appreciation
for barren beauty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHRYN WILKENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>We both saw it in the rearview mirror at the same instant. Just as I
yelled "Stop!" my husband wrenched the steering wheel to the right
and hit the brakes. We skidded to a halt on the berm.</LD>
<LD>   Grabbing my camera--no time for the tripod--I leaped from the car
and sprinted across the road to photograph a Joshua tree at sunset.
The sky, which had been a stubborn gray for hours, had exploded into
a blazing patchwork of pink and blue.</LD>
<LD>   Ralph and I had come here, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles,
for a weekend photography workshop offered through UC Riverside's
Extension program. We wanted to combine the class with some camping
at Indian Cove on the park's north side, where every site has a good
view of the park's rocky, otherworldly landscape.</LD>
<TE>   I had called about six weeks ahead for a reservation, a good thing
because all 101 campsites at Indian Cove were occupied that November
weekend, mostly by families and groups of rock climbers. Our site was
small but left us feeling close to nature--so much so that we took
care not to bayonet ourselves on the yucca next to the tent.</TE>
<TE>   The photography group gathered for introductions Friday afternoon
at instructor Craig Fucile's campsite. Fucile, a former assistant for
Ansel Adams' Friends of Photography workshops, has been a landscape
photographer since 1972 and an extension instructor since '95. The 12
participants (most Southern Californians, though one man drove from
San Francisco) had varied photographic interests: landscape,
wildlife, close-up, black and white. Camera equipment ranged from
point-and-shoots to more expensive digital and SLR models.</TE>
<TE>   UCR offers the workshops three or four times a year. (The next is
Feb. 21 to 24 in Death Valley; Fucile teaches similar classes through
UC Irvine and UC Santa Cruz.) Even though no photography experience
is required, no one in our group was a novice. We all knew, for
example, that a hot shoe isn't the latest trend in footwear but an
accessory connecting flash to camera.</TE>
<TE>   After a field session among the towering granite formations, we
went our separate ways for dinner. Ralph and I had heard good things
about the 29 Palms Inn, which turned out to be a bit tough to find.
Granted, we arrived before the peak dinner hour, but the place looked
like a deserted western movie set. We were about to leave when a
passing guest pointed us to the restaurant, behind the inn's swimming
pool.</TE>
<TE>   There we found an arty dining room with a dozen tables and a bar,
all just coming to life. Things were looking up. A friendly waiter
brought us cocktails as we perused photos and paintings, mostly
desert scenes by local artists. We both opted for Cajun-style
albacore, served medium rare in a pool of spicy Creole sauce. A bowl
of mini vegetables, salad, twice-baked potatoes, a grilled
okra-and-eggplant medley and homemade bread rounded out the meal. We
were so pleased that we made a reservation for the following night.</TE>
<TE>   The class reunited at 8 p.m. at Indian Cove to experiment with
night photography. We set up tripods and trained our cameras on the
dim landscape. Moonlight bathed the rocks, but the sky looked black.
Fucile assured us that the camera would record it as blue even if our
eyes couldn't. He was right.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian Cove Campground has fire rings, picnic tables and pit
toilets but no water. We skipped campfire cooking in favor of
restaurants in Twentynine Palms, about nine miles away.</TE>
<TE>   After a hearty breakfast at the Carousel Cafe, we met our
classmates outside the park's western entrance off California 62 in
the town of Joshua Tree. Because we were part of a UCR class, the
park waived the $10 entrance fee. Our destination: Desert Queen
Ranch, just north of the Hidden Valley Campground.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I had been to Joshua Tree several times, I had never
heard of this place. It turned out to be the highlight of the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Desert Queen, also called Keys Ranch, started as a gold mine;
Bill Keys was hired as assayer and custodian in 1910. When the mine
faltered, he claimed the land and turned the surrounding acreage into
a homestead with his wife, Frances, and five children. Keys lived
here until his death in 1969 at age 89.</TE>
<TE>   From October through May, tours are given twice a day for $5 per
person. UCR had arranged a special tour, so we didn't have to pay the
fee, and, unlike other visitors, we were allowed to use tripods.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger Deb Gaunt led us around the ranch, a weathered set of
buildings surrounded by husks of cars, rusty machinery and mining
equipment, all set against a backdrop of rounded golden rocks. In
short, photographers' heaven.</TE>
<TE>   I found plenty of camera fodder: a one-room schoolhouse, a
windmill, porcelain stoves and a machine shop full of old tools. Even
a table strewn with broken glass, purple in the desert sun, seemed
photogenic.</TE>
<TE>   We spent two hours happily snapping our shutters. The ranger
circulated and answered questions. She showed me a bullet hole in a
car door and recounted how a neighbor had shot at Keys. (He shot
back--and spent five years at San Quentin for manslaughter.)</TE>
<TE>   Next we were off for lunch at the Hidden Valley picnic area, where
Fucile gave more pointers on outdoor photography and led us on a
mile-long nature trail. Hidden Valley is a box canyon once used by
cattle rustlers, a perfect spot to try the panorama method Fucile
taught: Take three or more shots by pivoting a camera on the tripod.
As if on cue, streaky clouds appeared, adding visual interest to the
rich blue sky.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon we were driving to the Ryan Mountain trail head
for sunset photos. Ralph and I, hungry and impatient with a sky that
had turned overcast, decided to call it a day. We headed for the 29
Palms Inn, periodically checking the rearview mirror for color.</TE>
<TE>   After stopping for our serendipitous sunset, we reached the inn
and this time requested an outdoor table by the pool. Our steaks were
good but not as great as the previous night's meal. Still, we enjoyed
the balmy evening and were amused by a singing guitar player whose
musical taste lingered in the 1970s. "Peaceful Easy Feeling" was
still running through my head later as we settled in by a campfire.</TE>
<TE>   I thought a cricket was in our tent in the middle of the night,
but the noise turned out to be our alarm clock chirping at 5 a.m. We
rolled out of sleeping bags for sunrise at the Cholla Cactus Garden,
about 30 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   The garden is in the transition zone between the high desert, the
Mojave, and the low desert, the Colorado. Heavy cloud cover obscured
the dawn, but Bigelow chollas (also called jumping chollas or teddy
bear chollas) were worth a few frames.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the group--buddies now--returned to Twentynine Palms for
breakfast at Bella Rouge, an upscale bakery and bistro on the main
drag. Except for the copper and marble fixtures and the inexplicable
elephant portraits on the walls, it reminded me of a cozy farmhouse
kitchen. I enjoyed my cinnamon roll, which had a thick layer of cream
cheese frosting. Ralph gobbled up his French toast, made from
croissants and topped with hazelnut butter and maple syrup.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to our final lesson, we talked about the weekend. We
liked our instructor's pragmatic, low-key approach. Formal lectures
were kept to a minimum to allow more time in the field, where Fucile
answered questions one on one. To our satisfaction, we had spent so
much time looking through the lens that we had not yet read handouts
from the first day.</TE>
<TE>   The group gathered at the park's visitor center in Twentynine
Palms to critique old photos we had been instructed to bring from
home. Then came our last lesson and a field session at the nearby
Oasis of Mara, one of five oases in the park.</TE>
<TE>   By this time my head was spinning with talk of aperture
priorities, warming filters, slide scanners and color temperatures.
Fucile reassured us. "Seeing is the most important part of
photography," he said. "The technical aspects will fall into place
over time."</TE>
<TE>   I had seen moonlight on granite, golden wildflowers, the oddity of
abandoned jalopies in a boulder-strewn wilderness and Joshua trees
silhouetted against a crazy-quilt sky. Had my camera recorded any of
it? It didn't matter. The weekend had been a success regardless: We
picked up some pointers, made friends and reveled in the stark beauty
of the California desert.</TE>

<DH>In medieval towns, seeking traces of warrior monks known as
the Templars.</DH>

<DL>PROVINS, France</DL>
<LD>"The lunatic is easily recognized," Umberto Eco wrote in his mystery
novel "Foucault's Pendulum." "Sooner or later he brings up the
Templars."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the risk to my sanity and reputation, I resolved to
discover firsthand the elusive truth about these fabled knights
recruited to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land during the Crusades.
Depending on whom you believed, they were also magicians, Satanists,
heretics, Druids, alchemists, cosmic architects, Freemasons, even
blood descendants of Christ.</LD>
<LD>   I had written one historical novel about the Knights Templar; a
second was in progress. Yet I was no nearer to understanding them.
Since the history on my pages had turned stale, I decided to climb
castles, search tunnels and walk ancient paths.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Templars' reach extended from Syria to Scotland, I
narrowed my quest to north and central France, in the five regions
where the order was conceived and exterminated. During my 12-day
journey last spring, I logged more than 1,000 miles on an itinerary
that roughly circled and led back to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris I met up with tour guide Peter Gravgaard, a former
professor with expertise in medieval history, and two others. We
drove 80 miles southeast across poppy-splashed fields to Clairvaux. I
wanted to understand why, at the dawn of the 12th century, this
rolling Champagne-Ardennes farmland fertilized an idea--the warrior
monk--that ultimately would change the world.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1118 a knight of Champagne led eight fellow barons to
Jerusalem, where they set up headquarters at the site of the Temple
of Solomon. Some believe their true purpose was not to protect
pilgrims but to track down and recover precious relics.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful monk in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was
canonized in 1174, championed the knights' formation into a new
military religious order with unprecedented powers. Recruits would
take vows of poverty and chastity and were trained to spill infidel
blood. They answered only to the pope. With their long beards, shorn
hair and white mantles blazoned with splayed red crosses, the
Templars came to be held in awe by both Muslims and Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Only a vaulted cellar and a small section of the church remain of
the Cistercian abbey at Clairvaux, where St. Bernard may have
conceived the Templar order. To evoke his spirit, detour 120 miles
south to the 12th century abbey of Noirlac, near Bourges.</TE>
<TE>   Noirlac's somber, ascetic stone church and houses, often visited
by St. Bernard, are marvelously maintained. The afternoon we arrived,
craftsmen in breeches and jerkins were demonstrating ironworks and
glass blowing to several hundred spectators during a medieval arts
festival.</TE>
<TE>   North of Noirlac is Coulommiers, perhaps the region's
best-preserved Templar commanderie, or regional headquarters. More
than 1,000 such compounds, with curtain-walled barracks and round
chapels imitating the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, were
built in France during the 200 years of the order's existence.</TE>
<TE>   As Coulommiers' high-beamed tithe barn proves, the Templars were
as accomplished in agriculture and commerce as they were in war. At
its height, the order numbered about 20,000 and held estates in
Palestine, the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. With their unique
network of storehouses and treasuries, the Templars soon became
bankers for pilgrims and monarchs alike.</TE>
<TE>   But their stunning success in garnering wealth contributed to
their downfall. King Philip IV of France, who lusted after the
Templar gold to finance his wars, connived with Pope Clement V to
order the mass arrest of the knights on Oct. 13, 1307, a day now
memorialized as Friday the 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in Coulommiers' echoing chapel, I could envision the
unsuspecting Templars kneeling in evening prayer, only to be burst
upon by royal henchmen and dragged to prison on charges of sacrilege
and heresy. Those who did not die under torture were executed. King
Philip did not find the treasure he expected, and some historians
have surmised that a few Templars escaped to hide their riches in
underground stashes.</TE>
<TE>   One suspected sanctuary is a legendary Templar lair with an
alluring name: the Orient Forest, a modern wildlife preserve a few
miles west of Troyes.</TE>
<TE>   The next day at dusk, we drove through its isolated 173,000 acres.
A Templar could have hidden among its dense pines for years. Now
vacationing Parisians find refuge here, boating on the Lake of the
Temple and on ponds dug by Templars for fisheries. If I had months to
spare and scuba diving skills, I would look for the lost treasure
here.</TE>
<TE>   That evening we arrived at Aux Armes de Champagne hotel in
L'Epine. After a marvelous dinner of lamb chops in the hotel's
restaurant, I strode across the quiet square to the lovely basilica
of Notre Dame de L'Epine. Walking past its pillars, carved in the
form of a Celtic cross, I came upon a tantalizing fresco near the
altar depicting the Temple of Solomon.</TE>
<TE>   It remains a mystery why this Gothic miniature of the cathedrals
in Paris, Amiens and Reims was built in this isolated hamlet during
the 15th century, long after the fall of the Templars. Some believe
that anonymous Templar relatives completed a plan that placed the
Notre Dame cathedrals across France in a pattern to mirror the stars
in the constellation Virgo, in honor of the Blessed Virgin.</TE>
<TE>   Our next day's search led us to the walled hilltop city of
Provins, 50 miles southwest of L'Epine. Eco describes Provins as "a
magical place, still redolent of secrets." Some Templars were rumored
to have fled into its vast network of tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Provins is a medieval gem, inexplicably ignored by tourists.
Hovering over all is Caesar's Tower, a donjon whose thick turrets and
octagonal shape evoke the traditional Templar design. Some of the
walls of the city's subterranean passages, which are open to the
public, still contain occult markings.</TE>
<TE>   In the upper part of town I came upon a sign nearly covered by
vines: Rue des Templiers. I knew from experience that street names
often provide the best clues for finding Templar remains. Following
the alley, I reached an ancient two-story stone building. I peered
into the basement and saw vaulting over what looked like a chapel
undergoing excavation. Had I stumbled upon a Templar sanctum? A door
plaque revealed it to be the residence of a "mason." But no one was
home to ask.</TE>
<TE>   Our group next traveled 98 miles to Vezelay, the launching point
for the Crusades. Built upon a crag blessed with curative salt
springs, the town of clustered, rust-hued roofs is now starkly
serene. As I climbed the cobblestone main street bordered by gift
shops and artists' galleries, I imagined it crowded with Templars,
crusaders and pilgrims gathering courage for their dangerous
journeys.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Vezelay seems almost ashamed of its pivotal role in the
Crusades. An occasional toy sword or crusader statuette sat in store
windows, but there was little to remind me of the rabid spirit that
once held sway here.</TE>
<TE>   The Basilica of the Magdalene, which crowns Vezelay's summit, is
reputed to be an enchantress of dancing light. But on the day we
visited, a ghostly mist enveloped its voluminous Romanesque nave.</TE>
<TE>   Two images of Vezelay will remain with me. The first was a
towering statue of St. Bernard at a side entrance to the basilica.
Depicted preaching the Second Crusade, the saint thrusts his crucifix
like an avenging sword toward heaven. On a single day in 1146, more
than 100,000 souls crowded the north hillside to hear him promise
eternal salvation in return for regaining Jerusalem from the Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The basilica's cool, candle-lighted crypt offered an unexpected
antidote to that imagined warlike scene. I descended the uneven
stairs and found a white-robed nun frozen in pacific vigil near a
reliquary that once held the bones of Mary Magdalene. The nun had
knelt there for hours, without padding, on cold flagstones. Here, a
few steps apart, were two irreconcilable manifestations of the same
faith.</TE>
<TE>   Our trip was fast coming to a close, and I still had not answered
the question that most nagged me: What had the Templars discovered in
the Holy Land?</TE>
<TE>   The next day the spires of Chartres Cathedral appeared over the
horizon. I had been warned that words could not capture this miracle
of stone and stained glass. Still, I was breathless upon entering the
nave. Perhaps I finally had found my answer, writ large in the
language of architecture.</TE>
<TE>   French scholar Louis Charpentier argued that Templar masons
applied esoteric geometry learned in the East to create an alchemical
vessel of light and space that transformed worshipers. Most of all, I
looked forward to walking the legendary labyrinth at the center of
Chartres' nave. But the ancient map for spiritual discovery had been
covered by chairs. I welled up with disappointment. Whatever secrets
the Templars may have memorialized here, bureaucrats now prevented
their revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred miles north, in Normandy, the round Templar tower of
Gisors sits upon a man-made hill. Here and in Chinon in the Loire
Valley, the Templars' last grand master, Jacques de Molay, and other
jailed Templars left enigmatic graffiti and carvings. In 1946 a
gardener reported finding an underground chapel with chests and odd
statuettes, but his claim has never been corroborated.</TE>
<TE>   Any pilgrimage to the memory of the Templars should save Paris as
the finale. De Molay and many of his brethren met their grisly end
here. Nothing remains of their once proud palace, which stood in the
northern Marais district near the modern Square du Temple. The last
stones were razed in 1854, and a peaceful garden and lake exist on
the spot. Armed with maps, I strolled the cafe-lined Marais and tried
to imagine the 14 towers and octagonal church.</TE>
<TE>   I crossed the bridge to the Ile de la Cite and made my way to the
most haunting of all Templar sites. At the island's western apex,
Pont Neuf, a plaque marks the spot where, on March 18, 1314, De Molay
was burned at the stake. Standing there, I recalled a Latin
inscription scrawled on Gisors' dungeon wall: Tempus Edax Rerum.
Time, the devourer of all things. Did De Molay write it? If so, his
legacy has disproved his prophecy. Time, it seems, has met its equal.
Fascination with the Templars and their mysteries has only grown with
the passing centuries.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii on Sale (sort of)</HD>
<DH>On a quest for a hotel room bargain, knowing where to look
and how to ask sometimes can lead to deep discounts, sometimes to big
disappointments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>At the front desk of a Sheraton last month, I asked for a rate sheet
because I wanted to know the published price of a room there. Known
in the travel industry as a "rack rate," the tariff printed in a
brochure is generally the highest price a hotel charges. The clerk
frowned and told me to wait, rooted around in a cabinet, then walked
down the long, curving counter and consulted a colleague.</LD>
<LD>   When she returned, she said, "I'm sorry, we don't have one."</LD>
<LD>   "Then can you tell me the rack rates?" I asked.</LD>
<TE>   "The rack rates don't exist since the World Trade Center," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt this is Sheraton's official line. But it was just what I
wanted to hear as I began a quest for bargain room rates in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The time was ripe. With fewer people traveling in the aftermath of
Sept. 11 and Hawaii tourism down more than 27% in November compared
with the previous year, hotels and resorts seemed certain to be going
begging--and thus might be ready to deal.</TE>
<TE>   But the results of my search for deals were as mixed as a good mai
tai. On Waikiki it was a wide-open playing field for bargain hunters.
But on the Big Island and Maui, hotels were generally reluctant to
haggle, although they were amenable to selling me a nicer room at a
discounted price.</TE>
<TE>   I got ocean-view or partial ocean-view rooms in the three hotels
where I stayed during my five-day scouting trip at deep
discounts--about two-thirds of the brochure rate at Waikiki's
pink-painted Royal Hawaiian on Oahu and the Outrigger Waikoloa Beach
on the Big Island, and half off at the Hyatt Regency Maui.</TE>
<TE>   But other places wouldn't budge. The price was the price. Period.</TE>
<TE>   To compare rates before I left on the trip, I tracked prices at
about a dozen hotels on Waikiki Beach on Oahu, on the Big Island and
on Maui, Hawaii's three most visited islands. I checked Web sites,
contacted travel agents and called the hotels' toll-free reservations
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Dec. 16, I flew to Hawaii to see whether the prices would
come down further if I showed up in person. Granted, only adventurers
travel without reservations, but I've snagged good deals that way in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Success was not assured. I was traveling just before the holidays,
when rates all over Hawaii go up. Furthermore, Kimberly Grant, author
of "Best Places to Stay Hawaii" (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), told me
that Hawaiian hotels aren't set up to bargain with walk-ins.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the "rate integrity" factor.</TE>
<TE>   "Rate integrity" means that a hotel quotes the same prices whether
guests call an 800 reservations line, contact the hotel directly or
show up at the front desk.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last five years, hotels probably did maintain some rate
integrity because times were so good. They could establish rates and
pretty much hold them," says Harvey Chipkin, a New Jersey-based hotel
industry expert. "Now, even though times are bad, chains are trying
to hold rates because the common wisdom is that if you heavily
discount, guests won't pay the freight when the rates go up again."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, hotels don't want guests to start expecting low
prices, so many resist cutting rates across the board.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, experts say that front-desk personnel sometimes have
authority to offer deals to walk-in customers, especially if it's
late in the day and rooms are still empty. But it's unrealistic to
expect you'll get a $250 room for $50. Moreover, if you try what I
did, you may be quoted rates that are different from those I got.
That's because prices are affected by a variety of factors, such as
occupancy and the time of year you visit.</TE>
<TE>   But I did find walk-in wiggle room on prices, especially in
Waikiki. And even when desk clerks wouldn't come down on rates, they
were often willing to upgrade me to a higher accommodation
category--an ocean or partial ocean view--for the price of a standard
double, which usually has less desirable vistas, called, variously,
"garden," "terrace," "mountain," "city" or "golf view" rooms. (See
related story.)</TE>
<TE>   Here's an island-by-island breakdown:</TE>
<TE>   Waikiki</TE>
<TE>   More than 4 million people visit Oahu each year, mostly heading to
the fabled crescent beach at Waikiki. Japanese tourists favor Waikiki
especially, accounting for half of the visitors here, and that's bad
news for the tourism industry. "Japanese arrivals were down 50% in
September and October," says Rick Humphreys, executive director of
the Hawaii Tourism Authority.</TE>
<TE>   So Southern Californians who think of Maui or Kauai when planning
trips to Hawaii may want to set their sights on Waikiki. As soon as I
got here, I started finding deals.</TE>
<TE>   From a phone booth at the Honolulu airport, I called my chief
targets: the Sheraton Moana Surf- rider (one of four Sheratons in
Waikiki), Royal Hawaiian, Hilton Hawaiian Village and Halekulani. At
two of the four resorts, the rates I was quoted in those airport
calls were lower than the lowest I found in my pre-trip research.</TE>
<TE>   The most enticing was a garden-view room in the historic section
of the 528-room Royal Hawaiian, a pink bauble of a hotel that opened
in 1927. The rate was $195, compared with $272 when I called the
reservations line from home and the $420 brochure rate.</TE>
<TE>   I then rented a car at the airport and drove to Waikiki, where I
started at the 2,998-room Hilton Hawaiian Village. But the front-desk
personnel wouldn't bargain, a pattern I found in both Hiltons I
visited in the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Just down Waikiki, however, the marble-lined lobby of the posh
456-room Halekulani was as empty as a beach at red tide, though when
I walked up, the price for a standard garden-view double was holding
at $275, the rate I was offered on the phone from the airport.</TE>
<TE>   So I had lunch, then tried the front desk again. This time I got a
tall, amiable young man named Asa. I felt compelled by the elegance
of the place to explain my unexpected arrival. I had been on a
business trip in the islands, I said, and, on the spur of the moment,
had decided to stay two extra nights. (I told such fibs on several
occasions because it's unusual for a person to show up in the lobby
of a luxury hotel asking for accommodations for the same night, and I
didn't want staffers to know I was a reporter. I also dressed nicely
to further discourage hotel personnel from thinking I was riffraff.)</TE>
<TE>   At the Halekulani, I probably didn't need the white lie because
Asa seemed happy to see me. While he showed me a $275 garden-view
room and a $360 partial ocean-view room on the third floor, both with
large, gorgeous baths, we chatted about his impending graduation from
the University of Hawaii. I guess that broke the ice. On the way
downstairs, he said he thought he could get the partial ocean-view
room for $275, with an extended checkout time, though he had to check
with his manager.</TE>
<TE>   I almost booked it, but I needed to see what was up at the
793-room Sheraton Moana Surfrider, a handsome, century-old hotel with
a modern tower. The front-desk clerks there wore graceful gowns but
weren't inclined to dicker over prices; the rates I was offered were
the same as those I had been quoted at the airport phone booth. I
looked at rooms in the older Banyan wing for $172 (city view) and
$273 (ocean side), which were small but had pretty Hawaiian quilts on
the beds. Then I summoned my courage and asked to see the manager.</TE>
<TE>   He was a polite if harried man who offered me the same rates as
the clerk, though he said he might be able to give me a room with a
partial ocean view in the tower for $228 (worth $460, according to
the rate sheet). It was huge and fresh looking, although the
furnishings were rather bland.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the front desk, the manager fielded a phone call--from a
hotel guest, I gathered--while talking to me. I heard him say, "No,
sir. I would if I could. But $100 for a suite is just too low.
There's only so much we can do. You're already in a very nice room."</TE>
<TE>   I might have taken the $228 tower room if I hadn't heard that, but
clearly the guest was getting a better rate than I had been offered.
And--talk about chutzpah!--now he wanted a suite for $100.</TE>
<TE>   The sun was setting, and I needed to make a decision. So I went to
the Royal Hawaiian, where the lowest rate was still $195. I all but
twisted the desk clerk's arm to upgrade me to an ocean-view room on
the second floor of the historic section (priced at $273 when I
walked in and $575 on the rate card). No. 283 had a king-sized canopy
bed, plush towels, sheets and robes--all in pink--and a window that
overlooked a roof, mostly. Never mind. The Royal Hawaiian is still
the prettiest thing on Waikiki Beach, and when I checked in I got a
fresh orchid lei.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I found more bargains at modest hotels (none with
pools) I hadn't priced before leaving. At the 79-room Aston Waikiki
Beachside Hotel, across the street from the sand, I could have gotten
a cozily decorated but windowless room for $75 as a walk-in versus
$205 on the rate sheet.</TE>
<TE>   At the far east end of Waikiki, the 124-room New Otani Kaimana
Beach Hotel had a standard room with a little lanai and a Motel 6
feeling to offer to walk-ins like me for $99 (regularly $138 for low
season).</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, discounts were to be had on Waikiki at all price levels.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Island</TE>
<TE>   When I reached the Kona airport on the west coast of the Big
Island, a man at the visitor information desk told me to go to the
Kailua/Kona area if I wanted a bargain. He even wrote the names and
phone numbers of three places where he was sure I could get a deal.
As I walked away, he cried out, "Remember, ask for oceanfront!"</TE>
<TE>   But I had my heart set on the Kohala Coast, north of the airport
and lined with a handful of Hawaii's dreamiest resorts, including the
243-room Hualalai Four Seasons.</TE>
<TE>   When I called from the airport, a reservations agent told me the
hotel was fully booked. And as a walk-in, I got a positively frosty
reception. When I arrived at the front desk and asked for a room for
the next two nights, the clerk said the resort did not take same-day
reservations for "security reasons," as though I were carrying
explosives or planning to sit at the bar singing "Ten Cents a Dance."</TE>
<TE>   I pressed, asking whether I could get a room for the next night
and whether a room would have been available for that night if I had
called the previous day. Both would have been available, at the
brochure rate of $475 to $500.</TE>
<TE>   Then I asked to speak with a manager, who told me the clerk was
mistaken about "security concerns." Instead, she said, the hotel was
full.</TE>
<TE>   When I pointed out that I had been told space was available, she
said the hotel didn't always fill all the rooms during busy times so
it wouldn't put too much pressure on guest services like laundry. It
didn't make sense to me, and by this time I was hungry, though
disinclined to stay there even for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   I moved on to the rambling 1,240-room Hilton Waikoloa Village,
with its dolphin pool and tram; the 539-room Orchid at Mauna Lani, a
Starwood hotel; and the 310-room Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, built around
1960 by Laurance S. Rockefeller as part of the Rockresorts chain.</TE>
<TE>   No great bargains here; the rates at all three were about the same
as what I uncovered in my pre-trip research.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mauna Kea, manager Alvin Oshiro told me rates dropped after
Sept. 11 but then went back up. "We have lots of longtime returnees,"
he said. "We don't want them to think others paid less."</TE>
<TE>   Still without a place to stay, I stopped at the 545-room Outrigger
Waikoloa Beach, which wasn't on my list but looked good from the
road. Renovated two years ago and now the flagship of the Outrigger
chain, it had fresh if not particularly stylish rooms, with lanais.
And it was offering discounts.</TE>
<TE>   The desk clerk was a real pro. First she offered me a standard
garden-view room for $133 (brochure rate $315), then an oceanfront
room for $163 (regularly $485). I meant to take the cheaper of the
two. But the clerk encouraged me to look at the other, which hooked
me the minute I saw its sweeping view of the pool, lagoon and ocean,
wrapped in gardens and flanked by lava flows.</TE>
<TE>   While the Outrigger wasn't as luxurious a resort as the others I
checked in Kohala, it struck me as a good deal, even at full price. I
also liked the room I saw at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, but the
more expensive places didn't seem in the mood to make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Maui</TE>
<TE>   On Maui, the signs were inauspicious from the start. If I hadn't
reserved a rental car, I wouldn't have been able to get one. The
traffic around the Kahului airport was heavy, and at the Westin and
Marriott in Kaanapali on the island's west coast, long lines of
guests waited to check in.</TE>
<TE>   I also tried the Hyatt in Kaanapali, a smashing 815-room resort in
three buildings that surround gardens so lushly tropical you almost
wish you had a machete. There I was offered a terrace room with big
mirrors, fetching prints and lamps, a plump, inviting bed and
Southeast Asian-inspired furniture for $230 (regularly $300, though
the rate increased to $350 just after I was there).</TE>
<TE>   I ultimately stayed at the Hyatt (upgraded to partial ocean view
for the same price) because my quest for other hotel bargains on Maui
didn't get me far. There wasn't much give on rates at the Grand
Wailea Resort or the Renaissance Wailea Beach Resort on the eastern
part of the island or at places up the west coast from Kaanapali,
like the Napili Kai Beach Resort and the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua.</TE>
<TE>   An emperor's palace of a hotel, surrounded by a golf course, on
the heights above the rugged Kapalua coast, the Ritz-Carlton seemed
about as forbidding to walk-ins as the Four Seasons on the Big
Island. A businesslike clerk let me look at a handsome garden room
for $325. When I asked if there was any flex on the price, she said
no, in a tone that brooked no discussion. But then she said an
American Express cardholder's special rate of $265 might be offered
if I called the Ritz-Carlton toll-free reservations line. It was
available, and I would have taken the room if I hadn't already
decided on the Hyatt.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I had a drink at the Ritz-Carlton, thinking that the
clerk's tip was the kind of gesture that turns comparison shoppers
into repeat customers.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I'd had time to do some snorkeling, but I decided that
hunting for hotel bargains in Hawaii is its own kind of fun.</TE>

<HD>Descriptions of Views Don't Always Mean the Same Thing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever check into a pricey "ocean-view" room from which you could see
the sea only by hanging precariously over the balcony railing? Or a
"partial ocean-view" room with a window mostly overlooking the roof?
Or a "city-view room" with fine vistas of a parking lot?</LD>
<LD>   Never mind what's actually in the room; the degree to which you
can see the water is mainly what decrees the price of a Hawaii hotel
room, although even those classifications can be subjective. So
unless you have already been to a hotel or resort and know precisely
which room you want, you don't always get the view you hope you'll be
paying for.</LD>
<LD>   At the Royal Hawaiian I took a "historic ocean" room (brochure
rate $575) instead of a "historic garden" room (brochure rate $420)
because both were offered to me for the same price ($195). In the
end, I wished I had chosen the "historic garden" because the view
from my window in the "historic ocean" was mostly roof, while the
garden room overlooked the pretty back lawn.</LD>
<TE>   Designating room categories at the Hyatt Regency Maui is a little
more scientific: Water makes up at least 20% of the view from
"partial ocean-view" rooms. At least 50% of the view in an
"ocean-view" room is water.</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, less expensive rooms without ocean views usually are
named for the feature they overlook: a golf course, mountainside,
lagoon, terrace, garden or cityscape.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the categories aren't hard and fast. A garden room I saw in
the Alii Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki had a
partial ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how to get the room with the view you want:</TE>
<TE>   * When you make a reservation, quiz the agent about what you'll
see from the window or lanai of a room in the category you're
discussing.</TE>
<TE>   * Request the highest floor possible.</TE>
<TE>   * When you check in, make sure the front-desk clerk knows that the
view is important to you. Ask to inspect several options if possible.</TE>
<TE>   * If you end up in a room without the view you expected, don't
unpack. Return to the front desk and discuss the problem, calmly and
rationally.</TE>
<TE>   Most people are reluctant to complain. But remember, if you don't
ask for something better, you won't get it.</TE>

<HD>Auto Rental Agencies Roll Out the Rate Hikes</HD>
<DH>As the industry sputtered in 2001, competition for consumer
dollars drove prices unsustainably low. Corrections are underway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're feeling sticker shock at the car rental counter, it's not
just your imagination. Rates have gone up in the last few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Last month Hertz raised its weekly rates by 26% and daily rates by
10%, on average, it says. And on Friday it increased weekend rentals
by an average of 14%. Several competitors, including Avis and Dollar,
have also revved up rates. Some experts say consumers should expect
another, more modest increase in the spring.</LD>
<LD>   These may seem like odd moves given the post-Sept. 11 slump in
travel. Business is down, so rates should be down, right? But pricing
a car rental is more complicated than that--way more complicated,
which can be frustrating for customers trying to find a deal.</LD>
<TE>   "We probably change between 50,000 and 100,000 rates per day,"
says Jay Foley, executive vice president of operations at Tulsa-based
Dollar Rent A Car Systems Inc., which operates about 4,600 rental
sites in the U.S. and Canada. Like airlines, much of the industry
practices a fluid "yield management" system, changing prices moment
by moment according to demand.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, rental companies "change their rates probably more than
the airlines do," says John LeSage, vice president and director of
research for Abrams Travel Data Services in Long Beach, which
collects data on the industry. Unlike airlines, which basically have
three types of products to sell (coach, first class and business
seats), rental car companies have classes of cars, plus different
rates for rentals by the day, week or weekend in different locations,
he notes.</TE>
<TE>   The major chains do exert general control over rates, though. And
they have shared the same fate in the last year: Business has been
sputtering, and the slowdown began long before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, by many estimates, business travel began to decline,
and car rental companies soon began price wars to woo leisure
customers. As a result, average rates shifted into reverse after
increasing, by LeSage's estimate, 2% to 5% per year since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The downturn varied by city. In Seattle, hurt by the dot-com
crash, the average weekly rate--the one most leisure travelers care
about--dropped 35%, from $245.15 to $159.03, between July 2000 and
July 2001, according to Auto Rental News, a trade publication. (The
Torrance-based bimonthly bases the weekly rate on an economy car with
unlimited mileage.) Others in the 10-city survey fared better
(Chicago's rates were down 8.5%, for instance), and rates dropped in
all but one (Phoenix, up 4.2%) in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Although the attacks brought a brief spurt in one-way rentals by
stranded or plane-shy travelers, demand and rates soon dropped
further, especially at airport outlets, where companies such as Hertz
and Dollar typically conduct 90% or more of their business. (A
notable exception is Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co., which gets only about
5% of its revenue from airport sites. "Our business has been more
than holding its own," says spokesman Pat Ferrell.)</TE>
<TE>   Rental companies, which had begun to cut back their fleets,
accelerated the process, and fleets are down 20% to 25% from a year
ago, says Neil Abrams, president of New York-based Abrams Consulting
Group, the parent company of Abrams Travel Data Services.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, business has started to pick up again, although as of
late December it was still below pre-Sept. 11 levels, says Hertz
spokeswoman Paula Stifter.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the demand is probably greater than the supply," Abrams
says. And when demand rises and supplies fall, prices increase,
experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   Stifter sees some other forces pushing up rates too. Besides the
usual increase in new car prices and repair and labor costs, rental
companies are getting less for the used cars they sell when they cut
their fleets. The reason: a glut in the used-car market.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's pain is real. In November, ANC Rental Corp., parent
company of Alamo and National car rental companies, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Rates were "irrationally low" in the last few months, says Avis
spokesman Ted Deutsch. That "may seem great for consumers, but it was
not sustainable," he says, citing ANC's problems as evidence. And
even with the increases, rates in December were generally lower than
in December 2000, several experts note.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch contends that a car rental is still a good deal. "You're
getting hold of a $25,000 or $30,000 asset at rates that are
sometimes $30 or $35 per day"--less than renting a tuxedo, he notes.
(In case you wondered: A randomly chosen Gingiss Formalwear in
Century City earlier this month quoted $49 to $99 per day for a
tuxedo rental, depending on the style, not including vest and shoes.)</TE>
<TE>   To drive the best bargain, "it can make a huge difference" to go
online, suggests Cathy Stephens, executive editor of Auto Rental
News.</TE>
<TE>   LeSage agrees and suggests contacting travel agents about buying
air-hotel packages that include car rentals. "Often the rental car
will be thrown in ... at a really good rate," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, renting a car in a neighborhood location instead of at
the airport is a better deal because extra taxes and fees usually
apply to cars rented at airports, experts say. But for a while you
may do better at airports because that's where business has fallen
off most, LeSage says.</TE>
<TE>   Just be sure to ask for the total charge, with all taxes and fees,
to accurately compare airport and non-airport rentals.
Airport-related fees, plus state and local taxes, can add 25% or more
to the cost of a rental. And this year a new California law allows
airports to assess a "customer facility charge" to develop and
maintain rental car centers. On Jan. 1 Ontario (Calif.) International
Airport began charging the fee, at $6 to $10 per rental.</TE>

<HD>Minneapolis' Cold Comforts</HD>
<DH>When winter weather gets frightful, the city's residents
head for the 'in' places.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HAINES</AU>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>MINNEAPOLIS -- It was like Las Vegas without gambling; New Orleans
without gumbo; San Francisco without cable cars. December in
Minneapolis without snow?</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to some weather weirdness, our December trip to Minnesota
lacked the vital ingredient. Ultimately that didn't last, and by late
last month the Great Cosmic Auditor had balanced the meteorological
books. The nighttime temperatures were falling below zero, and snow
flurries were in the air. But we were gone by then.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota is that coffeepot-shaped state at the top of the
Mississippi River. For people like me, born and raised in the Land of
10,000 Lakes and 100,000 ice-fishing houses, crummy weather defines
who we are. Today's Minneapolis has an international image of
Scandinavian-American efficiency and sometimes even hipness. But when
I left there in 1971 and would tell people where I came from, I'd get
a stare, followed by, "Gets cold up there, I bet."</LD>
<TE>   Ya, sure. We are Minnesotans: the Cold, the Proud.</TE>
<TE>   We congratulate ourselves, believing that frigid, snowy weather
builds character. Snow is part of our identity, like the Mississippi
River that slices through Minneapolis, jokes about the state
legislature, Gov. Jesse Ventura and tuna-noodle casserole in the
Lutheran church basement.</TE>
<TE>   What if you don't do cold? Well, confidentially, lots of
Minneapolitans don't either. But if they can't pack up the RV and
stay in Tucson until the spring thaw, they find lots of fun things to
do in Minneapolis' great indoors.</TE>
<TE>   When my wife, Janice, and I looked out the window of our
descending airplane and saw grassy lawns and unfrozen lakes on a
December afternoon, we panicked. How would we cope without adversity?</TE>
<TE>   We managed. We revisited all those Minneapolis delights that are
comfortably under roof. The cross-country skiing, ice fishing and all
of Minnesota's other outdoor winter sports would have to wait for
another visit.</TE>
<TE>   A favorite indoor refuge is the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,
just a snowball's throw from downtown. Its brochure claims, in
language readily understood by us farm kids, that it has eight acres
of galleries. In those indoor fields the seeds of art appreciation
germinate and are nurtured. It's where I saw my first Van Gogh (his
"Olive Trees") and Cezanne (his "Chestnut Trees").</TE>
<TE>   One of the most beautiful images we could see within a frame,
however, was the view through the institute's north windows toward
downtown Minneapolis. Particularly after winter's 4:30 p.m. sunset,
Minneapolis is a rich picture. The office towers are lighted, and the
steamy plumes from their heating plants snake across the sky.</TE>
<TE>   The IDS Center, designed by Philip Johnson, John Burgee and Ed
Baker, is the tallest building in the group, but the I.M. Pei US Bank
Place is the most striking, although from some angles it resembles a
giant electric pepper mill. Cesar Pelli's Norwest Center shows sturdy
grace.</TE>
<TE>   We also made our annual pilgrimage to the Walker Art Center. There
has been a Walker for 100 years, although its present structure dates
only to 1971. On the western edge of downtown, the Walker is probably
best known for Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen's giant,
whimsical spoon and maraschino cherry ("Spoonbridge and Cherry") in
its adjacent sculpture garden.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, its contemporary contents constantly challenge one's
assumptions of what art is or was, and cross boundaries between
visual and performing arts. It is the kind of place where works of
art might incorporate a refrigeration unit (by Pier Paolo Calzolari)
that keeps a coat of frost on the work's metal surface or a head of
lettuce (by Giovanni Anselmo) that decomposes, both part of an
exhibit called "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera 1962-1972." The only
thing I can say with certainty about the Walker is that by the time
you go there, it will be different.</TE>
<TE>   If it all seems a bit heady, I have just the place for you. Across
the Mississippi by St. Anthony Falls, the 25-foot natural hydraulic
engine that gave birth to Minneapolis as a logging and milling town
in the mid-19th century, is the Museum of Questionable Medical
Devices. Its curators have assembled dozens of gizmos, many of them
seized by the Food and Drug Administration, that promised to enlarge
whatever was too small, reduce whatever was too big or otherwise cure
whatever ailed you, from heart disease to snakebite. From the
bloodletting devices of the 1790s to the "immortality rings" of last
year, every device there but one is a failure.</TE>
<TE>   The exception is a shoe store X-ray machine that performed all too
well in irradiating kids' feet. A highlight in every "modern" shoe
store of the 1950s, it was intended to show whether a child's foot
fit appropriately into the shoes Mom and Dad had selected.
Unfortunately, it did so with a fluoroscope, and, while it was fun to
see the tot's toes wiggling inside back-to-school oxfords, the kid
was also getting a harmful dose of X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   I sat under the hood of the phrenology machine and had my
personality assessed. Phrenology is the science of determining a
person's character from the lumps and bumps on his head. From the
shape of mine the mechanized doctor of phrenology determined that I
am deficient in "acquisitiveness," meaning, I guess, that I should
shop more.</TE>
<TE>   We were in the right place. Shopping malls seem so essential to
American life that one forgets that they've been with us less than 50
years. It was in 1956, in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina, that
Southdale Center, the country's first indoor shopping mall, began
life. Minnesota weather. Indoor shopping. It's hard to imagine a more
natural fit.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis (or to be more specific, its southern suburb,
Bloomington) also is the home of the largest indoor shopping mall in
the nation. Southdale is still active, but the
4.2-million-square-foot Mall of America is a tourist destination in
its own right. It claims to get 43 million visitors annually--more
than Disney World, Graceland and the Grand Canyon combined. By
comparison, the 3-million-square-foot South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa
gets 20 million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   The mall seems to have at least one example of every national
chain (Nordstrom, United Colors of Benetton, the Sharper Image), plus
some uniquely local shops (Lake Wobegon USA, Al's Farm Toys)--in
total more than 500 stores. And it has an amusement park, Camp
Snoopy, which boasts a roller coaster, a waterfall ride and 400 live
trees, all indoors. As some indication of the size of the mall, Camp
Snoopy's seven acres accounts for only 10% of the mall's indoor area.</TE>
<TE>   Janice and I strolled along this indoor Main Street, getting lost.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Minneapolis is turning into a big mall itself. One may
work, shop, dine, go to Mass at St. Olaf Roman Catholic Church,
attend a Minnesota Timberwolves pro basketball game at Target Center
and return to one's condo without ever setting foot outside.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis has linked its major downtown buildings through what
is now a five-mile network of elevated, glass-enclosed walkways at
the second-floor level. Whenever a new building is erected in the
downtown, it is virtually assured that it will be connected to
others. Shopping downtown in winter no longer requires us to don
mittens, boots, scarf and big furry hat, dash through the slush to
the store on the other side of the street, and then take everything
back off lest we die of heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Janice and I placidly crossed above the traffic, enjoying
the 70-degree indoor climate. Neiman-Marcus, Saks, Marshall Field's
and hundreds of small shops all may be visited without exposure to
the elements. It was so easy I worried that we hadn't really earned
any bargains we might find.</TE>
<TE>   Snow or not, December in Minnesota prompts some kind of
hibernation instinct to add a layer of fat, so I insisted we go to
Al's Breakfast, a diner on the northern edge of the huge University
of Minnesota East Bank Minneapolis campus. It serves only breakfast
and only to 14 fortunate diners at a time.</TE>
<TE>   It began life in an alley 50 years ago as a slapped-together shed
hardly bigger than a modest ice-fishing house. But beginning at 9
a.m. Sundays, 14 people will be sitting on the stools at its worn
counter, 14 more will be waiting to pounce on the first opening, and
still more will be standing in a line that spills out the front door
and down the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, the attractions are the blueberry pancakes or the
bacon waffle, but we went there for the ambience. As usual, Al's was
filled with neighborhood folks, musicians, permanent grad students
and anyone who likes breakfast dishes whose names are spelled without
a "Mc" in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Grina, the man behind the smoke and the spattering fat at the
grill, traded insults with the customers, the waiters and the unseen
omelet chef in the kitchen somewhere in the back. It's a tradition
that started with Al Bergstrom, for 23 years the owner and
wisecracking grill captain. Janice and I have been going to Al's
since grad school days, years ago. As usual, we ate the fabled
blueberry-walnut pancakes ("wally blues") and corned beef hash with
poached eggs. We have to try hard to spend $15 there for the two of
us--and we're good tippers. On the other end of the dining scale,
downtown Minneapolis has restaurants where the ambience and cooking
talent match the wallet-lightening prices on the menu. We ate that
evening at D'Amico Cucina in Butler Square, a refurbished warehouse
near the Target Center with a vast beamed atrium.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoying a succession of exquisite Italian-inspired dishes from
the chef's tasting menu--including sea bass delicately cooked in duck
fat, lobster ravioli and little beefsteaks with marrow flan--we
momentarily forgot that we were in the land of tuna-noodle surprise.</TE>
<TE>   But a few blocks away in the IDS Center is Aquavit, a nouvelle
Swedish-American restaurant with a chef who comes from Ethiopia by
way of Goteborg, Sweden. Marcus Samuelsson has received a host of
accolades, including the James Beard Foundation's highest "Rising
Star Chef" honors in 1999. There is no tuna-noodle surprise on
Samuelsson's menu either, but there is herring, in various modes and
marinades. The kitchen staff has a deft touch with, for example,
tandoori smoked salmon and wasabi creme fraiche, but really they show
what can be done with a fish that usually gets no respect.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such encroachments from foreign cuisines and superstar
chefs, it remains possible to eat a traditional,
who-cares-about-cholesterol meal in the city. To get a taste of
Minneapolis as it was 50 years ago, we went the next night to
Murray's on 6th Street. The home of the "Silver Butterknife" steak,
so named because of its tenderness, Murray's looks like it probably
did the night it opened in 1946. The draperies and the chandeliers
made me think we were on the set of a 1940s movie. I was pleased to
see that Murray's has changed only slightly.</TE>
<TE>   That butterknife steak (a strip sirloin built for two) was still
perfection and huge: We barely touched the au gratin potatoes that
came with it. The garlic toast was buttery, hot and crisp; the slab
of raspberry pie was as great as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, even though the weather was too nice for it, we continued
a personal tradition. Before our son was born, Janice and I used to
walk or bike along the banks of the Mississippi. Those are still the
best ways to see the river if you want a relaxed view of the Father
of Waters while getting an authentic nip at your nose, but our flight
would be departing soon, so we drove.</TE>
<TE>   The water freezes in winter, and the river then resembles a broad
white ribbon. Janice and I used to talk here of our future. Jobs and
colleges and other things that seemed important at the time took us
from Minneapolis. I sometimes comment wistfully about the city to
colleagues who respond, "It's so cold and snowy there."</TE>
<TE>   And now I think, sometimes. But not if you can always stay inside.</TE>

<LD>Is there a plan in the universe, or do things just happen?
Philosophers and physicists have long pondered this question. But now
I know the answer.</LD>
<LD>   It came to me last month as I waited to board a United Airlines
flight at Kahului Airport on Maui. I had a seat assignment in coach,
where I always fly. My boarding pass was in hand, and my mind was on
mundane matters, like whether my houseplants had died while I was
away.</LD>
<LD>   Then it happened.</LD>
<TE>   A voice on the public address system summoned me to the counter.</TE>
<TE>   A thousand things flew through my mind. I was being bumped, which
seemed unlikely because there were only about 40 people waiting to
board the 757, with seats for 182. Or I had left my laptop in the
restroom. Or something.</TE>
<TE>   "You are getting a complimentary upgrade," the counter agent said.</TE>
<TE>   My jaw dropped. "You mean to business class?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, first class," she replied.</TE>
<TE>   "This has never happened to me," I said. "Why are you doing this?"
(Of course I had not said I was a reporter.)</TE>
<TE>   She smiled and said, "Well, you don't have to take it if you don't
want."</TE>
<TE>   Great Jones! Of course I wanted it. First class. Imagine. On my
honeymoon, my husband and I were moved up to premium economy seats
from coach on a Virgin Atlantic flight from New York to London, but
that was back in the dark ages. And once, on a TWA flight from St.
Louis to L.A., I was assigned to a big seat by chance, because the
airline was reconfiguring and hadn't gotten around to replacing the
plane's business class seats with narrower coach seats. Still, I
didn't get any of the other perks--the hot towels, free cocktails,
lavish meals--that usually go with business class.</TE>
<TE>   In first class on the Maui-L.A. flight, I got it all, beginning
with a seat 201/2 inches wide, with 38 inches of pitch (the distance
between seats, in the upright position). It was bliss out of the blue
compared with a coach seat on the Boeing 757, with a width of 17
inches and pitch of 31 inches. I had an adjustable head support, a
wide armrest and three pouches on the seat back in front of me,
including one for eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Before takeoff, a flight attendant came by with guava juice and
champagne. The menu offered a choice of three entrees: macadamia
nut-crusted chicken breast, grilled filet mignon or crab cakes. I
ordered a scotch and soda with a twist, and when it came the flight
attendant said she would bring more scotch if the drink didn't suit
me. Dinner--the crab cakes--was served on white napery, with real
metal utensils and darling miniature salt and pepper shakers. And the
hot towels on departure and arrival made me feel as fresh as a
plumeria. It's the little things that separate first class from the
unwashed masses.</TE>
<TE>   Never in a million years, however, would I have paid for a
first-class fare just for the crab cakes and hot towels. A
first-class seat on the Maui-L.A. United flight costs $2,501, while
the lowest restricted coach fare is $464.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Perkins, former consumer advocate for the American Society of
Travel Agents, said I was lucky to get the upgrade. "There are always
more people eligible for upgrades and wanting them than there is
space available," he says. Airline experts say that few people in
first class actually pay the first-class fare; most are high-level
members of frequent-flier clubs who have paid a full coach or
business class fare and know how to work the upgrade ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, dressing nicely and asking sweetly for an
upgrade at the gate got you into first or business class from coach.
"Gate agents used to have more authority to upgrade," Perkins says.
"Now frequent-flier programs have systematized upgrades."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's disagreement about whether charm, good looks and
bribes can get coach passengers into first or business class. Rudy
Maxa, a Washington, D.C.-based travel expert, got an upgrade on a
flight from Paris to Washington by giving the crew a chocolate
gateau. He told them he and his companion were on diets and couldn't
eat it. To get this kind of upgrade, Maxa says, "you've got to act
like you're pure of heart."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not a good enough actress to get an upgrade this way. On the
Maui-L.A. flight, I got mine because I had recently accrued enough
miles to graduate from the airline's basic Mileage Plus
frequent-flier program to Premier status, which requires travelers to
rack up 25,000 miles or 30 paid flight segments in a year. In
appreciation for my loyalty, I was given, among other things, the
promise of four upgrades, each valid for a 500-mile flight (hence a
2,000-mile flight requires four upgrades), on trips within North
America for every 10,000 miles I fly. I also get a chance to travel
in an Economy Plus seat. Those seats make up the first six to 11 rows
in United's coach sections, offer up to 5 inches extra pitch and are
available to Premier Mileage Plus members on a first-come,
first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   After my Maui-L.A. windfall, I called United to find out why I had
been so blessed. Spokeswoman Chris Nardella said the airline was
reluctant to reveal guidelines on how and why people get
complimentary upgrades because they might start expecting them. "It
all depends on the operational day and the loads on a plane,"
Nardella said.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, though, it also depends on whether you're a frequent
flier with a full-fare coach ticket. Airlines use upgrades to reward
loyal customers.</TE>
<TE>   So if you want an upgrade, dress well and be nice. But also travel
enough with an airline to achieve elite frequent-flier status,
because the airline universe really does have a plan.</TE>

<HD>Enron Way: Anything but 'Simple, Straightforward'</HD>
<DH>Hire fancy lawyers and accountants to tell you how to take
what you want to take.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Balzar</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The laws and rules that govern the securities industry in the United
States derive from a simple and a straightforward concept: All
investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should
have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to
buying it.</LD>
<LD>   I've been backgrounding myself in preparation for the juicy
investigations of Enron. The words, "simple and straightforward,"
caught my eye. They are contained in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's mission statement.</LD>
<LD>   Few things in life get so complicated so fast as federal
governance once the flacks and fixers weigh in.</LD>
<TE>   But I've found that if you dig a little, there is usually
something simple and straightforward about the way Americans mean to
govern themselves. For my own sake, I wanted to make sure I didn't
lose sight of this salient fact in the donnybrook that's now started.</TE>
<TE>   How did the Enron collapse happen?</TE>
<TE>   Simple. Enron did not live up to the intent of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Straightforward. Enron is a public company and the laws that
direct public companies are unmistakable in their objective. They
begin with the Securities Act of 1933, which established the SEC to
be the nation's first line of defense against shady dealing by
companies that sell shares to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The law says this:</TE>
<TE>   It shall be unlawful for any person ... to obtain money or
property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact ... to
engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.</TE>
<TE>   Hint: I think Congress meant that $586 million of overstated
earnings would be a "material fact."</TE>
<TE>   The other primary statute guiding the SEC is the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. It says investors must be given "reasonable
detail" about all of the company's business activities. And
"reasonable assurances" that accounting is supervised by management.</TE>
<TE>   The terms "reasonable assurances" and "reasonable detail" mean
such level of detail and degrees of assurance as would satisfy
prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Seems pretty straightforward to me. Congress meant for officers in
public companies to conduct themselves forthrightly and with common
sense.</TE>
<TE>   But I could be wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the CEO of Enron, I do not have a PhD in economics and
stacks of clippings telling me what a genius I am.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a platoon of lawyers to tell me that the purpose of
the securities laws is something else entirely. The president is not
beholden to me, the vice president does not slap me on the back and
welcome me into his office and I don't have cohorts scattered through
the executive branch or a national GOP chairman who is on retainer as
my strategic advisor.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have lapdogs in Congress to do my bidding. National energy
policy is not built on my say-so, to my specifications and with my
handpicked candidate at the controls.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general hasn't cashed my checks, the secretaries of
the Treasury and Commerce departments do not take my calls.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if I had all those things, I would see matters differently.
Who knows, I might even alter the conduct of my "own affairs" to
conform to the Enron model.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I would summon the family. Our finances are not nearly as
good as they might be, I could say.</TE>
<TE>   So, henceforth, Liisa and I will keep our bank account, our 401(k)
plans and our paychecks. As for the mortgage debt, the credit card
bills and the car payment? Those we move off the books into a limited
partnership of Nick and Nora, our two deadbeat cats.</TE>
<TE>   Then with my fancy new balance sheet, I would float loans all over
town. And I'd grant myself a fat bonus at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   If the scheme collapsed and people around me were left holding the
empty bag, I'd have my flunkies shred all the records and I'd hire
the slickest lawyers I could afford.</TE>
<TE>   As for the law? Hey, haven't you heard, this is the age of
deregulation. Never mind the law. I've got millions in the bank.</TE>

<HD>Historian Broke the Rules, but Is That So Bad?</HD>
<DH>Plagiarism is not synonymous with inaccuracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART P. GREEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent allegations against and admissions by historian Stephen
Ambrose concerning alleged plagiarism in two books, "The Wild Blue"
and "Crazy Horse and Custer," are a reminder of what a fluid and
murky concept plagiarism can be.</LD>
<LD>   In many of the questioned passages, Ambrose included footnotes to
the works on which he had relied. What he failed to do was indicate
when material was being directly quoted. In all likelihood, Ambrose
did not intend to deceive his readers into believing that the words
were his own. Rather, this prolific, bestselling and widely
celebrated author of about 30 history books seems to have been guilty
of more instances of sloppy note-taking than would be tolerated even
from a college freshman.</LD>
<LD>   Plagiarism, of course, is nothing new, although the
Internet--particularly Web sites such as www.cheater.com--and "cut
and paste" features of word processing programs seem to have made it
more of a temptation.</LD>
<TE>   Some scholars have suggested that the concept of plagiarism is no
older than that of "authorship," and that the idea of authorship, in
turn, owes its existence to legal protections for intellectual
property first enacted in the 18th century.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the idea that one has a moral obligation to cite one's
sources is certainly older than that, dating at least to the medieval
Talmudic text, Ethics of the Fathers, and allegations of plagiarism
brought by contemporaries of the 15th century Talmudic scholar Isaac
Abarbanel.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I sat on a university disciplinary committee hearing
charges of plagiarism against a student who had copied long passages
from various sources, often without quotation marks or footnotes. As
I listened to his rambling explanation of how he had gotten himself
into such a predicament, I felt a strange mix of contempt and
sympathy for what he had done.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that all of us are influenced by those who came before
us. None of us wholly invents the stories we tell, the metaphors we
use, or the theories we espouse. Almost every creative writer or
scholar feels, at one time or another, not only that he has been
given inadequate credit for his own ideas but that he himself might
have inadvertently failed to make proper attribution.</TE>
<TE>   If anything has been consistent in the history of plagiarism, it
is inconsistency. In the early 1980s, a young author named Jacob
Epstein had the bad judgment to plagiarize plot elements and
descriptive passages from a novel by Martin Amis. More recently,
Susan Sontag was alleged to have lifted various phrases from mostly
dead authors for her novel "In America."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein was skewered by Amis in a scathing rebuttal that
essentially ended his novel-writing career. Sontag was given a
national book prize. Meanwhile, the hapless student plagiarist on
whose disciplinary committee I sat was denied his degree and asked to
leave the university.</TE>
<TE>   So what to make of Ambrose's numerous lapses? Surely, he did a
great disservice to the writers on whose work he improperly relied,
and his practices cast serious doubt on his integrity as a scholar.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose's fellow historians have a right to censure him. On the
other hand, Ambrose is a beloved figure whose numerous books have
brought history alive to many thousands of ordinary readers. No one
has claimed that his books are inaccurate or that they cannot still
be a source of pleasure and edification. He did, after all,
apologize.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, Ambrose will certainly be more conscientious in his
research and writing. And, in a few months, I suspect, whatever it is
exactly that he did wrong will be all but forgotten.</TE>

<HD>Fighting the 'Attack on All' Alone</HD>
<DH>Only Britain has stepped up. We need more help for phase
two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT E. HUNTER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last September, President Bush called the war on terrorism
"civilization's fight." However, the United States has mounted the
overwhelming bulk of the outside world's effort in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Among close allies, only Britain has been substantially engaged.
Even the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which for the first time
invoked its formal provision that recognizes "an attack on one is an
attack on all," has essentially watched from the sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   But for the ongoing campaign, the United States will need major
support from other nations. Before the Afghan phase of the war
concludes, the United States should create a global anti-terrorism
coordinating committee to marshal efforts on the many individual
steps needed to undercut terrorism's reach.</LD>
<TE>   There has been a consensus about the search for Osama bin Laden,
the elimination of the Al Qaeda network and the punishment of the
Taliban regime that harbored members of it. But beyond that, there's
little agreement, not even on the definition of "terrorism with a
global reach," much less on what to do about it.</TE>
<TE>   Many Europeans especially worry that the Bush administration has
Iraq in its sights, and they are fearful both about the military
costs and the diplomatic consequences throughout the region and with
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue for a primary focus on Middle East terrorism's
political support structure, which they believe to be a combination
of economic and social backwardness, unreformed regimes, and--in
particular--the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Differences with the allies might not matter if the U.S. could
continue largely to go it alone. But except for the use of military
power in backward places such as Somalia and Sudan, the active
support of friends and allies will now become critical, especially to
trammel the ability of terrorists to operate around the world.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Bush understood this: "We will ask, and we
will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services and
banking systems around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Many countries responded, including those in the European Union,
which committed its members to act in areas of transport security,
police and judicial cooperation, denial of financing of terrorism,
border controls and export controls related to nonproliferation.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. leadership, a good deal has been achieved, but support
has been far from uniform or consistent.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, we need a systematic means whereby the U.S. and its key
allies can agree on an overall political strategy for the war on
terrorism: definitions, sources and quality of threats, means for
opposing them and the contributions to be made by different countries
under different circumstances--what Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld has called ''multiple coalitions.''</TE>
<TE>   Realistically, however, differences of viewpoint will make
reaching such an agreement difficult if not impossible. That is why
another approach is needed, and is likely to be more successful.</TE>
<TE>   What we need is an agreement, a process and a bureaucracy to
coordinate efforts in intelligence, finance, police, extradition,
border controls and other bread-and-butter matters of stifling the
capacity of terrorists to act.</TE>
<TE>   There is useful precedent. During the Cold War, the NATO allies
saw the need to keep the Soviet Union and its allies from gaining
access to sensitive exports that could be diverted to military uses,
but each nation had its own criteria and procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, from 1950 to 1994, 17 allied countries, including Japan and
Australia, banded together in a Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Security Controls, or COCOM, to set the necessary
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Operating out of public view, by and large it worked, mainly
because the group took the politics out of each individual decision,
created a bureaucracy to apply the rules and made the whole process
routine.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we need a COCOM for anti-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   This would not replace efforts by individual institutions but
would help ensure that they all work together and are consistent in
their judgments and actions. The anti-terrorism COCOM should begin
with U.S.-EU cooperation and then be extended, progressively, to
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   With such a structure, governments would not have to analyze in
advance the precise nature of each terrorist movement and its
purposes. They would not have to be faced continually with making
difficult political decisions or have to decide how much leadership
and control to cede to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This anti-terrorism COCOM should be created now, before the first
phase of the war on terrorism winds down and it becomes harder to
mobilize support among allies that do not share all of the U.S.
perspective on global terrorism. It could become a core feature of
the long-term struggle to outlaw terrorism.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration faces the possibility of a full-scale scandal
in the Enron bankruptcy. It can be dealt with quickly or drawn out
painfully. What will decide this is how fast and how thoroughly the
administration comes clean on all of its ties to Enron, and whether
Democrats can avoid the temptation to pay back the Republicans for
their long campaign against Bill Clinton. White House forthrightness
and Democratic restraint are the winning combination here.</LD>
<LD>   It is now clear that Bush administration contacts with Enron were
not confined to Vice President Dick Cheney's task force; they went
deep into the Cabinet. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and
other officials are trying to spin their way out by dismissing all
questions as partisan politics, but the only way for the
administration to clear itself is to open up its records, starting
with the secretive energy task force.</LD>
<LD>   That means minutes of meetings, phone logs, notes, e-mails,
everything. Otherwise, the White House will feed the perception that
it is trying to cover up involvement in a scandal that led to the
collapse of one of the biggest corporate donors to the Bush
campaign--the largest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who received $25,000 from Enron CEO
Kenneth L. Lay a week before being defeated in the 2000 U.S. Senate
race in Missouri, has acted appropriately in recusing himself from
the Justice Department's criminal investigation. But contacts between
Enron and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary
Don Evans also need to be explored fully.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department added Friday that Enron President Lawrence
"Greg" Whalley asked Undersecretary Peter R. Fisher for help in
getting banks to extend more credit and that the two men spoke six or
eight times in October. If the administration did have extensive
contacts with Enron and knew that the company was about to collapse,
why did it do nothing to protect the employees who eventually lost
their retirement savings, locked up in Enron stock? Exactly how many
officials met with or had e-mail communications with Enron employees?
Was the president aware of what his officials were doing?</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) was almost
alone in demanding that the administration produce records of its
contacts with Enron. He shrewdly avoided stepping from demands for
information to allegations of wrongdoing. Now that five congressional
committees have issued subpoenas concerning Enron, other Democrats
should find strength to resist the innuendo and partisanship that
marked Republican investigations of the Clinton White House.</TE>
<TE>   Rumblings are also starting, though not yet on the record, among
congressional Republicans who seem as alarmed as Democrats about
Enron's ties to the White House. When Congress reconvenes, perhaps
supporters of campaign finance reform will whisper "Enron" in the
ears of members who refuse to petition for a vote on the languishing
reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who heads the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, will need to walk a line between
tough questioning and needlessly heated rhetoric when he chairs the
first hearing Jan. 24. The administration will do itself a favor by
cooperating fully. It may well turn out that there is nothing to
hide. But first the administration has to open its books on its
dealings with Enron.</TE>

<LD>Events have once again pushed the beleaguered patients' bill of
rights off the legislative agenda. Some in Washington say the issue
is dead. Not likely.</LD>
<LD>   Critical though the war on terrorism is and will remain, it won't
be long before Americans notice that inadequate health care cuts down
far more people in the United States than Al Qaeda could dream of
slaying, and they'll again clamor for some simple protections.</LD>
<LD>   For years, Congress has kicked around legislation to safeguard
men, women and children enrolled in health maintenance organizations.
Last session, the House and Senate each passed bills that would
assure HMO members' access to specialists, their right to appeal
treatment decisions to independent experts and their right to
participate in experimental trials of new drugs and procedures.</LD>
<TE>   The Democrat-driven Senate bill would also allow patients who feel
they have been abused by their health providers to sue for punitive
damages in state courts, where limits on the awards are generally
fairly generous. The House bill, backed mainly by Republicans, would
send most of those cases to federal court and limit how much money an
aggrieved patient could collect. President Bush was a fan of the
latter approach. Everyone involved continued to wrestle toward
compromise. But, as Times health writer Charles Ornstein reported
Thursday, even the plodding progress came to a halt Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that politicians, fatigued by America's
all-too-real combat role, have little enthusiasm for returning to
this sometimes brutal and exhausting domestic fight. Eventually,
though, they will have to.</TE>
<TE>   The factory worker's baby whose last hope is a promising
experimental surgery; the architect whose overworked doctor botched a
breast exam; the grandfather whose HMO is unwilling to spring for
that "unnecessary" hip implant--such people will demand attention in
the coming election cycles.</TE>
<TE>   The patient's bill of rights is on life support. Astute
legislators of various stripes--from Georgia Republican Rep. Charlie
Norwood, who pioneered an early version of the bill, to California's
own Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat--stand poised with legislative
defibrillators, ready to revive some compromise version of reforms
that tens of millions of American HMO members would rather not see
die from neglect.</TE>

<LD>So now we know that sending a teenager to his room can be dangerous
to investors around the world. The Securities and Exchange Commission
alleges that a 17-year-old Mission Viejo high school senior named
Cole A. Bartiromo ran an elaborate Internet investment scheme that
successfully and cleverly defrauded at least 1,000 adult investors
out of more than $1 million. That's probably more than most of us
made for mowing lawns or baby-sitting during those fabled teen years.
You know, when cute little people who don't mind public hugs mature
into emotional mutants on a hormone-driven thrill ride where the
spoken vocabulary ranges from a convincingly dense "Huh?" to a firmly
dismissive "In a minute."</LD>
<LD>   Yes, yes, our child's adolescence is revenge and well-deserved
justice for what we put our own parents through in those grandly
awkward ages 13 through 19. On teen planets nothing is so small that
it can't be blown into a volcanic argument or life-altering
disappointment. But what an awful responsibility now to put on
parents: The realization that grounding a teenager to his bedroom
while trying to instill some behavioral accountability may actually
be enabling a global swindling operation with mounting deposits in
Costa Rica.</LD>
<LD>   Honey, why are so many men in dark suits with identical Chevrolets
and badges ringing our doorbell? And what are all those satellite TV
trucks doing on our street?</LD>
<TE>   Parents might be frightened--and maybe strangely also a little
proud or encouraged--to think that a closely related, once-diapered
creature incapable of remembering a school lunch or rinsing a
bathroom sink has clandestinely learned to play a worldly, eloquent
Internet pitchman amid a mass of empty Dr Pepper cans that was
supposed to be taken out last week. And that he's using an Internet
pseudonym, a dexterous digital mind and a simple computer keyboard
like a fine musician to play on an international stage to some
universal human traits like hope and greed.</TE>
<TE>   Is it conceivable that recent children who still seem thrilled
with Christmas gifts and take a facial pimple census every morning
are privately paying $4,000 e-mail bonuses to gullible trial
investors in England and New Zealand with the well-placed confidence
and savoir-faire that this will prompt the adults to fork over
$27,000 more? No, our son isn't here; he's at baseball practice, we
think.</TE>
<TE>   If widespread, this teen tycoon phenomenon could forever upset the
parent-child imbalance of power, not to mention forcing allowance
adjustments. The SEC investigation, we hope, will find this to be an
isolated case. The teen promised to return more than $900,000. We
also hope he didn't say, "In a minute."</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Air Bases Forge Double-Edged Sword," Jan. 6: There is a
problem in being a powerful, moneyed nation with, I think, basic good
intentions. That problem is balance and being able to withstand the
jealousies thrust at our nation under the guise of sensitivity to our
military presence in their holy midst. However, if the U.S. withdrew
from all foreign countries militarily, I believe that much chaos
would ensue.</LD>
<LD>   But I too am sensitive to having three of our airliners rammed
into national sites, killing thousands of my fellow Americans. I too
am sensitive to having to listen to foreigners on American soil
complain about America while still partaking greedily of our
goodwill. I too am sensitive about ingratitude to Americans for their
help in times of famine, drought and financial hardship--and with
totalitarian regimes that have to be gotten rid of, which endangers
the lives of our servicemen and women. I too am sensitive to the
insensitivity of the Muslim world to America.</LD>

<LD>Jeffrey Miles (letter, Jan. 5) repeats the oft-stated ''we have the
best, most effective health care system in the world.'' Not true, and
it's not even close anymore. A check of the international studies of
the last decade reveals that, by any measure, the single-payer
systems in Europe and Canada provide more comprehensive coverage for
more people at lower cost.</LD>

<HD>Taxing Bush With Presidential Precedents</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, Robert Scheer once again plays the class warfare card ("Let
Down His Rich Pals? Over His Dead Body," Commentary, Jan. 8).
Liberals always want bigger government, higher taxes and more social
programs that don't work. Any fool knows you don't raise taxes during
a recession. Not to mention Scheer's blaming President Bush for the
recession (even though it began a year before he took office). Both
Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy cut taxes, which vastly increased
revenues. They were smart enough to realize supply-side economics is
the way to a better life for the greatest number of people.</LD>
<LD>   If it weren't for our free market and, yes, capitalist economy, I
would venture to say that liberals like Scheer wouldn't be free to
espouse their misguided attempts at compassion. True compassion
encourages self-reliance, hard work and pride in our country, not
government handouts.</LD>
<LD>   Stan Bush</LD>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer has ventured beyond his usual misleading innuendo and
stumbled into egregious error when he charges that Bush will be
remembered "as another Herbert Hoover" under whom "the government
went broke catering to the wealthy." Hoover raised taxes. As the
country slid from recession into the Great Depression, he raised
income taxes and increased the top rate from 25% to 63%.</TE>
<TE>   James R. Adams</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's put to rest the myth that ignoring the economy was Bush
Sr.'s downfall. He was a colorless administrator with no vision who
had a huge spike in his poll numbers during a war administered by his
staff. Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   The public is (rightfully) so stunned, horrified and revolted by
the Sept. 11 attack that it would rally around any halfway competent
president, and that's all that's occurring. As time passes, people
realize the U.S. military response, while wonderfully effective, was
crafted by military and Cabinet advisors. They also slowly become
more aware of the empty domestic agenda Bush Jr. has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's tax cuts and the war have taken us to a deficit in one
year. Bush wants more tax cuts. Bush has learned nothing and is
merely repeating his father's mistakes. We can only hope that the
pattern will hold true and he will be a one-term president.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Interesting juxtaposition on Jan. 9 of Dave Thomas' obituary and
George W. Bush's signing of a $26-billion education bill. Thomas
built an $8-billion-a-year fast-food franchise without having
graduated from high school, let alone college.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it's because he escaped the full impact of government
schools, which ignore the three Rs in favor of frivolities like
self-esteem, DARE programs and recycling. Thomas simply created his
own "after-school program"--he got a job and worked his way to the
top, raising our standard of living, in the process, by giving us
another choice of affordable fast food.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Bush should give the $26 billion back to the taxpayers
it was stolen from so we can afford to support more young
entrepreneurs who create the products and services we want to buy,
instead of reducing our standard of living by funding more parasitic
government employees.</LD>

<LD>Admittedly, I have been slow to learn the lesson, but "Catholics Slam
Napa Art Exhibit" (Jan. 5) made me see the light. Political
correctness doesn't just mean that we should be sensitive to the
feelings of particular groups, such as American Indians. It also
means that art groups, such as Copia in the Napa Valley, should spend
taxpayer money to insult Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   I did not get the message when the Brooklyn Museum of Art used
government money to show a portrait of the Virgin Mary smeared with
elephant dung, but the scales have dropped from my eyes. The next
time someone suggests that what I say or write about a person is not
politically correct, I'll ask if the person is Catholic. If so, I'll
continue what I'm doing and apply for an NEA grant.</LD>

<LD>Re "Wiccan Chaplain Brews Storm," Jan. 7: Your article on Jamyi
Witch, the Wisconsin Wiccan prison chaplain, tried to show two sides
of the story: a Wiccan who claims to be just another leader of
another religion trying to minister to inmates and those who oppose
her because the religion she practices is not a mainstream one.</LD>
<LD>   [There is] a wider, more basic issue: Should any government body
in this country employ any religious chaplains at taxpayers' expense?
There is absolutely no justification for publicly funded support of
any religious ministry, period. Any religious proselytizing or
ministering should rightly be sponsored by those faithful who pursue
such beliefs. The rest of us should not be coerced into sponsorship
of any mystical, irrational ideologies regardless of their
proponents' alleged noble purposes.</LD>

religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) realized they do not have
a monopoly on all matters spiritual. As a follower of the Druid path
I am familiar with the kind of intense scrutiny faced by the Rev.
Witch. It would be nice if we as a society came to the realization
and understanding that we do not all follow the same path.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Launches a Criminal Probe of Enron," Jan. 10: To have the
Bush Justice Department investigate Enron is a classic case of the

nothing less than a special prosecutor. What did President Bush and

<TE>   Paul Conrad's tweaking of the Enron logo (Commentary, Jan. 10) is
crude, crass, obscene and unsuitable for publication in a family
newspaper. I take that back--considering Enron's infamous financial
contempt for the California energy market and what Enron officials
are doing for stockholders now that Enron has gone bankrupt, the logo
as revised by Conrad couldn't be a more fitting gesture.</TE>

special prosecutor. With over 70% of Enron's money going to
Republicans, these will be interesting days.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed Martha Farnsworth Riche's "Old Age Certainly Isn't What It
Used to Be" (Commentary, Jan 7). When I was born in 1923 the life
expectancy was in the 50-year-old age group. I retired when I was 65
but could have worked longer. I try to avoid doctors, and I'm sure
others are using up my Medicare money. I've had a pacemaker for over
10 years, and modern medicine has me living a normal life.</LD>
<LD>   I worked at the post office for the last 10 years of my work life.
It seems the post office hired a bunch of old ladies in their 50s in
1978. I wanted more physical labor than in my old office job. The
boss often said we beat out the younger workers in production. We
reminisced about our World War II jobs--one lady was all over Europe
with the Red Cross and I was the first lady welder at the Pullman
shipyard in Chicago. We all knew hard work and did our jobs!</LD>

<LD>As L.A. County Supervisor Michael Antonovich pointed out, we must
have a regional approach to air travel in Southern California
("Spread Out L.A.'s Air Traffic," Commentary, Jan. 8). However, we
must have a few large airports, not many small facilities that create
dangerous air congestion. It is also unlikely that airlines could or
would serve scattered small airports efficiently.</LD>
<LD>   A new airport at the El Toro base in Orange County would not solve
this problem. Can you imagine flights to London from both LAX and El
Toro? No. However, the airlines could and would provide full service
from two or three large regional airports. One reason that Ontario is
underutilized is the difficulty of reaching it from most of Orange
County. The toll roads have helped, but the missing link is a highway
from the end of the toll road at the 91 Freeway directly to the
airport at Ontario. Such a route has been discussed for years. It is
time to build it.</LD>

<TE>   Antonovich writes that we should spread out L.A.'s air traffic.
That is a great idea, but it seems that everyone is overlooking a
better solution. A small group is stopping the changing of the closed
El Toro base into an international airport, which would benefit the
whole world.</TE>

<TE>   Re "LAX Lot Fee May Hit $30 Per Day," Jan. 8: Great minds at work!
If lots are only half full, then raising the rates will a) attract
more business or b) result in less business? If airport
administrators gouge those now using the lots on the assumption that
they will pay almost any price, they will need to maintain a 40%
usage to earn the same parking revenues (using the close-in lots as
the model). That may happen. But if you want more people to use the
lots, you have to lower prices, not raise them. What happened to the
notion that the airport was serving the needs of the public?</TE>
<TE>   The rates at other airports are of interest but not part of the
decision. And thanks for limiting the shared-ride van services to
just a few companies--so they could raise rates by 80%. That made
things much better.</TE>

<KH>U.S. MILITARY</KH>
<HD>The Folly of Air-Power Hubris</HD>
<DH>Our stunning military success in Afghanistan shouldn't mean
that our airmen can do it all when the next challenge comes along.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEREK LUNDY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. air power is flying high for its role in the war against
terrorism. And it should be. The combat performance of U.S. aircraft
was largely responsible for our quick and decisive victory in
Afghanistan. It can even be said that air power, as an instrument of
military power, has turned a corner, at long last realizing the
dreams of some strategic thinkers who regarded air war as a
civilizing force because it could shorten conflicts. Yet, all this
success shouldn't rush to the heads of policymakers, who may be
tempted to use air power to pursue ambitious--and risky--goals
abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts, policymakers and politicians already believe that
air power can fight and win our conflicts. In the Dec. 3 issue of
Newsweek, Fareed Zakaria wrote that many in the Pentagon remain
trapped in land-power nostalgia. He urged them to face the facts that
bombing works. Similarly, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) has complained
that we "underestimate the impact that air power can have." Lawrence
J. Korb, assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration,
notes there is "a tendency among our political leaders to view air
power as a cheap and easy military solution to all our foreign policy
problems."</LD>
<TE>   Yes, technology such as Global Positioning System equipment,
advanced communications, airborne sensors and weapons that can be
guided by ground commandos allows us to put a bomb within 30 feet of
a target from miles away. During World War II, we were satisfied if
we bombed the correct city and lost only 5% of our airmen. Today, we
practically expect to hit a windowpane from 30,000 feet without any
loss of life. According to Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, 90% of the munitions used in Afghanistan were
precision-guided, the highest percentage ever in a major U.S.
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   But victory over the Taliban is hardly the measuring stick we
should use to evaluate the future role of U.S. air power in the
making of foreign policy. Afghanistan has little infrastructure and
few economic centers. The Taliban had virtually no air defenses.
Furthermore, Northern Alliance fighters on the ground in Afghanistan
were pivotal to the success of our air operations. They forced the
Taliban to amass their forces and fight a more conventional war,
which created ready-made, easily detectable targets.</TE>
<TE>   Air-power promoters tend to gloss over such details and
concentrate on how few American lives have been lost in the war in
Afghanistan. From here, it's a short step to advocating air power as
an alternative to ground troops, a tactic with obvious political
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a decreased tolerance for putting American troops in harm's
way, coupled with unrealistic expectations about U.S. air
capabilities, is a recipe for misadventure abroad. Policymakers might
use air power in humanitarian missions deemed too dangerous, or not
important enough, to send in ground troops. That could result in a
mismatch between means and ends, with unhappy consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Take Kosovo. Many politicians and strategic thinkers consider that
mission to have been a victory for air power. Yet, truth be told,
complicated political imperatives determined which military tools
were employed to achieve the stated goals. From the outset of NATO's
involvement, former President Bill Clinton dismissed the idea of
deploying U.S. troops in the region, proclaiming that airstrikes
alone would prevent then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
"continuing and escalating his attacks on helpless civilians." But
airmen understood that their mission was to destabilize Milosevic's
regime, not to aid the refugee population. Aircraft had the ability
to bomb fixed targets, but were helpless when it came to stopping
lightly armed military police from killing unarmed civilians.</TE>
<TE>   If Pentagon leaders are constrained by political imperatives in
their use of air power, as in Kosovo, it will leave us unprepared for
future threats and limit the overall capability of the military. "Air
power is a superbly powerful and versatile tool," explains Capt. Jeff
Niner of the U.S. Navy, "and only an insane military strategist would
want to enter a modern war without it. However, airpower is but one
tool in the toolbox. It would mark the strategist equally insane if
he thought air power was all that is required for modern warfare."</TE>
<TE>   Acceptance of air power as the centerpiece of our military
response will inevitably create funding problems in the Pentagon. The
push to pump up U.S. air power would at some point cut into the
budgets of the other armed forces. For the price of one F-22, priced
at nearly $200 million, the military could buy 30-plus M1A1 Abrams
tanks, the backbone of U.S. armored ground forces.</TE>
<TE>   There have been attempts in the past to push air power beyond its
capabilities. Horrified by the destruction of trench warfare in World
War I, air-power advocates sold air war as a quick and decisive
alternative to land power. Italian Gen. Giulio Douhet, the father of
strategic air power, believed that aircraft alone could win wars,
and, accordingly, land and sea operations should be reorganized
around air power. The underlying theme in his theory was that bombing
attacks on civilian populations would shatter the enemy's morale,
making wars shorter and ultimately more humane. Douhet's U.S.
counterpart, Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell, wrote in 1930 that air
power "is a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because
wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, air power has never lived up to such expectations. It did not
end World War II quickly and decisively, despite inflicting heavy
civilian casualties--especially in Japan. It was similarly
inefficient in Vietnam. It did not topple Saddam Hussein. Nor did it
save civilian lives in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to this uneven track record, there is a strong
practical reason why it would be unwise for policymakers to rely
exclusively on air power to achieve U.S. objectives overseas--the
high level of interdependence among U.S. military forces. With no
land or sea support, not only would U.S. airmen be more exposed to
enemy air defenses, but our military response to crises would be
one-sided, predictable and thus vulnerable to future challenges.
Bombs alone shouldn't shape our foreign policy.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With the Argentine peso falling 40% in free-market transactions last
week, and a yearlong freeze on all dollar-dominated savings accounts
of more than $3,000, the long-dreaded crash has come to Argentina,
but the rest of Latin America has, at least for now, come through
unscathed.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the crying for Argentina, as it happens, is in Spain,
where leading banks and utility companies made huge investments in
the home of the tango. Now they are discovering what British and U.S.
firms learned long ago: When things go bad in Argentina, politicians
rob foreign investors to calm angry voters.</LD>
<LD>   Biting the hand that feeds it is an Argentine tradition, a
hallmark of the governing Peronist party. For Americans, the
influence of Juan Peron and his party on Argentina is hard to grasp.
Imagine, though, if instead of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Tony Soprano
had been our longest-serving president in the 20th century and had
built a corrupt political machine that dominated our politics for 60
years. Then, imagine that instead of Eleanor Roosevelt as our most
influential first lady, President-for-life Soprano had married an
ex-Vegas chorus girl with the body of Marilyn Monroe and the
political judgment of Jane Fonda.</LD>
<TE>   The only two alternatives to the Peronists are the opposition
Radical Party and the military. Neither can govern. The military lost
public confidence, and deservedly so, during the last dictatorship,
when thousands of innocent Argentines were murdered by thuggish
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The military then topped this off with a catastrophic and idiotic
attack on the Falkland Islands in 1982--sheep-dotted British outposts
in the South Atlantic that Argentina pointlessly but fervently
claims.</TE>
<TE>   Following the military collapse, Argentines elected Raul Alfonsin
of the Radical Party as president, but one of the country's recurring
bouts of hyperinflation set in, and Alfonsin had to resign the
presidency to Peronist successor Carlos Menem in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, Menem seemed to have given Argentines a new direction.
The wildly popular currency-convertibility plan, linking the volatile
peso to the stable dollar, allowed Argentines, for the first time in
decades, to go to sleep at night knowing their money wouldn't be
worthless by the time they woke up. Inflation was stopped and Menem
was a hero.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors, pundits and U.S. foreign policymakers were also
charmed by Menem's pledges to reform the Argentine economy and to
draw his country closer to the United States in international
politics. To some degree, Menem delivered. Key state-owned industries
were privatized, often with significant reductions in employment for
workers in featherbedded public industries. Argentina reduced its
trade barriers and supported U.S. proposals for a Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA).</TE>
<TE>   But Menem's reforms were only skin deep. Failure to fully overhaul
the country's labor laws, which make it extremely difficult to fire
redundant employees or cut wages and which give inordinate power to
corrupt but traditionally loyal Peronist trade unions, meant that
wage costs in Argentina remained unrealistically high even as foreign
investment in the country gradually slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, politicians continued to treat the national treasury like a
private piggy bank, showering favors on lobbies, well-placed
industrialists and organized blocs of voters. In the old days,
Argentina always handled these costs by printing more money. With the
peso tied to the dollar, that couldn't happen. Argentina borrowed
money instead, and the debts piled up until they couldn't be paid.</TE>
<TE>   After Menem's second term, voters gave the Radicals another
chance--and they muffed it again. Last month, Radical Party president
Fernando de la Rua, like Alfonsin before him, was forced to leave
office before the end of his term by popular outrage over economic
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Now, under recently installed Eduardo Duhalde, the Peronists are
back in power and up to their old tricks. It appears that the
Peronist party will do what it knows best: repudiate the
unsustainable debt it has built up with a bout of inflation and
rhetoric that blames evil foreigners for Argentina's woes.</TE>
<TE>   This is unlikely to work, and it is hard to see what will happen
when these policies fail. Historically, when squabbling politicians
have led the country into a truly impossible position, the military
takes over, turns the economy over to technocrats, and after things
have stabilized a bit, lets the politicians back in.</TE>
<TE>   That probably can't happen now, at least not for a while. The
crimes and blunders of the last military regime were so outrageous
that even officers understand that they should stay out of politics.
If, however, the Duhalde government continues to make a bad situation
worse, the men in uniform could start looking better.</TE>
<TE>   During Latin America's unhappy past, military coups were a little
like hitting the control-alt-delete buttons on a computer. Nobody
thinks that is a good thing to do, and everybody knows that it
involves data loss and delay, but when system crashes come, there
sometimes aren't any alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   If, as now seems likely, the Peronists fail and the Radicals
remain ineffective, Argentina may decide to reboot.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Argentina's troubles aren't setting off another wave
of Latin America crises. Mexico is now seen as hooked to the U.S.
economy, and its prospects are tied to how fast the U.S. emerges from
recession. Similarly, Chile gets credit for years of sound fiscal
policy and a sensible economic model that has enabled it to weather
the global slowdown in reasonably good shape. Even Brazil,
Argentina's closest neighbor and its main partner in Mercosur, the
ambitious program that seeks to build a common trading bloc in South
America, has survived the news from Buenos Aires. Brazil's long-
battered currency remains well above its lows last fall, and its
stock market has made some impressive gains.</TE>
<TE>   When investors--and foreign-policy professionals, for that
matter--think about Latin America, they increasingly divide the
continent into three categories. There are the stellar performers
like Chile, where a long record of solid achievement makes Chilean
debt a solid blue chip.</TE>
<TE>   There are the serious reformers like Mexico and Brazil. These
countries are not out of the woods yet, but they have made a real
beginning on cleaning up the corruption, inefficiency and instability
that have bedeviled Latin America for generations.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are the laggards, countries like Argentina,
Venezuela and Colombia that are still mired in the continent's old
and failed ways. None of them has to be poor. All are rich in natural
resources, and their populations are, by world standards,
well-educated.</TE>
<TE>   In all three countries, elites have historically been corrupt and
shortsighted; populist political movements repeatedly fall for
snake-oil salesmen selling no-pain solutions for difficult problems.</TE>
<TE>   Buenos Aires has more psychoanalysts per capita than any other
city in the world, giving a new poignancy to an old joke:</TE>
<TE>   Q: How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?</TE>
<TE>   A: Only one, but the light bulb has to really want to change.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, it seems that, despite a lost century of missed
opportunities and economic decline, Argentina is still not ready to
change. Until it is, look for one unhappy turn of the screw after
another.</TE>

<HD>LAUSD's Building Fantasy</HD>
<DH>No one at the district seems to grasp that these mistakes
come with a price.</DH>

<AU>CAROL LYNN MITHERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last fall's announcement that the nightmarishly overcrowded Los
Angeles Unified School District expects to complete 85 new schools
and expand 75 others within six years should be cause for
celebration. As a Times editorial wistfully noted, "We want to
believe." But if the past offers any indication, the district is as
likely to achieve that goal as its superintendent is to fly.</LD>
<LD>   My skepticism stems from having seen what happened when the
district tried to build just one school--on a site it already owned
with funds it had committed. The Community Magnet School, an
elementary school on Airdrome just east of La Cienega, is one of the
district's jewels. Its multiethnic students get top Stanford 9
scores. It has enormously dedicated teachers and a flourishing parent
association. In 1999, the school was the only LAUSD campus to receive
a prestigious National Blue Ribbon award.</LD>
<TE>   Since it was founded in 1977, however, this exemplary school has
been squeezed onto a 2.5-acre slab of asphalt surrounded by a
chain-link fence. Students are taught in 34-year-old "temporary"
classrooms; two bathrooms and the school's former library were
converted to classrooms after mandatory class-size reduction went
into effect. The rooms have peeling paint, but no air conditioning or
Internet access; two barely have windows. There's no auditorium, food
preparation area, lunch room or covered halls--on rainy days kids eat
in class, and when they go to the bathroom, they get wet. Three
hundred students share eight toilets.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Principal Pamela Marton begged the district for
upgrades. Then, in April 1999, a representative sent by the U.S.
Department of Education Blue Ribbon committee toured the school and
reportedly told then-Supt. Ruben Zacarias and at least one school
board member, "You should be ashamed." Within a month, word came down
that a new Community campus was to be built, on an unused portion of
the 9.8-acre site housing Walgrove Elementary School, in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Community's neighbor, the equally sterling Los Angeles Center for
Enriched Studies (LACES), cheered--finally, this onetime junior high
that now also has a high school could expand and build the sports
facility it so badly needed. But parents and staff at Walgrove, an
under-attended, dilapidated neighborhood school, were outraged. No
one from LAUSD had told them this action was even being considered.
They had been in talks with Santa Monica's Crossroads School founder
Paul Cummins, who also wanted to build on their site, and who'd
promised massive upgrades to their campus as part of the deal. And
Community, most of whose students live well east of La Cienega,
didn't want to move.</TE>
<TE>   The district gave all the same basic reply: Too bad. At a June
meeting, the district's then-project manager presented the plan: The
school would be allocated $4.2 million, which would just cover the
cost of building a modern campus of pre-fab modular structures,
including an administration building, mutipurpose room, lunch shelter
and other amenities. (About $1.2 million of this money would come
from building-rehabilitation funds that Community was due to receive
anyway, from passage of Proposition BB, a 1997 school repair bond
measure.) The proposed opening date was fall 2000. If the school
rejected this offer, it would be evicted when LACES built its
facility and ultimately might be relocated somewhere like Sunland.
Amid much grumbling, the parent body voted to endorse the change.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, school committees formed and went to work preparing
for the move. Several parents were architects and focused on building
design. Others reached out to the Walgrove community. Over the next
six months, dozens of meetings took place, between Community and
Walgrove principals and parents, staff and district project managers,
and various independent consultants hired by the district. The Playa
del Rey-based architectural firm of Martinez Amador Architects Inc.
was hired and began designing the new campus.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Barbara Boudreaux, the board member who'd pushed for
Community's relocation, was replaced by Genethia Hayes. Supt.
Zacarias was replaced first by Ramon C. Cortines, then Roy Romer. The
district's facilities division, which oversees construction, was
reorganized. By January 2000, Martinez Amador still didn't have a
contract. By March, it was growing clear that $4.6 million for the
new school wasn't enough. "Everyone knew you couldn't build a school
for that price," says one parent, an architect who has been involved
in public construction projects for 15 years. "But we were told to
keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in May 2000, the whole game plan suddenly changed. Kathi
Littman, hired earlier that year as the district's director of new
facilities, decided that pre-fab buildings weren't cost-effective.
Community should get a campus that was "stick built"--constructed
from scratch. The new budget was just over $6 million. There were
dozens more meetings. By September, staff at the Walgrove School was
growing upset at the scope of work being proposed for Community while
its own rehabilitation needs went unmet. Progress on the new school
slowed as the district addressed that problem. Then, in December,
local district D Supt. Merle Price was shocked to discover that the
school board had never approved giving Community any more than the
original $4.2 million. And still, the work went on.</TE>
<TE>   By January 2001, the new Community school had its third project
manager--but still no official budget. By April, costs for building
the new school were being estimated at more than $11 million. In May,
Principal Marton reviewed the district's master-plan project list for
new construction--and Community wasn't even on it. The district,
under fire for its overcrowding problem, had created new criteria for
which schools deserved new facilities. Because Community wasn't on a
year-round schedule or busing students, it didn't meet them.
Construction on the LACES sports facility was due to begin, which
meant Community would be on the street.</TE>
<TE>   In June of last year, exasperated parents flooded school board
members with demands for action. No one seemed to remember what had
been promised the school, or why, or even know what was happening.
School board President Hayes, for instance, sent one parent an
irritated note, saying that the promise to move Community had been
"based on inaccurate information and faulty research" and that the
Walgrove buildings that would house the school--there weren't
any--had proved to have "major structural damage."</TE>
<TE>   "I was dumbfounded," says the parent whose profession is public
construction. "Unlike with other institutions, you didn't get the
sense that anyone was in charge or in control of the process."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in July, the district abruptly informed Community that it
would not be moving after all. Martinez Amador was fired, and the
project turned over to architect Laurel Gillette, who was designing
the LACES sports complex (which now had to be reconfigured to fit in
a smaller space). And it quickly became clear that $6 million, once
declared enough to build a whole new school, wouldn't buy much at
all.</TE>
<TE>   As the plan now stands, by 2004--five years after the building
effort began--Community will have a new multipurpose room,
administration building, library and two bathrooms. Classes will
continue to meet in the old bungalows, which will be given a new coat
of paint, air conditioners and Internet connections. The budget for
this improvement includes a whopping $526,000 in "project management"
fees, $358,000 for design fees and $70,000-$100,000 to cover "soft
costs" associated with the aborted Walgrove move. (The LACES sports
project, meanwhile, which was to break ground this month, was
suddenly found to be "several million" over budget and is on hold.)
The land-poor district is doing nothing with the vacant acres at
Walgrove.</TE>
<TE>   How does a school district promise to move a school, offer a plan
that meets its budget, expand that plan, then discover there's no
money after all and cancel everything? Kathi Littman--who notes that
she and her staff "inherited this effort"--gets an impatient edge in
her voice when asked. "This is a grandfathered project, not a
priority plan school," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue isn't whether Community "deserves" a new campus or
not. It's that, in Supt. Romer's own words, past district
construction estimates were sometimes based on "pure air." It's that
no one ever is held accountable for such mistakes. And it's that no
one at the district seems to grasp that these mistakes come with a
price. Some of it is actual: The district consultants who attended
three years of planning meetings were well paid for their time
(although parents were not.) A larger part is psychic. The district
desperately needs the support of active, concerned, middle-class
parents. But when it treats those parents with dismissive contempt,
when it wastes their time, when it convinces them that even their
most strenuous exertions are futile, it has lost them.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope things move forward, but I'm done," says a Community
parent who was intensely involved in the effort to move the campus
and who estimates his architectural firm contributed $15,000 in
unpaid labor. "I have no more energy for this. We worked for three
years, and designed two new schools, and we don't even have one."</TE>

<HD>Which Way U.S.A.?</HD>
<DH>GOP could pull off the unexpected and achieve midterm
electoral gains if current trends hold up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Like 2000 and 2001, this year is likely to be the year of the
unexpected. But not entirely. Turn-of-the-century periods have an
unusual psychological characteristic. People tend to refocus on
trends already evident and project them into the new century. The
years 2000-2001 have displayed less technology worship and more
traditional religion, less new world order and more disorder, and
less pie-in-the-sky economics and more evidence that neither markets
nor government central bankers can work magic.</LD>
<LD>   It's a bit premature, then, for events in November, December and
early January to support optimism about improving economic and
military conditions over the next 12 months. But should an upbeat
scenario prove correct, it would replace two longtime precedents
suggesting Republican political and electoral vulnerability with rare
opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Since President Herbert Hoover's day, every Republican
administration has had a recession or serious regional downturn
keynote party losses in midterm congressional elections. Second, U.S.
20th-century wars have usually created enough disillusionment in
their first 12 to 20 months to cost the party in the White House
seats in the next midterm elections.</LD>
<TE>   Suppose, instead, that neither precedent holds this November
because economic recovery has been building for two to three quarters
and the American public is satisfied that terrorism and Osama bin
Laden have been defeated. In this case, the GOP could break its
midterm pattern of losing congressional strength. A gain would have
major implications for policymaking and politics in the next two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP must worry, though, that a lot can go wrong in the 10
months before elections. Forecasters are divided about the country's
economic prospects, but even some relative optimists see
unemployment, a lagging indicator, rising through election day.
Besides, a resurgence in the major stock indices but not in
employment could be attacked by Democrats as a Wall Street recovery
and a Main Street abandonment. A similar "recovery" in 1991-92 led to
the defeat of President Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   Global forces could also be negative. Deepening economic weakness
in Japan and South America, in particular, already hint that
bail-outs and central-bank rescue missions have run out of magic. If
this problem spreads to the United States--if Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's unprecedented series of 11 interest rate
cuts in 2001 prove incapable of heading off a second-stage
decline--public confidence would probably shatter by summer. Few
predict such a scenario, however.</TE>
<TE>   A second round of terrorist attacks on the United States could, in
theory, target economic assets. An unnerving article by Stephen E.
Flynn in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine identifies
major U.S. bridges, transportation systems, customs operations and
harbors as a "soft underbelly of globalization" vulnerable to
sabotage. The risks here are simply unknowable.</TE>
<TE>   Where the war on terrorism is headed globally is not much clearer.
Despite the White House's war whoops against evildoers, few of the
major ones have been caught in Afghanistan. Even in the E-ring, or
"outer corridor," of the Pentagon, questions are being quietly raised
about how much of a victory the bombing campaign and tribal alliances
achieved if Bin Laden, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar and their
chief Al Qaeda and Taliban associates got away.</TE>
<TE>   The British in the 19th century and the Russians in the 1980s were
defeated in Afghanistan because their large ground forces were so
bloodied that they had to pull out. The U.S. war effort there now
faces the opposite critique: that a minimal, inadequate U.S. ground
commitment required reliance on tribal allies who let the Taliban and
Al Qaeda leaders get away (or didn't even seek them out).</TE>
<TE>   Capturing or killing Bin Laden would end the grumbling.
Historically, Americans have put a face on their wars. In colonial
times, there was King Philip's War in New England and Pontiac's War
on the frontier. During World War I, it was "Hang the Kaiser." Adolf
Hitler was the focus of World War II. Lacking demon figures in the
Korean and Vietnamese conflicts, U.S. voter commitment flagged. In
1990-91, after then-President George Bush demonized Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, the failure to topple him fostered the perception that Bush
had not won much of a victory in the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's face is just as clearly stamped on the Sept. 11
attacks. U.S. failure to locate him, followed by a resumption of
terrorist attacks in America and Europe, could make the bombing of
Afghanistan look as effective as the U.S. military's success in
kicking Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why, if Bin Laden gets away, the pressure on Bush
ratchets up a few notches. He might have to chase Bin Laden in
Somalia, the Sudan or even in Pakistan. Defense Department war hawks
like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and former Pentagon
strategist Richard N. Perle already want to reopen a second front
against Hussein in Iraq. This would be the first "legacy" war of a
U.S. chief executive, and after a first round of trumpets, the
electorate might start to get nervous over hints of World War III.</TE>
<TE>   Escalation would reintroduce war-related politics on a large
scale. Republican leaders like Bob Dole have lumped the two World
Wars and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts together as "Democrat
wars." It is intriguing to ponder what sequence of events could give
rise to similar terminology being used against the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   A disappointing economy would increase the pressure on Bush to
escalate hostilities and demand "unity." Politicians have frequently
contemplated military actions as diversions. Some Republicans charged
former President Bill Clinton with ordering up cruise-missile attacks
on Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998 to divert public attention from the
Monica S. Lewinsky scandal. In mid-Depression 1932, when Japan
invaded Manchuria, GOP U.S. Secretary of War Henry Stimson privately
advanced the idea of U.S. armed intervention to counter the
accelerating economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   What policymakers still don't want to think about is the
possibility that the 11 rate cuts undertaken by the Federal Reserve
last year won't produce a full-scale economic recovery. The last time
that happened was also in the early 1930s, when eight Fed
discount-rate cuts between late 1929 and early 1931 failed to
jump-start the economy. True, the Standard &amp; Poor's index turned up
soon after the rate cuts began, but the stock-market recovery lasted
only five months, at which point economic decline speeded up. Several
Wall Street investment firms expect a similar scenario today--a
late-2001, early-2002 surge, especially visible in the stock market,
before the market and the economy start to fall again in the spring
and the middle of this year.</TE>
<TE>   One can also examine the Fed-led recoveries from brief recessions
in 1970-71 and early 1980. The Fed's easing produced surges of growth
in late 1971 and early 1972, and, later, in the second half of 1980.
However, by mid-1973 and mid-1981, the short recovery was heading
toward a deeper recession than the one before. Were this pattern to
repeat, Bush might duck a recession for the midterm elections only to
face a tougher one in the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, our leaders in Washington are making fiscal fools of
themselves. The Democrats are reemphasizing the deficit, partly
reflecting Clinton's insistence that they uphold his economic
successes. Democratic National Committee Chairman Terence McAuliffe,
the former Clinton fund-raiser, absurdly claimed that Bush wouldn't
have any coattails in 2002 "now that he has to defend a deficit
budget."</TE>
<TE>   Bush properly replied that it's entirely legitimate for government
to run a budget deficit in wartime. Then, he, too, overdid it by
conjuring up a new label--"economic security" legislation--for his
stimulus package that disproportionately hands out corporate and
upper-income tax breaks. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is right
to point out that the Bush package is so skewed that when poll-takers
describe its contents, citizens think they're making it up. But
despite Daschle's success in linking the deficit to GOP favoritism
toward corporations and the wealthy and endangering Social Security,
he'll have little chance of cutting through national-security imagery
with Clinton nostalgia and budget-balancing for its own sake.</TE>
<TE>   Institutionally, we have not had a Democratic Senate conjoined
with a Republican House of Representatives since the Civil War, so
today's arrangement is anomalous to begin with. Some political
pundits predict that the November results could produce a Democratic
House and a Republican Senate, although such a switch has never
occurred in a single election.</TE>
<TE>   As a "year of the unexpected," 2002 could be a doozy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Phillips' most recent book is "The Cousins' Wars: Religion,
Politics and the Triumph of Anglo-America." What policymakers don't
want to think about is the chance that Greenspan's 11 rate cuts won't
produce a lasting recovery.</TE>

<HD>Old Politics Ends New Journalism</HD>
<DH>Notimex, the news agency funded by the government, was
going to become a BBC-style organization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM QUINONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mexican term "autogol" is borrowed from soccer and means the goal
a player scores for his opponent. It is also used to describe actions
that hurt one's own cause. Unfortunately for Mexican President
Vicente Fox, the recent firing of Francisco Ortiz Pinchetti as
director of Notimex, the government-funded news agency, was a
political "autogol."</LD>
<LD>   Notimex is Latin America's largest news agency, with some 800
clients and 740 employees, including more than 100 in Mexico and
another 100 abroad. For years, it was the propaganda vehicle of the
government, that is, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the
PRI, and the president.</LD>
<LD>   Fox promised to transform Notimex into an independent and
respected source of news, and Ortiz Pinchetti seemed the perfect
candidate to orchestrate the change. In the mid-1970s, he was a
reporter for Excelsior, then Mexico's best daily newspaper and the
most critical of government conduct. President Luis Echeverria, upset
at the paper's tone, engineered the ouster of its editor, Julio
Scherer, in 1976.</LD>
<TE>   It was a pivotal moment in the development of independent
journalism in Mexico. Three hundred journalists, including Ortiz
Pinchetti and staff, followed Scherer out the door. Together, they
formed Proceso, a left-wing newsweekly, that for years was the only
voice critical of the government in the Mexican mass media.</TE>
<TE>   During his 25 years at Proceso, Ortiz Pinchetti covered some of
the most important moments on Mexico's road to democracy. These
included widespread vote fraud in the state gubernatorial elections
in Chihuahua in 1986 and the similarly fraudulent presidential
election of 1988. He and his son, Francisco Ortiz Pardo, were the
magazine's correspondents on the Fox campaign during 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Their reporting soon reflected the groundswell of Fox support that
eventually led to his victory. But Proceso was distinctly anti-Fox,
and Scherer's son advised the PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida. Less than a month before the presidential election, both
Ortizes were fired. Neither Scherer nor Rafael Rodriguez Castaneda,
the magazine's editor, has given a reason for the firing. The episode
stained the reputation of Scherer, who up to then was considered
Mexico's leading proponent of press freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz Pinchetti accepted the Notimex job on the condition that he
would have full autonomy to shape the news agency into a BBC- or
Agence France Presse-style press. For a while, it seemed possible.
The $4.5-million debt that Ortiz Pinchetti inherited was retired last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Notimex stories began appearing more frequently in the
Mexican press. In part, this was because they reflected Mexico's new
pluralism. Notimex reporters could quote sources from across the
political spectrum. Ortiz Pinchetti invited politicians from various
parties to contribute opinion columns. "We had no more censorship.
There were no more taboos or issues that weren't touched," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of last summer, there were rumblings of discontent
in the Interior Ministry, which oversees Notimex and its budget.
Interior Undersecretary Jose Luis Duran complained to Ortiz Pinchetti
that the governors of Queretaro and Oaxaca--one a member of the PRI,
the other of Fox's center-right National Action Party, or PAN--had
objected to Notimex quoting their critics in news stories. Ortiz
Pinchetti claims Duran insisted he fire the reporters in question,
which he refused to do. Duran later complained about an article
critical of Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda. Ortiz Pinchetti
said he told Duran that it was an opinion column, identified as such
and thus appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, midway through his first year as president, Fox and
his administration were getting hammered by Mexico's media. Fox was
also trying to cultivate support among Mexico's governors. The
combination of the two may have changed the administration's attitude
toward the idea of an independent news agency supported by the
government. In any case, at a meeting in early November, Ortiz
Pinchetti said Duran warned him that there were people in the
administration who thought Notimex needed new management.</TE>
<TE>   Later that month, Ortiz Pinchetti and 16 other top editors were
fired. A spokesman for Duran said the firing was not censorship but a
restructuring. Duran did not return repeated phone calls requesting
comment on the firing.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was a decision aimed at the administrative side, but
they fired only journalists and left the administrator in place,"
Ortiz Pinchetti says. In protest, 25 reporters and editors quit.
Notimex is now headless, its editorial staff demoralized. Pedro
Tames, a former Duran assistant, is now interim director of the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Corral, a senator from Fox's party, the PAN, called the
firing "political censorship." The Fox administration "thought twice
about an agency producing real journalism," Corral says.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason for the firing, it's hard not to note its
parallel with what happened at Excelsior years ago under PRI rule.</TE>
<TE>   A revitalized Notimex could have been one shining example of what
the Mexican president hopes to create in Mexico. Instead, he has lost
some credibility and has another dysfunctional government agency on
his hands. Ortiz Pinchetti's fate may also illustrate how difficult
it is to resist old tools of political control when change takes an
unexpected course. The democratic traditions and habits--like
speaking truth to power--that would have protected Ortiz Pinchetti
are only now developing in Mexico. Notimex, if left alone, could have
accelerated progress.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My friend's father, a 77-year-old man I'll call Mr. Smith, suffered a
stroke following elective surgery at a Los Angeles-area hospital. The
stroke left him paralyzed on the right side and unable to speak. The
family became concerned after noticing a bump on his knee, presumably
the result of a fall. They raised the issue of his safety with the
hospital. Soon thereafter, Mr. Smith was left alone on a commode in
his room. Unable to support his weight, he fell toward his weak side,
striking his head on a wall. Only after his wife came to visit and
pressed the staff to explain the bump on his head was she told what
had happened. The staff physician briefly examined him and told the
wife that "falls are common in patients with disabilities."</LD>
<LD>   A week later at home, Mr. Smith lapsed into a coma. An emergency
CAT scan revealed a large subdural hematoma, a blood clot that can
develop days after an acute head injury. He ultimately died from the
injury.</LD>
<TE>   As a physician devoted to the care of elderly persons and their
families, I wasn't surprised to hear this story. Falls like Mr.
Smith's are regular occurrences when elderly patients are
hospitalized. They happen at the best institutions, public and
private. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
reported in November 2000 that 10% of falls occur in health-care
institutions. I suspect that only a small fraction of actual falls
are reported.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that hospitals have become unsafe environments for
elderly patients. One reason is a critical shortage of skilled
hospital workers, particularly geriatric nurses. Although it doesn't
take the technical expertise of a registered nurse to ensure a
patient's physical safety, it is up to the nurse to oversee the
safety requirements of patients. If nurses are saddled with too many
patients, and too much bureaucratic paperwork, they have no time to
train and supervise those under them. The understaffing of hospitals
occurs in an environment where, according to the 1999 National
Hospital Discharge Survey, patients 65 years old and over accounted
for 40% of discharges and used 48% of hospital care days. As the
population ages, hospitals have increasing numbers of sicker patients
to take care of, and fewer trained staff at their disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the problem, a 1999 California law mandates that the
state Department of Health Services adopt regulations to establish
minimum nurse-to-patient ratios for hospitals by early this year. But
while establishing such minimums is an important step, it is
meaningless if there aren't enough nurses to meet the requirements.
The current critical shortage of registered nurses is only likely to
get worse. Nearly 60% of the RN workforce is over 40 years old, and
the percentage of nurses under 30 has fallen nearly 40% since 1980,
according to a recent Vanderbilt School of Nursing study. Even if
nurses become available, it will take several years for full
implementation of the law, and there's no mandate in it that hospital
workers be trained in elderly care.</TE>
<TE>   When a patient falls or experiences an unexpected "adverse event"
such as a physical injury in the hospital, staff are required to
submit an "incident report." But patients and their families cannot
gain access to these reports. To protect the hospital from having to
give up such reports in the event of a lawsuit, they become part of
the so-called "peer review process." Patients are not permitted even
to verify whether an incident report is accurate, nor are they
routinely informed of any corrective actions taken. The premier
review agency for hospitals, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, has argued for many years that "fear of
reprisals, public castigation, and loss of business ... impede the
reporting of serious errors."</TE>
<TE>   But if hospital care for the elderly is to improve, consumers need
access to data on "adverse events" in hospitals. Hospitals protested
when Medicare required them to make public their outcome statistics,
including incidents of surgical complications and mortality. But
these data have served the public well, enabling patients to make
informed decisions about which hospitals to patronize--if their
health plans allow them to choose. Now, data from incident reports
should be made similarly available--not by name, of course, in order
to protect privacy, but classified according to age, sex, kind of
injury and outcome, with statistical comparisons to other hospitals
across the community and nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Patients and their families should also have the right to file
incident reports. And hospitals should be required to respond to
these reports. Although one can be sympathetic to hospitals' fears of
legal exposure, they are institutions that serve the public and
should not be immune from honest disclosure or the legal
repercussions of failure to act. Hospitals should also be required by
Medicare to provide elderly-protection training to all full-time and
temporary staff.</TE>
<TE>   The burden shouldn't be on the family once a patient is in the
hospital--but in the absence of better staffing and reporting, it
often is. To get high-quality care, families find they have to
advocate on behalf of the patient, and, even then, getting
appropriate care is not easy. A 2001 article in The Journal of Family
Practice reported that even family physicians intervening on behalf
of their own parents found the experience frustrating. They wondered
how people without physician-advocates in the family could ever hope
to manage the fragmentation and poor communication endemic to our
current health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   Weekends, evenings and holidays are particularly hazardous, as
staffing is even more difficult for the hospital. Increasingly,
family and friends of the elderly are staying in the hospital to
ensure that the patient is accompanied at all times when out of bed
or in the bathroom. Enlightened hospitals allow parents to accompany
children to tests and procedures outside the hospital room; they
should allow the same for the elderly and their caretakers.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the only way to make health-care environments safer
for elderly patients is for greater public accountability and strong
private advocacy. If an injury occurs in the hospital, at the very
least all hospital and professional expenses incurred as a result of
the incident should be borne by the hospital, not by the patient or
the insurance carrier. From a policy perspective, federal, state and

<HD>The Context of Terror Can't Be Ignored</HD>
<DH>Bush's policy helps perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON VIORST</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush, let us concede, has brilliantly managed the war in
Afghanistan, just as his father George Bush senior, a decade ago,
managed the war in the Persian Gulf. The difference between them is
that the father was well schooled in global politics. The son is not.
The father understood the importance of building a post-war structure
out of the debris. The son, unfortunately, seems not to grasp
post-war problems at all.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has made clear that his primary foreign policy concern is
terrorism, suggesting that he sees it outside any political context.
We Americans, as victims of the World Trade Center attacks, can
identify with this fixation. But as his father understood, the Middle
East is a complex place, and single-mindedness is not enough.</LD>
<LD>   George Bush senior, though he miscalculated on Saddam Hussein,
understood that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not only crucial
to regional stability but a fundamental American concern. We are more
certain of that now that we have paid a heavy price for Muslim rage.
In the wake of the Gulf War, the father convened a peace conference
in Madrid, initiating a process that promised--still promises--to
remove the conflict from the agenda of both the East and the West.
The son seems to dismiss the Middle East as irrelevant to our
nation's interests.</LD>
<TE>   It is true that in the weeks after Sept. 11, when he sought to
mobilize the Muslim world behind his war in Afghanistan, Bush sent a
message, not unlike his father's, that America would try to bring an
equitable resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He sent
Gen. Anthony C. Zinni to Israel to jump-start a process, but the
Afghan victory came so swiftly that Muslim buy-in to the war seemed
less essential. Zinni retains the assignment, but its paramaters are
now limited to security issues, which keeps Zinni at arm's length
from the real issues that feed the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's notion that terror is only terror has become conventional
wisdom, obediently echoed by the media. It keeps Bush from having to
take sides in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. It
permits him to ignore Saudi Arabia's heavy promotion throughout the
Islamic world of the fundamentalist Wahabi ideology from which Bin
Laden emerged. It allows him to sidestep the tough choices that good
policy demands.</TE>
<TE>   No government can do much to change the nihilistic world outlook
of an Osama bin Laden; we can only stamp out its murderous agents.
Palestinians, in contrast, seek to end nearly 35 years of control of
their lives by a foreign army. Their grievance is not frivolous. In
the same situation, our own feelings would be similar. Far from
demanding a doomsday response, the grievance is within our country's
power to address. But not if we see the situation solely in terms of
fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the apocalyptic vision of Hamas, the organization most
involved in anti-Israeli terror, shares some of Bin Laden's nihilism.
Hamas is not interested in a sensible peace. But it is important to
remember that in the years after the 1993 Oslo peace accords, which
offered the prospect of a reasonable settlement, support for Hamas
was at single digits in Palestinian polls, and terrorism dropped
dramatically. Only within today's context has Hamas gained support in
the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Bush should review that context. First, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin was murdered in 1995 by a Jewish zealot committed to stopping
Oslo. His successor, the hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu, began
dismantling the pact. Ehud Barak, who followed Netanyahu in 1999, was
committed to peace, but on victor's terms. Had he offered a viable
Palestinian state, he might have overcome the obstacles of Jerusalem
and the refugees. Instead, he proposed a series of Bantustans,
largely under Israeli control, that the Palestinians could never
accept.</TE>
<TE>   As the talks fell apart, Ariel Sharon, head of the hard-line
opposition, mocked the Palestinians for their weakness by marching
across the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with hundreds of Israelis. His
supporters insist his show of power had no bearing on the later
violence. But just as it served to ignite an unprecedented wave of
terror, it also got Sharon elected prime minister, which is surely
what it was intended to do. Since then, there have been no peace
talks, and certainly no peace.</TE>
<TE>   Wars are always ugly, and wars of terrorism are more so.
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat no doubt encouraged
this one by lowering the barriers against Hamas without controlling
its operations. But he may have seen terror as the only tactic
available to him. It would be hard to find a war leader who has not
knowingly taken innocent lives to achieve a strategic goal. Rightly
or wrongly, Arafat deduced that, without shaking up Israel, there was
no way to break the deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has been hugely popular among the Palestinians, even
those who a few years before had cheered the Oslo accords. They have
accepted losses, in their desperation, far greater than Israelis have
suffered. Arafat has sneered at Bin Laden's belated discovery and
belabored exploitation of their cause. Bin Laden's anguish over
Islam's unhappy history, as Palestinians see it, in no way compares
with their own goal of ending relentless military occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, never serious about the Palestinians, was never serious
about stopping this war. He ignored a proposal by the Mitchell
commission, an international body led by former U.S. Sen. George J.
Mitchell, to have Israel stop expanding settlements in the occupied
territories. He did not pick up on a proposal, made by some Israelis,
to have Sharon commit to removing the precarious settlements in the
Gaza Strip. Either of these acts by Israel would have given Arafat
cover for clamping down on Hamas, and on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bush, refusing to meet with Arafat, has endorsed Sharon's
declaration that Arafat is "irrelevant." Bush has given approval to
Sharon's insistence that only after 7 days of absolute quiet would
Israel consider negotiations. Since Sharon had already said his offer
would be much less generous than the Barak proposal which Arafat had
already rejected, it was tantamount to no offer at all.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Hamas's excesses have persuaded Arafat to cool
the war. He was surely influenced by international disapproval of the
rising bloodshed. But his decision derives, I suspect, more from a
calculation that, having restored some equilibrium to the rivalry, he
can take a break to see where Washington is willing to lead.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, however, seems unable to recognize the differences between
Palestinian resistance and Bin Laden's pure destructiveness, much
less the link that exists between them. Relatively few Muslims
identify with Bin Laden's extremist ideology, but most identify with
what they see as oppression of their own people. Every night they see
on television tanks and helicopters manned by Israelis, built and
paid for by Americans. If many indiscreetly cheered when the twin
towers fell, it was not for Bin Laden but for the punishment
inflicted on those they consider the oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   Those who cheered on Sept. 11, we should note, constitute a
potential pool from which Bin Laden or some successor will draw new
recruits. Among Palestinians, the sense of despair, if Arafat fails,
is sure to bring Hamas to power.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's father understood this dilemma. The son, instead, feeds the
hostility of every Muslim and every Muslim state. His policy not only
helps perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; ironically, it
also does a disservice to his own high priority of winning America's
war against terrorism.</TE>

<LD>Stephen Hawking admits his international mega-hit "A Brief History of
Time" was a bit of a slog. Translated into 40 languages since its
debut in 1988 and selling more than 10 million copies worldwide, the
tome is probably the most unread book of all time. Hands up all those
who got past Chapter 2. Be honest now. Notwithstanding the legendary
arcana of book No. 1, Hawking's second effort at "popular" science
writing, "The Universe in a Nutshell," is currently climbing
best-seller lists.</LD>
<LD>   From an equally daunting corner of the physics pantheon came
another surprise science success story, Brian Greene's 1999 book on
string theory, "The Elegant Universe." Following Hawking, Greene is
now penning his second volume, for which he is rumored to have
received a whopping advance. An elegant stylist himself, Greene
acknowledges that string theory requires a grasp of large slabs of
the most fiendishly difficult mathematics humans have ever
encountered, and although his text is mercifully free of equations,
"The Elegant Universe" remains a difficult text.</LD>
<LD>   What is going on here? Why are so many people paying hard-earned
cash for books they can barely begin to understand?</LD>
<TE>   Part of the answer, surely, is vanity. A Hawking or Greene sitting
on the coffee table--preferably with a few pages conspicuously bent
back at the corners--sends a powerful message to visiting friends,
prospective dates, and (above all) to oneself, that an intellect is
present in the house. Whether or not you read them, possession alone
looks good. Intellectual vanity is as potent a force as the sartorial
variety.</TE>
<TE>   But most purchasers are honorable in their intentions--at least at
the time of acquisition. They want to read; they believe they will
read; they just don't quite get around to it. Which brings us to the
question of why the arcane reaches of theoretical physics attract
such interest at all. There is no obvious reason why they should.
Before "A Brief History" came out, Hawking's publishers worried that
they had an unsalable monster on their hands. No one, least of all
Hawking, expected the breathtaking success the book was ultimately to
have. Greene and I share the same editor, who tells me that our
publishing house, too, was quite unprepared for the success of "The
Elegant Universe."</TE>
<TE>   Hawking in particular has transcended mere fame, rising into the
realm of the iconic. Marilyn with her pleated dress billowing around
her, Elvis swiveling his hips, Marlon Brando's what-have-you-got
slouch and Hawking in his wheelchair--these are some of the most
instantly recognizable images of our time. More even than Hawking's
image is his voice, or rather the computer-synthesized signal that
now stands in for his natural voice, which was a casualty of his
crippling illness, Lou Gehrig's disease. Hawking has been accorded
the ultimate celebrity nod--a starring role in an episode of "The
Simpsons." In Britain, he also appeared in a commercial for breakfast
cereal. On "Star Trek: The Next Generation" he entered the Holodeck
and played chess with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, the
suggestion being that he was their equal.</TE>
<TE>   What is going on here is hinted at on Newton's own tomb. Taking
pride of place in Westminster Abbey, alongside kings and statesmen,
the great physicist's sarcophagus is emblazoned with the epitaph:
"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night; God said 'Let Newton be!'
and all was light."</TE>
<TE>   Like many people after him, Alexander Pope, who penned these
lines, saw Newton as someone specially chosen by God. If God had
created the world according to mathematical laws, as educated
Europeans of the early 18th century were coming to believe, then the
person who could get "closest" to God was the physicist. Ironically,
in the secular age, ushered into being by the rise of modern science,
it is the physicist who has been increasingly endowed with the mantel
of the divine. The divination of Newton began even in his own
lifetime, with Edmund Halley, discoverer of the eponymous comet and
Newton's longtime champion, writing in an ode: "Nearer to the gods no
mortal may approach."</TE>
<TE>   The allure of theoretical physics, especially in its cosmological
mode, has, in short, always been tied up with an essentially
religious sentiment. It is no accident that in "A Brief History"
Hawking speaks of God as if he were a colleague, a fellow physicist
trying to assemble the most mathematically elegant set of
cosmological laws. The elision of God and physics has indeed become a
mainstay of contemporary science publishing.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Davies, one of the first authors to plow this field, speaks
of a "cosmic blueprint," a mathematical plan for creation. It is
physicists with their deep-space telescopes, their high-energy
particle accelerators and their awesome mathematical tools who will
discover this plan and stand, so to speak, in the shoes of the
Creator. At the end of his book, Hawking famously declares that when
we have found the ultimate set of these laws we will "know the mind
of God."</TE>
<TE>   When one buys a book by Hawking, one is buying more than just a
science book--the unstated suggestion is that one is getting the
words of a prophet. In contemporary Western culture, there is a very
real sense in which physics has taken on some of the trappings of a
religion. Where once we looked to the Bible as the source of ultimate
"truth," now we look to physicists and their quest for a "theory of
everything." At present, it is string theory and its more general
cousin, M-theory, which look like the prime contenders for being such
a theory. Greene, as a leading string theorist, is one of the high
priests of this mathematical path to "enlightenment."</TE>
<TE>   As with most religions, there is also a mythological dimension at
work here, for in many cultures the high priest was also a
seer--someone credited with literally being able to see through to
another plane of reality. In the modern West, physicists like Hawking
and Greene have come to hold the cultural position of seers. Hawking
in particular fits this bill.</TE>
<TE>   In tribal societies seers were often physically marked--they might
be blind, deaf, epileptic, or crippled. Though his language is
mathematics, Hawking is the archetypal crippled seer--his body may be
hobbled to a wheelchair, but his mind is unbounded, soaring beyond
the mundane terrestrial world to the far reaches of the cosmos, there
to engage with vast and mysterious supernatural powers. Black holes
of unimaginable strength able to gobble entire galaxies into their
maws; tunnels through spacetime that would take us back into the
past; and wormholes to other exotic universes--these are the
mythological "creatures" of the age of science.</TE>
<TE>   A book by Hawking is a work of science, but it is also a work of
modern mythology, which like all great mythological tales promises
the excitement of encounter with awe-inspiring magical forces.
Hawking may be a great physicist, but the key to his appeal lies not
in the rigor of his equations, but rather in the doors he opens to
our imaginations.</TE>

<LD>To anyone who has flown since Sept. 11, Travelocity's "Tips &amp; Advice"
section states the obvious: "For the foreseeable future, getting from
the front door of the terminal to the plane will be even more
time-consuming than it already was. Increased security means longer
lines, which means you're going to need to get to the airport
earlier."</LD>
<LD>   But just how much earlier has proved confusing and constantly
changing, and airlines, airports and online booking sites are
struggling to address this but are adding to the confusion because
the sites often do not agree.</LD>
<LD>   Many major airports and most airlines advise passengers to arrive
at least two hours before flight time for U.S. departures and three
hours for international flights, but actual check-in times have
varied.</LD>
<TE>   As Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) notes in its consumer-friendly Flying
Forecast, a few carriers have used Web check-in, self-service airport
kiosks and new security lanes dedicated to first class and
high-mileage frequent fliers to scale back recommended arrival times.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's site (www.nwa.com) now advises passengers to get to
the airport 75 minutes ahead of time for domestic flights, two hours
for international.</TE>
<TE>   The "Update for Travelers" section at Delta's site (www.delta.com)
still recommends allowing at least two hours for check-in but notes
that shuttle passengers flying from Boston, New York or Washington,
D.C., can cut that process to one hour.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, a growing number of airlines--among them Delta,
Northwest, Continental (www.continental.com), Southwest
(www.southwest.com), United (www.ual.com) and US Airways
(www.usairways.com)--have started posting estimated wait times for
specific airports on their Web sites. Whether that information
translates to time savings for stressed-out travelers is debatable.</TE>
<TE>   Continental passengers must click from "Customer Advisories" on
the airline's home page to "What to Expect at the Airport" and then
"Airport Processing Times" before they learn that "the average time
required from entering an airport terminal within the U.S. to
boarding our aircraft is approximately one hour."</TE>
<TE>   Travelers are also advised to "review the approximate processing
time for select airports that require more than one hour during peak
traffic hours." When they do, they'll see a list of more than 50
airports with waits longer than an hour during "peak traffic hours,"
defined as 6:30 to 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 3:30 to 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some airports have adopted their own guidelines, which
may not jibe with the airlines'.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a home page link to "current airport status" on Salt
Lake City International's recently redesigned site
(www.slcairport.com) notes that "arriving at the airport 90 minutes
before your flight's scheduled departure is advisable; however,
passengers may want to consult with their airline for more specific
arrival times."</TE>
<TE>   Delta, which has a hub in Salt Lake City, took a decidedly dimmer
view Jan. 2, when its site advised Salt Lake passengers that during
peak traffic times (7 to 11 a.m., 3 to 7 p.m.), they should count on
40 minutes for curbside check-in, four hours at the ticket counter
and 30 minutes to clear security. (A spot check on Jan. 7 was more
encouraging: an hour at the ticket counter and 45 minutes at security
during peak times.)</TE>
<TE>   One more thing, Delta adds: "Wait time information is regularly
reviewed for accuracy; however, all times are approximates.
Unanticipated wait times may occur on days or times other than those
listed."</TE>
<TE>   So what's a frazzled traveler to do?</TE>
<TE>   Some are posting queries to message boards and newsgroups, a
hit-or-miss process that can yield some daunting results.</TE>
<TE>   One traveler, flying out of John Wayne Airport in Orange County
for the first time in early January, got this tip from a fellow flier
by posting to an airport forum on FlyerTalk (www.flyertalk.com): "SNA
[Orange County airport] in their infinite wisdom has not expanded
their security checkpoint area.... If you have an early morning
flight, get into the airport [about] 5:45 a.m. so you have plenty of
time to go through security. The security time through is 25 to 55
minutes. (This is after you have checked in.)"</TE>
<TE>   But others are simply steeling themselves for a long wait.</TE>

<HD>Heading to the Cold? Here's How to Cope</HD>

<LD>Some Southern Californians avoid freezing temperatures at nearly all
costs. But snow in the Rockies and post-holiday air fare specials may
inspire even the seriously cold-shy to venture onto the slopes or
head to frigid climes to visit loved ones, if only for a few days.
Once there, they may find that adapting to cold weather, especially
after years of frost-free living, can be a challenge.</LD>
<LD>   While physiologists dismiss the old saw that living in a warm
climate thins the blood, they concede that the less time we spend in
cold weather, the harder it becomes to adapt to it. Certain people
do, they say, adapt more easily. But we can all improve our tolerance
of freezing temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   If you routinely travel between cold and warm regions, you adapt
more easily than someone who visits cold climes infrequently, says
Michael Sawka, chief of thermal and mountain medicine at the U.S.
Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Mass.
"The more you are exposed to cold," he says, "the better your body
gets at handling it."</LD>
<TE>   When you are subjected to low temperatures, your blood vessels
constrict to preserve heat. You shiver, which produces more body heat
and boosts the metabolic rate. Your blood pressure may rise.</TE>
<TE>   As we age, our ability to withstand the cold, or thermoregulation,
tends to decline, says Lawrence Duffy, a professor of biochemistry at
the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. In general, heavier people adapt
to the cold more easily than thinner people because their
surface-to-mass ratio keeps them warmer, Duffy says. And body fat "is
a good insulator," says John Castellani, a research physiologist with
the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. "Heat
can't move as well through the layer of fat sitting under the skin."</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically women have a slight insulation advantage, at least
when unclothed, because of their generally higher percentage of body
fat, Duffy says. But Castellani notes that women are usually smaller
than men, and they often have less muscle mass to generate heat by
shivering, so they are actually more likely than men to complain of
feeling cold.</TE>
<TE>   Some medications, including certain blood pressure-lowering drugs,
can reduce tolerance to cold, at least in elderly patients. Those on
medications should check product literature or ask a pharmacist if
the drugs could affect their response to cold weather.</TE>
<TE>   A few days or, preferably, weeks before a trip to a frigid locale,
you can help acclimate yourself by taking a 30- to 60-minute walk in
the chilly night air daily or every other day, Castellani says. Sawka
notes that this regimen will help your body adapt by getting it
accustomed to increasing blood flow to the hands more quickly, for
instance. "To get the body in shape for cold, get a little chilly
[before you go]," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the cold, dress for it. "Be sure all extremities are
covered," Duffy advises. Some experts say it's a good idea to
remember the acronym COLD--stay Clean, avoid Overheating, Layer and
keep Dry. Soiled clothing can interfere with ventilation and keep
moisture from wicking away from the skin. If you overheat, your
clothes will become sweaty, and that makes them lose their insulating
capacity. Layering clothes is particularly advised if you will be out
in the cold for a prolonged period.</TE>
<TE>   The layer next to the skin should ideally be silk or a synthetic
such as polypropylene, Castellani says. The middle layer, which he
says is most important, should be fleece. And the outer layer should
be resistant to wind and water.</TE>
<TE>   For cold-weather workouts, synthetics are probably better than
cotton, according to researchers who compared the two and published
their findings last month in the journal Medicine &amp; Science in Sports
&amp; Exercise. The study evaluated subjects exercising indoors in warm
rooms. The researchers found no difference in their skin temperatures
or heart rate whether they wore cotton or synthetics. But cotton
clothes retained more sweat, which in the cold would translate to a
loss of insulation.</TE>
<TE>   In extreme cold it's also important to cover the face. "We had a
visiting professor here who got frostbitten cheeks just walking
around campus," Duffy says. "It was minus 20 or minus 30; since then
it's warmed up to 20 above."</TE>
<TE>   Frostbite, the freezing of the skin or underlying tissues, can
occur in only a few minutes, especially if there is a high wind-chill
factor. Particularly susceptible are the hands, feet, ears and face.
Redness usually develops first as the body gets blood flowing to the
region, says Dr. Stephen Ross, chief of staff at Santa Monica-UCLA
Medical Center. Then the skin may turn white and waxy or, in advanced
stages, gray-blue or black.</TE>
<TE>   There can be a fine line between simple numbness from the cold and
frostbite, Ross says. If you feel numb and don't warm the region, it
can progress quickly to frostbite.</TE>
<TE>   Medical help is advised even for mild frostbite. Until it is
available, the affected areas should be warmed by rinsing them with
water that is warm, not hot, to the touch of the person administering
first aid. If no warm water is available, Ross says, try blowing on
the skin. Then cover the area.</TE>
<TE>   Another cold-weather risk is hypothermia, the potentially fatal
lowering of the body's core temperature to less than 95 degrees
Fahrenheit. It is a risk especially to someone who isn't used to the
cold, Ross says.</TE>
<TE>   A victim of hypothermia will experience chills, shaking and muscle
aches. As the body temperature drops, mental confusion and slurred
speech can occur. At this point it is essential to get to a warmer
environment and get medical help, Ross advises. And it's a mistake to
think jumping around will warm you up, he adds; staying still will
preserve more heat.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking alcohol makes you feel warmer, but don't be fooled.
"Alcohol will make you lose more heat," Ross says. "It dilates
surface blood vessels," allowing heat to escape.</TE>

<LD>I take exception to your article "Air Tickets' Base Price Is Just
Part of the Fare" (Travel Insider, Jan. 6). You make it sound as
though the airlines are the only ones that charge fees and taxes on
top of their base price. Why are you picking on an industry that will
have a multibillion-dollar loss for last year? I, for one, will be
glad to pay an extra $10 per round trip for security.</LD>
<LD>   Let's not forget about cruise ships. The last cruise I sailed on,
the taxes and fees were $139.75 per person. For four, that was an
additional $559.</LD>
<LD>   I just made travel plans. The rental car costs $330. With the
concession recoupment fee, rental maintenance fee, license fee and
state tax fee, the total for the rental is $375. That is about 13% in
taxes and fees. For the hotel, there are a sales tax of 4.166% and a
7.25% transient accommodations tax, plus a resort fee of $12 per
night.</LD>
<TE>   Please do not pick on one industry when all charge these fees and
taxes.</TE>

<LD>I was surprised by Susan Spano's question ("Writers Who Have Gone
Before Us Evoke Afghanistan's Past and Present," Her World, Jan. 6).
She asks, "How much more dangerous, demoralized and dilapidated must
it be now, after U.S. bombing, the exodus of millions of Afghans to
neighboring countries and the demise of the Taliban?"</LD>
<LD>   Because of the demise of the Taliban, I would imagine that the
women of Afghanistan would feel liberated, energized and full of hope
for their future.</LD>

<LD>Christopher Reynolds, always insightful, eloquent, concise and
delightfully funny, has outdone himself with his article ("Looking
Back, Going Forward," Dec. 30). His comment regarding the "remarkable
bargain" that is "struck every time an American pledges allegiance"
is the clearest description I've seen of what last year meant to us
as Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Spano's comment about how empty it was to have no airplanes
in our night sky also struck a chord. Tears streamed down my face on
the first night after Sept. 11 that I could look out my Marina del
Rey window and see the "string of pearls" on final approach to LAX.
Man dreamed for many thousands of years of the miracle of flight. It
is not a privilege to be given up easily over threats from
self-righteous, twisted minds.</LD>
<LD>   Although neither writer gave advice on whether Americans should
travel, as an American who does not work in the travel industry, I
feel free to encourage everyone to travel. It is as much an act of
patriotism and compassion as donating to the Red Cross, and the
results are more immediate.</LD>
<TE>   The airline captain who greeted me in the jet bridge 11 days after
Sept. 11 will keep his job if you and I keep flying.</TE>
<TE>   The maid in the New York hotel will keep her job if you and I keep
traveling. The friendly and helpful man at the rental car counter at
Albuquerque airport, the busboy in Kansas City, Mo., the man in the
gift shop at the Metropolitan Museum in New York all will keep their
pride and their jobs. They will know we support them if you and I
keep traveling.</TE>
<TE>   And you and I can stand up, look in the face of hatred and
ignorance and make it clear that it may have horrified us, but it did
not terrorize us. We Americans remain airborne and mobile; we remain
productive and alive. We remain free. We win.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: A fisherman is kept company by his reflection on Inle Lake in
central Myanmar (formerly Burma), where the Intha people are known
for their rowing technique. Fishermen balance one leg at the end of a
flat-bottomed boat and wrap the other around an oar, leaving hands
free to throw a spear or toss their conical nets. Los Angeles
resident Dan Davies, who took this photo in February, spent lazy
afternoons drifting around the lake's floating pagodas and gardens.
Davies debated about taking the trip, worrying that tourism, in
practicality or merely symbolically, would be supporting a government
known for human rights abuses. Ultimately the value of experiencing a
different culture won out. "I enjoy that part of the world," Davies
says. "The Buddhist culture, the architecture, the people--they're
all wonderful."</CP>

<HD>Walking Away From Sprawl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The theory that sprawl is bad for health has landed in some Orange
County business and development camps with about as much welcome as a
gnatcatcher settling down on a graded hillside.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental theory has been battled over down the line as Orange
County has built out in recent decades. But in fact, whatever the
merits of this latest argument, redevelopment more friendly to
walking has been springing up around the county. It's a trend that
should be encouraged.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after years of fights over environmental review, contests
over endangered species and uneasy truces over habitat preservation,
comes a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Preservation.</LD>
<TE>   The finding from top environmental health experts is that people
who live in suburbs don't walk or bike enough because of poor design.
Orange County has spread south and east after early postwar
development in North County and the early population of prime coastal
areas that were attractive initially as getaway or retirement places
for people of means.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk about planned communities, many aren't laid out
in a way that encourages foot or bicycle traffic. Today, sprawling
subdivisions have extended beyond Mission Viejo to Rancho Santa
Margarita, Foothill Ranch and Ladera Ranch, with more new
subdivisions on the drawing boards for former agricultural and
ranching land from Irvine south and east.</TE>
<TE>   If this theory is true, many of the arguments for the benefits of
suburban life, with its promise of mobility, clean air and space,
would be challenged even for upscale communities like Coto de Caza.
We hear a lot about empty-nesters returning to cities from the
suburbs to enjoy cultural life, restaurants and shops, but the notion
that suburbia has a cardiovascular downside is something new.</TE>
<TE>   Two researchers came up with the theory unapologetically,
dismissing the advertised health appeal of planned communities. One
author notes a study that shows that the average person living in
Washington D.C. walks 10,000 steps a day going from one place to
another, something that cannot be done in much of Orange County,
where people are more likely to go from garage to office parking
structure to distant mall or school. Another study cited in the
report suggests that students are four times more likely to be able
to walk to schools that were built before 1983, an indictment of
recent sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   The report is dismissed as "junk" by Laer Pearce, the Laguna
Hills-based spokesman for the Southern California Building Industry
Assn. It probably won't be possible to establish the truth of the
theory one way or the other, at least not immediately, although most
residents who spend too much time in car traffic no doubt will have
strong anecdotal opinions. Yet there are also many things people do
to stay fit in the suburbs, with a flock of health clubs, parks,
beaches and trails.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the suburbs aren't necessarily as suburban as they used
to be. In recent years, there has been a trend toward neighborhood
redevelopment, with downtown districts getting spruced up in Orange
and Fullerton. Not everybody can walk to these areas even if they
live nearby, but they do foster a sense of place that is an antidote
to the sprawl culture. Areas like the intersection of 17th Street and
Irvine Boulevard in Newport Beach have a neighborhood feel that,
except for the height of buildings, is very much like one of the many
neighborhoods of New York. By the way, this urban versus suburban
distinction isn't always as sharp as it seems. New York City since
the mid-1980s has seen an influx of franchise stores that make it in
some places feel like a condensed suburb, and you can't always get
there on foot.</TE>
<TE>   A commuter campus like Cal State Fullerton unavoidably has
students driving instead of living and working in a university
community, which no doubt is quite different from a place like
Washington's Georgetown. But the UC Irvine area is sprucing up its
local business and restaurant centers. As the county's land has built
out, people are talking about living in apartment buildings and
walking to stores and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too late to rectify much of what has happened with the
planting of wide boulevards and great distances between communities
that force people to be stuck in traffic. But even as a sprawl has
afflicted Orange County, there are other dynamics at work.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County ought to continue this trend of creating
neighborhoods, even if people do get their pedestrian work on
treadmills. A people-friendly community environment, where people can
walk and bicycle places, is good for the soul as well as the heart.</TE>

<LD>Last season the Anaheim Angels finished 41 games out of first place.
The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim are sitting in last place in the National
Hockey League's Pacific Division--and in league attendance. And
that's just the sports teams in the magic kingdom of the Walt Disney
Co.</LD>
<LD>   Things aren't so rosy with the company's other ventures. In 2001
the box office and gate for its movies and theme parks were down, and
its network TV ratings fell off too.</LD>
<LD>   But things may be looking up for Disney's sports teams in this new
year. And that could have a direct effect on the morale of its
long-suffering Angel and Duck fans, and on the county's sports scene,
which now can only look to a former county team, the St. Louis Rams,
for the thrills of a winning season and postseason play.</LD>
<TE>   Just as changing managers can boost hope for a bad team, there is
optimism now that Tony Tavares has resigned as president of the
Anaheim Sports Division. Tavares ran the Angels and Ducks virtually
as the final authority until last year, when a reorganization made
Paul Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and resort division, his
boss.</TE>
<TE>   Guilty or not, Tavares bore the blame for the lackluster play of
the teams and their failure to win. As he noted in resigning, "Losing
money and losing on the field makes a job like this unbearable." He
also understood how some fans might rejoice in his departure, but
said that while "it's a good day for them, it's a great day for me."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares and Pressler, however, both realized and publicly
acknowledged that the answer to losing games, money and fans is to
build a competitive and winning team. Pressler says Disney is now
focused on that. We can only hope Disney is serious and is not
sprinkling more magic marketing dust. After years of disappointment,
and watching the Rams go on to glory elsewhere, Orange County is
overdue for the kind of civic boost that comes from a winning
professional franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the fact that the Angels and Ducks have plenty of room
for improvement, the feeling, and most probably the reality, that has
haunted county sports fans is that Disney hasn't really cared about
winning as much as fielding an entertainment product that would bring
people through the turnstiles, herd them to the souvenir stands and
prove to be a popular attraction for some prospective buyer or sports
group interested in taking one or both teams off its hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have made some moves in recent weeks, picking up two
starting pitchers by trading Mo Vaughn to the New York Mets for Kevin
Appier and signing free agent  Aaron Sele for $24 million. Pressler
also has authorized the Angels to go after another hitter, all of
which should help make them more competitive this season. They have
even changed their team logo and will sport new uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   But it's understandable if some fans still greet all this with
more reservations than enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   There haven't been any buyers willing to pay the price Disney is
seeking for teams that season after season not only keep losing games
but also drop out of contention too early to even generate the
excitement of a close finish. According to a report from the baseball
commissioner's office, the Angels say they have operating losses of
$100 million from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Will Disney, considering the declines in 2001 in its
motion-picture, television and theme-park holdings and a 28% drop in
its stock price in the last 12 months, really commit to spending what
it will take to make  both Orange County teams legitimate contenders?</TE>
<TE>   That's a question that concerns not only sports fans but also the
community in general. Orange County is a major metropolitan area of
nearly 3 million residents, the fourth-largest county in the nation,
and is bigger than 20 states. It also draws fans from the inland
communities. The community deserves not only major-league status but
major-league performance with all the economic and civic benefits
that brings.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has been wishing upon a Disney star for all of that
and more. The county sports dream is not only for contenders in the
teams it has, but also for major league basketball and football
franchises.</TE>
<TE>   Sports are important to a community. Teams that are competitive
and well-run can be economic assets not only to their owners but also
to many other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   But more than money and tax dollars, they also generate community
pride, unity and identity. Just look back a few months at the last
World Series and how New Yorkers and residents of Arizona embraced
their teams, and the community spirit their play produced. Orange
County should be so lucky.</TE>

<HD>Fixing Crystal Cove, or Coddling Residents?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Solution for Crystal Cove," Commentary, Jan. 6:</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman John Campbell's proposal to "save" Crystal Cove by
allowing mobile home residents to stay in El Morro is based on flawed
reasoning and, worse, a disturbing disregard for the rights of
Californians to have full access to their beaches. Crystal Cove and
El Morro are state parks, and thus belong to all of the people, not
just a privileged few who have managed to monopolize these areas and
limit public access over the years.</LD>
<LD>   Just as the state Parks Department found it was going against the
will of the people in its plan to lease Crystal Cove to a developer,
Campbell is trying to thwart the public by extending private leases
at El Morro. This is not a "solution" for Crystal Cove, as he claims,
but a coddling of special interests. I don't blame the renters for
wanting to stay, but it's time for them to say thank you and move on.</LD>
<TE>   Crystal Cove, in fact, has already been preserved, thanks to the
efforts of local activists. There will be no resort. And even though
the cottages have been declared a historic district (a designation
sought by the residents in order to stay their eviction), this does
not mean that all 46 cottages must be kept. Most of them are so
ramshackle that they should be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   I hope the department can find enough money to restore a few for
administration and education, returning the rest of the beach to its
natural form. As for El Morro, the trailer occupants should be
required to leave by 2004 as the present contract requires.</TE>
<TE>   Bette Anderson</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I too have walked and run the beach at Crystal Cove for years,
most recently with a group from the Sierra Club on a beach stroll.
The fact Campbell cites, that "cottages ... have been listed on the
National Register of Historic Places since 1979," is the cause of all
this trouble. The solution: reverse the historic listing and get out
of the $250,000-to-$400,000-per-cottage restoration cost. Sentimental
values don't cut it here; the state doesn't have the funds.</TE>
<TE>   As for the proposed hotel, the allowance of which was simply a
vehicle to get more money to support this ill-conceived cottage
restoration project, I'm especially glad that idea was thrown out the
window. Only the wealthy could have afforded to stay in one of the
hotel rooms for $400-plus per night. Alternatively, staying in a
restored cottage would lose its luster after the guest learns there
is no room service, or worse, the bar is too far for walking. And do
not forget beach concessions with exclusive roped areas for hotel
guests while humble citizens are relegated to the less attractive,
less accessible areas (trash barrels and portable toilets provided,
of course).</TE>
<TE>   Further, the citizens of El Morro mobile home park should not live
under the threat of increased rent as a source of restoration money.
To destroy the active and pleasant community of El Morro, only to be
replaced with a campground for itinerant citizens, is one of the
cruelest proposals ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Peri Tooker</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For years, past residents and other supporters of Crystal Cove
have suggested the idea of having the revenue of Crystal Cove State
Park be used directly for its upkeep. Unfortunately, state politics
and bureaucracy have created a massive "black hole" for those
revenues known as the California State General Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Between El Morro and Crystal Cove resident lease revenue, there
always has been surplus to provide for restoration and improvement.
Unfortunately, the Parks Department has not acted responsibly, and
now they've kicked out one sure revenue source (the past residents)
and have even less to fall back on. To me, it sounds as though the
state's plan for restoration is a pipe dream.</TE>
<TE>   May I suggest an addendum to Campbell's plan? Allow some residents
back into the cottages for now (say 30 of the 46 cottages). These
residents could be new or previous inhabitants. Charge a fair rate
for their occupancy. Use the rental increases from El Morro and
additional income from the 30 cottages and start the renovation now.
When the first phase of cottages is done, focus on another set, but
work it to keep some residents there to help pay for the costs and
keep up what is already there.</TE>

<TE>   Campbell's idea to extend the leases at the El Morro mobile home
park is not a good one and is terribly unfair to the vast majority of
his constituents as well as the public of California.</TE>
<TE>   We taxpayers paid the Irvine Co. $32.5 million for Crystal Cove
State Park in 1978. At that time the people in the mobile homes were
given very generous 20-year leases to adjust to the idea of having to
leave. In 1999 they were given a five-year lease and now, as the time
approaches for them to leave, they are using every means possible to
stay on indefinitely, including disseminating misinformation and
hiring a lobbyist and public relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   A public campground and use of that wonderful beach with parking
and picnic facilities for the use of the people of California are
planned for this part of the park. In an area that is lacking in
recreational facilities, this need is great.</TE>
<TE>   Our hope is that Campbell will rethink his plan and allow the
campground and beach conversion to begin promptly in 2004. The state
parks officials say they will have the necessary funds to proceed.
After 25 years it is time for the California public to have a chance
to enjoy this lovely spot.</TE>

<TE>   Campbell proposes extending the leases on the El Morro trailer
park for 10 years past their expiration date of 2004. We have urged
him not to do this for the following reasons:</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Cove State Park was acquired in 1979 with state open space
bond funds; at $32.5 million, it was the most expensive purchase in
the history of the state parks system. At the time, residents of the
El Morro trailer park were given 20-year, supposedly final leases.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1998 the trailer park leases were quietly extended five
years, to 2004, without any public review of the terms, and
consequently, without any concessions toward better public access.
Even the line of trailers right on El Morro beach was allowed to
stay.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Greenbelt Inc. supports full public access to Crystal Cove
State Park and the provision of overnight accommodations, including
campgrounds, for the public. Currently, only a few hike-in campsites
exist in the park. Although public access is not perceived as a
traditional environmental issue, it is an issue for our organization
because of the modest amount of land open for public recreation in
Orange County, and especially along the Southern California coast.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's ostensible reason for sponsoring lease extensions is to
raise money from trailer rents for the rehabilitation of the Crystal
Cove historic cottages in the face of a state deficit. Using the
cottages as an excuse for prolonging the trailer park leases beyond
2004 is a red herring. Deficits come and go. The state budget is up
one year and down the next; what counts is commitment. The state
Parks Department has demonstrated unwavering support for the
preservation of the cottages and their rehabilitation for public use
since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The department staff is now well-embarked on public planning
processes for both the historic district and the El Morro cove. We
support that process fully as the best way to bring about timely,
full public access to the park.</TE>
<TE>   Even with no further lease extension, it will be more than a
quarter of a century from initial purchase until there are
significant overnight opportunities for the public in Crystal Cove
State Park. This beautiful wilderness park belongs to all
Californians. They've waited long enough to fully enjoy their park.</TE>

<TE>   President</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Greenbelt Inc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 11 letter, Val Carson seems to overlook the fact that
public funds were paid in 1979 to buy the historic district cottages
and beach for the use of all Californians. Public funds will also be
used to restore the cottages.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 22 years since the public purchase of Crystal Cove,
and it is about time that the people of California are permitted to
enjoy overnight stays at the cove in a natural setting. There are
sufficient art galleries, museums, stores and cafes available in
Laguna Beach and Newport Beach so that such facilities are not
necessary in the beautiful setting of this cove.</TE>
<TE>   California families should be permitted to experience the same
beauty of the cove that the former tenants enjoyed and monopolized
for years. Let's not again reserve this publicly owned treasure for a
privileged few.</TE>

<LD>Re "Report Deals a Blow to Suburbs," Jan. 7:</LD>
<LD>   As I read about urban sprawl and its effects on public health
issues, I felt I must respond to both the Centers for Disease Control
report and the counterpoint offered up by Laer Pearce, spokesman for
the Southern California Building Industry Assn. I confess, as a
certifiable tree hugger, I found both sides a bit too strident to be
fully credible.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County has been my home since 1978 (with a six-year break
when I lived in Westport, Conn., during the 1990s). With most of my
friendship base and family still living in Los Angeles where I was
born and raised, I have considered moving back to the home sod.
However, I find it extremely difficult giving up the network of
bikeways that have allowed me to stay active.</LD>
<TE>   While I am very concerned about urban sprawl, I will have to give
some credit to the occasionally embattled Irvine Co. and the
developers associated with it for including public parks and bikeways
among the perks for living in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Riding a bike in Los Angeles is akin to taking a death wish to new
heights. Public parks are few and far between. On a clear day, you
can see your thumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's air is getting pretty rank as well, which brings
up the issue of just how much sprawl we can take. But I believe I
have far more opportunities in Orange County for exercise and other
healthy pursuits, including hiking in the parks and hillsides, than I
had in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Enmity solves nothing. To harmoniously clear these philosophical
hurdles, builders would do well to seek out and work with
environmental planning specialists. These two groups should create a
healthy relationship that spawns open and honest communication. Only
then will we find the balance between conserving natural resources
while providing housing for an expanding population.</TE>

<TE>   Orange County has a form of eating disorder. Liken this
increasingly dense suburbanized region to a person caught up in the
endless cycle of binge eating, weight gain, then devouring yet more
to support the overexpanding body.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes that infrastructure and neighborhoods are
antiquated and overwhelmed. The Building Industry Assn. has the
solution: Build more. When a human does this, the syndrome (cycle) is
obvious, resulting in obesity and ill health. The entire body
(county) suffers.</TE>
<TE>   The association spokesmen refuse to look into the "environmental
mirror," pitching their usual rhetoric of libertarian rights, in the
name of "more money, more money."</TE>
<TE>   Calling the study done by the Centers for Disease Control "junk,"
the correct metaphor was inadvertently reached: Orange County is
hooked on "junk food," that is to say, out of control, unbridled
development that will result in a lessened quality of life, and the
premature death of what made it attractive to residents in the first
place. No one wants to face facts: We need a zero-growth amendment, a
delay in all new large developments like Rancho Mission Viejo, until
we catch up to our imminent environmental entropy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tollway Drivers Hit With Fee Hike," Dec. 14:</LD>
<LD>   It's time the toll roads incorporate value pricing. When I
switched from paying cash to using a transponder some time ago, I was
surprised that transponder users received no added benefit other than
saving a minute of two at the toll booth. The Transportation Corridor
Agencies incurs additional costs staffing the cash booths and
counting the money. The overhead for the transponder's automatic
withdrawal of money is obviously less costly. Why shouldn't
transponder users get a break?</LD>

<TE>   I was under the assumption that my tax dollars funded the Orange
County Transportation Authority and that it has a mission to improve
transportation throughout the county. I fail to see how the purchase
of the 91 Express Lanes will accomplish this. When I drive the
Riverside Freeway in the morning, I never even thought of spending my
money to improve this wonderful drive. However, a lot of folks from
outside our county would love to have OCTA spend our money to help
them get into Orange County. I believe in charity, but this wonderful
gesture would serve only to clog our freeways even more.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute. Now I see. OCTA will have a job forever fighting
the gridlock in Orange County should the capacity of the Riverside
Freeway be increased. Silly me. I just thought we were being nice to
the neighbors because we had a lot of extra cash.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pep Team Tryouts Get Jeered," Jan. 6:</LD>
<LD>   Ever since my daughter was young, knowing she would eventually
face the societal brainwashing that to be a cheerleader is the be-all
and end-all, I have programmed her to avoid any cheerleading
aspirations. Why direct competent athletic girls into cheerleading
instead of gymnastics or track? To use their talents as a sort of
sideshow at the more important, usually male football, baseball and
basketball games is pathetic.</LD>
<LD>   While I do not consider myself a feminist, I am embarrassed, not
impressed. And to think it may encourage these competent young women
to aspire to become professional cheerleaders is alarming. Not to
mention the social schism that cheerleading creates at our high
schools. Most cheerleaders come to believe that they are in a class
of their own.</LD>
<TE>   Kids who are excelling at academics are left to feel inferior to
the attention-getting cheerleaders. The turmoil at Newport Harbor
High could be easily avoided if we would simply direct our children
to a competitive sport.</TE>

<TE>   The principal is the victim of a district office failing to
support his authority and of board of trustees meddling. A policy was
inflicted on him from a previous incident to give the power for
selecting the cheerleaders to parent boosters instead of professional
employees. When they messed it up, he took action to fix it. He may
or may not have made a wise decision.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder principals are hard to find these days.</TE>

No, what is of most urgency is getting to the bottom of "pompomgate"
at Newport Harbor High School. Maybe we can convene the grand jury.
Somebody call Ken Starr. Thank you, distinguished citizens of Newport
Beach, for proving that we truly are getting back to normal.</TE>

<TE>   I have a few suggestions on the cheerleading "crisis" in Newport
Beach. First, the administrators should skip cheerleading this year
and invest their money in a way that actually benefits students.</TE>
<TE>   Open the High School of Second Chances for pushy and overly
involved parents. Here, moms and dads can pay to relive, or
re-create, their own high school fantasies. Moms can be cheerleaders
and homecoming queens. Competitive dads can try to be the super-jock
they think their kids should be.</TE>
<TE>   While their parents are busy, the kids can finally concentrate on
what is really important: growing into responsible and mature adults.</TE>
<TE>   To the young ladies who won't be twirling around on the court this
spring: Move on; your life is not over.</TE>
<TE>   While I never tried out for cheerleading, I did join the track
team. I worked hard and ended up an All-American in the mile. I
graduated from USC after competing on a full athletic scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   I also know how it feels to be disappointed. In 1984, I missed
qualifying for the Olympic trials in the 1,500-meter run by just
0.3-second. I was devastated. But there are no petitions, "do-overs"
or tears to persuade the Olympic Committee to bend the rules. I
picked myself up and started on my next goal.</TE>
<TE>   You too need to move on. You'll be a stronger, more resilient
person because of it.</TE>

<LD>   In response to your rather gloomy article, I would like to make
you aware of the Fullerton Historic Theater Foundation. Our mission
is the preservation and restoration of Orange County's historic and
architectural landmark, the Fullerton Court Theater, known today as
the Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Our priority is to protect the theater from immediate danger and
further deterioration. We envision a partnership of citizens with the
city, business leaders and property owners to recapture the flavor
and function of a popular theater center in a lively downtown. For
further information, please call (714) 607-0884.</LD>

<LD>Re "Irvine Co., Indians Divided by a Wall Carving," Jan. 3:</LD>
<LD>   There does not seem to be much objection from the Indians about
the bulldozing of cave paintings while the Irvine Co. seems intent on
going ahead.</LD>
<LD>   In the Jewish Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem, the modern
dwellings have been built on ancient archeological sites. The
dwellings are built on pillions, sort of like parking garages.
Nothing has been sacrificed by either the archeologists or the
developers and homeowners.</LD>
<TE>   Obviously, no one in the controversy values the Indian cave
paintings enough to take such steps.</TE>
<TE>   J. Gregory Keen</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is outrageous that the Irvine Co. wants to bulldoze ancient
wall carvings. Preserving sites such as these is the least we could
do to show respect to the Native Americans. Not only is such
destruction unethical, ignorant and barbaric, it is also completely
unnecessary. There is no reason that houses cannot be built around
the archeological sites. The best architecture takes into account the
natural beauty and history of an area instead of scraping every trace
of it away. California's history must not be sacrificed for the
convenience of the Irvine Co.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hardware Seller Sizes Up a New Rival: Wal-Mart," Dec. 28:</LD>
<LD>   With regard to his column whining about Wal-Mart, Dana Parsons
needs to spend more time in Huntington Beach talking to activists on
both sides of the issue. His selective research and fuzzy conclusion
that big bad Wal-Mart is to sound the death knell of poor little
Crown Hardware insults the intelligence of the citizens of Huntington
Beach and the integrity of its City Council. Parsons implies that the
council approved the project in the face of "public protest." In
fact, Huntington Beach voters approved the Wal-Mart, a fact that
Parsons conveniently omits from his column. Get over it, Dana. The
people of Huntington Beach want a Wal-Mart and are smart enough to
let the ebb and flow of business decide who survives.</LD>

<HD>Voters Will Get Revenge by Passing Measure W</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the recent story regarding the Measure F court decision, Barbara
Lichman, executive director of the Airport Working Group, says, "This
win changes things greatly."</LD>
<LD>   Lichman is right. The decision reminds nearly 70% of Orange County
voters that their county government doesn't give a whit about what
they want and caters only to Newport Beach. Their revenge will be
passing Measure W by an even larger margin.</LD>

<TE>   Measure F, the anti-airport initiative, has been laid to rest. The
state appeals court in San Diego confirmed it was indeed an
"unworkable and excessive exercise of the initiative power."</TE>
<TE>   Measure W, the new anti-airport initiative that is trying to sell
voters on a big park, is just as deceptive. Hopefully, this time
voters will recognize it as a "bait-and-switch" scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport activists sent us dozens of glossy brochures with
pictures and promises of a beautiful park complete with museums,
sports facilities, etc. They said it wouldn't cost taxpayers a dime.
Common sense told me something was wrong with that picture.</TE>
<TE>   Our ballot information will state the park should not cost
taxpayers much money. For those projects that will make it a real
park, taxpayers will certainly end up paying, probably billions of
dollars. Measure W stands for "Won't Work." It is important that
voters not be fooled this time.</TE>

<TE>   What wonderful news. It seems the only opposition to Measure W
comes from George Argyros' camp of consultants. David Ellis has had
the nerve to complain that this is using taxpayer dollars to fund a
Great Park. What planet does he think will finance his airport? The
Airport Working Group boasts that it will have access to FAA grants
for an airport. Is this not taxpayer dollars under a different
moniker?</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a degree in math to total taxpayer moneys the
county has already spent for an airport. What was that tally before a
court order mandated them to stop spending? $50 million? Measure W
has my vote March 5.</TE>

<TE>   With the growing debate on whether the El Toro property should be
an airport or a park, I think we need to rely on what we know for

<TE>   An airport will bring in money and a park will cost money. The
bigger the park, the more money it costs to build and maintain.
Airports are known as economy boosters. The airport will create far
more jobs than a park.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Debate Focuses on Contamination Levels," Letters, Jan.
6:</TE>
<TE>   With regards to Donald Nyres' letter, I am hoping that Orange
County citizens make the right choice in the upcoming election. That
is, to stop wasting money on an unwanted and unneeded airport at El
Toro. Most people in Orange County deserve to have a real voice in
its redevelopment. To equate these concerns to an act of "bigotry"
toward others that are suffering the negative effects of the very
thing that many of us feel is unnecessary is truly amazing to me.
Does that mean that airport supporters have come down to this:
Playing the "race card"?</TE>
<TE>   Please, Mr. Nyre, your concerns would seem much more real if you
went to those neighborhoods and protested the expansion of the
facilities that "unduly" affect them.</TE>

<LD>Re "Updating Words of Comfort to Warriors," Jan. 5:</LD>
<LD>   So, a 16-year-old Boy Scout from Orange spent three years updating
and diversifying a 1940s devotional for American service members
titled "Strength for Service to God and Country." Talk about being
out of touch with reality--1940? Don't the Scouts realize how much
this country has evolved in 60 years? A selection from this religious
tome for Sept. 11, 1940, reads in part: "It chooses men like the
apostles who, after being treated in a most shameful way and cruelly
flogged, came from that experience rejoicing that they were counted
worthy to suffer for the name of Christ." How quaint. How
anachronistic. How politically incorrect. No wonder the Boy Scouts
have so many political enemies.</LD>

<LD>News flash! Politics can be a very dirty game. Dirty even in
relatively small towns like my hometown of Tustin, where I ran
unsuccessfully for a seat on the City Council in November 2000. In
fact, after that election, a Times editorial remarked on how nasty
the 2000 local elections were: "Some contests, notably in Irvine and
Tustin, were marked with mudslinging and hit pieces sent out just
days before balloting, making questionable personal attacks on
candidates. Some of those may also result in lawsuits."</LD>
<LD>   Well, The Times was right. In Irvine, winning City Council
candidate Chris Mears filed a lawsuit over allegations that the able
attorney and local columnist had evaded taxes for numerous years. The
allegations were unambiguously proved to be false, but Mears simply
settled the case in exchange for a formal, public apology. He
recognized that it's not so easy for a public figure to prove
defamation in the courtroom. And even if one is successful, it's yet
another thing to receive a judgment for monetary damages.</LD>
<TE>   In my campaign, I was well-positioned to win, but a last-minute
smear piece cost me the election. Among other lies, the mailer
alleged that Ken Morrison "took a walk on his student loan." As I
proved in Superior Court, I never had a student loan in my life. The
court awarded me $5,000 plus costs, the maximum amount allowed under
law because I filed my lawsuit in the court's Small Claims division.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I am a lawyer and am able to represent myself, I made
the very calculated decision to file my claim in Small Claims Court
because I was simply seeking to vindicate my reputation and wanted a
swift verdict. In fact, I was never interested in the money and
intend to donate the proceeds to good-government charities.</TE>
<TE>   More important, I regarded my case as somewhat of a test and now
want to encourage future political candidates (especially those who
are not lawyers or very wealthy) to use my approach to fight back
against the repulsive tactics of personal destruction and character
assassination. Campaigns certainly can be spirited and aggressive,
but the line is clearly crossed when outright lies are made to
destroy decent people.</TE>
<TE>   When used wisely, Small Claims Court can be a useful weapon in
relatively modest local campaigns to help keep political candidates
honest and accountable for what they say about their opponents. And
for those harmed, it's a way to get a little quick justice.</TE>
<TE>   However, to help ensure an award for damages, defamed candidates
should make sure to incur expenses in responding directly to the
defamatory remarks. This can be done by sending out a response mailer
or taking out a paid advertisement in the local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   If they make sure to spend at least $5,000, they will have a much
easier time getting the maximum award. The legal burden for proving
economic damages incurred as a result of responding directly to the
lies is much lower than for proving noneconomic or exemplary damages.</TE>
<TE>   If more victims of these filthy campaign tactics use this route to
vindication, it won't take long to get the word out to the local
slime crowd that it will cost them an additional $5,000 out of their
own pockets each time they cross that clear line. In addition, each
courtroom judgment against them will mean some negative publicity
exposing them for the liars they are.</TE>
<TE>   As with Mears and in all too many other cases, my political
opponents never attacked me on any issue of substance; it was only
character assassination. And all too often, as in the Mears case and
mine, if opposition research fails to find any dirt on a clean
opponent, desperate candidates hellbent on winning at all costs
simply will fabricate something to discredit their honorable
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   We are plagued by these horrendous dirty tricks because, until
voters start to reject them, they work. In the meantime, it's up to
candidates to fight back and send the message that spreading outright
lies and engaging in personal attacks and character assassination are
not simply par for the course in local politics.</TE>

<LD>As an American and an educator, I have given much thought since Sept.
11 to what makes the United States special. The events of that day
caused me to realize there have been few times in the short history
of our republic that our values and way of life have felt more
precious and essential to Americans than today.</LD>
<LD>   Fundamental to our very foundation as a nation of civilized people
is the simple fact that the United States is a democracy.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a new concept.</LD>
<TE>   The Greeks governed themselves in a democratic manner more than
2,500 years ago. What the Greeks conceived, however, we Americans
propelled to greater heights.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining a democratic society in today's complex world has been
the hallmark of our success as a leader among nations.</TE>
<TE>   My greatest wish for the coming year is that adults everywhere
send a clear message to today's schoolchildren that our democracy is
alive and well, and worth preserving for generations to come.</TE>
<TE>   Communicating this idea across our nation not only will nourish
the current wave of patriotism but also will help our youth
understand why our republic is worth defending and saving. I can't
think of a better civics lesson for them.</TE>
<TE>   The Founding Fathers understood all too well that empowering
Americans to rule themselves through a representative government
could work only if citizens made decisions according to popular will
or the values and interests of the population.</TE>
<TE>   We know that such call to action does not work if people are
unlearned.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 years ago, Horace Mann, frequently regarded as the
"father of public education," said: "A republic cannot long remain
ignorant and free, hence the necessity of universal popular
education."</TE>
<TE>   From the very inception of our nation, one of the pillars upon
which our democracy is grounded is the notion that all citizens have
not just a need but also a right to have access to knowledge and
information; a right to be educated.</TE>
<TE>   Our public school system has guaranteed that right for more than
two centuries. It continues to be the cornerstone of a system that
keeps our country free.</TE>
<TE>   In this nation, public schools exist to educate everyone's
children. No child is cast aside.</TE>
<TE>   It frankly does not matter what a child's race, ethnicity or
gender is; what learning abilities he or she may or may not possess;
whether he or she is rich or poor; whether a child is incorrigible or
as likable as can be.</TE>
<TE>   This opportunity means everything in a democracy, because
education is a citizen's ticket to success--the good life.</TE>
<TE>   It also means that every American can contribute to keeping our
democracy alive through active and informed participation as a
citizen, voter or even representative of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Today more than ever we must find ways to show Americans the
critical connection between learning and liberty, thus helping all of
us appreciate the power and role of public education.</TE>
<TE>   Conveying that message might just be one of the greatest gifts we
give to our nation at this time.</TE>

<HD>A Modest Man Leaves Behind a Rich Legacy</HD>
<DH>C.R. Johnson did far more than tend the boilers at Cal
State Northridge. He believed in empowering students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boiler operator's gift took most of his life to save. Yet rather
than give the money to estranged relatives, he bequeathed it to the
university that had become his second home.</LD>
<LD>   A tall man with a thin mustache, thick wavy hair and an unassuming
demeanor, C.R. Johnson mastered the principle of saving more than he
spent.</LD>
<LD>   He lived in a modest house in Arleta, sipped McDonald's coffee for
breakfast and invested much of his state-employee salary in
government securities. His one indulgence was a late-model Lincoln
Mark VIII that he drove to lunch at an all-you-can-eat restaurant
every so often.</LD>
<TE>   For more than two decades, it was Johnson's job to keep the power
flowing on the 353-acre campus of Cal State Northridge. But he did
much more.</TE>
<TE>   The boiler operator--dressed in workpants, shirt and
shoes--approached mechanical engineering professor Tim Fox in the
late 1970s and floated an idea for a campus cogeneration facility.
His idea called for using excess steam from the boiler plant to
generate electricity for the campus and, eventually, the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Fox enlisted engineering students to draft preliminary
plans. The team won a state research grant and got technical support
from a Rocketdyne engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Although the project never got off the ground, the discussions set
into motion hands-on learning and energy conservation programs that
remain in place.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to learn the theory, but it's very important to
have hands-on experience," said John Guarrera, director of the Center
for Research and Services at the campus College of Engineering and
Computer Science.</TE>
<TE>   "When the mechanical engineering students go into the power plant,
they get a sense of the magnitude of the machinery," he added.
"Before C.R.'s idea, students relied on pictures and videos."</TE>
<TE>   During those plant tours, Johnson peppered his talks with
anecdotes about his time spent in Oklahoma oil fields and on offshore
drilling platforms, as well as a stint in the Navy. Beyond that, he
rarely talked about himself.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Johnson retired in 1983, he still drove the Mark VIII
to campus and took Guarrera out for chicken livers at the
all-you-can-eat lunch buffet.</TE>
<TE>   On one of those campus visits, Johnson mentioned to Guarrera and
Fox that he wanted to bequeath his estate to the engineering school
within the College of Engineering and Computer Science. He wanted to
know how to make the gift. Because the school would be the
benefactor, Guarrera thought it best that the arrangements be handled
by a private attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson contacted Van Nuys lawyer John Garvin, who drew up the
papers. All the while, Johnson continued to lunch now and then with
Guarrera, a respite from the round-the-clock care of his invalid
wife, Ila, who died in April 1990.</TE>
<TE>   His devotion to her became public after he told Fox and Guarrera
that he intended to fund a $1,500 engineering scholarship in her
honor. At an awards ceremony, he let Fox give the scholarship while
he stood in the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   After Ila's death, Johnson spent mornings sipping coffee with his
breakfast bunch at McDonald's, never letting on about the size of his
estate.</TE>
<TE>   Then this fall, Johnson's friends became concerned when he didn't
show up for coffee for a few mornings. They called his house. No
answer. They pounded on the door. No response. They called the
police. Officers forced open the door and found Johnson in bed,
apparently having died in his sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his death in October, Guarrera and Fox received a
copy of Johnson's will and the trust fund he had established for the
college. Guarrera and Fox were named trustees of the estate.</TE>
<TE>   "We were totally surprised by the amount of the gift," Guarrera
said. "I figured he must have had something saved up, but the
magnitude of the gift was a surprise to everyone on campus."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had left the school $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   The money, the largest individual gift in the engineering and
computer science college's history, will be used to fund two $1,500
scholarships annually, one each named for C.R. Johnson and Ila
Johnson. As the fund grows, money will be used to enhance mechanical
engineering and energy conservation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's gift has inspired faculty and staff members to consider
making contributions to the college, said Tammy I. Glenn, director of
development and public relations for the College of Engineering and
Computer Science.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more of an awareness of the impact you can make on your
work environment," she said. "He was your average state employee, but
he has a huge impact here."</TE>
<TE>   The College of Engineering and Computer Science acknowledged the
gift in November by renaming one of its facilities the C.R. and Ila
Johnson Memorial Engineering Auditorium, honoring the boiler
operator's legacy in bronze letters.</TE>

<HD>Davis Budget Calls for Array of New Fees</HD>
<DH>Finance: The administration says the proposal would raise
$143 million by making users pay more for services they receive from
the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis made very clear last week, he found a way to close
the state's $12-billion budget shortfall without new taxes.</LD>
<LD>   New fees, however, are another matter.</LD>
<LD>   Buried within the nearly 1,500 pages of the governor's
$100-billion budget proposal is an array of increased fees and
penalties totaling, by the administration's count, $143million.</LD>
<TE>   At the receiving end are some of society's most politically
unpopular members: polluters, drunk drivers, power producers,
insurance companies and assorted scofflaws. Fines paid by criminals
would rise by 20%, for example. A $25,000 application fee would be
levied on new power plants, and filing fees for DUI offenders who
appeal suspension of their licenses would grow to $120 to cover their
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, who are conducting their own analysis of the budget,
peg the amount of new fees at nearly $500 million and contend that
they target college students, struggling parents and sick, poor
people as well.</TE>
<TE>   With the quarter-cent hike in the state sales tax that took effect
this month, new revenue in the Davis budget is projected at $1.3
billion to $1.7 billion, according to tax watchdogs. "It's a
transference of wealth from the private sector to the government, and
consumers will ultimately bear higher prices," said Jon Coupal,
president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Timothy Gage said the fees and penalties
were fashioned so that users pay a larger share of the cost of
services they are receiving from the state, ranging from regulating
pollution to maintaining driver records.</TE>
<TE>   The fee on insurers and others who request driver information
would rise from $2 to $4, raising $40 million. Drivers who are late
with vehicle registration fees could see penalties jump 90%, which
would bring in an additional $25million.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce M. Brusavich, president-elect and legislative chairman of
Consumer Attorneys of California, an association of 4,000 trial
lawyers, took issue with a Davis proposal to tack a 10% surcharge on
civil filing fees. The increase is expected to generate $15.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years they've been making it more and more expensive to
get justice," Brusavich said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also wants to begin charging power plant builders a $25,000
fee to cover the cost of having their applications processed by the
state Energy Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy
Producers, said that because power producers spend several million
dollars to get a project through the approval process, it was unclear
whether a $25,000 fee would discourage new applicants. He added,
however, that the state should be doing everything it can to get new
plants up and running. If the economy rebounds at midyear as
expected, he said, power consumption will rise dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," he said, "nobody likes having their fees increased."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, praised Davis' strategy of raising targeted fees
rather than administering even deeper cuts to state services.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're very reasonable," said Jean Ross, executive
director of the California Budget Project, a group that advocates for
the poor during the budget process. "I think what they are saying is
that people who are taking advantage of a very specific government
service ought to pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   Ross said that fees levied by the state by law are not allowed to
exceed the cost of providing a service and that a fee must be used to
pay for the specified service.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who handles
budget matters for his caucus, said he is skeptical about how revenue
from fees is spent.</TE>
<TE>   "What can happen is that fees are not that," Campbell said. "The
money is put in the general fund and is spent on other services. In
those cases, I would say we're calling it a fee but it's not."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans are counting as new fees a Davis proposal to
begin charging Medi-Cal recipients a $1 co-payment on prescription
drugs and a series of new child-care charges, which they contend will
raise about $240 million. The Davis administration estimates those
fees, which it did not factor into the acknowledged increase, will
total $185million and will be used to assist more working poor
families with child care.</TE>
<TE>   GOP lawmakers say they are concerned that a proposal to eliminate
a combined $64-million tuition subsidy paid to the University of
California and California State University systems could result in
fee hikes for students.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say the state over-appropriated the
subsidy during the current fiscal year and is merely reducing the
systems' funding to reflect the glitch.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue talking to the state and see if that
money can be made available," said Brad Hayward, a spokesman for the
University of California.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect it to mean a fee increase and we're certainly not
in favor of a fee increase," state Department of Finance spokesman
Sandy Harrison said.</TE>

<HD>Lab Blaze Ruins Years of Genetic Research</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fire that tore through laboratories at UC Santa Cruz has destroyed
valuable genetic research that took years to develop, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire broke out early Friday on the fourth floor of Sinsheimer
Laboratories, the campus' primary biology building. It later flared
up twice more, said the university's Fire Chief Charles Hernandez.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, as many as 65 firefighters and 15 engines fought the
blaze, campus officials said. No injuries were reported.</LD>
<TE>   Although campus police were alerted to the blaze by a
heat-detection system, Hernandez said, the building did not contain a
sprinkler system because it was built in 1987, before fire codes
mandated one.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Ares, chairman of the molecular, cell and developmental
biology department, said many of the genetic strains in his lab took
14 years to develop and could take that long to replace.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a devastating situation," he said. "I don't know how far it
has set me back."</TE>
<TE>   Ares' work was related to the Human Genome Project, a national
effort to identify the tens of thousands of genes in human DNA. He
studies how genes act differently in healthy and diseased cells.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the damage done to Ares' lab and one other, the
Sinsheimer building suffered extensive water and smoke damage. Pump
trucks were brought in Saturday to help remove water from the
building, and many laboratory samples were moved elsewhere on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Campus spokesman Jim Burns could not estimate damages Saturday but
said it was sure to be in the millions.</TE>
<TE>   He said that a team of investigators from the California
Department of Forestry and the state fire marshal's office had
arrived Saturday to comb the building for clues as to the cause of
the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Their report is not expected for several days.</TE>

<DH>Palm Springs: A racial incident against a principal forced
a school to address simmering tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>An island of glitz in an otherwise bleak desert, this town has always
been a flawed paradise, tainted by a quiet history of racial tension.
So when students painted epithets and a swastika on the walls of Palm
Springs High School, civic leaders greeted the news with heavy hearts
and dejected resignation.</LD>
<LD>   But more than a year later, some of those same leaders, including
the school's African American principal, say they now view the
incident with a sense of irony. The graffiti, although it was an
overt reminder of lingering racism, has in some ways led to a renewed
sense of tolerance and harmony.</LD>
<LD>   "We are a stronger school and a better school because of it," said
Principal Ricky Wright. "It caused us to pull together."</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to tolerance, the Palm Springs area has always been
confounding.</TE>
<TE>   The region is a top destination for gays and lesbians--so much so
that it is home to a gay retirement community. The area revels in its
image as a precocious playground--an image reinforced recently when
the community shrugged after a resort decided to expand via a
nudists-only bridge over a busy downtown street.</TE>
<TE>   But some have been less accepting of certain ethnic and racial
groups.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, African American and Latino families began flocking
to the Palm Springs area, many to work on the nearby farms and
military installations. A number of them moved to a small parcel of
land called Section 14.</TE>
<TE>   Work was sporadic, and even when it was available, wages were
meager. The area had many impoverished families. City officials, busy
selling Palm Springs as a ritzy resort, didn't think Section 14 fit
in with that campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of homes were condemned. Many were burned. State officials
found that some families had been cast out without notice. To African
Americans in the area, the sweep cemented a separate-and-unequal
existence.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its increasing diversity, many saw the Palm Springs area
as divided among the haves--mostly white--and the have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   At Palm Springs High School, there were many racially motivated
arguments and fights throughout the 1980s and '90s, and federal
education investigators later found the largely white faculty guilty
of "negative stereotyping" of minority students.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, 18 students--including Asians and Latinos,
but no African Americans--scrawled a racial epithet on Wright's
office window and hung a dead black cat from a nearby clock tower.</TE>
<TE>   Wright suspended the students for five days and barred them from
graduation-week festivities, including commencement exercises. That
angered their parents, who felt the punishment was too severe. Wright
declined to press charges, and the Riverside County district
attorney's office said it did not have enough evidence to arrest the
students, which angered local minority leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that some of the students did not realize the impact it
would have," said Ronald Oden, director of a private vocational
college in Palm Springs, a three-term Palm Springs city councilman
and former chairman of the Palm Springs Human Rights Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "They initially thought it was a prank. But they didn't realize
how the community would be affected by the behavior.... What they
thought was going to be a joke turned out to be a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Wright and Oden say the incident forced the school to
address simmering tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Among other changes, aging textbooks were traded in for newer ones
with more multicultural themes. The Palm Springs Unified School
District hired more minority teachers. It educated the faculty in
tolerance and diversity. Some of those efforts were underway before
the incident, but school officials say the episode pushed them to the
top of the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   And, although no one knows for sure whether the changes are
linked, the school is beginning to document some encouraging trends.
The percentage of seniors who graduate rose from 91.5% in 1999-2000
to 95.9% in 2000-01, school records show. Suspensions fell by 7.5%
over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Confrontations still occur at Palm Springs High, as they do at any
school. But Wright says they are now one-on-one, kids-will-be-kids
exchanges, not disputes between entire racial or ethnic groups.
"You're always going to have issues that come up," Wright said. "But
now you don't have large groups that are consistently going after
each other. It's a different place."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the changes seen at the school will expand into the
broader community remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Palm Springs' old guard protested when civic
activists began holding tolerance and diversity seminars at the high
school.</TE>
<TE>   "The school district got some heat for doing this program," said
Martin Lax, a Palm Desert attorney and a volunteer who taught one of
the classes. "It's unfortunate, because we think the more educated
you are, the better off you are. It's a careful balancing act that
the school district found themselves in."</TE>
<TE>   And the work is not over, said Marjan Keypour-Greenblatt,
associate director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles. She
distributed anti-bias materials at the high school after the graffiti
incident and helped organize two seminars for parents: one that
warned them of hate material on the Internet, and another that
featured a viewing of the film "Journey to a Hate-Free Millennium."</TE>
<TE>   The graffiti incident "was used as a teachable moment for the
district, to build something positive and help the community come
together," said Keypour-Greenblatt.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it needs to be stated that this is ongoing work....
We constantly need to address our personal prejudices and find
positive and constructive ways to build alliances with those who are
different and are marginalized by society."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your issue about California and the Nobel Prizes was fascinating,
particularly the article about the triumphs and tragedies of William
Shockley ("The Twisted Legacy of William Shockley," by Michael A.
Hiltzik, Dec. 2). I knew Shockley in the 1950s when I was a beginning
patent attorney at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J. In the mid-'50s I often
lunched with Harry Hart, patent attorney extraordinaire and the dean of
our staff of 75 patent attorneys. At one lunch, [physicist] Walter
Brattain and Shockley joined us. As a junior attorney, I sat and listened
to this august group.</LD>
<LD>   The subject, raised by Shockley, was his plan to leave the
laboratories and set up his own research laboratory. Both Brattain and
Hart tried to dissuade him. I clearly recall Brattain saying, "You are a
research scientist and not an entrepreneur. You belong here, or maybe you
would be happier affiliated with a university." I detected only sincere
interest and concern on the part of Brattain for the well-being of
Shockley.</LD>
<LD>   At Bell Labs we had a very close scientific relationship with
MIT--more than we did with Stanford or Caltech. What if Brattain and Hart
had been successful in their appeal to Shockley? The birthplace of the
semiconductor and the integrated circuits industry might well have been
called the Silicon Highway, referring to the technology center along
Route 128 around Boston.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bravo to Martin Booe for sampling the Los Angeles solo dining scene
("Going Solo," Restaurants, Dec. 9). And kudos to the restaurants that
looked after him as if he were a party of 10. But why leave the quality
of a dining-out-alone experience to chance when savvy solo-dining
strategies are available? If you can claim cherished regular status
(highly recommended for solo diners) at a restaurant where they know your
name and are happy to accommodate your dropping in, no problem. If not,
it's easy to enhance the odds of receiving the hospitality you crave:
Make a reservation. So few solo diners do that the act of making one will
set you apart as a discerning solo diner, deserving of superb service.</LD>

<TE>   How nice to learn that self-involved baby boomers such as Patti Davis
think they have finally grown up at 50. Their parents grew up at 20,
fought a war, developed a country, and some of them evidently spoiled a
generation that is able to walk along a beach, study their navels and
grope through life.</TE>

<TE>   I don't know Patti Davis, and I have not been a fan of her dad's work
on the silver screen or in Washington. But on Dec. 9, three days before
my own getting-nearer-to-50th birthday, she gave me a very special and
personal birthday present in the form of her lovely essay. I'll tell you
what Patti: to celebrate both of our birthdays, I'm heading out to
Blockbuster to rent one of your dad's movies. Now that I'm older and
wiser (thanks to your charming and meaningful insights), I'll bet my
taste in movies has mellowed a bit. Happy birthday, Patti.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I well remember the day 25 years ago when i bought my first house.
I was so excited the night before the 10 a.m. closing that I couldn't
sleep, and I spent the first hours after dawn hiking in a park to calm my
nerves. I mean, I was going to own a home. I was going to be as stable,
as substantial--as adult--as my parents and grandparents and aunts and
uncles. No more downstairs neighbors with their odd cooking smells and
strange, muffled noises. No more contributing a check every month to
somebody else's net worth.</LD>
<LD>   It took a couple of decades of detaching roof shingles,
foundation-busting tree roots, wood-loving insect life and sclerotic
plumbing to reverse my psychology. I gradually came to feel more owned
than owning. I began longing to return to a state I'd mistaken for
deprivation and increasingly recognized as freedom.</LD>
<LD>   About a year and a half ago, my children having grown and my long
marriage having ended, I sold my house. I now live in a simple
one-bedroom apartment with about one-tenth the space of my former
domicile, which had three bedrooms and four (four!) baths. The air in my
present few rooms may be less voluminous, but it seems more oxygenated.</LD>
<TE>   Now my fond hope is never to own a house again. Although it conflicts
with that of the vast majority of Southern California renters, who yearn
to impoverish themselves for a place they can call their own, my highly
evolved thinking on this matter is increasingly in harmony with reality
in Los Angeles, where home ownership is, for most people, an economic
mirage receding into the smoggy horizon.</TE>
<TE>   According to the latest U.S. Census figures, L.A. now has a lower
percentage of homeowners, 39.6%, than anywhere save New York City. (We're
first, however, in the percentage of household wherewithal we pay for
housing.) A recent report by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at
Loyola Marymount University gives insight into why.</TE>
<TE>   Rising home prices continue to leave wages in the dust in L.A., the
income-disparity capital of America. In a single year, 1999 to 2000, the
median price of a home in Los Angeles County rose from $198,400 to
$220,620. To qualify for a conventional mortgage on such a dwelling, a
family has to make about $75,000 a year. Alas, the median household
income in the county is only $53,000. "The home ownership rate among 25-
to 45-year-olds--traditionally the source of most first-time home
buyers--has undergone an unprecedented decline," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Builders, meanwhile, have largely lost their taste for constructing
houses most people can afford. While plenty of building has been going on
in recent years, it has been of the upscale variety, which gives
developers the handsomest per-unit profit.</TE>
<TE>   The real reason for all this, however, is the same one that lies
beneath this region's every social ill, from bumper-to-bumper freeway
traffic to temporary classrooms taking over kids' schoolyards. It's an
issue public officials are loath to acknowledge, much less
address--unchecked population growth, most of it driven by immigration.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, L.A. County's populace grew three times faster than
the production of housing units. Moreover, it's projected to rise from
the current 9.5 million to 11.6 million over the next 19 years, a 22.1%
increase (the population of the five-county region is expected to jump
32.5%, to 21.6 million).</TE>
<TE>   The Loyola Marymount study states that unless higher population
densities are permitted by local authorities, land suitable for
residential development in Los Angeles and Orange Counties will be
exhausted in about 10 years. Even if all 165,600 available acres in L.A.
County are developed, they'll accommodate only 65% of the projected
growth in households by the year 2020.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, existing homeowners in places such as Ventura County
have panicked at the prospect of all remaining open space being turned
into housing tracts. Having bought in Ventura precisely for its openness,
they can envision the final swamping of their dwindling idyll. The growth
control initiatives undertaken in such places have further limited the
amount of new housing being built.</TE>
<TE>   Something has to give, and it's going to be the die-hard, post-World
War II American notion of the good life as defined by the affordable
single-family house on its own plot of land. There are already too many
people here to cram into that concept, and more are coming.</TE>
<TE>   To those destined to be out of the running, let me suggest that
apartment living isn't so bad, relatively speaking. Each morning from my
kitchen window, I look down on a garage that a young couple have made
into a home. It's probably illegal (there seems to be no toilet in the
place, judging from the frequent treks the occupants make to the
dilapidated house at the front of the lot). The housing report estimates
100,000 such garage dwellings now exist in L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   So, reluctant apartment-dwellers, take heart. A lot of people would
love to be in your place.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a Peiner SK575 tower crane 160 feet above a Santa Monica
construction site, Ron Caluya has spectacular views and a paycheck
commensurate to helming a 400,000-pound-capacity machine with a boom the
length of a football field. A 25-year veteran with more than 40 projects
under his belt, Caluya, 47, also consults for a crane manufacturer. For a
guy who began his construction career underground as a tunnel builder, he
now has the best seat in the house.</LD>
<LD>   How does a person train for this?</LD>
<LD>   The International Union of Operating Engineers has a program for crane
operators. The apprenticeship consists of three years, which include
schooling and 6,000 hours on the job. It's a trade that a lot of people
aren't wild about doing. It takes a unique person to get into something
like this.</LD>
<TE>   How do you control a crane?</TE>
<TE>   It's like playing Pac-Man. The operator is in a captain's chair. He
has two joysticks, one on the right that handles the hoisting up and down
and one on the left that handles the trolley in and trolley out and
swinging left and right. Also, you have a computer board and a monitor
[with] readings of the weight capacity, distance of the trolley, wind
factor, the gear modes. And you have your warning horns. It's like being
on a ship.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a system for coordinating lifts?</TE>
<TE>   The guys on the ground signal me as to what they want picked up over
the radio. I look to make sure they're rigging it right and that it's
balanced. Then I make sure that the load block is in the center of the
pick. I always come up really nice and easy. I bring it within a couple
feet and they let me know where to set it down.</TE>
<TE>   What's been your scariest experience?</TE>
<TE>   In 1990 we had a four-point earthquake while we were working on the
county jail in downtown L.A. I was up in my crane just watching the load
whip around. When you're up, there's nothing you can do. You just have to
ride the horse. [But] the worst experience was watching a guy fall over
the side of a building. That was horrifying and turned my stomach over.
Is it stressful to have lives in your hands?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever I'm doing, I'm thinking about being safe. If I let [stress]
bother me, then I don't belong up there. If I'm leery about a load, I
take my binoculars out and look at the load. A lot of new technology
they're coming out with on the crane will be cameras so the operator can
see the load itself.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about your weirdest lift.</TE>
<TE>   The most ridiculous thing was a five-gallon igloo water jug. The guys
didn't want to walk it up the ladder or wait for the elevator. When a
superintendent sees that, he throws a fit.</TE>

<LD>Invited to: Opening night of "Silverlining Silverlake," a two-night
celebration at the Paramour Estate in Silver Lake to benefit the
Hollywood Sunset Free Clinic.</LD>
<LD>   Tell us where it hurts: "I've never been to the clinic," says
indie-film princess Christina Ricci, co-hosting along with Robert Downey
Jr. for a second year. Not that visiting a free clinic should be the
stuff of celebrity bios, of course, but raising money to provide needy
Angelenos with health care certainly merits their involvement. As for the
entertainment, "it's the mother of all challenges to follow Elton John,"
declares Sting, second in a line of generous sets that include
performances by Daniel Lanois and Downey's ex-wife, Deborah Falconer.
Downey himself duets with both Sting and Elton. "It wasn't really until
after the first year that I started learning about what I'd hosted," says
Downey, a former "Ally McBeal" love interest. While a variety of
explanations might account for this, he may be relieved to hear Erika
Christensen of "Traffic" admit that she's not exactly up to speed on why
we're here. "I mean," she says of her first outing to the landmark
private residence that occasionally doubles as a party venue, "I just
believe in charity, period."</LD>
<TE>   we're on the list, too: Patricia Reeves, mother of Keanu, sports a
see-through lacy body wrap (this at an outdoor party on a chilly night).
Paramour habitue Beck checks out the fine-art items hanging for silent
auction on the seaweed-green tiles of the (yes, drained) swimming pool.
David Spade is briefly sighted. Otherwise, the rambling hilltop grounds
of the former Canfield-Moreno estate--whose neighbors aren't eager for
any return to its roaring '20s heyday--swell with Silver Lake hoi polloi
rather than Hollywood elite. No surprise there, considering that
community mollification requires guests to be shuttled up from a Kaiser
Permanente parking lot. But when fire marshals arrive and bar an
expanding crowd of bona fide $250 ticket-holders from entering, Paramour
proprietress Dana Hollister attempts some after-the-fact triage. "Anyone
who's got a comp, anyone who just got in and anyone who is a friend of
mine," her voice booms over the P.A., "if you got in free, I'm asking you
to leave."</TE>
<TE>Celeb Quotient:</TE>
<TE>   Anemic, considering the  megastar performers.</TE>
<TE>Wow Factor:</TE>
<TE>   Panoramic outdoor setting with festival-length concert that gives
neighbors apoplexy but delights guests.</TE>
<TE>Grazing Level:</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants such as Joseph's, Vienna Cafe, Coffee Table and Fabiolus
create an international buffet of falafels, goulash, gumbo, ziti; the
food is yummier than fancy hospital fare, but the long line is worthy of
HMO urgent care.</TE>

<LD>The ukulele was the furthest thing from Steve Salardino's mind as
he whipped his long hair around in the '80s to the goat-slaying sounds of
Brit-metal avatars such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. But during a
protracted period of unemployment in 1994, he was given a toy ukulele by
his friend Eddy French. The pair would pass afternoons on French's porch
with Salardino on uke and French slinging the banjo. "It gave me a way to
express myself that was simple," Salardino says. "And small. And not too
loud."</LD>
<LD>   Today, the two now sling strings with Jason Holley and Salardino's
younger brother, David, in Ukefink, a band joining pop songwriting with
off-kilter acoustic arrangements using instruments such as the ukulele,
banjo, National guitar, slide guitar, mandolin, pump organ, melodica,
cymbals, drums and cardboard boxes.</LD>
<TE>   Salardino, a 34-year-old Los Feliz resident who works at Skylight
Books, has begun to accumulate ukes, which he cherishes for their sound
and sentimental value. Ukes cranked out by renowned guitar manufacturer
Martin during the craze that swept America in the '20s are prized today,
but Salardino follows a simpler operating principle. "I could save $300
to buy a Martin, but I'd rather buy three or four $25 ukes," he says.
"The cheaper ukes of yesterday sound better than the cheaper ukes of
today." His collection features a koa wood Jonah Kumalae, a Waikiki and a
Harmony toy uke with a plastic fret board that he got at a flea market
for $25. More esoteric prizes include the Surfalele--complete with a long
curved neck designed to be jammed into sand at the beach--that Salardino
bought for $40 at a Hollywood junk store, and a Globe baritone resembling
a miniature four-string guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Salardino's approach to collecting reflects his aspirations for
Ukefink, which don't include major-label yearnings. "I find the music
industry to be completely satanic," he says. "I'd be happiest if everyone
stopped buying records and picked up an instrument and played it."</TE>

<LD>Miriam Larson hasn't forgotten losing swim meets to Esther Williams
at the Pasadena Athletic Club during high school, a competitive spirit
that continues to this day. Williams may have gone on to fame as a
mermaid of the silver screen, but Larson hasn't exactly been treading
water.</LD>
<LD>   The Unsyncables, the synchronized swimming team that Larson co-founded
in 1985, has taken four trophies for overall performance since 1997 in
the United States Synchronized Swimming Master's competition.</LD>
<LD>   Sports purists may crack wise, but "synchro," in which swimmers
perform choreographed routines with costumes and music, is a demanding
endurance discipline going well beyond the " 'Strictly Ballroom' with
water wings" image. After the sport debuted at the '84 Summer Olympics,
Larson, 82, and friend Lizzi Jakobsen of Arcadia joined a class at the
Pasadena YWCA, because, according to Jakobsen, 74, "regular swimming can
get boring." Seventeen years later, the Unsyncables owe much to the
coaching of Dawn Bean, 74, a synchro competition director at the '84
Olympics. The floundering group had sought out Bean in 1992 before
entering its first world competition. "I was horrified by what they were
trying to do," Bean says.</LD>
<TE>   The Unsyncables welcome swimmers of all experience levels and range in
age from 22 to 82.</TE>
<TE>   Some members compete, while others just enjoy the sport in weekly
practices at the City opf Industry Pacific Palms resort pool. The group
of about 30 members stays afloat financially by performing water shows.
"I enjoy the shows more than competition," says Jenifer Hanrahan, 30, of
Aliso Viejo. "After it's over, you get to drink wine and eat caviar."</TE>
<TE>   More competitive than her younger teammate, Larson maintains a rivalry
at national competitions with a fellow octogenarian from another
team--shades, perhaps, of those long-ago matches against Williams. Win or
lose, the bathing beauties of the Unsyncables delight in their sport.
Best of all, Larson adds, "You don't feel old in the water."</TE>

<LD>When he was growing up in the 1950s, the Pasadena appliance store
owned by Mark Hilbert's parents was the first in town to carry the RCA
transistor radio. It was Hilbert's job to unpack the radios, price them
and arrange them on shelves. Beyond that, he gave them little thought.</LD>
<LD>   And many years later, when Hilbert bought his first antique table
radio, he didn't give that much thought, either. "I was at an antique
store in Long Beach," says Hilbert, who owns and manages apartment
buildings. "I saw an old radio I had to buy. I paid $18 and brought it
home; it looked so good."</LD>
<LD>   Today, he has 150 table radios and 50 transistor radios, dating from
1932 to 1965, most in working condition. Radios made by RCA, Emerson,
Zenith, Fada, Philco, Trojan, Belmont, Motorola, Stewart Warner and GE,
in shades befitting an Art Deco paradise: turquoise, coral, deep red,
lemon yellow, blue, pistachio green, orange, chartreuse. At the Newport
Coast home he shares with his wife, Jan, a professor of business
applications at Santa Ana College, the radios are displayed in the living
room, garage and a walk-in closet.</LD>
<TE>   "Closets are boring places, and they brighten it up," Hilbert says.</TE>
<TE>   The streamlined, ornate design of the old pieces suggest an era in
which art, technology, functionalism and style dovetailed blissfully.
"The automobile and the radio were the two greatest design venues from
the '30s to the '50s," he says. "In those days, companies hired the
greatest industrial designers in the world to design their radios.
Manufacturers knew they would sell better if they were unique and
attractive."</TE>
<TE>   Hilbert, who also collects California watercolors, Indian textiles and
antique ceramic tile, says, "I go to swap meets when I have nothing going
on. It's a hunt. Sometimes you go and don't find anything. Yet, there's
always the excitement of finding something in the least expected place."</TE>
<TE>   His most exciting find came about 10 years ago as he meandered through
an antiques store in Idaho. And then he saw it--a classic S grille
Motorola Catalin plastic radio made in 1941. It was black and red, with a
gold grille cloth and red knobs. Made from cast resin, the radio was
rare, stunning and in mint condition. And as Hilbert came to find out,
worth a lot. "I bought it for $78 and it turned out to be worth 100 times
that, and is probably worth more now," he says. Antique radio prices
continue to rise, making Hilbert's radios pricey. The value of Catalin
radios, in particular, doubles every five years. "Of all the things I
collect," says Hilbert, "radios are the one thing people relate to the
most. And since I have a history in the appliance business, it's a
natural connection. My two sisters and I laugh about it. 'Oh, you're just
like Mom and Dad,' they say."</TE>

<HD>Tom Wales Fought for Gun Control. Maybe He Died for It.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>Kim Murphy is The Times' Seattle bureau chief</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A community college graduation on a warm june afternoon, the kind
where everybody sits in folding chairs in the gym and dads with bobbing
video cameras squint down from the bleachers. The commencement speaker, a
Seattle prosecutor and gun control activist, walks diffidently to the
podium. He's a tall, slight man in spectacles. In his blue suit, he looks
ready to try a tax fraud case.</LD>
<LD>   Hardly anybody expects that when Tom Wales finishes talking they'll
either feel like hugging him and saying thank you for saying that to my
child. Or they'll feel like punching him in the mouth.</LD>
<LD>   Wales knew that's what they'd think. He knew some people would listen,
and some would get mad. He didn't care. Because when they were mad, it
meant they were alive. As he tells the graduates: "John Lennon said,
before he was shot and killed outside the Dakota Apartments in New York,
'Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.'</LD>
<TE>   "Find something you believe in passionately and get into it," Wales
says. "Get outraged. Take a stand . . . . Be present in your own life."</TE>
<TE>   Then Wales takes on the National Rifle Assn., the death penalty, the
disproportionate number of black people in prison, the country's
"foolish" mandatory minimum sentences, and President Bush's inaction on
global warming. Whoa. There's some tentative applause and a lot of
exchanged glances. This is Edmonds, a conservative suburban outpost north
of Seattle, on the political fault line that runs north, south, east and
west of the liberal-minded city where Wales had also served two terms as
chairman of the city planning commission and hoped to run for city
attorney or county prosecutor, and maybe even Congress someday.</TE>
<TE>   "Disagree with me? Go ahead. Please do," Wales says, as if inviting
the lady who comes up afterward to tell him it's the worst graduation
speech she ever heard. (Somebody else tells him it was the best.) "Go
through that door and come battle me on these issues," he says. "Life is
not a dress rehearsal, ladies and gentlemen. It's the main event. Don't
waste your time on the stage. We're all forgiven many sins in our lives,
but the most difficult to forgive, in my view, is wasting the gift of
life on this planet."</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, on a frosty October night, Tom Wales says his last
lines on the stage, to a 911 dispatcher, after someone stands outside the
window of his house, sees Wales at the computer and pumps bullets through
the glass. A neighbor sees a man walk quickly from the area and drive
away.</TE>
<TE>   The shooter left behind the first nationally known gun control leader
killed by bullets in the last two decades of the handgun debate. Wales,
49, had spent more than 15 years with the gun control group Washington
CeaseFire. He was preparing to raise funds for further legislation
requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows in the state. It
would have been a significant step. Legislatures in Western states have
been among the most formidable opponents of gun control, although voters
in Oregon and Colorado have passed statewide initiatives requiring such
checks.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after the murder, with a $25,000 reward posted by the
federal government, a joint federal-local task force does not seem close
to finding the killer. Was it a defendant Wales once sent to prison? A
gun owner angered by Wales' frequent diatribes against the NRA? Someone
about to be indicted for a federal crime? Someone who had a personal
grudge?</TE>
<TE>   "We've called this an assassination. This was just a very targeted,
non-random act," says Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske, who bucked
conservative Washington law enforcement tradition by appearing at gun
control events at Wales' side. The police chief broke down recently when
shown a picture of himself next to Wales, planting daffodils at a Seattle
park in September in memory of a University of Washington pathologist
slain with a handgun two years ago. "The murder of a federal prosecutor
is unbelievably unique," Kerlikowske says. "We have to ensure that every
prosecutor knows that we're going to do whatever it takes, everything
possible, to solve this, and to protect them."</TE>
<TE>   The murder made people who knew Wales anxious. Some leaders of
Washington CeaseFire dropped out of sight for a time, operating on cell
phones out of friends' houses. Especially unsettling were phone calls to
the CeaseFire office and messages sent over the Internet. "You all ought
to be hung for high treason," one caller said. "Somebody musta thought it
was 'time to start shooting the bastards,' " a written message said.
"Seems like a good start to me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet another message said, "This bag of guts was either dispatched,
eliminated, or culled. Good riddance, and may his soul rot in whichever
circle of hell is reserved for government scumbags."</TE>
<TE>   A message addressed to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who oversees all U.S.
attorneys' offices, such as the one Wales worked in for 18 years, said:
"When you appoint a replacement for this nitwit jerk, please appoint an
attorney who . . . . will uphold the Constitution of the United States
instead of LYING and VIOLATING his Oath to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Wales, Wales' wife of 27 years until their divorce in 2000,
now draws the curtains at night in her Seattle condominium. "As a
society, we have every reason to be kinder, more gentle, caring, less
brutal. But I have a conviction that this society in America is violent.
And when it comes to your doorstep . . . . " She is unable to finish the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   To comfort herself, she remembers how Wales used to take her out in
the family boat, way past the lights, where he'd cut the engine and let
the boat glide, silent and dark. Look up at the stars, Bizzie, he'd say.
Except don't think they're stars. Imagine they're pinpricks, and think
about the vast light that must be behind them, shining through. Think
about that light, Bizzie.</TE>
<TE>   to understand the politics of gun control in washington state, you
might begin by driving southeast from Elizabeth Wales' condo to the
office of independent gun owner lobbyist Al Woodbridge in Sumner, Wash.
It's a mere 35 miles, but it's two different planets.</TE>
<TE>   The first is the city that gave birth to the 1999 World Trade
Organization protests, a hip town where lawyers carry REI backpacks and
beliefs tend toward the predictably liberal: passionate about the
environment, committed on human rights and diversity, suspicious of
companies that get too big (unless they market software), nervous about
guns.</TE>
<TE>   The second--Sumner--is at the foot of Mt. Rainier, and it's a  lazy
town with a single main street full of kitsch shops. Woodbridge works in
a small law office here because, in what he contends was a setup, the
federal government effectively shut down his gun shop and convicted him
of possessing machine gun parts 18 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be a reasonable solution to everything," says
Woodbridge, a man with an intense gaze and a long gray beard. "But once
you step on the Constitution, that's when the reasonability stops and I
just tell you no. I don't tell you hell no. I just tell you that it can't
be done."</TE>
<TE>   The West has far more Sumners than Seattles. Many folks have rifles in
the back of their pickup trucks, or gun cases in their living rooms, or
handguns they pack when going into the woods, home to bears and cougars.
It rankles when the guys with the REI backpacks in Seattle start talking
about registering guns or filing reports just to buy one from a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The modest gun control laws on the books can be linked to a Democratic
governor and Democrats in the Legislature, who only this fall narrowly
regained control of the Legislature. They were elected mostly by the
citizens of the Seattle metropolitan area, who account for 3 million of
the state's 5.9 million population.</TE>
<TE>   The freedom to buy weapons at gun shows and the absence of laws that
would hold owners liable for not locking up their weapons can be traced
to the citizens of Sumner and hundreds of similar communities, as well as
to the resources of the NRA, which claims 100,000 members in the state,
and to activists such as Woodbridge and Alan Gottlieb. The latter, a
direct-mail marvel of the far right, claims to raise as much as $24
million a year for causes such as private property rights and gun owners.
Gottlieb, of Bellevue, Wash., is founder and director of the Second
Amendment Foundation and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and
Bear Arms, which each claim more than half a million members nationally.
Last year, the foundation had $6.9 million in revenues and assets, and
Gottlieb's American Political Action Committee in the 2000 election
disbursed $117,849 to mostly Republican candidates, including $39,686
spent on direct mailings attacking Al Gore (who arguably lost Arkansas,
West Virginia and Tennessee--any one of which would have given him the
election--on the gun issue).</TE>
<TE>   Some say Wales' determination to control guns started in his days at
the prestigious Milton Academy, when his roommate, Joseph Kennedy, lost
his father, Robert F. Kennedy, to an assassin's bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Wales' son, Thomas Crane Wales VII, now studying for his PhD in
history at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, believes his father
also was influenced by a 1995 incident while Tom was a student at
Garfield High School in Seattle. A 15-year-old freshman ran through the
school firing a stolen handgun, injuring two students. "I think it was
the first shooting inside Seattle public schools," he says. "Pop came to
speak at the school after that. He came, I think, with a bunch of other
law enforcement people. He reassured people that the school would be
safe, and not to be paranoid or afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Wales joined CeaseFire in the 1990s. It had begun in 1983 as the first
state gun control organization in the country and within two years had
lobbied successfully for a state law requiring a criminal and mental
health history background check on all handgun purchases made through
licensed dealers and for a five-day waiting period for delivery. That was
five years before approval of the Brady Act, which set a federal waiting
period for new buyers of handguns.</TE>
<TE>   In the '90s, Wales was among those who pushed for CeaseFire to have a
full-time executive director and to create a state political action
committee, which became the only one in the nation to rate, endorse and
contribute to candidates based on their gun control views.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom really was the driving force behind professionalizing the
organization," says Bruce Gryniewski, hired as the first executive
director. Wales' forte was fund-raising. He had a large network of lawyer
friends, along with contacts in the business and land development
communities through his work on the planning commission. About the time
of the Garfield High shooting, Wales had raised $40,000 for opinion
polling on the issue of gun violence. Not surprisingly, it showed
Washington residents had little appetite for handgun registration. Yet it
also suggested that even outside of the Seattle political fault line,
residents substantially supported firearm safety issues, including
trigger locks and safety training for gun owners.</TE>
<TE>   That was the genesis of the single most important campaign CeaseFire
ever attempted, a ballot initiative in 1997 to require trigger locks on
weapons, training for gun owners and background checks for gun buyers. It
was the first statewide gun control initiative in the nation since
California voters turned down a registration initiative in 1982</TE>
<TE>   .  Wales was co-chair of the campaign and was instrumental in raising
the $1.2 million to support it. Much of that money came from what Joe
Waldron, a director of the Washington Arms Collectors and chairman of the
campaign against the ballot initiative, calls "the wealthy Seattle
elitist crowd," including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his father, a
well-known Seattle attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In the views of Waldron and Gottlieb, the initiative raised thorny
questions. What kind of safety training would be required, for example?
Because there weren't enough instructors in the state to train all the
gun owners, would people turn into criminals while waiting in line for a
class? How about the call for checking medical records of gun buyers to
see if they suffered from mental problems. Did people really want medical
records opened up to government bureaucrats?</TE>
<TE>   Waldron, a stocky man with a ruddy face and a shock of white hair,
still holds his military demeanor from 28 years in the Marine Corps, most
recently as chief of the Marine air targeting cell at Central Air Force
Headquarters during the Gulf War. "I joined the Marine Corps in 1963
because it was a gun club," he says. "I believe that the shooting sports
as originally promoted by the U.S. government in 1903 pushed marksmanship
training as a means of military readiness of the country, and that has
been true pretty much through this century."</TE>
<TE>   To Waldron, gun ownership may determine the survival of the republic.
"In the final analysis, we can talk about smart bombs and things like
this, but let's go back to the Gulf War, which everyone thinks was won in
the air," he says. "However, I also know that the Iraqis did not withdraw
from Kuwait until a man on the ground went in and chased them out with a
rifle in his hands."</TE>
<TE>   As the election neared, polls found some two-thirds of the state
supported the initiative. Wales, who already had support from the League
of Women Voters, church groups and the medical community, began working
on the state's three big law enforcement organizations. Although they
eventually refused to endorse, they appeared likely to remain neutral--a
victory of sorts because the public tends to look to the police for
guidance on gun issues.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA was alarmed. Fearing the initiative could lead to stricter
handgun regulation across the West, the organization moved much of its
Washington, D.C., operation to Washington state in the weeks before the
election and sent then-vice president Charlton Heston barnstorming around
the state doing fund-raisers. With the NRA pouring an estimated $2.2
million into the campaign, financing an advertising onslaught in the
final weeks, the initiative failed, losing nearly everywhere except
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   To many who knew him, Wales was much more than a gun control advocate.
He had climbed nearly every major mountain in the Cascade and Olympic
ranges. He baked artisan breads, prosecuted savings and loan frauds and
headed a national commission on federal sentencing guidelines. He would
drive his daughter to soccer practice three times a week and wait for her
in the car with his legal briefs and cell phone. He was immersed in the
business of laying an intricately patterned hardwood floor in the family
house he kept after his wife left him.</TE>
<TE>   Young Tom Wales remembers when, at age 15, he and his uncle, Rick
Wales, and father climbed Mt. Adams. A sudden snowstorm stranded the trio
on an exposed ridge. They pitched their tent and hunkered down. "And then
this tremendous wind began," Tom says. "When it finally broke upon the
tent, it was like being stuck inside a sandwich bag that someone was
shaking around powerfully. It took the roof of the tent and blew it in
our faces, so we were virtually choking inside. I panicked. We're in the
midst of this howling snowstorm, it's completely, totally black outside,
and there's these chunks of volcanic rock kind of sandblasting against
the side of the tent, and I thought we were going to die for sure.</TE>
<TE>   "But my dad charged outside and somehow managed to heave big boulders
up around in a circle around the tent . . . . He came back inside, and
this was while all this pandemonium continued, and he kind of put his arm
on my back, and when he did that, I knew we'd be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Wales says his brother was always doing that: charging ahead.
When they were 10, he says, Tom challenged five bullies who were stealing
a balloon from another child. All five turned on Tom, one holding him
while the others pelted him with snowballs.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember very clearly walking our bikes up this hill, and he said,
'Well, Ricky, now I guess we know what it's like to get beaten up.' But I
hadn't been beaten up. He sort of had this sense that life's resume had
these checkpoints on it, and getting beaten up was one of them, and he
managed to get it checked off for both of us."</TE>
<TE>   Amy, his daughter, says that when she was very young, most children's
books in the house were boys' adventure stories intended for her brother.
"My father would take down these books, and before he would read them to
me, he would have gone to a room and changed every 'he' to 'she,' and
every description or name--if it was Paul, it became Paula. To me, from
an early age, it wasn't like I was learning about all these masculine
male protagonists. I was learning about wonderful heroic women. He was
just making sure that I knew I was his equal."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth, after much soul-searching, came out as a lesbian and
decided to leave the marriage. Wales was adamant that the children,
despite their anger, not be allowed to push her out of their lives, Amy
says. The four of them would go on together, he said, just in a new
direction. Not that it wasn't the hardest thing that ever happened to
him, his daughter says. "I hadn't really seen my father cry, and I
remember right after they told me they were splitting up, he took me out
on the front porch and we cried together. Never in my mind have I doubted
his strength and wisdom, but he was also strong enough and wise enough to
let himself cry in front of his children."</TE>
<TE>   Friends say it took several years for Wales to get over Elizabeth's
departure. For the last year or so, he had been in a new relationship
with a 50-year-old ultramarathon runner, Marlis DeJongh, who owns a
court-reporting business in Seattle. A mutual friend introduced them, and
they gradually became close. DeJongh brings out photographs of them
celebrating a climb near the top of an Olympic peak with a flask of
single-malt scotch.</TE>
<TE>   The only furniture in DeJongh's new condo is a leather sofa Wales
helped her pick out. Buy the best thing you can afford, he told her, even
if it's the only thing you have. Wales would arrive at her house with
grocery bags, grab a pad and write out the menu for the evening (one
recent night's offering: filet mignon; pasta with fresh tomato sauce,
basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; puree of peas and watercress; salad
with apples, walnuts and Gorgonzola; hazelnut/ almond torte with melon),
then start cooking.</TE>
<TE>   DeJongh was also one of a long list of people who got Wales' lovingly
baked, much maligned holiday fruitcakes. He took no end of abuse about
them until a few years ago, when the Seattle Post-Intelligencer printed
his fruitcake recipe. Wales sent out an e-mail to everyone who had ever
been a grudging recipient. "A doorstop no more," it proclaimed in the
subject line.</TE>
<TE>   Wales had a habit of suddenly interrupting his work to fire off a
heartwarming e-mail. On Oct. 2, his former brother-in-law, Eric Redman,
got an e-mail from Wales about a Robert Fayrfax CD Redman had given him.
"Listening to Fayrfax, on my new computer at home, I'm reminded by the
music to tell you how much I love you and value our friendship--and, in
ways more real than familial, our kinship. Tom."</TE>
<TE>   DeJongh would get e-mails during the day, fondly recalling the night
before, suggesting lunch. "I'm sitting here thinking how powerful you
are, how great a life force you have within you, and how lucky I am to
have you as a friend, and a lover. Way lucky. I'd guess only one of you
is born about every 400 years; that's my guess, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   One recent night, she was watching a video of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon"--one of Wales' favorite movies. He had seen it eight times. He
never would admit that he identified with the sad-hearted warrior, the
one who falls victim to his enemy's hate in the end. "He was too humble,"
DeJongh says. Wales believed one of the great romantic lines in cinema
came from the movie, something the warrior tells his lover when he's
dying. DeJongh can recite it by heart. "I would rather be a ghost
drifting by your side, a condemned soul, than to enter heaven without
you. Because of your love, I'll never be a lonely spirit."</TE>
<TE>   So DeJongh sits in her own quiet hell, on the leather sofa Wales
picked out, and tells herself she finally found the world's most perfect
man, and then she lost him.</TE>
<TE>   Wales' last major push for CeaseFire began just over a year ago. After
defeat of the 1997 ballot initiative, the organization went to work on
state legislation that would hold parents criminally responsible if a
child got their guns and injured someone. The so-called Whitney Graves
bill is named for an 8-year-old Marysville, Wash., girl accidentally shot
to death by a 10-year-old friend. A total of 17 states now have such
child access laws. Even Gottlieb broke ranks with the NRA to support the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   But one dependable reality of Washington politics is the demise of the
Whitney Graves bill each year in the House Judiciary Committee,
co-chaired by pro-gun-rights Rep. Michael J. Carrell of Lakewood. One
year, CeaseFire got the bill introduced in a different committee, chaired
by a legislator whose daughter died in a street crime. Carrell had it
referred back to Judiciary and killed it.</TE>
<TE>   But the shooting deaths of 12 students and a teacher in 1999 at
Columbine High School in Colorado turned the gun control debate in
Washington in a new direction. The guns had been purchased at a gun show.
CeaseFire joined several other states to begin pressing for background
checks at gun shows similar to those required at gun shops.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon and Colorado passed such initiatives in 2000, but Wales and
Gryniewski, still smarting from the 1997 defeat, wanted to try the
Legislature before taking on another ballot initiative. They didn't
expect what happened next. "We were the next state to fall on this issue,
and the NRA started getting scared," Gryniewski says. The NRA's Western
lobbyist in Sacramento, Brian Judy, called him in December 2000 and said,
" 'Let's get together and talk about gun shows,' " Gryniewski says. It
was an offer without precedent: the NRA would sit down with a gun control
organization and negotiate legislation that placed limits on handgun
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The talks were tentative at first. Judy, who declined to be
interviewed for this article, would fly into Seattle-Tacoma airport.
Wales and Gryniewski would meet him for dinner at the nearby 13 Coins.
The purpose was to try to narrow down the points of disagreement. What
kind of checks would be done? Would they be handled by local police or
the state patrol? What kind of records would be kept of the checks? Would
they be instant checks? How long should a check take before a sale goes
through? Could the gun still be delivered before the end of the weekend?
And last, what's the definition of a gun show? Does it include flea
markets? Sporting events?</TE>
<TE>   The weekly meetings continued for a month or so, until word of them
leaked out and the process took a major turn. State political leaders and
others joined in the negotiations. Carrell and Democratic counterpart
Chris Hurst chaired the sessions. Lobbyists for the major police unions
joined in, as did Woodbridge. Waldron was there, too, irritated that
anyone was talking about a gun show loophole. For one thing, licensed
firearms dealers have to do background checks no matter where they're
doing business, and such groups as Washington Arms Collectors, which
promotes major gun shows all over the state, do their own background
checks. CeaseFire wasn't satisfied. WAC's background checks weren't as
comprehensive as they would have liked, and gun shows not sponsored by
WAC often required no background checks of unlicensed dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Waldron says his side searched for ways to satisfy the gun control
advocates. "We kept crawling out on that limb," he says. "But CeaseFire
never gave us any indication, OK, this is what we'll go with, this is
what's acceptable to us. Everything was always a problem, or it was,
'Well, we'll have to go back and see if our board authorizes that.' Well,
what incentive is there for me to negotiate if I can never meet your
standard?"</TE>
<TE>   Gryniewski has a different view. "Tom was an incredibly skilled
negotiator," he recalls. "Because of his experience in the courtroom, he
knew how to ask questions, he knew how to probe. He was great at getting
information. Also, he was an incredibly dynamic public speaker."</TE>
<TE>   The talks broke down in April, each side blaming the other. Waldron
says Wales warned him that if gun owners didn't go along with the gun
show language that CeaseFire was proposing, the group would go to the
voters with an even stricter ballot initiative. "He ended that by saying,
'That's not a threat, that's a reality,' Waldron says. "Well, no. That's
a threat."</TE>
<TE>   CeaseFire quickly followed through, as did Wales, who was poised to do
what he does best: raise money. CeaseFire hoped for a substantial
donation from Americans for Gun Safety to run a gun show initiative.</TE>
<TE>   And then came that October night.</TE>
<TE>   A sad irony of Wales' death is that he may be better situated in death
to win passage of gun control legislation than he ever was in life--an
irony not lost on either side of the debate. His murder brought a flood
of donations, to CeaseFire and to an endowment his family set up for
causes to which he was committed. With more than $400,000 raised so far,
CeaseFire hopes to guarantee the organization's operations permanently,
freeing up regular contributions for direct political applications.
Woodbridge finds CeaseFire's actions distasteful. "I realize most of
those guys think I'm a bad guy," he says, "but I would never raise money
from the body of a friend of mine."</TE>
<TE>   A month after the killing, the November elections changed the
Statehouse, with Democrats picking up a narrow majority, likely ending
Carrell's lock on gun legislation and raising CeaseFire's hopes that it
can win the background check issue.</TE>
<TE>   the only certainty in tom Wales' death is the tragic validation of his
concern about handguns. To those who are certain the murderer must have
been a crazed gun owner, let it be known there exists no shortage of
other theories.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, Wales had a weird encounter in July in the parking
garage of his office. He backed out of his parking space and accidentally
hit a limousine. As the limo driver, Fred Coleman, tells it, "I said,
'Excuse me, I need your license and insurance information.' He said,
'Well, there's no mark there, and he rubbed it off.' And I said, 'I'm
going to have to account for it to my company.' He told me to [bug] off."
Wales drove off, nicking a newspaper delivery truck on the way out.
Coleman called the police, who wound up charging Wales with two counts of
hit and run.</TE>
<TE>   In Wales' view, Coleman was being so argumentative that he was afraid
to give him his license. Besides, there was no damage. The case was
dismissed when the limousine company declined to seek damages. After the
murder, Coleman was among the first interviews police conducted. "I had
no idea who he was until the police came down here and asked me some
questions about the incident," Coleman says. "I happen to have a .380
[.38-caliber handgun] and they took it in, but they said it was the wrong
brand of gun." Sources familiar with the investigation say Coleman has
been ruled out as a suspect. As for other possibilities, FBI agents and a
Justice Department organized crime prosecutor from Washington, D.C., are
going over dozens of white-collar crime cases that Wales prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   In one, investigators have looked at a defendant who claims he was the
victim of an irresponsible prosecution by Wales and another in a case
involving military helicopter parts illegally installed on civilian
helicopters by a company that then sold the aircraft to the U.S. Forest
Service. The company that sold the helicopters paid fines to settle the
case and charges against the two defendants were dismissed. Nonetheless,
the case left bad blood. One defendant filed papers in court claiming the
charges were unfair and saying they had ruined his life. Prosecutors
urged the court to keep secret the identity of witnesses who could prove
the allegations, saying they had evidence of the "violent and retributive
nature" of one defendant.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents interviewed a Snohomish County man who claims he met
several times with Wales in the weeks before his death about purported
wrongdoing by a variety of local government officials in western
Washington. But they were never able to corroborate his story.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, gun advocates say they had far more to lose than gain from
Wales' death. The Tyranny Response Team, considered the far right of the
gun owner movement, contended in an op-ed piece that the murder was "way
too sloppy" for a skilled gun advocate. "Five shots fired, only two hits
at very close range. Anyone who could actually shoot would have done it
with a single head shot, not a 'spray and pray' tactic," says TRT
representative Kevin Schmadeka. "Then the shooter walked to his car,
which was parked in plain view on the main road . . . . I assure you,
'gun people' are generally up to speed on combat tactics and know better
than that. Not to mention the fact that someone who was concerned about
gun control would not have used a gun. A baseball bat . . . would have
been every bit as effective, a lot quieter, and with no negative
political fallout."</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves police back where they started.</TE>
<TE>   "We will solve this case," Kerlikowske has pledged, though he won't
say how. The family knows better than to keep asking. For their part,
they've decided to keep the old family house on Hayes Street and finish
the wood floor Wales was working on. Get the kitchen done, finally. Hope
that someday they can go to that house and think of something besides the
killer who lurked outside, waiting to take the man whose light burned by
the window.</TE>

<DH>At a Time When Many of Us Are Gung-Ho About Sacrificing Personal
Freedoms to Combat Terror, the Electronic Frontier Foundation Just Wants
to Say No.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Scott Harris last wrote for the magazine for the December 1999
millennium issue</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We're bombing Afghanistan, anthrax is in the mail, and all across
America it looks like Stars and Stripes forever. It is the evening of
Oct. 11, one month into the war on terrorism, and Congress is cooking up
something that will be called the USA Patriot Act. This sweeping law
includes a dramatic expansion of Internet surveillance, unprecedented
sharing of information between government agencies, stiffer penalties for
computer crimes and greater power to detain noncitizens.</LD>
<LD>   For many of us, that's just fine. If personal freedoms are to be
sacrificed, polls show that a majority of Americans aren't just willing,
they're gung-ho. Urgent times, urgent measures. Judged against the horror
of Sept. 11 and now our daily dread--those invisible spores, the
occasional drive across a bridge--what's a little electronic
eavesdropping among patriotic Americans anyway?</LD>
<LD>   But inside a half-empty auditorium at the San Francisco Public
Library, four civil liberties attorneys have come together on a panel to
challenge the new conventional wisdom. The audience is up for the
challenge, and when the floor is open for questions, a slender man with
long wispy hair and a scraggly beard takes a turn at the mike. He doesn't
give his name, but many here recognize John Gilmore, one of the brains
behind Sun Microsystems and one of the guiding spirits of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, perhaps America's most technologically astute civil
liberties group--and no doubt one of the funkiest.</LD>
<TE>   In a soft voice, the computer scientist explains what is troubling
him: the scarcity of news surrounding all those people, then numbering
about 500, who have been rounded up in the terrorism investigation. Who
are they? Why are they being held? Does anybody know anything? "Who's
representing these people and trying to get them out?"</TE>
<TE>   The panelists' silence leaves Gilmore exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "Are all the civil rights organizations afraid to step up to defend
potential terrorists?"</TE>
<TE>   Say this about the leaders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation: They
are not afraid to speak their minds. They are not afraid to push back.</TE>
<TE>   sometimes described as an "american civil liberties union for nerds,"
the Electronic Frontier Foundation was launched in 1990 by an illustrious
group of Internet pioneers troubled by what they considered to be the
government's clueless, ham-handed efforts to police the new medium.
"Nobody was thinking about extending the Constitution into cyberspace,"
recalls co-founder Mitchell Kapor, the wealthy Lotus software mogul. Who
but computer scientists would argue that binary code is a form of speech
entitled to First Amendment protection?</TE>
<TE>   To high-tech pros and policy wonks, the EFF is well-known for its
opposition to the regulation of encryption. Hollywood and the publishing
industry know it as the loyal opposition in battles over digital copy
law, which the EFF believes is so restrictive that it frustrates
innovation. "What we're working on is really cutting-edge stuff to
protect the rights of everyone, even if they don't realize the
significance of it," says EFF executive director Shari Steele.</TE>
<TE>   Non-nerds may more easily grasp the EFF's unyielding interpretation of
First Amendment freedoms and the Fourth Amendment protection against
unreasonable searches. It has poured resources into protecting the rights
of scientists and journalists to publish online. It defends the right to
make anonymous postings online, insofar as the posters honor laws
governing libel and trade secrets. In defending its principles, the EFF
may seem to casual observers to be bent on making the world a safer place
for computer hackers, copyright pirates, cowardly commentators and people
who think happiness is a warm Aibo robot puppy.</TE>
<TE>   (When Sony complained that Web sites set up by Aibo owners to share
programming tricks were infringing on its copyright, the EFF took up the
hobbyists' cause.) But the organization now sees itself on the front line
of the debate over security in the age of terror, and it is only too
happy to have its dissenting voice heard amid the clamor.</TE>
<TE>   Its assessment of the USA Patriot Act (an acronym for Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) has been especially critical.
Terrorism, says EFF legal director Cindy Cohn, has been used to justify a
law enforcement power grab that threatens fundamental freedoms. Had the
same surveillance and wiretap laws existed a year ago, she argues, they
would not have prevented the terror attacks on Sept. 11--and now
Americans are shouldering the burden of intelligence failures of federal
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "The civil liberties of ordinary Americans have taken a tremendous
blow, especially in the right to privacy," Cohn says in a 20-page legal
analysis of the Internet and computer crime sections of the Patriot Act
that was distributed to more than 100 civil liberties groups. "Be careful
what you put in that Google search. The government may now spy on Web
surfing of innocent Americans . . . by merely telling a judge anywhere in
the U.S. that the spying could lead to information that is 'relevant' to
an ongoing criminal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   (The judge may not reject the request; his role is simply to issue and
record it.)</TE>
<TE>   What makes this form of surveillance more worrisome, cyber
libertarians say, is how the Internet links people in ways that the
non-virtual world does not. Ask yourself: Have you ever received e-mail
from a terror suspect? Ever been on the same listserv or in the same chat
room? Book the same flight, frequent the same Web site? Not only would
you not know, Cohn says, but you also wouldn't know whether the feds had
snooped on your Web activities and compiled a secret dossier. Not only
could authorities abuse such information, she suggests, but so could
rogue agents.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, Cohn says, wouldn't tolerate such scrutiny of postal or
telephone communications, or library research. What makes the electronic
realm different? The EFF believes its role is to sound the public alarm
and watch for abuses by authorities that need to be challenged in court.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, libertarians from the left and right see the expanded Internet
surveillance as part of an authoritarian lurch that includes President
Bush's calls for military tribunals conducted of noncitizens accused of
terrorism; the dragnet that led to detentions of 1,400 individuals, only
a small number now thought to have suspicious links to the hijackers; and
the Justice Department's efforts to interview 5,000 men, most of whom are
Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Libertarians get a sense of deja vu listening to Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft portray opposition to such measures as "aiding" the enemy. They
recall how dissidents were rounded up in the buildup toward World War I,
Japanese Americans were interned during World War II and a Communist
witch hunt ruined lives in the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Says Gilmore: "There's a McCarthy era every 20 or 30 years." Only now,
digital technology has raised the stakes. J. Edgar Hoover would drool
over the tools that now exist to gather, transmit, store and interpret
information, and the technology is only getting more powerful. Broad
Internet surveillance, some civil libertarians say, could be a first step
toward the creation of a vast, permanent digital dragnet. Says Brad
Templeton, a 41-year-old Internet entrepreneur and the EFF's chairman: "I
sit in fear of the next attack not only because of who it might hurt but
because of where it will take this debate."</TE>
<TE>   what templeton fears is something many americans would welcome.
Imagine a nationwide high-tech security system as a fixed defense not
only against terrorism but all sorts of criminal behavior. The high-tech
fix could take many forms. A new generation of mobile products--from cars
to cell phones to firearms--could be equipped with a kind of super-LoJack
transponder linking Global Positioning System satellites to help
authorities locate stolen goods and suspects. A national ID system using
"smart cards" embedded with microchips carrying digitized personal data,
many argue, could dramatically strengthen identity-verification
practices. Airport security could employ advanced X-ray screening that
looks through clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy concerns pose a political obstacle to such technologies, but
momentum is gathering behind another powerful idea: the use of biometric
"face-recognition" software to augment security cameras that are already
commonplace in many private and public places. When Wall Street reopened
after Sept. 11 with a deep swoon, the rocketing exceptions were
biometrics developers such as Viisage Technology, Visionics and Imagis.
The software makes a "face print" based on a measurement of features and
compares it to a database of images. A Visionics system was tested at the
2000 Super Bowl in Tampa Bay, and company officials have proposed such a
system for Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. On Oct. 31,
Viisage's system became the first to be used in an airport, capturing
images of travelers at Fresno Yosemite International shortly before they
pass through metal detectors. Whenever the software suggests that an
individual resembles a subject in the database, security is alerted. Tom
Colastoti, Viisage's chief executive officer, says most false positives
are quickly resolved. And biometrics, he adds, should minimize racial
profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Most law-abiding people, Colastoti says, would consider
face-recognition capabilities helpful. Travelers already have their
carry-on bags X-rayed and are often searched as they pass through metal
detectors, which frequently buzz and trigger a more thorough search with
a hand-held metal detector. After all of that, Colastoti says, "People
are going to tell me having your face scanned in a nanosecond is an
invasion of privacy? I don't get it." A lot of people don't get it.
"People with something to hide are the ones who need 'privacy' the most,"
Times columnist John Balzar wrote last November. Polls suggest that such
reasoning has become more common since Sept. 11. "It's insidiously hard
to argue with that," Templeton allows. "But if we are under surveillance,
we are less free. We censor ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Just look at how the political climate has already censored us by
stifling dissent, he says. "My little phrase has been that 'America
speaking with one voice is un-American.' " Just because I'm paranoid.
Type that phrase into the Google search engine and, before long, you'll
be under the impression that techies simply aren't the trusting sort.
You'll surf sites put up by computer pros who recommend encryption
software such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). You, too, can mask your
e-mail from, say, your boss, your staff, your spouse, your children,
maybe your government--which is no guarantee that the mask won't get
ripped off. Even before Sept. 11, many techies subscribed to another old
one-liner: If you're not paranoid, you just haven't been paying
attention.</TE>
<TE>   The fondness that techies have for cryptology reflects a dynamic of
love and fear that is very much at the root of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. The love is reflected in the utopian view of cyberspace
shared by Gilmore and others who embrace the Internet Age mantra,
"Information wants to be free."</TE>
<TE>   "In the early days, the Net was free," says computer scientist Dave
Farber, a 67-year-old University of Pennsylvania professor. An EFF board
member since the mid-'90s, Farber has witnessed the evolution of the
medium since 1968, when he first got on the Arpanet, the Internet's
precursor that was developed by the Department of Defense and largely
used in academia. "It was an information barter economy. You gave things
to people, they gave things to you. It was that way for a long time,
until relatively recently . . . It was almost like the utopian socialism
attitude of the '20s and '30s." The philosophical divide "depends on when
you came on the Net and what your motivations are."</TE>
<TE>   As the Silicon Valley began its boom, the bohemians of cyberspace
sometimes found each other at "The Well," an online bulletin board
community launched in 1985 by environmentalist Stewart Brand, founding
editor of the Sausalito-based Whole Earth Catalog. The Well (which stands
for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) had some interesting, brilliant,
influential devotees who included Mitch Kapor and John Perry Barlow.
Kapor was a disaffected Transcendental Meditation instructor whose search
for enlightenment led him to computer science at MIT and the crafting of
the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, the most popular application of the
mid-'80s. When not running his Wyoming cattle ranch, EFF co-founder
Barlow was penning lyrics for the Grateful Dead or writing philosophical
musings about digital technology.</TE>
<TE>   One day Kapor read an article that Barlow had posted on The Well
describing a surreal encounter with an FBI agent he'd previously met
after some cattle were rustled from his ranch. This time the agent was
trying to figure out if Barlow was in cahoots with some outlaws who were
either, as Barlow would later write, "a dread band of info-terrorists,"
or possibly just a disgruntled Apple employee distributing source code.
The agent's "errand was complicated by a fairly complete unfamiliarity
with computer technology." Kapor could relate; he too had been questioned
by the FBI. The feds, he recalls, seemed incapable of distinguishing
brainy kids fooling around on computers for kicks and knowledge--the
real-world equivalent of trespassing and minor vandalism--from more
serious criminals dealing in theft and espionage. On a cross-country
flight in his business jet, Kapor phoned Barlow and detoured to the
airport nearest Pinedale, Wyo. The next day, The Well heralded plans for
what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   John Gilmore was the first to sign on, kicking in a six-figure
contribution and considerable energy. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple
Computers, wrote a hefty check. Stewart Brand joined the first board.</TE>
<TE>   Five years before the ACLU handled its first Internet case, the EFF
pioneered the field in a pair of landmark cases. The first involved Steve
Jackson Games, a Texas-based company that had been raided by federal
agents investigating hacking. The EFF brought a suit that established
that e-mail is protected under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
Law enforcement would be required to have a warrant describing each
message or e-mail participant before the mail could be read. Later, the
EFF successfully challenged the government's ban on the export of
encryption on behalf of a mathematician who wanted to discuss cryptology
research online. In that case, the court found that software code is
protected as speech by the First Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the EFF has labored to shed the image that it is little
more than a "hacker defense fund." Today the foundation's seven-member
board includes law professors Lawrence Lessig of Stanford University and
Pamela Samuelson of UC Berkeley, recognized experts in technology law who
help lend pragmatic ballast to the EFF. But the abiding presence of
Barlow and Gilmore through EFF's sometimes rocky history has helped
sustain the idyllic vision of cyberspace. "Yeah, I'm a utopian," Barlow
says. "But I think I'm a relatively realistic utopian. I see no problem
with aiming for the moon knowing you're not going to hit it."</TE>
<TE>   This may help explain Barlow's provocative prophecy on Sept. 11. In an
e-mail to about 1,000 friends and associates, he likened the attack on
the World Trade Center and Pentagon to "the Reichstag fire that provided
the social opportunity for the Nazi takeover of Germany . . . Control
freaks will dine on this day for the rest of our lives." He went on to
write: "And please, let us forgive those who committed these appalling
crimes. If we hate them, we will become them." (This from a man who, as a
Republican Party official in Wyoming, helped elect Dick Cheney to
Congress.) Barlow was speaking for himself, not the EFF, which tends to
be more diplomatic while making some, but not all, of the same general
points.</TE>
<TE>   At least Barlow hastened to note in his e-mail that he didn't think
American authoritarians, unlike the Nazis who started the Reichstag fire,
"had a direct role in perpetrating this mind-blistering tragedy." But
that, he says, didn't prevent "plenty of ugly responses," including one
death threat. Barlow laughs as he points out that the threat was just the
sort of anonymous online speech that the EFF defends, at least in
principle.</TE>
<TE>   the electronic frontier Foundation's virtual headquarters is its Web
site (www.eff.org), which its leaders boast is one of "the most linked
to" on the Internet. It's physical quarters started in Boston, Kapor's
base at the time. In 1992 it moved to Washington, D.C., to focus on
lobbying, recruiting ACLU chief legislative counsel Jerry Berman as its
new executive director and attracting financial support from high-tech
corporations. But the Beltway culture and the pressure to compromise
created turmoil. Berman departed in 1994 and launched the like-minded
Center for Democracy and Technology. The difference is more style than
substance, with CDT focusing on lobbying and building consensus on
Internet issues from inside the political establishment, and the EFF
trying to effect change through the courts. Berman took along some staff
and corporate sponsors, which now include AOL Time Warner, AT&amp;T, Intel,
IBM and Microsoft. He suggests that the EFF focuses too narrowly on
litigation as a means of influence. "They're great in their space but
they have to broaden their space." The EFF's pragmatists, Berman says,
"will follow the yellow brick road, and the yellow brick road will lead
back to Washington."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Kapor quit EFF's board ("I was burned out," he says now) and
the EFF moved to San Francisco, a countercultural fit next door to the
Silicon Valley. A brick building in the heart of the Mission District
that once served as a church supply store is now the home of EFF, a
bustling dot-org living amid the ghosts of dead dot-coms. It is not a
large operation, with an annual budget of less than $2 million, 15
employees and dozens of volunteers and interns, supported by 5,000
members. An American flag, such a common sight these days, is displayed
above a staff member's desk. A closer look reveals that, instead of white
stars, the blue field is arrayed with tiny corporate logos.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Kapor happens to be in the office this autumn day, "becoming
reengaged." He dropped by for a briefing from EFF attorneys on the
anti-terror legislation, preparing for a soiree of high-tech potentates
where security and privacy will be discussed. Yes, the law goes too far,
Kapor says, and yes, he worries that billions could be wasted trying to
build a digital dragnet. "We need more people who speak Farsi," he says.
"I'll vote for secure cockpit doors."</TE>
<TE>   This is an appeal civil libertarians are trying to make, saying there
are smarter approaches to terrorism that won't cost billions and won't
infringe on freedoms. Serious terrorists, they say, will be clever enough
to slip through the dragnet while innocents are ensnared. But perhaps the
more effective argument involves a bit of rhetorical flag waving.
"President Bush said they attacked us because we are a free society," EFF
executive director Shari Steele says. "If we give up our freedoms because
of the attacks, they win." "I mean," John Gilmore is saying in that
half-empty auditorium in San Francisco, "are civil rights organizations
afraid to defend potential terrorists?"</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Ann Brick musters a response. "The government is not
releasing names, and in a way that's the good news and the bad news."
Innocent people won't be tainted by the hint of suspicion, she says, but
"the secrecy means no one knows who they are or why they're being held."</TE>
<TE>   Every war has its Catch-22s. Today's paradox is this: How can a
society based on freedom protect itself by sacrificing liberties? But how
can it protect itself without such sacrifices?</TE>
<TE>   On this night, Brick seeks out John Gilmore afterward to thank him for
his question. Secrecy, they agree, is a police-state tactic that needs to
be challenged. Gilmore takes Brick's card and offers help: "If it takes
money, I'll send money."</TE>
<TE>   Later Gilmore smiles when he is asked if he thinks the EFF's work is
more vital than ever before. No, not really, he says. "What we've been
doing has been needed all along. You always need the Constitution.
Right?"</TE>

runs, games are held in nearly empty ballparks, the farm system is belly
up and the world's best teams are in other countries. It might describe
what's happening to the national pastime of Mexico, where the tradition
of bullfighting runs so deep that the landscape is dotted by more
bullrings (280) than there are minor and major league ballparks in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Word of the demise of bullfighting might cheer Americans who find the
sport barbaric, but that is not the issue in Mexico. To fans of the
sport, death is acceptable if the struggle is artistic and heroic. The
sin is in killing badly or with unfair advantage, such as was described
in a confidential report last year.</LD>
<LD>   Julio Tellez, the bullfight commissioner of Mexico City, had grown
frustrated over government inaction to halt the deterioration of the
sport. So he released the report publicly--and was promptly fired for it.
The report found that eight of 12 bulls examined by veterinarians during
the 2000-2001 bullfight season at Mexico's premier bullfighting arena,
Plaza Mexico, were either under the minimum age of 4 or had their horns
blunted to make them less dangerous to matadors.</LD>
<TE>   Bulls in that condition ordinarily are a mismatch for bullfighters.
But in Mexico today such disgrace is saved by a sorry equilibrium. Many
toreros are as unsatisfying as the bulls. Together these inferior
combatants engage in fights that crowds would never tolerate in Spain,
the birthplace of bullfighting, or in Mexico not so long ago. But here,
too, the sport has achieved a sad balance: Hostility toward its decline
is muted because most fans have given up on it. Fights take place in
largely empty arenas.</TE>
<TE>   "The attitude in today's bullfighting world is that we have lost the
essence of professionalism," says Luis Ni-o de Rivera, a former city
bullfight commissioner who is now head of the German Dresdner Bank's
Mexican operations. "The public feels cheated and is voting with its feet
by staying away from the plazas." During the 2000-2001 season, Plaza
Mexico attendance averaged no better than 10,000 to 15,000, or less than
one-quarter full.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's love affair with bullfighting has its heritage, like much of
modern Mexican culture, in Spain. Bullfighting there dates from the 11th
century, when fights were staged as sacrificial acts to celebrate
marriages. Philosophers and historians have tried for centuries to
explain why bullfighting--the fiesta brava--holds Spain in such thrall.
Some say it represents Spaniards' rejection of modernity, or that the
bullfight somehow reflects national sexuality. Others insist that it's
just a show of blood lust.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that bullfighting has resonated throughout Latin
America. Spanish conquistadors brought it with them to the New World,
with the first known mention of a Mexican bullfight appearing in a 1526
letter from Cortez to Spanish King Carlos V.</TE>
<TE>   Bullfighting followed the colonizers to Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru, but it took hold in Mexico as nowhere else, possibly because
Mexico was the most important colony in the Spanish imperium.</TE>
<TE>   Bullfighting begins, of course, with the bulls. The instinct a
fighting bull displays of charging moving objects that present apparent
threats is a trait that breeders have carefully cultivated over
centuries. Descendants of wild bulls that roamed over the Iberian
peninsula, fighting bulls have been refined for optimal bravura, or
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting bulls were imported to Mexico by the Spaniards, and by the
early 1600s were bred in Mexico City specifically for bullfights. Over
time, however, the quality suffered. In 1887, after a particularly bad
bullfight in Mexico City, an enterprising breeder named Luis Mazzantini
went to Spain and brought back 30 Spanish bulls. It was the beginning of
the practice of "refreshing" Mexican livestock with Spanish cows and
fighting bulls. This practice continued until 1946. Then an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease led to a quarantine of Spanish livestock that was
not lifted until 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the long isolation is what caused the decline in the
quality of Mexican bulls, even as the sport thrived and bullrings were
erected over the length and breadth of Mexico, from Merida in the Yucatan
peninsula to Tijuana. The most important arena of them all is "La
Mexico," or Plaza Mexico, which, since its completion in 1946, has been
the proving ground for Mexican toreros and breeders.</TE>
<TE>   The season in Plaza Mexico typically extends from late October or
early November through February, with fights held on Sunday and holiday
afternoons. Since Spain's bullrings operate in summer months, the two
seasons complement each other, and it is common for toreros from Spain
and Mexico to travel back and forth in their pursuit of glory. Despite
the infusion of Spanish talent, however, the 2000-2001 season in Mexico
was pitiful.</TE>
<TE>   The findings Tellez released about Plaza Mexico created a maelstrom
around the manager of the bullring, empresario Rafael Herrerias, who has
controlled the lease on Plaza Mexico for nine years. It has been a stormy
tenure, even for a sport whose methods of operation invite controversy.
Unlike the way most American sports are organized, such as baseball or
football, which are run under strict rules enforced by strong governing
organizations, Mexican bullfighting operates more like the boxing world,
where conflicting rules and the absence of a strong central authority
create conditions where side deals and special interests can flourish.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of regulation of Mexico's bullfighting provides opportunities
for unscrupulous breeders who are happy to sell underage bulls to the
rings. It saves them hundreds of dollars in feed costs and reduces the
risk of bulls dying in fights with other bulls on the ranch or in the
pens.</TE>
<TE>   Herrerias, a voluble, silver-haired man, manages bullrings in four
other Mexican cities. He has carried on a running battle with critics in
the press as well as with breeders who claim that he buys bulls only from
his friends. Herrerias says he has to trust the breeders that the bulls
are mature, but at the same time he downplays the age factor of the
fighting animals. Determining a bull's age is an inexact science, he
says, an issue drummed up by the press to create scandal. As for cronyism
in selecting bull breeders, Herrerias says it is the bullfighters who
choose more often than he, a reference to the power some superstar
matadors have to specify which bulls from which farms they will face.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he adds, the age issue has little to do with the success
of the show. "You can't regulate art," he says. "Does a symphony last
exactly 17 minutes or have so many notes? In his concerts, is Elton John
forced to sing 14 songs and not 16? Does a Picasso painting have to
measure 80 centimeters by 40?"</TE>
<TE>   Herrerias' defenders describe him as a blustery straight shooter, a
charismatic rogue who is trying to make the best of bad business
conditions. "He could come in here, clap you on the back and be charming,
or he could enter the room and just as easily start screaming at you,"
says a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Aficionados and city officials challenge Herrerias' philosophy. The
age of bulls has everything to do with a good fight, they say. Underage
animals are less stealthy, less serious, less vicious--and thus easier
for matadors to handle, but less provocative for spectators. Plaza Mexico
veterinarian Benjamin Calva says that sending an underage bull to face a
matador is "like saying it is all right to send an 8-year-old boy into
the military. Neither are fully formed."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy even led to a physical confrontation. In January 2001,
Herrerias pushed Calva in public. Calva says it was an attempt to
intimidate him into quitting. Herrerias says he stuck his finger in the
vet's chest but did not push him. Calva lodged a police complaint against
Herrerias. He and veterinarian Santiago Aja Guardiola are still on the
job, but tend to their Sunday afternoon duties under the protection of
police bodyguards. Both say they receive frequent anonymous telephone
threats. Herrerias says he knows nothing about the threats. "That's not
my style," he says. "I deal directly with people."</TE>
<TE>   While critical of Herrerias' business practices, Ni-o de Rivera, the
former bullfight commissioner, says the city shares responsibility for
not enforcing the minimum age rules for bulls. "In Spain, breeders would
be fined or lose their licenses for sending younger bulls," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one reason poor practices are tolerated in Mexico today is the
absence of any prominent patron to give the sport legitimacy. In Spain,
King Juan Carlos has become closely identified with bullfighting and
declared it to be Spain's cultural patrimony. In Mexico, President
Vicente Fox is a fan, and he has relatives who are cattle breeders. But
the prospects of his taking a stronger role dimmed following a deal he
made with Mexico's minority environmental party, the Green Ecologist
Party, which is opposed to bullfighting. The party supported him in the
2000 election and he agreed not to attend public bullfights during his
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Among bullfight aficionados, there are many who believe that Eduardo
Martinez Urquidi is the last great hope for the sport in Mexico. He is
also one of the breeders with whom Herrerias is at odds.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's goal is to raise bigger, faster and meaner fighting bulls
such as his amazing Romerito, a hulking half-ton package of destruction
who was so valiant during his 40-minute appearance in Mexico City's
bullring one year ago that he received the rarest of tributes: a pardon
from the ring judge, an honor bestowed on only 18 other bulls since 1946.
As befits his warrior status, he now lives as a stud in Queretaro state
in Mexico, propagating the bloodline that Martinez nurtures.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was the first Mexican breeder to receive permission to import
Spanish fighting bulls after the 50-year quarantine ended. He created his
Los Encinos ranch 100 miles outside Mexico City and brought in 34 cows
and three bulls from the famous Saltillo line of Spanish livestock. A
highly successful attorney, Martinez began building Los Encinos in 1991,
when he had acquired enough wealth to support his passion. "This is not a
money-making business for anyone," he says. Analogous to U.S.
thoroughbred owners, the roster of fighting bull breeders in Mexico
includes some of the country's wealthiest men. They receive as much as
$7,000 for each bull they sell to a bullring, Herrerias says, but that's
just a fraction of what it costs to raise them--assuming they are kept
alive for the regulation four years.</TE>
<TE>   What motivates Martinez and others like him is not pecuniary gain but
the pride that comes from producing warrior animals for Mexico's most
important rings. Martinez's task is to genetically mix and match suitable
fighting characteristics. To help, he has assembled a video library of 15
years' worth of bullfights in Mexico and Spain from which he has
cataloged each bull's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez likens raising bulls to any other kind of animal
breeding--with one big difference. "With other animals bred for behavior,
like racehorses or fighting roosters, you test them little by little
along the way. With bulls, you have one chance, in the bullring. You
always hope the bull will fight, but you don't know until he is in front
of the public."</TE>
<TE>   That's why one of the most important parts of bull breeding is the
tienta, or testing, as displayed in a miniature bullring on Martinez's
ranch one chilly Friday afternoon last fall. He submitted a half-dozen
female calves to basic trials, allowing the ones with desired traits to
live on to breed future generations, while sending the disappointments to
the slaughterhouse. Male calves are not put through a tienta. The
experience would ruin them for real bullfights, Martinez explains,
because they would learn enough to make a bullfighter's job impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Bulls from Martinez's "refreshed" bloodline have recently begun
reaching the plazas, with sometimes spectacular results. Martinez
produced six bulls that so outclassed the others that fought in Plaza
Mexico in the 1999-2000 season that they won the "best of season" title.
Martinez's bulls also fought bravely in Uruapan, Guadalajara, Monterrey,
Aguascalientes and other locations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite his success, Herrerias refused to buy any bulls from him
for the current 2001-2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   If Mexican bullfighting is to revive, it also needs one other major
infusion--a shot of celebrity. The sport now lacks home-grown matadors
with the star appeal of Spain's Julian "El Juli" Lopez, Enrique Ponce and
Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza. They command fees of $100,000 or more, two
times what top Mexican matadors get. But the Spaniards are worth it. When
they fight in Mexico, they regularly fill Plaza Mexico's 42,000 seats.
The bullring was a virtual sellout for the season's inaugural show on
Oct. 28, headlined by Hermoso de Mendoza, a rejoneador, or torero who
fights on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   But other than those Sundays when an imported torero is fighting, the
cavernous stadium is mostly empty. Witness the corrida on Nov. 4, when
barely 8,000 showed up to see a card that lacked the requisite Spanish
star. A week later, Mexico's El Zotoluco could only fill half of the
plaza, despite having triumphed before aficionados in several Spanish
bullrings last summer in widely publicized successes that made him the
talk of the bullfighting world. Gone are the glory days of great Mexican
matadors such as Manolo Martinez, Luis "El Soldado" Castro, Fermin
Espinosa, Silverio Perez and Lorenzo Garza. They live on as fading
memories or in the busts, plaques and paintings that adorn the interior
of Plaza Mexico. "It's not one person's fault that there are none. It's
the fault of everyone, the entire bullfighting environment," Herrerias
says. But he is soon blaming the government, which, instead of foisting
meaningless regulations on his operation, he says, should be helping
support the development of young bullfighters and provide promotion for
bullfights such as his.</TE>
<TE>   Many bullfight observers look with envy at Spain, where the government
underwrites the operation of dozens of bullfighting schools, including 22
in the province of Andalucia alone. In coordination with breeders and
empresarios, Spain also helps organize and fund the minor league of
bullfighting, the novilladas, or bullfights where apprentice toreros, or
novilleros, are given the opportunity to fight young bulls--3 years old
or younger--to learn their craft in a real ring.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Mexico has just two bullfighting schools and government
support is spotty. Even Herrerias' critics credit him with sponsoring a
dozen or so novilladas at Plaza Mexico last summer that cost him
thousands of dollars each. But the events are increasingly costly to
sponsor because attendance is so meager. Mexican youth also have lost
interest in becoming bullfighters because there are so few famous ones to
look up to in their country. Young boys are more likely to aspire to be
soccer stars or baseball players.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who was in the stands at Plaza Mexico's opening-day sellout
last October, the notion that bullfighting is archaic--or irrelevant--may
seem farfetched. But the principals in the industry know that
bullfighting is competing against more entertainment options than ever
before. "Television has 200 channels now. And last year they broadcast
the soccer games at 4 p.m. [when bullfights start]," Herrerias says. "And
there are other things that hurt attendance, like public insecurity."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer fights are being held, former bullfight commissioner Tellez
explains, which creates the double whammy of giving audiences less
opportunity to observe the sport and, to Herrerias' mind, limiting
Mexican bullfighters' opportunities to generate a following. The
audiences at Plaza Mexico are becoming older and older, with fewer
parents bringing their children to teach them the intricacies of the
fight and to communicate the passion of bullfighting.</TE>
<TE>   Could this be a make-or-break period for Herrerias and Plaza Mexico?
Guillermo Leal, bullfight critic for the Reforma daily newspaper, thinks
it could be and, like others, wonders how the business can survive with
such low attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Herrerias denies that the 2001-2002 season is any more crucial than
previous ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Bullfighting has been going on for a hundred years and will keep
going. Would the Los Angeles Times close if it had three bad weeks?" He
has signed top Spanish stars to build box office. But he has refused to
buy any more bulls from Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   At his ranch 100 miles away, Martinez surveys the rocky expanse of his
1,000-acre spread and tries to explain why he feels optimistic. "It's a
spectacle that is colorful, emotional, totally different from anything
else and difficult to do, beginning with the raising of bulls. If done
right, it projects harmony and a great deal of mysticism. It is life and
death."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Martinez promises a new "age of splendor" in Mexican
bullfighting.</TE>
<TE>   Others aren't so sure. They are fearful that a glorious tradition
could be lost, a ritual that for centuries has defined Latino culture but
which now, on some unspoken level, seems to no longer serve the
mysterious and primal purpose at the heart of its creation. Nearly 500
years after its introduction to Mexico, bullfighting may be relegated to
just another mention on a historic tour; Plaza Mexico, just another photo
opportunity.</TE>

<LD>If singing colors are an antidote to the blues, Joseph Marek and
John Bernatz have found a formula for happiness: an egg yolk-yellow
living room, a dining room of pumpkin orange and a vivid lavender front
hall. Even from the outside, you can see it coming in the gold roses and
purple irises tossed among the garden greens. Even the home's facade,
which was painted gray-white when they arrived in 1997, is now washed a
sunny ochre.</LD>
<LD>   Color has been a major theme of the transformation here since the two
began painting and planting--creating, in essence, a personality for a
place that, Marek says "wasn't Spanish or modern or Mediterranean but had
elements of each. Since the architecture wasn't pure, we didn't have to
be pure in how we treated it."</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1938, not far from the beach in Santa Monica, the tile-roofed
house lent itself, he says, to an eclectic approach. Outdoors this meant
that Marek, a landscape architect who grew up mostly in the South, could
give full vent to his California plant passions: succulents and roses,
birds of paradise and palms. Indoors, amid the hot-climate hues, he and
Bernatz, a travel agent raised in Newport Beach, went with modernism.</LD>
<TE>   Given Marek's profession, and the fact that gardens take time to grow,
he started the front landscape first, tearing out lawn, planting olive
trees and installing a street-side juniper hedge. He designed an entry
court with a fountain, raising it two steps above a stone path and
partially enclosing it. As a foil for deep, lush planting borders, he
tucked in a bit of lawn, edging it with lavender, echium, agave, yellow
columbine and his cherished 'Golden Celebrations' rose. Into one end,
amid a crowd of gold birds of paradise and 'Provence' lavender, he
sneaked a garden surprise--a pot-pond full of goldfish.</TE>
<TE>   "I choose plants I like, not what I know beyond a doubt are going to
thrive," he says. Nevertheless, "after a reasonable length of time, if a
plant doesn't stand up and say hello, it's out."</TE>
<TE>   Such no-nonsense pragmatism doesn't always extend to roses, which are
Marek's favorites and some of the few plants he brought with him from a
former garden. Behind the house, he now has 100, picked for fragrance and
"voluptuousness" (no super-starched hybrid teas) and arranged, of course,
by color--from a few whites to peaches, oranges and yellow-golds. Some
try his patience, such as the English 'Norwich Castle,' prone to rust.
But he's usually willing to keep them unless, like 'Crystalline,' their
scent proves faint or, like 'Oldtimer,' their blooms lack staying power.</TE>
<TE>   From spring through fall, Marek's roses are the backdrop for the
outdoor dining room he designed beneath a Chinese elm originally framed
by a concrete deck. But he and Bernatz also snip roses for the indoors,
where their warm tones complement a paprika-colored sofa and green
linen-wrapped chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica designer Kim Alexandriuk, whom Bernatz calls "our
modernist muse," helped them furnish the inside, showing them
photographs, taking them shopping and integrating their collections (of
palm-tree-patterned lamps and art, for instance) into rooms with
Christopher Farr rugs and Billy Haines chairs. "Mostly, aside from clean
lines, they asked for comfort--deep sofas and soft fabrics, velvets,
chenilles, linens and leather," she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Bernatz, "We wanted a livable house, but we also love to
entertain--move the furniture, roll the rugs back, dance!"</TE>
<TE>   "Happiness is much more important than luxury," Marek says. "We all
need things around that make us smile. Life is hard. Have fun."</TE>

<DH>24-Year-Old Design Prodigy Victor Cornejo Brings Stetson Hats Back
into the Ring</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA KOLKER</AU>
<AU>Houston-based Claudia Kolker is a former Los Angeles Times bureau
chief.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, when Hatco--the Texas firm that creates
Stetsons--advertised for help, they did so only with the vaguest plan of
mustering new blood. Designer Gary Rosenthal, now entering his 70s, was
hardly ready to retire. Although he'd launched each Stetson made for
almost 30 years, working with an icon tends to energize a man. And
Stetson--crown of ranchers, movie cowboys and weekend good old boys--has
gleamed with legendary luster since the Civil War. Rosenthal allowed,
though, that he'd like someone to do the legwork at the factory.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Thomas Harris, Hatco's president, was pondering Latino
buyers, who had been loyal Stetson wearers from the company's first days.
Now, unlike other Stetson clients, they also were a growing population.
By the 1990s, the cowboy hat business was what analysts politely term
"mature." In other words, the prospects for new buyers had dwindled. With
the glory days of "Urban Cowboy" and Texophile Asian tourists long past,
Stetson sales had flattened. But previews of the 2000 census showed that
Latinos in the U.S. had increased by more than 50% in number.</LD>
<LD>   It might be nice, mused Harris, to get a Spanish speaker on the team.</LD>
<TE>   So Harris hired a young Mexican named Victor Cornejo. The skinny
22-year-old seemed bright. Raised in the slums of Ciudad Juarez, across
the Rio Grande from El Paso, he' d worked his way through college in
Texas. A nice kid, diligent enough to endure an entry-level job. But
Cornejo did far more than just endure. He deluged his bosses with new
designs and strategies, all adding a Latino tilt to the hallowed Texas
hat. Within a year, he had revolutionized the company, lobbing sales
upward 40%. Harris had hired a prodigy. A western-wear savant. A spy in
the house of hats.</TE>
<TE>   inside the stetson offices in garland, texas, each wall offers  an ode
to cowboy culture. Pristine, curvy Stetsons line the entry like gold
discs at a record studio. Stills of Stetsoned film stars--John Wayne,
James Stewart, Tom Mix--peer manfully along the halls. And greeting
anyone who enters is Stetson's Mona Lisa: "The Last Drop," a
sunset-colored portrait of a cowboy watering his horse out of his
battered hat.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, in a factory, hat blockers still shape Stetson bodies one
by one. It's much as they were made in 1865, when a sickly Philadelphia
hatter named John B. Stetson first headed west to find his health.
Intrigued by the Mexican cowboys, Stetson fashioned his own version of
their headwear out of matted rabbit hide. A Mexican vaquero bought the
ur-Stetson for $5. Mexicans also nudged Stetson fortunes ahead a
generation later, during the Revolution: Pancho Villa is said to have
bought thousands to outfit his army.</TE>
<TE>   But in the generations after, it was Texans who identified with the
hats most closely. In the Lone Star State, a "Stetson is tantamount to
the crown of kings," declares Will Howard, head of Texas history at the
Houston Public Library. The brand' s heft and profile, he explains, are
simply unmistakable. It wasn't parody, precisely, when Lyle Lovett hugged
his Stetson in a recent CD photograph. When he sings, "You can have my
girl, but don't touch my hat," Texans may smile at the excess. But they
appreciate the sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Few people understand that sentiment as well as Gary Rosenthal. Lean
and wry, still piqued by nuances of brim and felt, he knows hats as well
as any man alive. That may be why Rosenthal so quickly recognized
Cornejo's talent. His new helper, Rosenthal explains, joined a designer's
moxie with cultural insight that sometimes dumbfounds his bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Scarcely a year after joining Stetson, for example, Cornejo suggested
a hat called La Guadalupana."In Mexican agricultural areas," he told his
bosses, "they have a tradition of tucking a little image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe for protection inside the hatband."</TE>
<TE>   Why not silkscreen her image right into the silk dome inside a
Stetson's crown?</TE>
<TE>   True, the traditional Stetson is a stern affair, devoid of color even
on the inside lining. But Mexicans find color perfectly compatible with
the male aesthetic. So Cornejo and his mentor puzzled mainly about how to
place the image most respectfully. "Talk about tasteful," Rosenthal says.
"We didn't put our name anywhere near the picture." La Guadalupana
quickly became one of Stetson's top sellers among Latino customers. Next,
Cornejo came up with El Azteca. Mexicans, he says, tend to be
nationalistic, relishing emblems of their heritage. Lined in blood-red
silk and emblazoned inside with an Aztec calendar, El Azteca sold
spectacularly.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened, Cornejo proposed a hat for cockfighting enthusiasts.
Though definitely a niche market, cockfighters constitute an ardent
subculture, Cornejo argued to his bosses. He sketched out an image of two
roosters tangling, beak to beak, that would be printed on a gold silk
interior. Then, worried about PETA activists, he resketched: the image
now showed roosters, separated, fiercely staring each other down. And
what if that picture reappeared on a tiny hatband medallion? This was not
your father's Stetson. But the company's board members, watching the
climb in Latinos sales, gulped and gave Victor their blessing. El
Palenque, or The Cockfight Rink, became another hit.</TE>
<TE>   the youngest of five children, victor cornejo grew up fatherless in
Juarez's most violent slum. Every day, along the bridge that stretched
into El Paso, fragments of America rolled in. Clothes styles, music,
tourists, the smell of Big Macs mingling with truck fumes. "What's on the
other side?" Cornejo once asked his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "A big shopping mall," she told him. "For rich folks." Cornejo thought
about it, and resolved that one day he'd cross that bridge as well. After
high school, he applied to the University of Texas at El Paso, his grades
earning him a scholarship that reduced his tuition to that paid by a
Texas resident. The only problem was, he didn't have the money of a Texas
resident. That, and he didn't speak a lick of English.</TE>
<TE>   He muddled through, learning English as he studied. As for the money,
he didn't figure that out until October of his freshman year. Then he
recalled that Halloween is sacred in the Juarez discos. Elaborate costume
parties culminate each year in frenzied contests with cash prizes.
Cornejo approached the contests like a job, devising an epic dinosaur
costume and winning $3,500--tuition for a year. Each October he returned
to Juarez with another killer costume. Contests paid his way through
college.</TE>
<TE>   Costumes were the closest thing to hat design that Cornejo did before
coming to Stetson. But when he saw Stetson's help-wanted ad, he knew he
understood the product. In Juarez, aswirl with transients, garments
plainly declare caste. Used clothes from the U.S. become the wardrobes of
the border's poor. Costume parties mainly are for kids with money:
pampered Juarez "juniors," or students from El Paso. And, especially for
rural folk, Stetson hats have always symbolized arrival.</TE>
<TE>   There's a tradition, Cornejo says, around heading north to work. The
first time you come home again, you bring a Stetson to the family
patriarch. These hats do not come cheap, starting at about $100. But for
Mexicans, a Stetson mixes the allure of the U.S. with the swagger of
their own vaquero past. Think Ronald Reagan. Think the Bushes. Think
Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that shows either you are powerful or you have money,"
Cornejo explains. "Even after the first year in the United States, people
bring a Stetson home. It's like a postcard. You want to say, 'I was
there.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo did more than just arrive. Within months of his first entry in
the hat-lined hall, he'd lassoed Stetson's corporate identity. So
dazzling is his track record that Cornejo is designing this season's
Latino line mostly himself. His salary's improved--he won't say by how
much--although his job title is the same. His effect, says mentor
Rosenthal, has been transformative. Today Latinos, mostly from Mexico,
buy 65% of Stetson hats.</TE>
<TE>   Today Cornejo is still skinny, but in a slate jersey shirt,
immaculately pressed slacks and good shoes, he looks distinctly
prosperous. His hair is cropped, his nails meticulous: the grooming of a
man raised poor and with near-religious self-respect. Cornejo shyly
reveals he has even become a celebrity in certain circles. After the
Spanish-language network Univision featured a story on him, girls at a
Tejano concert lined up, squealing for his autograph.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even now, he wrestles with his bosses. "I'll show them something,
and they don't know what it is," he says. "Or because they' re not part
of the culture, they don't know if it's going to work or not." Take the
case of the Green Hat. "We've been introducing things like green felt,"
says Cornejo. "The first time, they were like, 'Who would wear a green
hat?' But it's just a simple fact. If you look at Mexicans' jeans, green
is one of the colors they wear. They'll wear green boots, green pants. I
wear green myself."</TE>
<TE>   They will also, whether laborers or janitors or farm workers, pay
dearly for the hats. "The hat is a status item," Cornejo says. "Probably
most Hispanics who wear hats don't wear them because they work on a
farm." Instead, they wear them to dances and parties, and they want their
prosperity read easily. That's why Cornejo pioneered another detail:
taking the printed "X" signs that denote a Stetson's quality (the higher
the percentage of fur in the felt blend, the higher the "X" designation)
and making them external ornaments. A standard 4-X Western hat costs
about $100 to $150. "The X designation is really valuable--the more X's
you wear, the more status you have," Cornejo says. He reaches for a box
not unlike a tuba case and flips the latch. "This is a 1,000-X hat," he
remarks, pulling out a chiseled, lushly rounded specimen in white. Tiny
diamonds glitter from the buckle on its hatband.</TE>
<TE>   To create this hat, Cornejo says, Stetson had to find a new way to
process felt. In the past, if you tried to make a felt with this much
chinchilla in it, the fabric would dissolve like heated butter.</TE>
<TE>   "It retails for $5,000," Cornejo says, poising the white hat on his 10
fingertips. "Basically, the market demanded it. Latino clients asked us,
'Do you have any higher X's?"'</TE>
<TE>   And Stetson, now with Cornejo's guidance, said, "Of course."</TE>

<DH>On 'Gilligan's Island,' Mary Ann's Coconut Cream Pies Kept the Crew
Alive</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL BARBER</AU>
<BD>Phil Barber last wrote for the magazine about waffles</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some boys dreamed of being the Six Million Dollar Man or having a
ride-along with Starsky and Hutch. I suppose I did, too.  But as I soaked
in my requisite three hours of daily television as a youth, I hatched a
different fantasy. I wanted to be  abandoned on Gilligan's Island.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the attraction, I now admit, was Mary Ann. You can have your
Ginger. Mary Ann's bare midriff, permanent Coppertone tan and liberal
application of eye shadow combined to make the perky Kansas store clerk
the object of my pre-hormonal  affection. The show's other major selling
point was coconut cream pie.</LD>
<LD>   Every other episode, it seemed, featured a freshly baked,
picture-perfect coconut cream pie. At the time, I never stopped to
ponder the ingredient list. Now I envision the castaways grinding native
grasses for flour and stealing speckled eggs from the nests of rare
birds. I don't want to know where they got the milk.</LD>
<TE>   Few people are neutral about coconut cream pie. Some, like President
Bush and I, are dizzied by the combination of  voluptuous cream and
chewy, slightly acidic coconut. Laura Bush mailed a heart-shaped coconut
cream pie from Texas to  Washington, D.C., for Valentine's Day last year.
Others, such as Milton Friedman, avoid the dessert. Friedman can be
forgiven for his aversion. The Nobel Prize-winning economist got a
coconut cream pie in the face in 1998, courtesy of the environmentalist
Biotic Baking Brigade. Investigators did not disclose the recipe.</TE>
<TE>   The standard Americana blueprint for coconut cream pie involves a
simple cream pie recipe dressed up with shredded coconut.  It's like a
random and fortunate mutation, just a single trait removed from banana or
chocolate cream pie. You can find more creative versions, of course. One
time-honored trick is to substitute canned coconut milk for a portion of
the cow's milk.  Another is to support the pie with a coconut-based
crust. Toppings can range from meringue to whipped cream to gooey
chocolate sauce. All of them should enjoy a light snowfall of shaved
coconut.</TE>
<TE>   In searching for the perfect recipe, I thought the deciding factor
would be texture or authentic flavor. Then I discovered  "Mary Ann's
Gilligan's Island Cookbook," and I knew loyalty must prevail. Dawn Wells,
who played Mary Ann for three  seasons and romps eternally in
syndication, wrote the cookbook in 1993. The final pages are devoted to
no less than 13 variations of coconut cream pie. Her favorite, appearing
here, is her grandmother's recipe.</TE>
<TE>   Wells, who lives in the San Fernando Valley and prefers not to divulge
her age, remains highly active. She runs a Film Actor's Boot Camp  in
Teton Valley, Idaho, and still accepts many parts. She served as
co-executive producer of "Surviving Gilligan's Island," a  CBS movie of
the week that aired in October. She admits, however, that she will always
be Mary Ann to most of the world--even  in the Solomon Islands, where the
wife of a tribal chief once recognized her.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking of the immortal role, I have to ask: Was that really coconut
cream pie that Bob Denver and company were constantly  carving up on the
CBS studio lot?</TE>
<TE>   "If we ate it, yes," Wells says. "If it was a pie in the face, then it
was just whipped cream." The Gilligan's Island  Shipwreck Fantasy may
have just won a new recruit in Milton Friedman.</TE>
<TE>Mary Ann's Famous Coconut Cream Pie</TE>
<TE>   Graham Cracker Crust:</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups fine graham-cracker crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup melted butter</TE>
<TE>   Filling:</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   Dash of salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 cups coconut milk</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1 cup shredded coconut</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   3 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   Pinch of sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup shredded coconut</TE>
<TE>   To make crust, mix crumbs, sugar and butter together in a bowl. Press
crumb mixture into an 8- or 9-inch pie pan and bake for 8-10 minutes at
350-degrees.</TE>
<TE>   For filling, in the top of a double boiler over steaming water, beat
together egg yolks and salt. Add sugar, milk and butter. When bottom pot
begins to boil, mix cornstarch with a small amount of water in a separate
bowl. Add to egg-yolk mixture one spoonful at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Cook until thick, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Add coconut
and vanilla, and pour  the filling into baked pie shell. Beat egg whites
with a pinch of sugar and spread meringue over pie. Sprinkle remaining
coconut on top and briefly toast in oven.</TE>

<LD>Hard-core sushi fanatics would be loath to admit it, but there is
more to Japanese cuisine than chilly raw fish, however fresh and
pristine. Come cold weather, that steaming bowl of ropy udon noodles
looks awfully tempting. This is the time of year, too, when it's fun to
go out with friends for shabu shabu. My favorite address for that right
now is Kagaya, in a 2nd Street strip mall just west of Alameda in Little
Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   It's a small place, with just five or so tables and a handful of seats
at the bar. It has an appealing aesthetic, though. Tables are separated
by traditional openwork bamboo screens. Pots of snowy orchids grace the
bar, and on the sound system, Miles Davis gives life to the birth of the
cool.</LD>
<LD>   The beauty is that all you have to decide on is the main course--one
of three kinds of beef, mixed beef and seafood shabu shabu, or mixed
seafood. The meal includes two appetizers, a bowl of soup, house-made
pickled vegetables and dessert for one inclusive price.</LD>
<TE>   As soon as you sit down, the server turns on the electric coil beneath
a cast aluminum pot in the middle of the table. She fills it with a light
broth, in this case, chicken instead of dashi, the traditional Japanese
broth made from kombu (kelp) and shaved, dried bonita flakes. With all
the pots of boiling broth, the room becomes a sauna. Those unpractical
enough to wear sweaters push up sleeves and wish they'd brought a fan.
Even on this chilly evening, we're sweltering, which leads me to wonder
what it would be like in summer.</TE>
<TE>   When we ask our waitress whether we can open the door, she offers to
turn on the air-conditioning--and reaches overhead to fiddle the controls
with a broomstick. As we give our orders, she answers "hai!" and bows her
head. She then heads back toward the kitchen, shouting out the order as
she goes.</TE>
<TE>   Before we get to the main course, we have been brought a couple of
appetizers that are remarkably good. The meal may begin with a small
portion of absolutely fresh hamachi sashimi, followed by a light soup
garnished with shredded crab. One night we started with two thin slices
of duck breast ribboned with fat and anchored with a dab of rip-snorting
yellow mustard. Then came a lyrical dashi broth with chives and dominoes
of fresh mackerel in a lidded lacquer bowl. That was followed by a sliver
of Norwegian salmon crowned with a thatch of micro-greens. Once those are
cleared away, two bowls of dipping sauces arrive for each diner: a light
soy-based ponzu, and goma-dare, a creamy sesame sauce with a backbeat of
hot red pepper.</TE>
<TE>   They're followed by a platter piled extravagantly high with nappa
cabbage, chrysanthemum leaves, whole scallions, meaty shiitake mushrooms
and shimmering cubes of tofu. Underneath somewhere are skeins of opaque
glass noodles. The idea is to cook the vegetables in the broth, along
with the beef or seafood. As the meal progresses, the broth takes on
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   It's best to cook any seafood first--before the broth begins to taste
of the beef. I once ordered the mixed seafood, and that included clams in
the shell, oysters on the half shell and giant Alaskan king crab legs. I
picked up a clam with my chopsticks and promptly lost it at the bottom of
the pot, not to be recovered until halfway through the meal. I'm not a
fan of king crab, but here it's impressive for its freshness and delicate
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Shabu shabu means "swish swish." The idea is to take a piece of the
paper-thin beef and swirl it with chopsticks through the hot broth just
long enough to say the words "shabu shabu." Any longer and it will be
overcooked. I like to remove mine while parts of it are still pink. Leave
the heavily marbled beef in too long and the fat will melt away, nicely
flavoring the broth but giving you meat that looks like rags.</TE>
<TE>   For beef, the choice is USDA prime rib, Wagyu beef from Australia or
Kobe beef from Washington state. It is cut to order into almost
transparent slices and fanned out on a platter. It's not frozen but is
very, very cold, the waitress tells us. "That's $90?" croaked one of my
companions, referring to the platter of Kobe beef. Kobe is the famously
marbled meat, with so much fat it's more white than red, and deliciously
tender. Technically, Kobe is Wagyu breed beef from the area of Kobe,
Japan. Here the restaurant offers the Wagyu breed in those options from
Australia and Washington--but none from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The Kobe's fat melts across your tongue, flooding your palate. It's
the foie gras of the beef world. In Japan it can cost $300 or more a
pound. But, in fact, we all prefer the more robust, beefy flavor of the
less expensive Australian Wagyu ($65). The prime beef ($35) will give you
the experience of the whole meal, but the beef is less tender and
definitely less flavorful, because it's not as marbled. Incidentally, the
Wagyu breed is notable for its low cholesterol and unsaturated fat, which
is not to say it isn't high in calories.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, after all the flavors have melded into the broth, your
server whisks away the pot and brings it back as a delicious soup--
either with udon noodles or as "zosui" rice soup. I like both. The
slippery, firm texture of the udon is wonderful, but the rice soup,
described as a kind of risotto (which it isn't), is a delicious surprise.
It usually comes with umeboshi, which the server often sets on the side
for Westerners. But when we tell the waitress we know and like the
wrinkly, sour pickled plums, she asks the kitchen to include them in the
soup. When it comes back, the broth tastes even richer than when it left
the table, enriched with egg (as in egg drop soup), swatches of Japanese
watercress and fat, pearly rice with the occasional sharp tang of
umeboshi. It's stellar. After that, dessert--ice cream, chocolate mousse
and the like--seems beside the point.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>It finally happened.</LD>
<LD>   You wondered when all of the hard fouls against Shaquille O'Neal
would add up to something more than bonus free throws.</LD>
<LD>   They can be seen and heard almost every time he gets the ball,
those flailing arms and the smack of skin-on-skin. Usually O'Neal
responds only by glaring at the referee, and maybe calling out "And
one!" if the shot goes in.</LD>
<TE>   It came to a head Saturday night--actually, it came at Chicago
center Brad Miller's head--in the form of an O'Neal fist.</TE>
<TE>   One extra-hard hack too many, this time from Miller with help from
Charles Oakley</TE>
<TE>   Less than three minutes left until the Lakers could finish this
five-game road trip and head for home. Only the Bulls were making
this an unexpected fight, and O'Neal was suffering through a horrible
five-for-14 shooting night. He got the ball in the lane, Miller arms
came down on him, followed by Oakley's.</TE>
<TE>   As Miller stumbled in the direction of the Bulls' bench, O'Neal
came after him, like Marvin Hagler chasing Thomas Hearns around the
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, O'Neal's punch was about as accurate as one of his
free throws. It missed, or else we might be writing an obituary today
and O'Neal would be sitting out for the next year.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neal kept after Miller, while Oakley and Ron Artest came
flying in with tackles that as well executed as anything in the NFL
playoffs and they all landed in a heap in the baseline by the Bulls'
bench, with referees and players and security guards trying to break
them up.</TE>
<TE>   The final tally will include several missed games and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in lost salary, once NBA Vice President of
Operations Stu Jackson hands down the final verdict.</TE>
<TE>   What Jackson and Ed T. Rush, the league's supervisor of officials,
need to do next is decide once and for all how they're going to
handle O'Neal and the punishment he absorbs and administers.</TE>
<TE>   Special rules? They already exist for him.</TE>
<TE>   NBA officials have negotiated an unspoken exchange: they let
O'Neal bull his way through opponents on offense and they let
defenders audition for the WWF against him. Just about every time
O'Neal touches the ball, somebody gets fouled.</TE>
<TE>   "We really can't get into the judgment of it all," said Dan
Crawford, the lead official of Saturday night's three-man crew. "Very
difficult man to referee, though. I can tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   Then his superiors should spell it out. It's time to call an end
to the stand-off. Get rid of the mugging, and in turn force O'Neal to
go to his finesse moves. He has the skills to adjust. If other
players can't adapt to playing basketball like basketball--i.e., play
the man, hack only if you're going after the ball--then they should
be weeded out of the league.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, deter this stuff by calling these fouls for what they
are--level one flagrant fouls--and award the Lakers two shots plus
possession whenever people decide to grab, hug or whack Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   The only word the NBA rulebook uses to describe a flagrant foul is
"unnecessary." That leaves a lot of room for interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Here's Laker Coach Phil Jackson's interpretation of how opponents
play O'Neal, and I happen to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody goes after Shaq hard and says foul him really hard,"
Jackson said. "In the process of fouling him hard, they get him two
or three times from different places. That's all well, as long as
they're playing the ball. That's the rule, that you have to be going
to block the shot, have to get to the ball but not just whack the guy
indiscriminately. They don't call it [against] Shaq and he gets
frustrated. A lot of times he comes in the locker room and he's
frustrated during the course of the game because of that kind of
action."</TE>
<TE>   Laker power forward Samaki Walker is in the paint with O'Neal,
seeing and hearing everything that goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Fella takes a beating like this and the league has an idea
that he's so big that he's supposed to take a lot of the brutality
and the punishment that players dish out because of his size," Walker
said. "Well, that's not what it is. A foul is a foul."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is O'Neal has so few worthy adversaries.
You'll notice these types of situations didn't arise when O'Neal went
against such players as Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo--especially when they were on top of
their games.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons the 2001 NBA Finals were more compelling than
your typical five-game series is because the Philadelphia 76ers
played O'Neal without the nonsense, letting Mutombo try to defend him
as best as humanly possible.</TE>
<TE>   But when you get teams like the Bulls and players like Miller, you
get strategies like this: "You've got to foul him," Miller said.
"That's the only way you guard him, is foul him and hope he misses
his free throws. It's that odds game."</TE>
<TE>   He also said: "If he was only 6-6, 250, he wouldn't get hit that
way. It's not our fault that he's just that much bigger than
everybody in the league."</TE>
<TE>   That's the justification everybody uses.</TE>
<TE>   "He's [bleeping] 400 pounds," Oakley said. "You can't take a hit,
you shouldn't be playing ball. He's a big guy, he's going to get hit.
We got hit, we kept playing."</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't just about Brad Miller. It was about Oakley ... and
Matt Geiger and Greg Ostertag and Malik Rose and all the other
players who have grabbed and smacked and held him.</TE>
<TE>   And it was about his own two feet, those sore big toes that keep
from dunking even from close range.</TE>
<TE>   The only good thing about the upcoming suspension is it will give
O'Neal a chance to rest those toes.</TE>
<TE>   And the break should give NBA officals a chance to re-think their
approach. They don't need an official rule change, because there's no
official rule in place now. They just need to re-evaluate, before
O'Neal does more rule enforcements with his fist.</TE>

<HD>Raiders' Burdens Lifted</HD>
<DH>NFL: Behind Rice, Garner and Janikowski, they beat the
Jets, 38-24, in AFC wild-card game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Jerry Rice was too old.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Garner was too hobbled.</LD>
<LD>   Sebastian Janikowski was too weird.</LD>
<TE>   Coming into Saturday evening's wild-card playoff game against the
New York Jets at Network Associates Coliseum in front of a sellout
crowd of 61,503, the Oakland Raiders were burdened with problems and
doubts and a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   But with the 39-year-old Rice looking like the Rice of old, Garner
blowing past the Jets on one good leg and Janikowski back in action
and back on target, the Raiders put their troubles behind them with a
rousing 38-24 victory that put the Jets' season behind them.</TE>
<TE>   For the Raiders to advance, they had to beat the same team they
played six days ago in the same place. In last season's
regular-season finale, the Jets edged the Raiders, 24-22, to deny
Oakland a bye week.</TE>
<TE>   But that game was a distant memory to the Jets on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst way to the end the season," said Jet running
back Curtis Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The AFC West-champion Raiders will travel to Foxboro, Mass., to
face the New England Patriots on Saturday in a second-round game.</TE>
<TE>   That would not be the case were it not for:</TE>
<TE>   * Rice. The greatest receiver in NFL history, he was supposed to
be finished after last season, his vaunted speed slowed by too many
seasons and too many trips down the field.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's what the San Francisco 49ers thought. That's why
they allowed Rice to slip away as a free agent after last season.</TE>
<TE>   But not the Raiders. Part of their tradition, as much the silver
and black, is their success at pumping new life into supposed
retreads.</TE>
<TE>   Rice caught 83 passes for 1,139 yards and nine touchdowns in the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Raiders' biggest game this season, Rice came up as big
as ever, catching nine passes for 183 yards and a touchdown,
becoming, at 39 years and 91 days, the oldest man to catch a
touchdown pass in a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "What can you say about Jerry Rice?" Raider Coach Jon Gruden said.
"I just can't believe the performance he put on tonight. He may be
39, but remember, George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 44
[actually 45]. Jerry has still got a lot of football in him."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rice, "I really felt young today. Whatever I ate for
breakfast, I'm going to make sure I eat the same thing next week."</TE>
<TE>   * Garner. Because of an injured foot, the running back didn't
practice Tuesday and Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the Raiders knew they would go only as far as Garner could
lead them.</TE>
<TE>   Part of their problem in recent weeks was the failure to establish
the running game. They had no such problems Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Garner rushed for 158 yards, accounting for the biggest chunk of
the 215 yards the Raiders had on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   With the Jets still breathing, though faintly, Garner swept around
right end on an 80-yard run in the final two minutes to put the game
away.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie was legitimately hurt," Gruden said. "But he has an
unbelievable passion to play this game. When the time comes to line
up and play, this guy forgets about a lot of the injuries he has or
had, and that's why he plays so recklessly."</TE>
<TE>   * Janikowski. He missed last week's game because of cellulitis of
the foot. He has also had problems with bar fights and drug busts.</TE>
<TE>   But he came to kick Saturday, getting field goals from 21, 41 and
45 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Every point was needed because the Jets, despite all the Raider
heroics, kept hanging around.</TE>
<TE>   While Raider quarterback Rich Gannon was completing 23 of 29 for
294 yards and two touchdowns, New York's Vinny Testaverde was his
equal with 27 completions on 41 attempts for 277 yards and three
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   While Rice was sailing through the secondary, his New York
counterpart, Laveranues Coles, was doing much the same, catching
eight passes for 123 yards.</TE>
<TE>   While Garner was finding holes in the Jet defensive line, his Jet
counterpart, Martin, was doing much the same, rushing for 166 yards.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately the guys with question marks--Rice, Garner and
Janikowski--proved to be too much for the Jets.</TE>

<LD>When Jet quarterback Vinny Testaverde hit receiver Wayne Chrebet on a
four-yard touchdown pass with 1:52 to play in Saturday's wild-card
playoff game against the Oakland Raiders at Network Associates
Coliseum, it gave New York brief hope of prolonging its season.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders still led, 31-24. But if the Jets could recover an
on-side kick, they still had two timeouts left with which to work.</LD>
<LD>   Could they pull it out?</LD>
<TE>   We'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, New York Jet Coach Herman Edwards ordered kicker
John Hall to boom the ball downfield. Edwards would give the Raiders
their four downs, use his two timeouts and hope he could hold them
and get the ball back.</TE>
<TE>   If all went well, the Jets would have one more shot with no
timeouts and less than a minute to play.</TE>
<TE>   All didn't go well.</TE>
<TE>   On a third-down sweep around the right side from his own 20-yard
line, Raider running back Charlie Garner raced all the way to the end
zone to put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   "There was still so much time remaining ... I felt it was the
right thing to do," Edwards said. "We didn't want to let them get in
field-goal range."</TE>
<TE>   When he reached field-goal range, Garner was hitting stride.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders gave the Jets a look they hadn't seen when the two
teams played last Sunday, going to a no-huddle offense at the start
of each half.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the Jets had a short week," said Raider Coach Jon Gruden,
"we wanted to get the tempo going. I was not happy with our tempo
going to the line of scrimmage. I wanted much more speed in and out
of the huddle."</TE>
<TE>   Jet defensive end John Abraham, suffering from flu symptoms, came
out in the second quarter and did not return.</TE>

<LD>Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer-Press writes that new Viking
Coach Mike Tice has big plans for moody receiver Randy Moss.</LD>
<LD>   "I want him to shatter everything," Tice said, alluding to the NFL
record book. "We have to increase the ratio of touches for [him].</LD>
<LD>   "The ratio has to improve. It's not good enough."</LD>
<TE>   When asked if Moss can catch 150 passes in 2002, gain 2,000 yards
and score 25 touchdowns, which would be records, Tice had a one-word
answer:</TE>
<TE>   "Possible."</TE>
<TE>   Sansevere: "There wasn't even the hint of alcohol on his breath
when he said it. He was sober and dead serious."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for interceptions in a
playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Whoopee, he's gone! Brian Schmitz in the Orlando Sentinel on Ron
Zook replacing legendary Florida Coach Steve Spurrier: "Zook is
seemingly an unpopular choice with [Florida] fans who were teased by
the wooing of Bobby Stoops of Oklahoma and Mike Shanahan of the
Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   "Legions of Gator haters quickly reveled in Gatordom's grief,
clearly hoping that the swaggering powerhouse that Spurrier built is
staggering and at last vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Wishful thinking: Nick Canepa in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "If
the Chargers want to make a splash with their next coaching hire,
then Spurrier would be more than a ripple.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be more like Shaquille O'Neal doing a cannonball into a
wading pool."</TE>
<TE>   Still more Spurrier: Michael Ventre on MSNBC.com: "It doesn't
matter where [he] winds up coaching in the NFL. The only place he'll
ever be happy is on Mount Rushmore."</TE>
<TE>   Ugh! When an ankle injury sidelined Sacramento King forward Chris
Webber for 23 games at the start of the season, his aunt in Michigan
sent him her cure-all--a sack full of manure mixed with ammonia--and
told him to put the bag on his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim Van Vleit of the Sacramento Bee, "She swore it worked on
colds and would have the all-star forward back on his feet in no
time."</TE>
<TE>   Right, as long as he didn't breathe.</TE>
<TE>   Really? San Francisco Chronicle reader Ray Darbyhshire says Fox
NFL analyst John Madden was guilty of a "mexed mitaphor" in
describing the sagging Saints: "The snowball's running downhill and
it's gathering moss."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1974, the Miami Dolphins beat the
Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII at Rice Stadium in Houston,
24-7.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Vernon Perry of Houston, four, against, San Diego
in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Craig Dolch of the Palm Beach Post on Baltimore Raven
Coach Brian Billick:</TE>
<TE>   "You can call [him] egotistical, arrogant, self-centered and
imperious. That alone does not set him apart from every other NFL
coach. What makes him different is that he doesn't mind these
adjectives. In fact, he agrees with and welcomes most of them.</TE>
<TE>   "'I'm always arrogant,' he says. 'But you have to believe you can
make a difference. That's what coaching is all about.'"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If it was Saturday, then this must have been ... Toronto?</LD>
<LD>   The road-weary Clippers spent the night in Charlotte, N.C.,
mulling over their dispiriting 92-91 overtime loss Friday to the
Hornets, before heading to the Great White North.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the nice thing about the NBA, you've always got another
game in a couple of days," guard Eric Piatkowski said of playing
today against the Toronto Raptors. "[But] to walk off the court
[Friday] dejected and as the losing team really hurts."</LD>
<TE>   The road has been unkind to the Clippers, who are 2-12 away from
Staples Center, including 0-4 on this six-game trip. They appeared to
have Friday's game against the Hornets sewn up, but squandered an
eight-point lead with 1:25 remaining in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a game we should have won," guard Quentin Richardson said.
"By not making [defensive plays] down the stretch, we paid for it.
It's hard to deal with a loss when you've led the whole game. This is
a difficult one to swallow. We have to try to finish this trip on a
positive note."</TE>
<TE>   At least the Clippers got a chance to rest and regain their
bearings. They began this trip with a stretch of four games in four
cities in five nights. In all, they have played eight games in an
11-day stretch on two coasts.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry gave his team the day off Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Swingman Corey Maggette did not play Friday because of a strained
right knee and it's possible he could be sidelined again today.
Maggette had played in all of the team's 36 games before Friday.</TE>

during the Raptors' 94-91 overtime victory Friday against the Atlanta
Hawks. He had 29 points to lead the Raptors over the Clippers in the
first game between the teams Nov. 16 at Staples Center. He averages a
team-leading 25.5 points, but no one else averages more than 13
points.</TE>

<HD>Lang, Tchernyshev Let Freedom Sing</HD>
<DH>Ice dancing: Joyful, unfettered routine earns three 6.0
scores and gold medal. Handra, Sinek also get Olympic berth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His red shirt was unbuttoned and flowing. Her dress, black with
multi-colored sparkles, seemed to dance in the lights of Staples
Center. Peter Tchernyshev and Naomi Lang were wearing happy clothes,
the perfect complement to their skating Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With unfettered joy and freedom, Lang and Tchernyshev performed to
the music "Parisian Walkways." The program earned the couple three
perfect scores of 6.0 for presentation and, more importantly, their
first trip to the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Lang, 23, of Allegan, Mich., and Tchernyshev, 30, a native of St.
Petersburg, Russia, who earned his U.S. citizenship last year, won
their fourth consecutive U.S. Figure Skating ice dancing championship
and the chance to skate next month in Salt Lake City. They are the
first team to win four straight nationals since Judy Blumberg and
Michael Seibert from 1981-1984.</LD>
<TE>   Earning the silver medal were 17-year-old Tanith Belbin of
Kirkland, Canada, and 19-year-old Benjamin Agosto of Beverly Hills,
Mich. The young couple also brought the crowd to its feet with a
tender dance to the music "Tribute to Sarajevo." The bronze medal
went to 20-year-old Melissa Gregory of Chicago and 23-year-old Denis
Petukhov of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Since both of those teams are ineligible for the Olympics, Beata
Handra and Charles Sinek were perhaps the happiest fourth-place
finishers ever. "Thank goodness for our tough citizenship laws," said
the 33-year-old Sinek.</TE>
<TE>   He and Handra, 25, who are married, will also be first-time
Olympians, something hard to imagine last August. Sinek had knee
surgery and then a blood clot. He was off the ice for 41/2 months and
the two didn't begin training until Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Both Belbin and Agosto and Gregory and Petukhov said they were
just happy to be celebrating their U.S. medals.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't expecting to progress this quickly, maybe," Agosto
said, "but we just wanted to skate as well as possible and do our
best." Belbin, who has applied for U.S. citizenship, said all she
hopes for now is to be eligible for the 2006 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago Tchernyshev and Lang came to the Olympic trials
knowing they had no chance because of the citizenship issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a long-awaited dream come true," Tchernyshev said. "It
was a long process. I've spent 10 years in this country. I was in the
same position as Denis and Tanith four years ago. I know it does feel
a little bit bitter. But I would tell them that if you pursue your
career, your dreams will come true one day."</TE>
<TE>   Lang and Tchernyshev were bronze medalists at those 1998 nationals
and it's the last time they didn't win gold.</TE>
<TE>   While their presentation marks were all 5.9s and 6.0s, Lang and
Tchernyshev were marked as low as 5.4 for technical difficulty.
Tchernyshev said he and Lang needed to check with the judges, but he
thought a deduction might have been taken for one of the lifts
because Lang was out of contact with the ice for longer than the
prescribed time.</TE>
<TE>   The technical marks will need to be higher if the couple is to
have a chance to challenge Italian, Russian and French dancers for an
Olympic medal.</TE>

<HD>Ex Is Why the Ducks Lose</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Second-period goal by Tenkrat, who was traded by
Anaheim on Nov. 1, turns out to be the difference for Nashville in
2-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Nashville's Petr Tenkrat saw the red light on and triumphantly
slammed his fist into the glass, took congratulations from his
teammates, then pumped his fist all the way to the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Just another satisfied member of the Ain't It Great To Be a Former
Mighty Duck Society.</LD>
<LD>   Tenkrat's second-period goal was the difference in the Predators'
2-1 victory over the Ducks. Maybe this wasn't sweet revenge, but
celebrating before the 16,561 in the Gaylord Entertainment Center
certainly didn't leave a bad taste in Tenkrat's mouth.</LD>
<TE>   "Nashville made a good trade, huh?" Tenkrat said. "I have no idea
why I was traded. I talk to myself, 'What did I do bad in Anaheim?'
Right now, I'm in Nashville. I'm on my way."</TE>
<TE>   Duck players weren't quite so upbeat. They had chances, gobs of
them, but couldn't even put the puck on the net at times. When they
did, Predator goalie Mike Dunham was there, stopping 24 of 25 shots,
allowing only a Jeff Friesen goal on a breakaway in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   So the Ducks were left in a familiar position. Their winless
streak was extended to eight games, one shy of the franchise's
longest, which they have matched once already this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Just use the same quotes," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said. "It's
the same story."</TE>
<TE>   There was a different subplot though.</TE>
<TE>   The score was 1-1 when Tenkrat burst in from the blue line, turned
defenseman Pavel Trnka in circles and fired a wobbly shot that
somehow went in.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned around and saw the red light behind the net," Tenkrat
said. "That was the first I knew."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't waste any time celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   Tenkrat, traded by the Ducks for Patric Kjellberg on Nov. 1, has
six goals and 14 points in his last 13 games. He had no goals in nine
games with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   But a change from Anaheim has helped others--Teemu Selanne,
Fredrik Olausson, Pascal Trepanier, Scott Young, Jim McKenzie, all
former Ducks who are playoff-bound this season.</TE>
<TE>   "After the trade, I was surprised," Tenkrat said. "I was sent to
[minor league] Cincinnati and they said, 'You will be sent down for
two games and after that we'll see what is going on.' In two games, I
had five points and nothing happened after that. That's long time
ago. I'm in Nashville."</TE>
<TE>   Tenkrat has lots of company in the former Duck club.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three-plus seasons, the Ducks have had 62 players, six
assistant coaches, three head coaches and one general manager. Only
six players remain from their playoff team of 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   Despite constant revamping, they are only a Columbus Blue Jacket
surge from finishing last in the Western Conference for the second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to start somewhere," Duck goalie Steve Shields said.
"The fact we created enough chances to score goals is something the
guys have to hang their hats on right now until we become a better
finishing team."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Ducks offensively just reran their version of the good,
the bad and the ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Good opportunities wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Bad luck.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly power play.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were outshot, 14-3, in the first period but had plenty
of chances. Kjellberg didn't hold up his end of the trade as well. He
had an open net before him and badly missed a chip shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised that [the pass] got through and I tried shoot as
quick as possible," Kjellberg said. "I pretty much fanned on it. I
should have scored."</TE>
<TE>   Andy McDonald and Samuel Pahlsson hit the post with shots. The
Ducks were scoreless on four power plays, including a five-on-three
advantage for 55 seconds in the second periods, when the score was
1-1.</TE>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Paul Kariya was not voted to start in the NHL All-Star game for only
the third time in his eight-season career.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya held out at the start of the 1997-98 season, suffered a
concussion after returning and missed the All-Star game. He was
selected to the 1996 game as a reserve.</LD>
<LD>   The reserves for this year's game will be announced this week, but
Kariya is considered a longshot. Skating with several line partners,
he has 14 goals and 31 points.</LD>
<TE>   Former Duck Teemu Selanne was voted to start for the World Team,
one of three San Jose players who will start.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks aided Nashville's first goal Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators' Denis Arkhipov carried the puck toward the net and
was cleared by center Marc Chouinard. However, Chouinard also landed
on top of goalie Steve Shields, who was powerless to stop Vladimir
Orszagh from chipping in the puck.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Jason York missed his third consecutive game because of
tendinitis in his right shoulder. He said he was unsure whether he
could play Monday against Nashville.</TE>

<HD>Kelly's Back in a Familiar Position</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Kelly's five-under 65 allowed him to pull away from a large
pack and take a two-stroke lead Saturday after three rounds in the
Sony Open at Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, the 54-hole leader twice last year, had a tap-in birdie on
the 189-yard 17th hole and two-putted from about 45 feet for birdie
on the 18th to finish at 14-under 196.</LD>
<LD>   PGA champion David Toms moved into contention again with the best
score of a windy day near Diamondhead, a seven-under 63 that left him
two strokes behind. John Cook had an even-par 70 and also was at 198.</LD>
<TE>   This is Kelly's 200th start on the PGA Tour, and he keeps getting
closer to victory.</TE>
<TE>   He had a two-stroke lead over Tiger Woods going into the final
round of The Players Championship last year and tied for fourth.</TE>
<TE>   At the Reno-Tahoe Open, he triple-bogeyed the 16th hole in the
final round and finished one behind Cook.</TE>
<TE>   A hockey player in high school who used to bring his aggressive
nature to the golf course, Kelly has learned to tone it down and be a
little more carefree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a big part of my golf game--maturing," he said. "I'm
more focused on the golf course and not as worried about what's going
to happen or what just happened."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Furyk, who missed seven-foot birdie putts on the final two
holes and still finished with a round of 64, is three strokes out of
the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Another stroke back was Charles Howell III and Stephen Ames, who
each had 66, and Chris Riley, who still hasn't made a bogey this week
and had a 68.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods four-putted the second hole for a double bogey and
appeared to slightly injure his left wrist in the final round of the
New Zealand Open at Paraparaumu Beach, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who began the round seven strokes behind leader Stephen
Leaney of Australia, was one-under for the round after 10 holes and
three-under for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand's Michael Campbell held the lead at nine-under through
seven holes.</TE>
<TE>   After his double bogey on the par-three second hole, Woods stopped
in his downswing on his tee shot on No. 3. He appeared to wince in
pain and held his left wrist, saying "Ow."</TE>
<TE>   Play began over an hour late because of soggy greens from rain
over the last two days.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Clark took advantage of poor putting by James Kingston and
took a two-stroke lead after the third round of the South African
Open at Durban.</TE>
<TE>   Clark shot a four-under-par 68 and was at 204, 12-under par for
the three rounds. U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen shot a 69 in very
windy conditions and was tied for second.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Now that it's over, this eight-day trip, featuring the always
enjoyable Boston-to-San Jose flight at the end, isn't even the
longest of the year for the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   The longest was a 12-day sojourn in late November, including stops
at Detroit, Colorado, Tampa Bay, Florida, Carolina and Chicago. Not
too surprisingly, the Kings went 1-5 on that trip.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings have now made five trips to the Eastern time zone and
still have one left next month.</LD>
<TE>   The schedule makers didn't do the Kings any favors.</TE>
<TE>   See how good Ziggy Palffy's memory is on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings take the ice at Staples Center against Nashville,
expect Palffy to remember the last time the Kings played the
Predators, Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Palffy broke a rib in a 4-2 victory in Nashville.
Palffy's goal last week against the Rangers was his first since Nov.
27.</TE>
<TE>   How do you figure this: Jason Allison has two points in the last
eight games ... and the Kings are 5-2-1 in that span.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks got some bad news when they learned that defenseman
Magnus Ragnarsson will miss four weeks instead of two after breaking
his finger last week.</TE>

<HD>Kings Hold Off Sharks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. jumps out to 3-0 lead and improves record in
last 17 games to 11-3-3 with 3-2 victory over San Jose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>It's not too early to start thinking about the playoffs, says Coach
Andy Murray, but exactly how the Kings are going to get there is
nobody's business but his. "I know how many points we need to get for
the playoffs and I don't worry about what everybody else does,"
Murray said Saturday after the Kings' 3-2 victory over the Sharks. "I
have it in my mind what we have to get."</LD>
<LD>   So, fill us in. What's the scoop?</LD>
<LD>   "That's between me and my team," Murray said.</LD>
<TE>   Fair enough, but it's probably not that hard to figure out. Last
year, the Kings had 92 points, which was good enough for seventh
place in the Western Conference. Vancouver, the eighth-place team
last year, had 90 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping up their five-games-in-eight-nights trip with an
impressive victory over the Sharks, the Kings have 47 points in 45
games. What's more, they are 11-3-3 in their last 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   So you could safely say that the Kings are halfway there with 37
games left.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to get ahead of ourselves," backup goalie Jamie
Storr said. "If we just take care of our business, we should be all
right."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin stopped 39 of 41 shots and the Kings survived a
furious rally by the Sharks, who took 18 shots in the third period
and got goals from Bryan Marchment and Mike Ricci. San Jose outshot
the Kings, 41-20, but Potvin made power-play goals by Jaroslav Modry
and Craig Johnson in the first period and Ziggy Palffy's goal in the
second period stand up for his 13th victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real testament to our team to come in here and get this
win," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   It also helps to have the top penalty-killing unit in the NHL. The
Kings killed all three of the Sharks' chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had every right to be jet-lagged, but that's not the way
they started, with two goals in the first period. Actually, just
getting here was tough enough--the chartered jet had to stop in
Omaha, Neb., to refuel, and arrived late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Murray put the Kings through a workout as soon as they could lace
up their skates.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as soon as the puck dropped Saturday, the Kings put the
Sharks through a workout. The first goal occurred only 2:22 into the
game and the Kings were on a power play with Owen Nolan in the
penalty box for elbowing.</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher took a shot and the puck rebounded to Adam
Deadmarsh, whose shot missed, but the puck bounced out to Modry, who
poked the puck past Miikka Kiprusoff and scored his second goal of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I just put it in," Modry said. "It was good to get a good start."</TE>
<TE>   Nine minutes later, the Kings took a 2-0 lead on another
power-play opportunity. Jason Allison got the assist, along with
Palffy, who knocked the puck to Johnson at the corner of the goal,
where Johnson rammed it past Kiprusoff.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin stopped all 11 shots he faced in the first period. He
stopped 12 more in the second period, during which the Kings took
only five shots and still managed to increase their lead to 3-0 when,
with 1:14 left in the period, Palffy shoveled the puck past Kiprusoff
from the right side.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>For 20 minutes after another loss to a last-place team, the Lakers'
third such humiliation in three weeks, Kobe Bryant sat at his locker
in full uniform, his chin on his chest, his hands on his legs.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant missed three free throws Saturday night, one with 7.5
seconds left in the overtime. He also missed all six field-goal
attempts, and the Lakers shot one for 11, in the overtime.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Bulls won only their seventh game, 106-104, at United
Center.</LD>
<TE>   It was the Lakers' seventh game in seven cities over 11 days, and
their fifth on a trip Coach Phil Jackson called their "Great Lakes
Tour."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played tired and flawed. For going on two weeks they
felt as though they'd awoken in a new bed every day. That pretty much
killed their motor skills against the young and energetic Bulls, and
then they lost Shaquille O'Neal to ejection for throwing a punch at
Bull center Brad Miller.</TE>
<TE>   For a good team, maybe a great one, the Lakers are capable of
remarkable failure.</TE>
<TE>   They had a 17-point lead in the second quarter at 40-23 that
quickly got away.</TE>
<TE>   "Those ... free throws," Bryant said. "Man. Ugly. Ugly. I wish I
could get them back, you know?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. Rattled in and came out. I wish I could get it
back, take it back, but I can't. So I'm going to have to suck it up,
take it on the chin, let them celebrate, throw down the confetti or
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher scored a career-high 28 points and Bryant had 26. Ron
Mercer had 28 for the Bulls and Tyson Chandler, their rookie from
Dominguez High, had 12 points, , two of them--and two rebounds--in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Since Dec. 21, the Lakers have lost to the Memphis Grizzlies, last
in the Midwest Division, Golden State Warriors, last in the Pacific
Division, and the Bulls, last in the Central, all on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Heat, last in the Atlantic Division, will be at Staples
Center on Wednesday night.</TE>

<HD>Melee Day for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They are stunned by lowly Bulls in
overtime, 106-104, after O'Neal is ejected. He faces suspension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal retaliated, finally, with a ferocious overhand right
that grazed the left ear of Chicago Bull center Brad Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Enraged, apparently, over the hard and calculated fouls that
accumulated over a game, and perhaps over a career, of being the
biggest target in the NBA, O'Neal threw the punch he hoped never to
throw.</LD>
<LD>   Set against the Lakers' unlikely 106-104 overtime loss to the
Bulls, the worst team in the league, on Saturday night, O'Neal's
fourth-quarter attack on Miller comes with an automatic one-game
suspension without pay. NBA Vice President Stu Jackson will review
tapes and referees' accounts of the incident, which occurred with
2:44 left in regulation, and consider further punishment.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal refused comment as he stalked to the team bus, other than
to say, several times, "Get out of my face." He did claim not to have
been hurt in the melee, which landed, eventually, in a pile to the
side of the Bulls' bench.</TE>
<TE>   "We warned the officials during the course of the game ... that it
was getting too rough out there," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.
"Shaq takes a beating every single night he goes out there and plays.
I'm surprised he doesn't let it go more often than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that's going to suspend him and probably rightly so,
because you can't attack anybody with a fist in this game, but yet I
hold those officials responsible for not taking care of the ballgame
earlier than that."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers led, 87-84, when O'Neal took a pass beneath his basket.
As he gathered himself for a shot, he was fouled hard across the face
and neck by Charles Oakley and Miller. Miller stumbled away toward
the baseline, and O'Neal approached him from behind, his right fist
balled behind him. He hesitated once and then tried to strike Miller
in the back of the head.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran Oakley and Ron Artest then charged in from behind,
bowling over O'Neal and Miller, and players and referees joined in.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to break it up," Oakley said. "He swung at one of my
teammates, in the back of the head."</TE>
<TE>   When it was done, O'Neal, Oakley and Miller were ejected. Laker
forward Rick Fox was ejected later for arguing over the incident at
midcourt with the referees. Fox also left without comment. Miller was
charged with a flagrant foul, and he left the floor with a smirk on
his face, and without his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who comes after you from behind," Miller said, "you have
to wonder about anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Shaw, who played with O'Neal in Orlando before joining him
with the Lakers, said he had seen O'Neal fight on the floor only
twice before, with Eric Montross and Charles Barkley.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, like most of the Lakers, blamed the referees for allowing
the Bulls to so recklessly attack O'Neal. Kobe Bryant said O'Neal
told him in the fourth quarter he was becoming frustrated and angry
by the lack of protection by referees Dan Crawford, Michael Smith and
Derrick Stafford, and that he mentioned it to one of the officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq gets hammered every time," Shaw said, "and not just touch
fouls. They have to always put a little extra into it every time they
foul him.</TE>
<TE>   "They hold him down, they come down on him hard. It's going to
frustrate him after a while and he's going to protect himself. We
were saying to the referees all game long that it's going to get out
of control. It's going to get ugly because of the way they were
fouling him. And Oakley's a savvy vet. He knew what he was doing
every time. He was the main culprit. Every time Shaq made a move, he
was trying to foul him, trying to throw him to the ground and send
him to the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, Shaq's going to say, 'Hey, I'll sacrifice a couple
of games and however much money it is, but you guys aren't going to
keep on taking free shots at me.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal often has said that he is held to a different standard by
referees who believe his stature allows him to be fouled harder than
others, an opinion shared by his coaches and teammates. They often
marvel at his ability to restrain himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is always in control and I'm surprised he doesn't do this
more often," Jackson said. "I know that many people couldn't take
that kind of punishment and not have some kind of anger about it. But
he does a good job of it most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't to be stopped. He was very intense."</TE>
<TE>   Referees saw only the one punch from O'Neal, and then it got
messy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was actually on the back of Oakley," Crawford said, "so I can't
tell you who else participated.</TE>
<TE>   "If [O'Neal] threw a second blow, I did not see it. ... Charles
Oakley jumped into the pack not as a peacemaker but as a participant
and dove on Shaq's back."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said he did not believe early fouls on O'Neal were
excessive.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is going to get fouled out there," he said. "They foul him
and send him to the free-throw line."</TE>

<HD>At Least Knicks Now Get to Be Happy Losers</HD>

<LD>Knicks in hell: Now that's entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Looks like that morose little guy they rode out of town on a wave
of ingratitude could coach, after all. The Knicks were 11-10 under
Jeff Van Gundy, 4-12 since. As Joni Mitchell noted, "Don't it always
seem to go, that you don't know what you got till it's gone?"</LD>
<LD>   They had Pat Riley, but he fled when he saw the sun setting on his
empire, after which he became known in New York, or at least in the
New York Post, as Pat the Rat.</LD>
<TE>   They had Riley's disciple, Van Gundy, who prolonged the illusion
of contention for five seasons. When he walked, the Madison Square
Garden gross was up to $1million per game and only the Yankees' Joe
Torre had been running a Gotham team longer, but he was skewered like
shish kebab.</TE>
<TE>   Said a New York Daily News headline: "It Was Time for Van To Go
... Knicks Won't Miss Him."</TE>
<TE>   Said a Post headline: "Finally, the Little Whiner Is Out of Here."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Camby, whom Van Gundy often zinged, said it was "like night
and day" under interim Coach Don Chaney.</TE>
<TE>   "We still work hard, but at the end of the day, there's more
smiles around here now," said Camby. "It's been more laid back....
Hopefully, that can be a good sign and guys can just relax and play
their games."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote the Daily News' Mike Lupica: "Van Gundy had clearly gotten
sick of coaching this team, lecturing them--and us--about how they
hardly ever gave him an effort worthy of all his preparation.... [He]
has been around pro basketball for little more than a decade. Chaney,
once one of the great defensive guards of all time, has been around
for more than 30 years and coached three teams before the Knicks and
won a coach-of-the-year award in Houston, which is frankly one more
coach-of-the-year than Van Gundy won.... Chaney deserved another
chance. These Knick players at least deserved a chance to show they
are better than their former coach said they were."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Chaney and the Knick players got that chance.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks were gritty overachievers, not great players. However,
there'd been a debate on that point since the incredible
Knick-versus-Knick spring of 1999, when they made their miracle run
to the NBA Finals in the midst of an organizational shootout, with
Dave Checketts loyalists insisting this was actually a talented team,
which Patrick Ewing and/or Van Gundy slowed down.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney, buying the myth, wanted to run and get easy baskets, which
old-line guys used to say was "the name of the game in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   It worked with Chaney's Boston teams in the late '60s, which were
the best, deepest and most cohesive around.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't work for the Knicks, who have modest talent and now
aren't even cohesive.</TE>
<TE>   Checketts, who had ideas, if increasingly desperate ones, is gone.
He was replaced by neophyte son-of-the-boss James Dolan, who says he
knows nothing about basketball but is aces at delegating.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Dolan went on the road, an ominous sign. Hardly
impressed, the Knicks went 0-3 and, worse, seemed to accept their
lowly status.</TE>
<TE>   On the charter after their loss in San Antonio, Dolan strummed a
guitar. Maybe he does that when he's thinking, or maybe he was trying
to impress the guys. In Van Gundy's time, noted the Daily News' Frank
Isola, the young scion might have taken his ax home in splinters.</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, where Moochie Norris dropped a game-winning
three-pointer on the Knicks, Shandon Anderson joked around afterward.
Latrell Sprewell, customarily somber after losses, was described as
"giddy."</TE>
<TE>   In Dallas, they trailed by 31 and lost by 22.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is their future brighter. In 2003, when other rebuilding teams
will court free agents Tim Duncan, Antonio McDyess, Jason Kidd, et
al, the Knicks still will be locked into an $80-million payroll, far
over the cap and deep in luxury tax territory.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing lasts forever, not even the hottest ticket in the biggest
town. Not even if all the king's horses and all the king's men try to
make it so and all the kingdom's newspapers play along.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Van Gundy isn't, at last, gaining appreciation. At a home
game, where the Nets beat the Knicks by 18, a fan came dressed as a
milk carton with a picture of Van Gundy and the words: "Missing: Have
you seen this coach?"</TE>
<TE>   A Post headline even noted recently: "All We Want for X-mas Is Our
VG Back."</TE>
<TE>   Heart-warming. Just late, is all.</TE>
<TE>   Faces And Figures</TE>
<TE>   I don't like to get into that gnashing of teeth because "our team"
is getting jobbed on something as "monumental" as All-Star game
selections but: Elton Brand's 18 points and 11 rebounds a game, 51%
shooting, exemplary work ethic and participation in the Clippers'
rise should make him a mandatory selection, even in a conference
loaded with power forwards.... By the way, who in the NBA's public
relations office left popular, flashy and not unaccomplished Darius
Miles off the all-sophomore team, taking such plow horses as Marcus
Fizer and Chris Mihm? That one looks like a sop to the Bulls and
Cavaliers, who have little enough, since another Clipper, Quentin
Richardson, was named to the squad.</TE>
<TE>   At Allen Iverson's urging, the 76ers donned headbands and went 3-1
before losing at home to Orlando, whereupon Iverson decided
solidarity had gone far enough and issued a garden-variety complaint
about Larry Brown's game plan. Replied Brown, playing for sympathy:
"This is the first time in my career I've had any player say anything
like that publicly." The Philadelphia Daily News ran it under a
headline asking, "Whose team is this, anyway?" Soon, it'll be all
Iverson's.</TE>
<TE>   Heading toward the Feb. 21 deadline, the usual blizzard of trade
rumors is circulating as the press--especially the influential ESPN
Insider--runs amok with every lame suggestion. In real life,
Portland's Rasheed Wallace is unlikely to go anywhere. He's scorned
by outsiders, whom he won't deal with, but teammates like him and
insiders say there's nothing wrong with his game. Then, of course,
there's his temper. In the fourth quarter of last week's game in
Atlanta, with the Trail Blazers coming from 10 points behind and on a
fastbreak that could have tied it, Wallace drew his eighth technical
of the season. They lost, 101-92.</TE>
<TE>   Said Former Trail Blazer, now Turner analyst, Danny Ainge to the
Portland Tribune's Kerry Eggers, "I felt sorry for Mike Dunleavy and
I do now for Maurice Cheeks. Maurice has no chance to succeed in that
job. He might be a great coach and he might not but I don't think
there's a chance with that group. Mike has to be cracking up right
now at the Blazers. Mike had a very smiley Christmas looking at the
Portland Trail Blazers."</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-control Maverick owner Mark Cuban, fined an astounding
$500,000 for ripping referee supervisor Ed Rush, said he'd write
another $500,000 check to charity. Next time--and there will be a
next time--Commissioner David Stern should suspend Cuban. The time
after that, he should boot him out of the league. If NBA owners voted
on lifting his franchise, it would be 28-1. Said Seattle owner Howard
Schultz, "He should grow up."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Sloan, one of three Bulls--with Michael Jordan and Bob
Love--whose jerseys have been retired, on his old team: "This
franchise probably would've won three or four more championships if
they had kept that team together. We [the Utah Jazz] aren't going to
break it up until [Karl Malone and John Stockton] are dead, as far as
I'm concerned. I don't see any reason to."</TE>
<TE>   John Hammond, the former Clipper assistant who's now Detroit's
personnel director: "We were talking the other day about how, with
Kobe [Bryant] and Shaq [O'Neal, the Lakers are] basically invincible.
How would you like to be San Antonio? It would be so frustrating to
be as good as they are, to know you are going to win 50 games and
make a run in the playoffs but in the back of your mind, you know you
are going to have to run into the Lakers sooner or later."</TE>
<TE>   Former Clipper, now SuperSonic, Brent Barry, who still has a home
on the beach, on declining an invitation to participate in the
three-point contest on All-Star weekend: "Philadelphia or Hermosa
Beach?"</TE>

<HD>Shanahan Points  the Way for Detroit</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brendan Shanahan's first goal Saturday at Detroit gave him 1,000
career points. His next goal and assist helped give the Red Wings
their fifth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Shanahan scored twice in the first period, and the Red Wings
defeated the Dallas Stars, 5-2.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit leads the league with 69 points.</LD>
<TE>   "It's humbling to be in the room with the players and the coaches
we have," Shanahan said. "It's a nice feeling. More important, we got
the win."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit improved to 21-4-2 at home this season.</TE>
<TE>   Dominik Hasek made 16 saves for the Red Wings, Marty Turco 30 for
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Modano's second goal of the game, with about seven minutes to
play in the second period, pulled the Stars within 4-2. But Dallas
couldn't put the puck past Hasek in the final period.</TE>
<TE>   Igor Larionov's empty-net goal capped the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're a great team, so you've got to make sure you come
to play well," Detroit's Luc Robitaille said. "We weren't happy with
our start the last game. We wanted to make sure we had a better start
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Pittsburgh 1--Scott Mellanby scored two goals at
Pittsburgh to spoil Mario Lemieux's first game in nearly two months.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Stillman and Keith Tkachuk scored less than two minutes apart
in the third period and the Blues weathered an early Pittsburgh
flurry.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux went scoreless in his first game since Nov. 14 following a
season-long problem with a hip, but couldn't help the slumping
Penguins sustain a dominating first period in which they led, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues won their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 2, New Jersey 1--Martin Biron made 28 saves and Miroslav
Satan and Chris Gratton scored at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Gratton's goal with 40 seconds left in the second period, on a
slap shot from the right boards that sailed over the left shoulder of
goalie Martin Brodeur, proved the winner.</TE>
<TE>   The shot was the Sabres' first of the period.</TE>
<TE>   Gratton's goal came 1:13 after Bruce Gardner scored his first goal
as a Devil.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 5, Boston 4--Mariusz Czerkawski had two goals
and an assist, and Alexei Yashin had four assists for the Islanders
at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Scatchard, Mats Lindgren and Oleg Kvasha scored for the
Islanders, who had a 4-1 lead in the first period and held on for
their fourth victory in the last 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Guerin, Sergei Samsonov, Rob Zamuner and Martin Lapointe
scored for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 1, Montreal 1--Mats Sundin scored midway through the
second period, giving the Maple Leafs the tie at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Hossa scored and Jose Theodore made 38 saves for the
Canadiens, who haven't won consecutive games since winning five in a
row in mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Joseph stopped 28 shots for the Maple Leafs, who have only
one loss in their last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 5, Chicago 4--Mike Sillinger had two goals and an assist
for the Blue Jackets at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Deron Quint, Rostislav Klesla and Grant Marshall scored for
Columbus, which matched its season high for goals in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Whitney had three assists and Espen Knutsen two.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Daze had a goal and two assists, Tony Amonte a goal and an
assist and Michael Nylander had two assists for the Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, Tampa Bay 1--Ottawa's Jani Hurme stopped Martin St.
Louis' penalty shot with 5.3 seconds left to preserve the victory at
Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty shot was awarded after Hurme knocked the net off its
moorings.</TE>
<TE>   Hurme made 33 saves and Ottawa beat the Lightning for the seventh
consecutive time. He is 6-0-0 with two shutouts in his career against
Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Bonk scored the go-ahead goal on a power play in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 1, Florida 0--Jeff Halpern scored in the first-period
at Sunrise, Fla., and Ollie Kolzig made 25 saves for his second
shutout this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Halpern scored his fifth goal this season at 2:18 of the period.</TE>
<TE>   Alone in front of the net, he swatted in a short pass from Chris
Simon, who stripped the puck away from defenseman Robert Svehla just
to the left of goaltender Roberto Luongo.</TE>
<TE>   Luongo made 34 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Edmonton 2--Patrick Roy made 32 saves and Colorado
rallied from a two-goal deficit to tie the Oilers at Edmonton,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton maintained its one-point lead over second-place Colorado
in the Northwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   Milan Hejduk tied the score 39 seconds into the third period.
Ville Nieminen also scored for the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Comrie and Georges Laraque scored for the Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 7, Carolina 1--Trevor Letowski had a goal and two
assists, and seven players scored for the Canucks at Vancouver,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver scored one short-handed goal and three power-play goals
in winning for the fifth time in eight games.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom led all players in fan balloting
for the NHL All-Star game, receiving 211,486 votes to earn a spot
Saturday in the World team's starting lineup for the Feb. 2 game at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Swedish star will be joined on the World team by Red Wing
center Sergei Fedorov of Russia and goalie Dominik Hasek of the Czech
Republic. Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman will direct the team.</LD>
<LD>   Red Wings left wing Brendan Shanahan led voting for the North
American squad with 165,184. He will be joined in the starting lineup
by fellow winger Owen Nolan of San Jose, goalie Patrick Roy of
Colorado, defensemen Rob Blake of Colorado and Chris Pronger of St.
Louis, and San Jose center Vincent Damphousse (89,139).</LD>
<TE>   Pat Quinn of Toronto will coach the North American squad.</TE>
<TE>   Lidstrom will play alongside Carolina defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh.
The starting World forward line will consist of Fedorov and wingers
Teemu Selanne of San Jose and Jaromir Jagr of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining players will be announced Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Stevens, one of hockey's most reliable scorers when the
Pittsburgh Penguins were winning consecutive Stanley Cups 10 years
ago, missed another game Saturday as he pondered retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, who has only one goal all season, unexpectedly left the
Penguins shortly before their Thursday night game in Buffalo and
returned to Pittsburgh. He met with General Manager Craig Patrick for
about an hour after not practicing Friday, and did not show up for
Saturday's game against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees his career is coming near the end, and he doesn't like
the way it's ending right now," Patrick said. "He's just trying to
decide what he should do, whether he should continue playing or
forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   The 36-year-old Stevens has averaged about 10 minutes per game
this season, but has often been a healthy scratch in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's down," Patrick said. "He's frustrated with the way things
are going. He's going through a tough time, and you don't like to
face the day it might end."</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers claimed New Jersey Devil right wing Pierre
Dagenais off waivers and reassigned center Nick Smith to St. John of
the American Hockey League. Dagenais played in 16 games for the
Devils, getting three goals and three assists.... The Nashville
Predators recalled forward Mark Mowers from Milwaukee of the AHL.</TE>

<HD>Lindros Keeps Quiet in Return</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Former Flyer takes three shots and doesn't score as
the Rangers lose, 4-2, in Philadelphia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Eric Lindros was distracted by the sights and sounds of his former
home.</LD>
<LD>   It showed, as Lindros and the New York Rangers were overwhelmed by
the feisty, aggressive Flyers.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Johnsson skated in through the circles and flipped the puck
over Mike Richter's shoulder at 5:51 of the third period for the
go-ahead goal Saturday, giving Philadelphia a fight-filled 4-2 win
over the Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   Johnsson, one of the players the Flyers received in the Lindros
trade, made it 3-2, and Justin Williams padded the lead with 4:23
left.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel real comfortable until halfway through the second
period," Lindros said. "When you step into a building where you
played so many years, a lot of things go through your mind."</TE>
<TE>   John LeClair had a goal and an assist, and Jeremy Roenick also
scored for Philadelphia, which moved six points ahead of the Rangers
in leading the Atlantic Division.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Berard and Radek Dvorak scored for New York. Berard added an
assist.</TE>
<TE>   New York has lost six consecutive games, while the Flyers have won
10 of their last 12.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the game, Lindros took time to look around the
sold-out First Union Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It was memories," he said, "looking around the rink at different
sections. Remembering where my seats were when I played, seeing some
familiar faces along the glass. There was a lot going on."</TE>
<TE>   Spending nearly two years away didn't earn Lindros a reprieve from
the 19,867 fans, many booing each  time he touched the puck. He was
razzed even in warmups.</TE>
<TE>   Lindros, who missed time as a Flyer because of a concussion and
squabbled with General Manager Bob Clarke, was traded to the Rangers
in August.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the contentious first period, which featured three
fights and 60 minutes of penalties, Lindros looked concerned and
awkward.</TE>
<TE>   He avoided getting involved in any of the dustups and was hardly a
contributor to New York's offense, taking just three shots on goal
all game.</TE>

<HD>Now Barnes Can Hit Broad Side of Basket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Barnes didn't have to see the scouting report on himself last
season.</LD>
<LD>   Duke practically read it out loud in the Sweet 16.</LD>
<LD>   "Shane Battier was playing 10 feet off him," Billy Knight said.</LD>
<TE>   The Blue Devils were daring Barnes to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, he laid off me," Barnes said. "Me and my dad talked about
that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   No one is going to bet against Barnes any more.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes scored 27 points Saturday in UCLA's upset of No. 1 Kansas,
two days after he scored a career-high 34 in the loss to USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams better start using new scouting reports," Knight said. "He
looks like a pro out there."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes scored on three-pointers. (He has 10 in the last two games,
two more than he had in the last two seasons.) He scored on slippery
cuts through the lane. And he scored two of his loudest points on a
ferocious windmill dunk, sprinting to the other end after a steal.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes' career has been more role player than record-setter, but
his 61 points in the last two games are the most by any UCLA player
since Ed O'Bannon scored 64 in a two-game stretch during the Bruins'
last national championship season in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   After Saturday, Barnes is shooting 54%--and 50% from three-point
range, making 19 for 38.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt's playing in the magic zone right now," Coach Steve Lavin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it lasts the whole year. It did for Ed O'Bannon in '95.
Sometimes it lasts for a few games or weeks."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA can only hope it lasts as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   On an afternoon when Jason Kapono scored only 10 points, Dan
Gadzuric fouled out and freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman teetered
between brilliant and boneheaded, UCLA beat the No. 1-ranked team in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins did it with defense, helping force 16 first-half
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   They did it with rebounding--outrebounding a team that has the
nation's leading rebounder in Drew Gooden, and doing it only two days
after being destroyed on the boards by USC.</TE>
<TE>   And they did it with shooting, finishing with 52.6% against a team
that hadn't allowed anyone to shoot 50% all season.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows our potential, what we can be,'' Barnes said. "And last
Thursday shows what we can be too. It's kind of frustrating to know
you can beat the No. 1 team and not be able to beat teams in our own
conference we should beat."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its habit of knocking off No. 1 teams and losing to
supposedly lesser foes, UCLA isn't looking exactly like the team
everyone expected.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono is caught in a scoring funk caused by playing too much
point guard while Bozeman was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric, you never quite know--though he had his moments against
Kansas, in a 13-point, three-block performance.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bruins are making do on a tag-team of performances from
such players as Barnes, Knight and T.J. Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be different people every night because we have
tremendous balance," Lavin said. "T.J. comes off the bench and gets
20-plus, then Dan gets 20-plus, then Billy gets 30, then Matt gets
30. That's the strength of this team."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes established his big-game scoring ability with 32 points
against Stanford last season. But this seems like something more.</TE>
<TE>   After last season--with his senior season and the knowledge he'll
have to be a perimeter player in the NBA smack in his face--Barnes
went to work.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of sticking around the all-star pickup games at Pauley
Pavilion, he went home to Northern California and played with
Sacramento King players.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Webber, Bobby Jackson, Peja Stojakovic," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked really hard on being able to drive and shoot."</TE>
<TE>   Still, frustrated with an early-season stretch of single-digit
scoring games, he needed more help, and got it from Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the one who got me out of my slump," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   However he has gotten out, he is thriving.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt is playing tremendous basketball," Lavin said. "All of his
skills and abilities have been put on display. He's able to play
inside with his back to the basket, step away and knock down threes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people feel kids don't get better in our program. It
makes you feel good when you see a Billy Knight improving over five
years or a Matt Barnes playing the way he has. And obviously Earl
[Watson] last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt has made quantum leaps every year. And he was on the on the
athletic director's honor roll last semester, after being ineligible
because of academics, two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Where UCLA goes from here is hard to say.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to tell if Bozeman will be ready for the rigors of
March.</TE>
<TE>   On one trip down the floor, he threw a seeing-eye pass to Gadzuric
under the basket. On another, in the crucial final minutes, he threw
the ball away.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those passes he made in high school, you can't make in
college.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I've talked to him about and Jason's talked to him
about," Barnes said. "He knows."</TE>
<TE>   Just as they all know they'll need a point guard in March who
plays like a veteran--even if he isn't one.</TE>

<DH>Roddick Has Talent, Personality to Burn, but  He Faces a
Tough Road at Australian Open</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Athletes In Acting.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it's always harder than it appears. For every star turn,
like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in "Airplane,"  there is a wooden Wayne
Gretzky on "Saturday Night Live."</LD>
<LD>   Teenager Andy Roddick was finding this out shortly before
Christmas at the  Los Angeles Tennis Club, even though he was playing
himself, not required to sing or dance. "I probably wouldn't have
been caught dead doing a play," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood wanted him to be himself. No problem ... once the
cameras stopped rolling on the set of "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch."
Sabrina, played by  Melissa Joan Hart,  was spraying balls, off the
court, and right at Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   "You hit the ball well, Sabrina, you just have to learn how to hit
it in the court," Roddick said.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick was asked to project more.  There are similarities to his
day job, of course, doing the same thing over and over for hours.
Once you get something right, something else goes wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the dialogue right and then I don't step out," Roddick
said.</TE>
<TE>   He's had those days on the court, too. The serve is fine, but the
volley isn't.</TE>
<TE>   At the club, there was no crowd of 15,000, cheering his every
gesture. In some ways, it's tougher in front of the small crew and
cast on location. "I just don't want to mess up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Roddick couldn't help Sabrina, who had to resort to magic to
compete against her boyfriend on the court. And, maybe there should
have been some sort of cosmic tradeoff--she could have summoned  her
powers to  change his lousy draw at the Australian Open, which starts
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   You begin  to wonder about magic, superstitions and flat-out bad
luck for the top Americans when the 13th-seeded Roddick landed in the
same quarter of the draw as two-time defending champion and
third-seeded  Andre Agassi, No. 8 Pete Sampras and No. 9 Marat Safin
of Russia. What's this? Legends vs. kids?</TE>
<TE>   Still, any  conspiracy theories are dismissed when the case of
Australian favorite Lleyton Hewitt is considered. The U.S. Open
champion and top-ranked player, who is recovering from a recent
run-in with chickenpox, was not exactly handed a cure when the draw
came out. He will open against Alberto Martin of Spain and is in the
same half as Agassi, Sampras, Roddick and company.</TE>
<TE>   The women's draw is not nearly as unbalanced. Venus Williams,
seeded second, will try  to win her third consecutive Grand Slam,
following her Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles in 2001. For the first
time, she has put in early preparation in Australia, winning the Gold
Coast tournament two weeks ago. Williams is unbeaten in 20 matches
since losing to Meghann Shaughnessy in Palo Alto in July.</TE>
<TE>   She could meet her younger sister, fifth-seeded  Serena Williams,
in the semifinals if Serena gets past a possible quarterfinal against
No. 3 Martina Hingis of Switzerland. Hingis, who defeated
Shaughnessy, 6-2, 6-3, on Saturday in Sydney to win her first
tournament title in 11 months, has played  in the last five
Australian Open finals, winning three. Her last Grand Slam title was
the 1999 Australian Open, but since losing the top ranking last year,
Hingis seems to have relaxed, adopting the role of challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport, recovering from knee surgery, will not play.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jennifer Capriati is coming off a shaky
performance in a three-set loss to Alexandra Stevenson in Sydney, and
finds herself in the same half of the draw as Belgians  Kim
Clijsters, seeded fourth, and  Justine Henin, seeded sixth. Stevenson
and Anna Kournikova would be considered two dangerous, unseeded
floaters, if not for their first-round draws.</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson will play No. 10 Shaughnessy in the first round, and
Shaughnessy beat her in the quarterfinals in Sydney and reached the
final when Serena Williams retired because of  injury. Kournikova
will meet Henin in her first match at Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   An early Kournikova departure would turn full Australian attention
back to the fortunes of Hewitt and his troublesome draw. His quarter
is almost ridiculously loaded with talent. There's  11th-seeded Roger
Federer of Switzerland, No. 7 Tommy Haas of Germany and two former
Australian Open finalists, Carlos Moya of Spain and Marcelo Rios of
Chile. Federer won the tour event in Sydney after beating Roddick in
the semifinals. Rios, a former No. 1, is one of the most dangerous
floaters, along with Australian Mark Philippoussis, who is in the
lower half.</TE>
<TE>   And, another former Australian Open finalist is in Hewitt's
portion of the draw: No. 15 Arnaud Clement of France, who lost to
Agassi in straight sets in last year's final.</TE>
<TE>   This tournament has not been kind to native sons. It has been
almost 14 years since an Australian male reached the final (Pat
Cash), and the most recent singles champion was Mark Edmondson in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt lost early in Melbourne last year to Moya in the third
round, but it seems more like five years ago the way he has evolved.
After winning the U.S. Open in September, Hewitt has not relented,
becoming the youngest player to reach the No. 1 ranking. One of his
lesser-known accomplishments, even before the Open, was his stunning
victory in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup against Gustavo Kuerten
in April, on Kuerten's home clay turf in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The setting was different in New York at the Open, but it had a
Davis Cup-type feel when Hewitt faced Roddick in the quarterfinals.
Roddick, was angered by a controversial overrule late in the fifth
set and lost the match, throwing one of the biggest temper tantrums
of his young career.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick regained his equilibrium quickly after the loss, thanking
the crowd for the support. But it remains a defining episode and he
spoke about it during a break from trading shots with Sabrina.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost embarrassing," he said of his outburst.  "That's
something I've been working on. I've been seeing a sports
psychologist [in Boca Raton], so I'll have my fire. But I'm going to
have it in check. That's definitely important. That's a big part of
my energy and where my power and energy come from. At the same time,
I need to be able to step out of the situation and see it, from the
outside looking in, to say, 'Mellow out.'</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at ways, if I feel myself wandering, to snap out of
it and get back into the flow. The fans there were so great. I didn't
need them to hear me crying about everything. I was lucky to be out
there playing. I saved my fumes for when I was away from everybody."</TE>
<TE>   So what's next, hypnosis?</TE>
<TE>   Roddick shook his head but was quick with a one-liner.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I hear a bell ring, I have to cluck like a chicken,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   This will be Roddick's first Australian Open as a professional.
Last year, he realized he needed more matches and went to a
challenger event in Hawaii, and won it, instead of making the long
trip to Melbourne for qualifying. Unlike others before him, he
welcomes the hype, although not indulging in it but taking the best
it has to offer, like parts on WB shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely different," said Roddick, who plays Mariano
Zabaleta of Argentina in the first round. "I had a lot of exposure
this year. I'd rather have it that way than the other way because
that means you're winning matches. I like to set short-term goals, so
I feel like I'm close to it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you set something like, 'Career goal, I want to win 10 Grand
Slams.' But if you're sitting here at none, then it seems a little
unrealistic. If I set a goal, I want to be top-whatever [before]
Ericsson, it gives you something to strive for, something to go for."</TE>

<KH>PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Oregon Finally Solves Stanford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his five years as Oregon's coach, Ernie Kent has tried to
model the program after Arizona's, and especially after the one run
by his former boss, Stanford's Mike Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks trounced Arizona twice this season, but Kent's team had
never quite solved the Cardinal. Until Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Jackson scored 27 points and Chris Christoffersen had 16 as
Oregon defeated No. 14 Stanford, 87-79, at Eugene, Ore., to end a
10-game losing streak against the Cardinal.</LD>
<TE>   "They gave us a blueprint," Kent, who was an assistant to
Montgomery during the 1989-90 and 1990-91 seasons, said of Arizona
and Stanford. "For us to get to the level where we can play Stanford
and Arizona like we did this year, that shows the growth and
development of our program,"</TE>
<TE>   Frederick Jones had 12 points for the Ducks (12-4, 5-1), who
improved to 10-0--including 4-0 in the conference--at home. Oregon
was 3-6 against Pac-10 teams at McArthur Court last year.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Jacobsen scored a career-high 32 points to lead Stanford
(9-4, 2-2), but he made some key mistakes late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt good today, but it doesn't matter," Jacobsen said. "I
could care less how many points I scored."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen's previous high was 28 points last Dec. 22, in an 81-76
loss to Brigham Young.</TE>
<TE>   Center Curtis Borchardt, who had a career-high 29 points, cut
Stanford's deficit from 10 to one with some rare long-range shooting
proficiency. But with the Cardinal trailing, 78-75, Jacobsen missed
two free throws. Then, with under a minute left and the lead at five,
Jacobsen fumbled the ball out of bounds in the frontcourt.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, Oregon's Luke Ridnour was fouled and made both
free throws to ice it at 85-78 with 38 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Arizona 74, Washington 69--Jason Gardner scored 16 of his
21 points in the second half and had six assists to lead the Wildcats
(11-4, 4-2) over the Huskies (7-9, 1-5) at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner made a three-point basket with 2:45 left to make it 70-64.
Grant Leep's three-pointer from the right wing with 30.7 seconds to
go pulled Washington within 71-69.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner made a free throw, Washington's Curtis Allen missed a
three-pointer that would have tied it, and Salim Stoudamire made two
free throws for the Wildcats with 16.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn had his third consecutive 20-point game for the
Huskies, scoring 25 points. He has scored 77 points in his last three
games and is the first Washington player to have three consecutive
games with 20 or more since Todd MacCulloch in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 81, Washington State 71--Curtis Millage had a
career-high 24 points and Tommy Smith tied a season-high with 19
points and nine rebounds to lead the Sun Devils at Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (10-5, 3-3) used a 20-9 run in the first half to
pull away from the Cougars (4-10, 0-6), whose losing streak reached
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Moore led the Cougars with 23 points and made a school
record 16 of 16 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   California 61, Oregon State 53--Joe Shipp scored 14 points, and
A.J. Diggs hit the clinching shot with 25 seconds left as the Golden
Bears won at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Gates and Brian Wethers had 10 points each as California
(11-3, 2-2) won on the road for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jackson scored 16 points and Jimmie Haywood had 13 for the
Beavers (8-8, 1-5), who have lost four consecutive and seven in a row
to the Bears.</TE>

<PH>U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS</PH>
<KH>Mike Penner / ICE FOLLIES</KH>
<HD>Kwan Is ... Wait, Raiders Just Scored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Football or figure skating, that was the question.</LD>
<LD>   ABC made its call early on that one, opting to keep the
Raiders-Jets playoff game right where it was, on prime-time center
stage, and bumping the women's free skate at the U.S. Olympic trials
to a side lot known as ABC Family Channel.</LD>
<LD>   To put it another way, ABC opted for Al Michaels, Dan Fouts,
Dennis Miller and Eric Dickerson over Michelle Kwan, Sasha Cohen,
Sarah Hughes and Angela Nikodinov. I'm not sure I'd make the same
call, but I'm not paid to make those decisions.</LD>
<TE>   We had been told, again and again after their lively short-program
scrimmage, that Michelle and Sasha and Sarah and Angela composed one
of the all-time great starting lineups for a "championship ladies
free skating" final (as they call it in the program) at the U.S.
nationals.</TE>
<TE>   The Fearsome Foursome of U.S. championship ladies free skating.</TE>
<TE>   The Steel Curtain of U.S. championship ladies free skating.</TE>
<TE>   The Purple People Eaters of U.S. championship ladies free skating.</TE>
<TE>   Well, that's not entirely accurate.</TE>
<TE>   The Lilac, Lavender And Silver Sequined People Eaters, then.</TE>
<TE>   Any way you looked at it, it was a performance not to be missed.
But the figure skaters were going head to head with the Jets and
Raiders, and the Raiders used to be a big deal here, but the only way
to watch the skating final live was to drive out to Staples Center
and leave the big screen behind.</TE>
<TE>   What's a well-rounded sports enthusiast to do?</TE>
<TE>   One idea: Show up at Staples and head for the worst seat in the
house--a chair in the hockey press box, high above the Laker
championship banners, up among the rafters, a parachute dive away
from center ice. On the plus side, the press box has many television
monitors, with a couple available for pro football viewing.</TE>
<TE>   The monitors were silent, their volume functions disabled. ABC's
cameras showed Dickerson on the sideline, moving his mouth, but we
could not hear a word. This was not a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   So with one eye on the television, another on the ice and one ear
plugged to the radio, the competitions began.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets kicked off and the Raiders began their opening drive
while Stacey Pensgen of Fairport, N.Y., began her routine. Pensgen
was clad in blue, the Raiders in home black. Pensgen performed to the
theme music from "Dr. Zhivago," and at the same time, so did Tyrone
Wheatley. Not quite "Up She Rises" and John Facenda intoning, "The
autumn wind is a Raid-uh," but, you know, it did make Sebastian
Janikowski seem more graceful.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Cristobal of San Jose went next, skating to Rachmaninoff's
Piano Concerto No. 3, a long-standing favorite of the Black Hole.
There the denizens, wearing black and silver greasepaint and spikes
on their heads, glared into the camera and--since we couldn't really
hear--apparently screamed their support for the local girl.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders were leading, 9-3, late in the second quarter as
Hermosa Beach's Amber Corwin stepped onto the ice. Corwin was 21/2
minutes into an elegantly dispatched program when her music suddenly
stopped. So, at the same time, did the football game.</TE>
<TE>   Two-minute warning.</TE>
<TE>   After some awkward moments standing around with hands on hips, the
music finally restarted and Corwin and the Raiders and the Jets
resumed action. Ninety seconds later, Rich Gannon passed to Tim Brown
in the back of the end zone. Raiders 16, Jets 3, Corwin ranging from
4.9 to 5.5 for artistic presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The football game stopped for halftime. ABC ran a commercial for a
strange new game show featuring a dentist's chair, a ring of fire and
John McEnroe. The Staples Center video board flashed to a skater in
the kiss-and-cry area, her face streaked with tears.</TE>
<TE>   The football game moved into the fourth quarter. The ladies
championship free skate headed into its final group.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan led off as the Raiders punted. Kwan hit a triple lutz-double
loop combination, nailed a triple flip, eased into a spectacular
Charlotte spiral. She ended her program to a standing ovation, having
clinched her trip to the Winter Olympics. The Jets were going
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov had a rough night, but so did Herman Edwards. His Jets
fell behind, 22-10, shortly after Nikodinov fell on a triple loop and
doubled three triple jumps. Cohen went next, wearing black and
silver, and skated cleanly, just as Richie Anderson scored for the
Jets. Cohen had protected her second place standing and her berth on
the Olympic team. Up in Oakland, nobody was playing any defense.</TE>
<TE>   Next up: Hughes. The pressure was off, after Nikodinov's mistakes,
and Hughes did what she needed to do: No big mistakes, lots of 5.6s
and 5.7s, good enough for third place.</TE>
<TE>   The roster for the three-woman Olympic team was displayed on the
video board.</TE>
<TE>   1. Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   3. Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   The names were still glowing up there when the Raiders scored
again, Gannon to Rice, for a 31-17 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, Cohen and Hughes were headed for Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders were headed for New England.</TE>
<TE>   On tap for all parties: Cold weather. Rugged competition.</TE>
<TE>   But, finally, a TV slot to call their own.</TE>

<LD>It was like stepping to the plate after Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   It was like walking down the fairway behind Tiger Woods.</LD>
<LD>   At 7:10 p.m. Saturday, all the air had been sucked out of the
biggest room in town.</LD>
<TE>   The woman who had spent two months catching her breath gasped.</TE>
<TE>   Following her heart had been easy.</TE>
<TE>   But now Angela Nikodinov had to follow Michelle Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   The echoes of a standing ovation wafting down the Staples Center
hallways. Piles of stuffed yellow toys freshly plowed from the ice.
The announcement of two 6.0 scores bouncing off the boards.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, you there, you in fourth place, you who are still grieving
the recent death of your coach, you with the wobbly knees and puffy
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Your turn.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard," said Nikodinov. "I've skated right after Michele
before, so no excuses, but when you hear those 6.0s and all the
cheering.... "</TE>
<TE>   Hard. Then awkward. Then ugly. Then impossible.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:14 p.m. Saturday, the best story at the U.S. Figure Skating
championships became the most sadly predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov, the San Pedro woman struggling to overcome to
loss of teacher and best friend Elena Tcherkasskaia, could not.</TE>
<TE>   The woman recently transformed into one of the world's best
skaters wasn't even one of the three best in her country.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who was supposed to be the perfect Olympic story will
only compete in Salt Lake City if somebody better breaks a bone.</TE>
<TE>   A happy ending became just another ending.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really hold it together," she said quietly afterward.</TE>
<TE>   In a perfect world, she does, beating Kwan and finishing first.</TE>
<TE>   In a fair world, she at least summons the strength to move up one
spot from her fourth-place finish and qualify for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   But for all its eye shadow and lace, the figure skating world is
the real one.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say, 'Hey, I'm just going to just go for it,'" Nikodinov
said. "But you have to be in the right physical shape to go for it."</TE>
<TE>   And she wasn't. Loss had sapped her energy, inactivity had taken
her strength.</TE>
<TE>   In the real world Saturday, Angela Nikodinov sputtered, then
stalled.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she was neither ecstatic nor enraged, but simply
exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just kind of glad this is over with," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first half of her four-minute free skate, she soared.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like her life before Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   She hit a triple lutz. Hit a triple toe loop. Hit a triple flip.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, at the 50% mark, it shut down," explained her new coach,
Frank Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like her life after Nov. 12.</TE>
<TE>   She fell on a triple loop. Doubled a triple salchow. Doubled a
triple lutz. Singled a triple-toe loop.</TE>
<TE>   She was like a baseball player who, after hitting what could be an
inside-the-park homer to win the game, begins limping from exhaustion
after rounding second.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov was tagged out of the Olympics even before she had a
chance to round third. You wanted to find any excuse to cheer, but it
was difficult to even watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I believed I could do it," she said. "But at some point, it
doesn't matter how strong I feel inside. I have to have to be that
strong physically."</TE>
<TE>   How bad was it? When asked to put herself in Nikodinov's position
afterward, third-place finisher Sarah Hughes couldn't even bear to
speculate.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to have to face that," Hughes said. "I would not
want to put myself in that position if I didn't have to."</TE>
<TE>   As of Nov. 12, Nikodinov didn't have a choice.</TE>
<TE>   That was when Tcherkasskaia died of pancreatic cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov didn't even know her coach was seriously ill.</TE>
<TE>   This was the coach who turned her into this country's third-best
skater at last year's Nationals, and the fifth-best skater at the
worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov wasn't in championship shape? Of course she wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Between recovering from the shock of Tcherkasskaia's death and
mourning her loss, she essentially skated for more than two months
without a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot of changes recently adjusting to new training,"
she said. "It all takes time and, unfortunately, it had to happen
this late in the season."</TE>
<TE>   It happened so late, sometimes Nikodinov still has a hard time
believing its real.</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia was supposed to be leaning on the boards Saturday
night, warmly embracing Nikodinov with her huge eyes and expressive
voice.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she was a cold neon light high above the rink, oddly
enough on a scoreboard that still listed her as Nikodinov's coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see that," Nikodinov said. "Actually, I'm glad I didn't
see that."</TE>
<TE>   While skating, Nikodinov wore the tiny blue eye necklace that was
given to her by Tcherkasskaia. Called "the evil eye," it was supposed
to ward off nasty spirits.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, it looked like a tiny, harmless stone.</TE>
<TE>   And watching the other skaters backstage, you wondered.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan came off the ice, found herself standing next to estranged
coach Carroll and backed into a corner so the camera wouldn't catch
them in the same frame.</TE>
<TE>   You thought, at least Kwan had a choice.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes came off the ice, somebody asked her about finishing third
instead of second, and she started crying.</TE>
<TE>   You thought, through everything Saturday, Nikodinov didn't cry
once.</TE>
<TE>   She made no excuses. She offered no alibis. She even tried to
console onlookers who greeted her with sad faces, saying, "Why so
somber?"</TE>
<TE>   She said that, even at 21, she hasn't given up hopes of making the
Olympics when she's 25.</TE>
<TE>   "I will go back to work,'' she said. "I will get better.''</TE>
<TE>   For all the messiness Saturday, that is the lasting memory of
Angela Nikodinov's skate.</TE>
<TE>   Not the part of about her falling. The part about her getting back
up.</TE>

<HD>Loss Left Lavin Neither Shaken Nor Stirred</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem with playing such less-than-significant basketball
schools as Northridge or USC, especially when you are a big-time
basketball powerhouse like UCLA, is you might be caught looking ahead
to another big-time basketball school--such as Kansas--and maybe lose
to one of college basketball's pipsqueaks.</LD>
<LD>   That's always upsetting, and for some people who don't understand
basketball as well as you and I do, they look on a fluky loss to one
of these nowhere basketball schools such as Northridge or USC as the
end of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Some people consider this a coaching flaw when discussing UCLA's
Steve Lavin, I guess suggesting his team should win every game.</LD>
<TE>   But I look at all of this as entertainment, like Goldfinger
telling James Bond he's a goner while a laser works its way up a
table to split 007 in half, but everyone in the audience knowing Bond
will escape and, ultimately, triumph. Obviously, I don't see any
comparisons between Bond and Bob Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing Bond's tastes, I wouldn't think he'd give a second look to
Cinderella, and here was UCLA in much the same situation Thursday--
playing an unranked team from a program that doesn't attract many
faithful basketball fans. How do you get excited playing Plain Jane
when two days later you're going to be playing against Kansas, the
No. 1 team in the whole United States of America?</TE>
<TE>   If you're the Bruins, are you going to trot out your best stuff
for Fox cable or for a Saturday national TV audience? The credit goes
to Lavin for having all his players show up Thursday night, all of
them obviously aware they were missing the climactic episode of
"Survivor" to play a meaningless game.</TE>
<TE>   The fact it was a Pacific 10 Conference game means nothing anymore
because there is going to be a Pac-10 Conference tournament in
Staples Center at season's end when this whole thing will really be
sorted out.</TE>
<TE>   If Thursday's game had really meant something, do you think Lavin
would have kept Cedric Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre
Patterson--his collection of super freshmen-- on the bench for much
of the game? He didn't let any of them score a single point--because
what's the challenge or lesson learned in scoring against an unranked
school known best for having a good football team years ago?</TE>
<TE>   Saturday he played the kids a combined 50 minutes against Kansas,
in a game that everyone across the country was watching, and UCLA won
by 10.</TE>
<TE>   For all I know, Lavin let his assistants do the coaching against
USC, which allowed Henry Bibby to feel what it's like to beat UCLA.
Back to work Saturday. Of course, it really wasn't much of a
match--Lavin versus Roy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The game with Kansas was probably as good as college basketball
can get, with the crowd getting a full dose of entertainment and the
best of Matt Barnes and Dan Gadzuric. I saw UCLA Athletic Director
Peter Dalis after the victory, and he was so excited I think he might
have offered Lavin a lifetime contract had they not been walking to
opposite ends of the court.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third consecutive year Lavin's team has knocked off
the No. 1 team. That's as much fun a team and its fans can have. You
can't knock off the No. 1 team in the nation and have all that fun if
you win all your games and you're ranked No. 1--and I think you can
be pretty sure Lavin won't let that happen.</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday's game a group of more than 100 boosters gathered
to listen to Lavin, many of them drinking sparkling white wine at
10a.m. because a season with Lavin will do that to you. Someone asked
him if news reports after the USC game were true, which suggested the
Trojans wanted to win more than the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin told the crowd the Trojans played every moment as if they
were playing the national championship game. As you know,
"Hoosiers"-like teams from Northridge and USC are going to do that
when they get the chance to play a big-time school like UCLA, and the
gutty little Trojans deserve credit.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the Bruins go, they played just OK and lost Thursday,
which meant Saturday was a trademark, bounce-back day for a Lavin
team. Kansas never had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   I know what you're thinking, and I checked. The Bruins play the
Trojans again on a forgettable Wednesday in February, as if they're
really going to care, knowing they will play at Villanova the
following Saturday in a nationally televised game. I wouldn't be
surprised if they lose again to USC, knowing Villanova's fine
basketball reputation and how much the Bruins will be looking forward
to playing that school.</TE>
<TE>   THE BRUINS' games are broadcast on KXTA (1150), and before the
game with Kansas, Dave Smith blasted the local media for going easy
on Shaq. When a caller told Smith that 1150 has been going easy on
Lavin because it's the Bruins' station, Smith said, "We're backed up
against the hour," and cut the caller off. Then he took another call.</TE>
<TE>   WORD IS Steve Spurrier will become coach of the Washington
Redskins on Monday, which will clear the way for Bobby Beathard to
return to Washington as general manager. This probably rules out any
trade between the Cowboys and Redskins involving Ryan Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   THIS COMES from ESPN.com's Jayson Stark:  The Dodgers' Marquis
Grissom has made more outs in the last 10 years (4,441) than any
other player. Eric Karros is fifth at 4,248--but climbing fast.</TE>
<TE>   PETE MOYER, the guy who is trying to help refinance our home, told
me Bob Dougherty, his father-in-law, is a swell guy and a diehard
Raider fan. After I asked Moyer to leave our home he called back to
say his father-in-law was now a Rams' fan.</TE>
<TE>   It's still going to be tough, but I think we can do business.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Lilboydboy:</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you may get paid to write your stupid opinions--none
of it is appreciated by us Angel Fans."</TE>
<TE>   And I'd work for nothing if I were just appreciated more.</TE>

<LD>Beatrisa Liang of Granada Hills was a sensation at last year's
national competition at Boston, where she finished sixth.</LD>
<LD>   With a more ambitious program this year, she fell twice and
finished 10th, a disappointing result for the precocious 13-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   "I need a little work on my stamina," said Liang, who fell on the
second part of her triple toe-triple toe combination and on her
triple salchow. "Next year I'll try harder on stamina. It's just
another thing to work on."</LD>
<TE>   Amber Corwin of Hermosa Beach had the bad luck of having her music
stop as she dug her toe pick into the ice for a triple lutz.
Surprised by the silence, she fell; when she got up, she skated to
the judges to ask for another chance.</TE>
<TE>   She was allowed to pick up her routine from just before that
point, but she felt her program and mood had been disrupted. The
23-year-old Long Beach State student finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weird. I don't think that ever happened to me," she said.
"It threw off the line of my program. It's a little disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Another Southland skater, Ye Bin Mok of Los Angeles, finished
ninth. "It felt great out there," said Mok, who has fought through
back problems. "I'm so relieved it's over, and I'm so happy."</TE>
<TE>   Said her coach, Peter Oppegard: "She lost her stuff for a while
but she really worked hard to get it back.... I'm really proud of
her."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a sellout crowd Saturday, the event set an attendance
record with 125,345 tickets distributed to all sessions at Staples
Center and the Sports Arena. That broke the record set last year at
Boston of 124,372.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's attendance of 18,035 was the largest at the U.S.
championships since 1998, when a crowd of 19,082 attended the women's
free skate.</TE>

<LD>UC Riverside 68, Cal State Fullerton 60--The host Highlanders pulled
through in the end to defeat the Titans in a Big West game between
teams fighting for survival.</LD>
<LD>   John Galbreath had 19 points, Lloyd Cook added 14 and Vili Morton
finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds for Riverside. Mark Miller
came off the bench to score 13, including making four free throws
down the stretch to hold off the Titans.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't a pretty effort as the Highlanders (6-7, 3-2) committed
22 turnovers and had enough problems to let the Titans hang around.</LD>
<TE>   "We battled the whole way through," Cook said. "They were
competitive the whole game and I don't think a lot of people
recognize how good that team really is."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton (3-11, 0-5) can appreciate the kind words but they
aren't helping the Titans win.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton has lost seven games by 10 points or fewer and are doing
it with a familiar storyline. They play hard but can't come up with
the key plays at the right time. They continued a season-long pattern
of poor shooting. The Titans made only 17 of 63 shots and their 27%
shooting was the worst since 1995. They also missed 14 of 36 free
throws.</TE>

<LD>UC Irvine 92, Idaho 54--Mike Hood scored a career-high 25 points to
help the Anteaters go 2-0 in a Big West road trip this week.</LD>
<LD>   It was the largest victory margin for UC Irvine (12-4, 5-0) since
beating Salem State by 38 points in 1993. Stanislav Zuzak and Jerry
Green scored 14 points each, and Adam Parada added 12 for the
Anteaters, who stayed atop the conference standings with their
seventh consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   David Howell scored 17 points to lead Idaho (4-11, 1-5).</LD>
<TE>   Pacific 73, UC Santa Barbara 70--Maurice McLemore and Eli Nolan
each scored 11 points to lead Pacific to a Big West Conference
victory in Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific (11-4, 3-2 Big West) trailed, 49-43, midway through the
second half but took the lead for good with a 15-5 run. Demetrius
Jackson scored five of those points for the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara (10-5, 4-2) was led by Mark Hull with 18 points and
Adama Ndiaye with 17.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State 70, Long Beach State 66--Desmond Penigar had 26 points
and 11 rebounds to help the Aggies win a Big West Conference game and
avoid successive homecourt losses for the first time since 1992-93
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies (4-2 in Big West, 12-3 overall), who had their 31-game
homecourt winning streak ended by UC Irvine on Thursday, were last
swept at home by Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Reed scored 18 points to lead the Niners (1-4, 5-11), who
are 0-7 on the road this season.</TE>

<LD>Loyola Marymount 75, St. Mary's 64--Greg Lakey and Keith Kincade each
had 14 points as a bigger and faster Loyola Marymount coasted to a
Big West victory.</LD>
<LD>   After taking an early 10-6 lead, St. Mary's cooled considerably.
The Gaels missed 16 consecutive shots from the floor and were
outscored by the Lions, 20-2, during a nine-minute stretch as Loyola,
behind Lakey's eight points in the half, took a 32-18 halftime
advantage.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola (8-8, 1-1) continued to dominate in the second half,
building its lead to as many as 22 points with 9:21 remaining.</LD>
<TE>   St. Mary's (5-10, 0-2) was led by Chase Poole's 14 points.</TE>

<LD>Cal State Northridge 72, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 62--The Matadors
used a strong defensive effort and a big second half to pull away for
a Big West Conference victory before 1,250 at Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   A ball-hawking press set the tempo in the second half, when
Northridge extended a two-point halftime lead to as many as 14. The
Matadors (4-10, 3-2) rebounded from a poor-shooting first half to
make 66.7% (18 for 27) of their shots from the field in the second
half.</LD>
<LD>   Northridge forced 20 turnovers for the second consecutive game as
Cal Poly (9-5, 3-3) struggled to get into its offense after enjoying
an early lead.</LD>
<TE>   Curtis Slaughter and point guard Markus Carr each scored 15 for
Northridge, which held Cal Poly without a basket for nearly five
minutes during a pivotal stretch in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Carr's steal and layup capped a 6-0 run that gave the Matadors a
57-47 lead with 6:56 to play, and they led by at least eight the rest
of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Carr also contributed team-high totals of 10 assists, seven
rebounds and three steals, a performance that went a long way toward
erasing the memory of his three-for-18 shooting in a 57-54 Big West
loss to UC Santa Barbara on Thursday.</TE>

<LD>The Wisconsin Badgers quietly waited in their locker room waiting to
find out if they had won.</LD>
<LD>   "When we heard their fans boo, we knew," Wisconsin's Freddie Owens
said with a grin.</LD>
<LD>   The Badgers ended the nation's longest home winning streak at 53
games, defeating No. 25 Michigan State, 64-63, Saturday at East
Lansing, Mich., after an alley-oop layup by Kelvin Torbert was
disallowed with two-tenths of a second left.</LD>
<TE>   Officials made the decision not to count Torbert's basket after
they watched television replays.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's loss and Detroit's 75-74 overtime win over Wright
State on Saturday give the Titans the longest home winning streak at
37 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The better team won today," said Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo,
who agreed with the officials' final decision. "It's disheartening
because a great streak has come to an end."</TE>
<TE>   The previous team to beat Michigan State at home was Purdue on
March 1, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We got just about what we deserved," Izzo said.</TE>
<TE>   Home fires doused: Another team that recently saw a long
home-court winning streak end struggled for the second consecutive
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But No. 16 Boston College's 70-43 home loss to Georgetown--the
Eagles had won 25 in a row at home and now have a two-game losing
streak there--was one guard Troy Bell took hard.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most embarrassing game I've ever been a part of in
my life," said Bell, who was held to eight points.</TE>
<TE>   More losing: The end of the home-court winning streak carousel
doesn't stop spinning there. Georgia State, which also had won 25 in
a row at home, lost to Jacksonville, 84-72, at Atlanta. On Thursday,
Utah State's 31-game home winning streak fell against UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Etched in Stone: Marvin Stone officially became a member of
Louisville's team before ever talking to Rick Pitino, something the
Cardinal coach had said he needed to do to make a final decision.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was Stone's mother, Lois, who convinced Pitino in a
phone conversation Friday night to take her son, who transferred from
Kentucky, before she and Marvin met with Pitino on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have to speak to Marvin after speaking with his mom,"
Pitino said. "I wish more parents were like her. She's the type of
lady that, you get on the wrong side of her, you're going to get a
broom over your head. She's a strong disciplinarian."</TE>
<TE>   Stealing the show: We're not sure what Jehiel Lewis specialty is
with the Navy, but perhaps he should angle for a career in espionage,
especially if his ability to steal secrets is anywhere near his
ability to steal a basketball.</TE>
<TE>   In leading the Midshipmen to a 64-49 victory against Bucknell,
Lewis racked up 21 points, nine assists and a school and Patriot
League record 12 steals, one shy of the NCAA mark set twice by
Oklahoma's Mookie Blaylock in 1987 and '88.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' steal total is the most in Division I this season and he's
the fifth to have 12 in a game, the most recent being Texas
Christian's Greedy Daniels against Arkansas Pine Bluff on Dec. 30,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Temple of doom: Temple's 60-42 victory against Rhode Island is
typical of a John Cheney-coached team--gritty defense, opportunistic
offense, late surge to win.</TE>
<TE>   It also marked the 50th consecutive time the Owls have won when
holding their opponents under 50 points.</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Keith McLeod, a 6-2 senior guard, scored a
career-high 42 points to lead Bowling Green to an 85-73 victory
against Buffalo in a Mid-American Conference game at Amherst, N.Y.
McLeod made 17 of 18 from the free-throw line as the Falcons improved
to 13-1.</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Long Island took a 20-point halftime
deficit into the locker room and lost, 85-66, to Robert Morris at
Coraopolis, Pa., as the Blackbirds fell to 0-13. They are one of only
three teams in Division I still winless. Arkansas Pine Bluff (0-14)
and Morgan State (0-14) are the others.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>There were 68,145 crammed into Qualcomm Stadium on Saturday for the
second round of the AMA/EA Sports Supercross Series, which caused a
30-minute delay to accommodate the crowd.</LD>
<LD>   They jammed inside to see defending champion Ricky Carmichael race
for the first time since suffering a mild concussion last week at
Anaheim, to see seven-time champion Jeremy McGrath of nearby
Encinitas try to win for the first time in nearly a year and to get
their first look at 16-year-old James "Bubba" Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   They got history with Stewart, and they got more of French rider
David Vuillemin from Team Yamaha.</LD>
<TE>   For the second time in the season's first two races, Vuillemin
took the checkered flag, stretching his lead in the race and the
series standings. Vuillemin, who resides in Corona, won four races in
2000 but was shut out last season as Carmichael won 14 and McGrath
twice.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael, 22, of Havana, Fla., didn't disappoint early, winning
his heat race easily, outdistancing Kevin Windham and McGrath, to
transfer to the main event. He was racing with facial lacerations, an
injured hand and a mild concussion. But Carmichael was no match for
Vuillemin in the main event.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael followed second-place Pastrana and Team Honda teammate
Mike LaRocco to the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath finished 10th. Stewart, from Haines City, Fla., became the
youngest rider to ever win a professional supercross event.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, riding for Team Chevy Trucks Kawasaki, turned 16 on Dec.
21.</TE>

<HD>No.1 Hit Has UCLA Rocking</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Barnes scores 27 points and Bruins
rebound by knocking off top-ranked Kansas, 87-77, before rare sellout
at Pauley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beating No. 1 and being No. 1 are as far apart as the end lines. One
involves a great day, the other, great days.</LD>
<LD>   But when a day is this wonderful, UCLA found no harm in soaking in
adulation that comes grudgingly in this town.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after taking an embarrassing tumble, the Bruins took a
huge step forward Saturday, pummeling No.1 Kansas, 87-77, in front of
a noisy capacity Pauley Pavilion crowd of 12,280 and a national TV
audience.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great feeling," said Matt Barnes, who followed a
career-high 34-point performance against USC with a game-high 27
against the Jayhawks.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get more like it. Let's do this more often."</TE>
<TE>   Students poured onto the court as the horn sounded, mobbing
players as if it were March and a banner had been won. Maybe the fans
were thanking Barnes for visiting them Friday night while they camped
out in front of the ticket booth. Maybe they were grateful that the
sour taste of losing to USC was washed away so swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe beneath all that California cool beats the hearts of bona
fide college basketball fans. This was the first sellout since late
last season. No coincidence the opponent was No. 1 Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "We get great home crowds in marquee matchups," Coach Steve Lavin
said. "That's when the fans come out."</TE>
<TE>   And this time they left pleased. While driving home, many no doubt
asked, "Why can't the Bruins play this well every game?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in the locker room the Bruins asked, "Why can't this
many fans show up loud and lusty every game?"</TE>
<TE>   Bruin fans might blanch at the comparison, but they are no
different than their team, showing up in force against top opponents
and sauntering in when they feel like it against mediocre ones. No.
11 UCLA (12-3) made like No. 1 against No. 1 on a day their fans made
the game their No. 1 priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see them at every game, but people have other
things to do," center Dan Gadzuric said. "We need to do what we need
to do and they'll come out."</TE>
<TE>   Supreme confidence, suffocating defense and slick shooting was
needed against Kansas (13-2), which had not lost since its opener and
reached the top of the rankings last week.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes led the way, making 10 of 14 shots. Billy Knight added 20
points, many coming on late free throws, and Jason Kapono had seven
rebounds and 10 points despite making only three of 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric played only 17 minutes because of foul trouble, but they
were dominant minutes. He made six of nine shots for 13 points,
blocked three shots and helped contain the Jayhawks' vaunted low-post
combination of Drew Gooden and Nick Collison.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden had 22 points and 10 rebounds, but made only seven of 17
shots and one of six three-point attempts. Collison had six points
and one rebound before fouling out and was collared for stretches by
Bruin freshman Andre Patterson, who had five rebounds in 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   All four UCLA freshmen had shining moments, a sharp contrast to
the USC game, when they appeared lost. Guard Cedric Bozeman had his
best game, running the offense with confidence for 27 minutes,
scoring four points and passing for three assists.</TE>
<TE>   Dijon Thompson, another freshman who did absolutely nothing
against the Trojans, made a big play on each end of the floor.</TE>
<TE>   He blocked a shot by Gooden from behind in the waning seconds of
the first half, and when the All-American forward looked back to see
who had the temerity to stuff him, Thompson grinned and the horn
sounded with UCLA ahead, 46-35.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson made a three-point shot with 10 minutes to play after
Patterson forced a turnover to extend the lead to 65-56. Redshirt
freshman Ryan Walcott, a forgotten man since Bozeman returned from a
knee injury two weeks ago, also got into the act, passing for two
assists in four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the seniors--Barnes, Gadzuric, Knight and Rico
Hines--who were most composed amid the din.</TE>
<TE>   "We were calm and confident before the game and in timeout
huddles," Lavin said. "We have salty veterans who understand that a
season is a marathon."</TE>
<TE>   The composure was tested with nine minutes to play. Gadzuric was
called for his fourth foul when it appeared Patterson actually
committed the infraction. Lavin protested wildly, and Kansas guard
Kirk Hinrich seized the moment by sinking consecutive three-point
baskets to cut the margin to 65-61.</TE>
<TE>   But order was restored when Barnes put back a missed shot by
Knight and Kapono made a 15-footer. Kansas had one more surge,
pulling to within 80-77 with 1:42 left. But the Bruins clamped down
defensively and Knight made six of his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "USC taught us a lesson," Knight said. "Sometimes you get lulled
into thinking you just have to come out and run the offense and
defense and you'll win. That game reminded us you have to play with
heart. The key now is to go back to conference games with the same
intensity."</TE>
<TE>   A packed Pauley Pavilion for the next home game wouldn't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Golly, I don't know how good we'd be if we had a crowd like this
every night," forward T.J. Cummings said. "Sometimes our crowd is up
and down--just like we are. They gave us a big boost today."</TE>

<LD>UCLA had no complaints about the vocal, capacity crowd Saturday. OK,
there was one complaint.</LD>
<LD>   When senior guard Rico Hines hustled from the bench to enter the
game in the first half, he was booed. It did not go unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   "Those people do not understand what Rico means to our team,"
Coach Steve Lavin said. "It's a tough town, we all know that, and I
don't mind them getting on me, but a fifth-year senior, a great
example like Rico Hines should be embraced."</LD>
<TE>   Hines did not score in 11 minutes and has scored only 12 points in
328 minutes this season. But UCLA is 10-1 with him in the starting
lineup, he plays sound defense and is a mature leader.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a lunch-pail guy, a hard-hat guy," Lavin said. "He's a
captain for a reason."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Bartow hadn't been to a UCLA game since the last one he
coached in 1977. But there he was, scouting for the Memphis
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   "Pauley Pavilion looks exactly the same," he said. "It brings back
wonderful memories."</TE>
<TE>   Bartow, of course, had the unenviable task of following John
Wooden, who won 10 NCAA championships at UCLA. Although the Bruins
were 52-9 and won conference titles in his two seasons, Bartow could
not add another NCAA championship banner.</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Thursday at Arizona State (10-5, 3-3), 5:30 p.m.--The Bruins
resume Pacific 10 play against the Sun Devils, who have four
returning starters and are strong on the interior with forward Awvee
Storey and center Chad Prewitt.</TE>

<LD>With the team struggling early in the season, USC Coach Henry Bibby
shook up the Trojans, who were 1-1 and shooting 11% (two of 18) from
beyond the three-point stripe.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after a loss to Fresno State in the Preseason National
Invitation Tournament on Nov. 15, Bibby announced after a practice
that there would be a roommate switch.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea what he was talking about," junior guard Robert
Hutchinson said. "I thought he was just joking about switching rooms.
Looks like it worked, though."</LD>
<TE>   The surprised players went along with Bibby's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Hutchinson roomed with sophomore Jerry Dupree while
seniors Brandon Granville and Gennaro Busterna shared a place, as did
seniors David Bluthenthal and Sam Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's decree paired Clancy and Granville, Bluthenthal and
Hutchinson, and Busterna and Dupree.</TE>
<TE>   Since the switch, the Trojans have won 12 of 13 games and are 5-0
in Pacific 10 Conference play.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to expect from Coach sometimes," Granville
said. "I've been here four years and pretty much seen it all, so I
wasn't really surprised. But Bibby's the head man, and he does what
he wants to."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Bibby's a character," he said. "He can be superstitious, at
times, even though he doesn't like to admit it."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal admitted that the move probably helped him focus.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play as many video games as I did," he said. "Sam has
PlayStation 2, so I was always playing that. Now I spend more time in
the gym working out instead of playing video games."</TE>
<TE>   So Clancy was a bad influence?</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't being a bad influence," Bluthenthal said with a sly
grin. "He just had video games."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, meanwhile, downplayed the switch as a possible catalyst
for the Trojans' recent run, in which they've won nine consecutive
games and appear on the verge of rejoining the rankings for the first
time since moving day. USC, coming off an 81-77 victory over No. 11
UCLA, plays at No. 20 Arizona on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it does [correlate]," Clancy said. "We would have
finally come around. I don't think the roommate change had too much
to do with it. It is a little interesting, but we couldn't have
played bad the whole season.</TE>
<TE>   "I like my new roommate ... better because of the way we set the
apartment up."</TE>

<LD>USC (8-7, 4-2) at UCLA (5-9, 2-4), 2, KACD (850), KEWS (1340), KMPC
(1540)--Home-court advantage has been a recent factor in this series.
The Trojans, coming off an 80-79 overtime loss at Washington, have
not won at Pauley Pavilion since Jan. 24, 1997, losing their last
four games there. UCLA, coming off a 76-64 victory at Washington
State, probably needs to frustrate USC into turnovers and keep the
score in the 60s to have a chance.</LD>

<HD>Rumors Are a Millstone for Greco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michelle Greco keeps hearing the rumors. She got pregnant. Her grades
were bad.</LD>
<LD>   And then there was this one: UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier conspired to
sideline the senior until next year, when a strong recruiting class
is scheduled to arrive.</LD>
<LD>   Greco, 21, is sitting out the season at UCLA, but not for any of
those reasons.  She has a history of concussions. A series of
preseason tests convinced UCLA doctors she was in danger of another
injury, and they have refused to clear her to return to the team. She
hasn't played since Dec. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Greco is both amused and irritated by the continued gossip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating knowing that people aren't buying my story,"
Greco said. "Why do I have to prove to people why I'm sitting out?
It's kind of sad to me to think people have been making up rumors
about me.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want people to think that I've gotten pregnant, or I
can't pass my classes. That's offensive."</TE>
<TE>   She does understand, however, how the grist for the rumor mill was
created. Greco and UCLA officials were vague on the details regarding
her condition, and on the amount of testing she has undergone. And
there was the fact she played in five games, averaging 26.3 points
before being shut down.</TE>
<TE>   "I was honest," Greco said. "I may not have been overly up front
with every little detail, but it still should not be a cause for
people to blow things out of proportion."</TE>
<TE>   She underwent tests before the season and most came out
fine--except one. That test result, which UCLA officials said was not
available until after the season started, has her sitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're trying to be cautious," Greco said of team
physicians. "So it's weird--I don't know when I'm going to play. It's
not like there's a timetable on my brain."</TE>
<TE>   She hates missing today's  game against USC at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't describe the feeling when you run out [on the floor]
before the game," said Greco, who led the Pacific 10 in scoring
(19.9) last year and has averaged 13.2 points against the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear our band, then you hear the USC band try to top it. The
rivalry creates so much extra fire in you."</TE>

<HD>Frankly, Kwan Is Magnificent</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Criticized after split with coach, she
responds with dazzling display, wins U.S. title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This one was for herself. Not for her parents, not for her family and
certainly not for the doubters who have second-guessed her throughout
every stage of her tumultuous season.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Kwan skated Saturday for the same reasons she became
enchanted by the sport as a tot in Torrance: for the freedom, the
beauty, the emotional release she feels nowhere but on the ice. She
found what she sought--and much more.</LD>
<LD>   Performing before a Staples Center crowd of 18,035 that wanted to
love her and had ample reason to stand in tribute when she was done,
Kwan earned two perfect 6s for the presentation of her long program
and swept past a strong field to win her sixth U.S. title.</LD>
<TE>   Joining her on the U.S. women's team at the Salt Lake City Winter
Games are Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, whose flirty, spirited
"Carmen" long program helped her remain in second place, and Sarah
Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., whose seven triples were the most among
the top contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, physically and emotionally depleted
after losing her coach to cancer and unable to train as much as she
wanted, finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an excellent team," said Frank Carroll, who coaches
Nikodinov and coached Kwan for nearly 10 years, until October. "I
think we'd be an excellent team with Angela, too. Our women's singles
skaters are incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, 21, was distracted by a minor collision with Cohen during
the warmup and needed to take a sip of water and circle one end of
the ice an extra time before she began her 4-minute "Sheherezade"
program. Once she began, though, she was in a world of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt pretty amazing tonight," said Kwan, who acknowledged she
would need to perform a triple-triple combination at the Olympics, a
jump she reduced to a triple-double Saturday and for which she lost a
few tenths of a point on her technical marks.</TE>
<TE>   "I skated with freedom. I haven't felt like this in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, who moved her training base from El Segundo to Lake
Arrowhead two months ago after she parted company with Carroll, will
get a second chance to claim the gold medal that eluded her at Nagano
in 1998. With that incentive, she was more aggressive than she has
been in a generally sub-par season season, earning her 26th and 27th
perfect marks in the U.S. championships and 32nd and 33rd in major
international meets.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had this energy the last four months or so," she said. "It
was ready to burst, ready to go. Tonight, I let it all out. I just
let it go, let it breathe.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to skate like this just for myself. Not for my critics,"
she said, spreading her arms to encompass the crowd of reporters in
front of her. "But I'm not bitter or anything," she added, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did she feel her performance Saturday vindicated her risky
choice to go it alone and without a coach. "This skating was the
freedom and the joy that's always been there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's joy on the ice was apparent. After missing last year's
national championships because of a back injury and failing to land a
promised quadruple jump three times this season, she had to
reestablish her presence with the judges. She did that brilliantly
Saturday in a performance marred only when she put her hand down on
her final jump, a triple salchow.</TE>
<TE>   She got seven second-place votes and two third-place votes from
the nine judges; Hughes got the other two second-place votes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so excited. I can't, like, really believe it yet," said
Cohen, who trains in Aliso Viejo. "It's that moment you've been
training for. It's one chance, four minutes, 18,000 people watching.
You have that one chance."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was disappointed with her placement, which was a bit of a
comedown after a spectacular season in which she defeated Kwan at
Skate Canada and finished third at the Grand Prix Final. She lacked
her usual luminous quality Saturday and reduced the difficulty of her
planned triple-triple to a triple-single, but still received marks of
5.6 to 5.8 for technical merit and 5.5 to 5.8 for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about her emotions, she replied, "Mixed," before giving way
to her coach, Robin Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disappointed," Wagner said. "She's a fighter and she's on
the Olympic team, and that was our goal."When she regained her
composure, Hughes recognized that making the Olympic team was the
important result, not her placement. "It was a tough week, but I felt
prepared," she said. "It's amazing. It's always been a dream of mine
to make the Salt Lake City Olympic team. It's fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov, understandably upset at missing the team, said she
wished she could have had more training time with Carroll to fortify
her stamina. The first half of her program was a perfect blend of
artistry and athleticism, but she fell apart after she fell on her
planned triple loop. She simplified two triples to doubles, and
another triple to a single.</TE>
<TE>   "Near the end of the program, no matter how much you believe in
yourself, it's how much you're in condition," said Nikodinov, who
wore the blue gemstone necklace given to her by her late coach, Elena
Tcherkasskaia, who died of cancer in November.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to look back now and say, 'If I gave that extra little
shot,' but I just have to learn from my mistake.... I'm just kind of
glad this is over."</TE>

<LD>In order to understand what makes a terrific figure skater, you have
to look at the whole picture. You have to look at what makes a
picture a painting, what makes a painting a work of art and what
makes a work of art a masterpiece.</LD>
<LD>   Content is important. But, in figure skating, you can't just count
the triple jumps, subtract the falls and other mistakes and determine
the winner. It is the intangibles that creates figure skating stars
and perhaps Olympic medalists.</LD>
<LD>   When Michelle Kwan does an inside spiral and causes 18,000 people
at Staples Center to roar in spontaneous approval. ... When Sasha
Cohen does inside half axel turns and sliding extensions with her
legs at 180 degrees perfectly split....</LD>
<TE>   They can both turn a painting into a work of art, and maybe even a
masterpiece, and Sarah Hughes is quickly developing that potential.
They provided us with a phenomenal night of skating in the women's
long program Saturday night, these three women holding it together
while battling each other with berths on the Olympic team at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, although she deserved to win, did not produce a masterpiece.
But she is a master. She has such great confidence, smiling in
mid-air on her triple flip. Her whole program is subtle and elegant
and the presentation is mature. She has the intangibles, that
undefinable it.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't complete her triple-triple combination Saturday night,
doubling the second jump, but if she can hit the second triple in
Salt Lake City, that will provide the spark that could transform her
long program into a truly electric performance and make it extremely
difficult for anyone to beat her.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is the most innovative of the three. Everything about her
long program was fresh and exciting. She is a huge threat in Salt
Lake City to the women, the Russians Irina Slutskaya and Maria
Butyrskaya and even Kwan, who got used to not seeing her last year
because of her back injury.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes has incredible landings. She goes from the air to the
landing position with no hitch. The surety of her landings on her
high jumps enables you as a member of the audience to relax when she
is in the air because you never have the feeling she is going to
fall.</TE>
<TE>   You never see the ice chips shoot out from her blades on her
landings.</TE>
<TE>   She has all the technical elements, and the emotional side to her
skating is coming together.</TE>
<TE>   All three have got to be excited at night when they go to bed,
thinking about their possibilities in Salt Lake City. Kwan has
positioned herself as a favorite for the gold medal, but the other
two are right there with her. It is a very strong Olympic team.</TE>

<HD>Ravens, Dolphins Hope to Get a Grip</HD>
<DH>Pro football: AFC wild-card game between the low-scoring
teams could turn on turnovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Combine dominating defenses with turnover-prone offenses led by
erratic quarterbacks and you've got today's playoff game between the
Baltimore Ravens and Miami Dolphins.</LD>
<LD>   Should be a bruising, low-scoring game, right?</LD>
<LD>   "It'll be 69-68," Raven Coach Brian Billick joked.</LD>
<TE>   Not likely. One touchdown may be enough to win, which means one
turnover may be enough to lose.</TE>
<TE>   For both teams, the goal will be to stay away from the giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a factor in the playoffs," Miami quarterback Jay
Fiedler said. "Every mistake is magnified."</TE>
<TE>   That's another thing the teams have in common: mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami (11-5) and Baltimore (10-6) had taken better care of the
ball this season, they would have won their divisions and earned a
first-round bye. But the Ravens and Dolphins ranked near the bottom
in the NFL with 36 and 38 turnovers, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like looking in a mirror," Miami Coach Dave Wannstedt said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Ravens, turnovers have been the biggest change from last
season, when they won the Super Bowl. In 2000, Baltimore led the NFL
with a turnover differential of plus-23. This season the Ravens rank
23rd at minus-eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins were even worse, tying for 27th at minus-10. In the
five games they lost, the Dolphins committed 20 turnovers and forced
none.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't afford to turn it over," Dolphin tight end Hunter
Goodwin said. "One time could cost you the game. We just have to be
careful with the ball and not do anything too fancy."</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for the Ravens, who committed 22 turnovers and
forced only five in games they lost.</TE>
<TE>   "There are only so many opportunities with the ball in the
playoffs," quarterback Elvis Grbac said. "You've got to take care of
the prize that you have."</TE>
<TE>   Both quarterbacks have struggled, but Fiedler has become more
careful with the ball, while Grbac has gotten sloppier. Grbac threw
for 28 touchdowns with 14 interceptions last season for Kansas City;
this season he has 15 touchdown passes and 18 interceptions. The
Ravens are 0-5 when he has at least two passes picked off.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler has thrown 20 touchdown passes and 19 interceptions, but
in the last seven games has thrown for 11 touchdowns with four
interceptions. He considers his improvement a reflection of
experience gained as a second-year starter.</TE>
<TE>   "The big key is decision-making," he said.</TE>

<HD>Western Pride Can Be Proud of This</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A terror in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia as a
3-year-old, Western Pride has now proven himself in California.</LD>
<LD>   After a battle through some brutal fractions with 8-1 shot
Orientate for most of the race, the son of Way West prevailed in the
end, winning the $214,200 San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes on
Saturday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Jim Chapman for his mother, Carolyn Chapman, and
Theresa McArthur, Western Pride won for the ninth time in 19 starts,
defeating Orientate by a length in 1:411/5 for the 11/16 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Although he doesn't deserve the term "great" his trainer used in
reference to him afterward, the Florida-bred certainly earned his win
Saturday under top weight of 122 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden for the first time by Garrett Gomez, who became the 10th
jockey to climb aboard the dark bay colt, Western Pride picked up his
seventh victory in 15 races on the dirt and stamped himself a strong
contender for the $400,000 Strub Stakes on Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never got any credit for what he has done," Chapman said.
"They'll know who he is now."</TE>
<TE>   If anybody had slighted Western Pride--and the fact he was the 9-2
third choice in a Grade II race indicated there wasn't a lack of
respect--it was because he had done most of his winning at places not
considered among the elite tracks in America, such as Mountaineer
Park, Thistledown and Calder.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth in the Hollywood Derby in his initial start in California
on Nov. 25, Western Pride was ready to ramble Saturday, even though
his trainer insisted the San Fernando was merely a prep for the
Strub, where he'll have a date with impressive Malibu Stakes winner
Mizzen Mast.</TE>
<TE>   "He was maybe 75%-80% ready," Chapman said. "His next race will be
his best race. Garrett rode him well and he kept going."</TE>
<TE>   After his first experience with the colt, who was purchased by
Chapman for $65,000 as a 2-year-old, Gomez is looking forward to
another collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim told me to let him run his own race, not to change anything,"
Gomez said. "I just let him do what he needed to do. When it came
time to running, he put his heart out there. He's a real game horse."</TE>
<TE>   Breaking from the outside in a field reduced to 10 after I Love
Silver was scratched due to a minor illness, Orientate either set or
pressed 221/5, 444/5, 1:084/5 and 1:342/5 fractions before weakening
ever so slightly near the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran great," jockey Chris McCarron said of the runner-up, who
is trained by Wayne Lukas for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. "I can't
believe he hung in there as well as he did after going that fast."</TE>
<TE>   Fancy As, the 4-1 third choice, finished third in his first race
in California. A winner of 13 of 15 in Canada, the gelding finished
three lengths behind Orientate and will return in the Strub for
trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment in the San Fernando was Momentum. The 11-10
favorite on the strength of his victory over Euchre in his main track
debut last month at Hollywood Park, the son of Nureyev was
well-placed down the backside by jockey Corey Nakatani, but had
nothing to give in the stretch. He wound up fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed a work with him and I don't think that helped things,"
trainer Craig Dollase said. "I thought they would come back off that
hot pace, but it never developed. I was really excited there for a
while.</TE>
<TE>   "But he got a race over the track and we'll get a mile and an
eighth in the Strub. We'll hope for the best next time."</TE>
<TE>   All Sir Bear needed was a return to Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-year-old gelding, who had lost six in a row and had finished
last in his most recent start on Oct. 27, rallied in the final
furlongs to edge even-money favorite Red Bullet in the $100,000 Skip
Away Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Barbara Smollin and trained by Ralph Ziadie, Sir Bear
earned his sixth victory in 13 starts at Gulfstream Park, winning by
a half-length under jockey Edgar Prado in 1:434/5 for the 11/16
miles.</TE>
<TE>   "For him to do that at his age, he's just a phenomenon, one of a
kind," Ziadie said. "He loves this track. He's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking only his second win since he surprised Fusaichi Pegasus in
the 2000 Preakness, Red Bullet had to settle for the runner-up spot.
He was a half-length better than Hal's Hope, the 5-1 second choice in
the prep for next month's Donn Handicap.</TE>

<LD>Given the recent history of the $150,000 San Gorgonio Handicap, it
seems safe to say that Tout Charmant, Old Money or Dancingonice will
win the 33rd running of the Grade II race.</LD>
<LD>   Tout Charmant and Old Money are trained by Ron Mc- Anally and
Dancingonice is trained by Bobby Frankel. The two hall of famers have
dominated the San Gorgonio since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   McAnally has won the race twice--Queens Court Queen (1995) and
Golden Arches (1997)--while Frankel has won four--Wandesta (1996),
Sixieme Sens (1997), See You Soon (1999) and Uncharted Haven (2001).
The only trainer not named McAnally or Frankel to have won the San
Gorgonio in the last seven years was the late Ed Gregson, who scored
with Lady At Peace in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The McAnally-trained entry of Tout Charmant and Old Money is the
2-1 favorite to win the 11/8-mile turf race against seven other
rivals, including Frankel's 3-1 third choice, the front-running
Dancingonice.</TE>
<TE>   One of the top female turf performers as a 4-year-old, Tout
Charmant was winless in three starts last year, but has trained well
for her 2002 debut and has been productive at nine furlongs. In eight
career starts at the distance, she has been in the money six times.</TE>
<TE>   An Australian-bred mare, Old Money will be making her debut in
this country and first start since Dec. 26, 2000. A first-time Lasix
user, she won five of 11 in her native land, including two Group II
victories and another in the Group I Western Australia Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Janet, the 5-2 second choice, had the best 2001 of any San
Gorgonio entrant. She won four times, and two of the victories were
in Grade Is.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fourth is a wide-open turf sprint. The fact
that the morning-line favorite is 4-1 suggests how good a betting
race this is.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Lytle Creek. The 5-year-old Gilded Time horse has won
four in a row and will go for another in today's eighth at Golden
Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Sid's Song. The 4-year-old Sultry Song colt is working
on a 10-race losing streak and looks to be in for more grief in
today's fifth at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three using Three Amigos, Seven
Jillion, Flick, Disguys Dalimit and Always Game in the fourth,
singling Tizmania in the fifth and using Prairie Predator, California
Power and Musaa Ed in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/39. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17.80/$257.20. Total money bet: $240.</TE>

<HD>Eagles Dump Dungy</HD>
<DH>NFC wild-card game: Embattled Tampa Bay coach might be
fired after lackluster 31-9 loss to Philadelphia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Tony Dungy performed gamely Saturday at Veterans Stadium, which is
more than can be said of his Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Dungy, who might
lose his job, didn't wilt under constant pressure. He appeared calm,
cool and collected. He did not flinch when asked repeatedly about his
future.</LD>
<LD>   If this was the best the Buccaneers could offer in an attempt to
save Dungy's job as their coach, then he is as good as gone, however.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers accomplished nothing of note in their NFC wild-card
game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Nothing, that is, except to
make the moderately skilled Eagles look invincible during a 31-9 rout
that propelled Philadelphia into next week's matchup against the
Chicago Bears.</LD>
<TE>   Tampa Bay is set to sack Dungy and replace him with Bill Parcells,
according to one report. And all because the Buccaneers can't seem to
do anything right against the Eagles in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eagles were a better team than we were," said Warren Sapp,
Tampa Bay defensive lineman. "We just did not make a lot of plays and
that was the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson seemed befuddled, sending four
passes into the waiting arms of the Eagles' secondary. Damon Moore
swiped two, returning one 59 yards for a touchdown with 2:08
remaining in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's inability to make plays probably sealed Dungy's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Above all else, Johnson was unable to get the ball into the hands
of big-play receiver Keyshawn Johnson. The Johnson-to-Johnson
connection clicked only three times, but each time it produced a big
play. Keyshawn Johnson averaged 25 yards per catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what is going to happen," Keyshawn Johnson said
when asked about Dungy. "He better get some guys who will play for
him, though. There were some guys out there today who just didn't
play."</TE>
<TE>   Of Parcells, he added, "I know that he will get guys to play for
him. There will also be some guys gone from here. But I don't want to
talk about that now. If [Parcells] is here, we'll fight and we'll
win."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers also couldn't run against the Eagles, gaining a
meager 63 yards. They also couldn't stop the run, giving up 148 yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the Eagles needed a big play, quarterback Donovan McNabb
provided one. He completed 16 of 25 passes for 194 yards and
touchdown passes of 16 yards to tight end Chad Lewis and 23 yards to
Duce Staley in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb also ran for 57 yards, including one 39-yard dash that set
up David Akers' 26-yard field goal that tied the score, 3-3, late in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay had no one capable of producing a big play, which meant
Dungy was forced to spend the bulk of his postgame session attempting
to respond to questions he could not answer.</TE>
<TE>   At least Dungy looked good behind the podium. He quickly
discounted the notion that his expected firing distracted the
Buccaneers, who accounted for their second lopsided playoff loss to
the Eagles in as many seasons. Last season, the Eagles drubbed Tampa
Bay, 21-3, in the NFC wild-card game.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a factor," Dungy said. "We had good practices. We were
ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   Asked point blank if he believed he had coached his final game at
Tampa Bay, Dungy said, "I don't think so, but I don't make those
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   A third question followed about his future and Dungy managed a
faint smile before saying, "We don't need a funeral around here. We
can talk about Philadelphia and the game. Speculation is not the
reason we're here."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the rumors swirling around Dungy were the only compelling
thing about this clunker.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles seized control in the second quarter, keeping the
Buccaneers out of the end zone and limiting them to three field goals
from Martin Gramatica. Tampa Bay got nothing in the second half
except another sorry chapter in their playoff history as the Eagles
turned the game into a rout after leading, 17-9, by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, Dungy had his defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all need to pat him on the back," Eagle Coach Andy
Reid said. "With the winning seasons and getting into the playoffs, I
just can't say enough about him."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, Philadelphia's tight end, prefaced his postgame remarks by
saying, "I think Tony Dungy is a heck of a coach and one of the best
guys in the NFL. If he gets fired, I think it's a sad day."</TE>

<LD>Perhaps the only intriguing matchup in a one-sided NFC wild-card
victory by the Philadelphia Eagles over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on
Saturday involved name-calling and eye-poking between Tampa Bay
defensive lineman Warren Sapp and Philadelphia's offensive line.</LD>
<LD>   Sapp's name was called infrequently by the public address
announcer, , which didn't pass without notice by John Welbourn,
Philadelphia's left guard. He wasn't surprised to hear that Sapp was
not credited with a solo tackle. Sapp did have five assists.</LD>
<LD>   "No, not at all," Welbourn said. "We did this to him last year [in
a 21-3 wild-card victory], so I don't know what's such a big surprise
for anybody."</LD>
<TE>   At one point, Sapp grew so frustrated with Welbourn that he tried
poking him in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when a guy with a big ego gets frustrated, he does stupid
things," Welbourn said.</TE>
<TE>   All the talk didn't bother Welbourn, who picked up a personal foul
for kicking Sapp while Eagle running back Duce Staley was running 23
yards for a first-half touchdown..</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that Welbourn spends his off-seasons in Clearwater,
Fla., a short drive from Sapp's home in Tampa. "I talked to him after
the game," Welbourn said. "I told him I lived down there and he said,
'Give me a call. We'll hang out.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay drove inside the Philadelphia 35-yard line five times
and came away with three field goals and had two passes intercepted .</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers' inability to produce even one big play in the red
zone killed their chances. "We had some stuff up the field and we hit
a couple," Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy said. "We did check the ball
down a lot and we thought we could make some plays running after the
catch. Obviously, the interceptions, that's something Brad [Johnson,
Tampa Bay quarterback] hasn't done all year."</TE>

<HD>Narbonne Shifts Into High Gear to Win, 74-25</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first 21/2 minutes, the Gardena High girls' basketball team
held its own against defending City Section, state and national
champion Harbor City Narbonne. After that, the Gauchos shifted to a
higher gear and cruised to an easy 74-25 Marine League victory
Saturday afternoon at Harbor College.</LD>
<LD>   Narbonne (12-3 overall, 2-0 in league) fell behind, 4-3, but
outscored the Panthers 39-7 for the rest of the first half, including
a 22-0 run to end the second quarter. The Gauchos were ranked No. 1
in the country at the start of the season, but three losses to
national powers have opponents believing Narbonne is vulnerable.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish we could've started the season right now because our
offense is really clicking," said Wilnett Crockett, a 6-3 senior
center for the Gauchos who has signed with Connecticut. "But in a way
it's good that we lost those games because if we were undefeated we'd
probably be very overconfident. Instead, we're motivated to prove
ourselves. As far as we're concerned, it's put up or shut up time
from now on."</LD>
<TE>   Crockett led all scorers with 15 points and had 12 rebounds. Indi
Johnson scored 14 and Jamie Funn added 13 for the Gauchos, who are
ranked No. 2 by The Times. Alexis Johnson and Miesha Parker each had
six points for Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   After winning two preseason tournaments and routing Wilmington
Banning, 79-28, in their league opener, the Panthers (15-2, 1-1)
appeared ready to challenge Narbonne's supremacy. Instead, they
reaffirmed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how confident we were but we were looking forward to
this game," Gardena Coach Ralph Lepore said. "Their size hurt us and
so did their full-court press. We didn't handle that well at all."</TE>
<TE>   Gardena had 29 turnovers and made only nine of 30 free throw
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining the Marine League in 1998, Narbonne has won 42
consecutive league games.</TE>

<HD>Transferring Lessons Learned the Hard Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when high school transfers are rising at an alarming rate,
and administrators, coaches and parents are bickering over who's to
blame, Perry Klein and David Wooley offer lessons from the past.</LD>
<LD>   They played during a time when transfers were largely restricted.
Gaining athletic eligibility after switching schools occurred only if
you moved, created a false address, obtained a special permit or lied
about who you were living with.</LD>
<LD>   Klein was known as "Mr. Transfer" when he went from Palisades to
Carson to Santa Monica in a 10-month period during the 1988-89 sports
seasons.</LD>
<TE>   He passed for nearly 4,000 yards as a junior quarterback at
Palisades in 1987, then moved into a two-bedroom apartment near
Carson High because he wanted to win a City championship and play for
his quarterback coach, Steve Clarkson.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived there by myself," he said. "You can imagine what I had to
deal with. It was pressure and stress that was really undue."</TE>
<TE>   Carson won the City title in 1988 and Klein got a scholarship to
California. In the spring, he returned to his parents' home in Malibu
and played volleyball for Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Klein, 30, said he doesn't regret trying to fulfill his high
school football aspirations by transferring but has second thoughts
about the way he went about it.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason it was easy for me to do was I didn't have loyalty to
a particular school," he said. "I was the one who initiated it.
People think parents are the ones pushing their kids to do these
things. When you get to a certain age, you make decisions yourself. I
didn't think of the other ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   His mother and father occasionally stayed with him at the rented
apartment, but mostly he was on his own as a 17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a lot of [criticism] for what I did," he said. "I was
pretty high profile.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was like, 'Whatever.' That reputation followed me
to college and always had a negative connotation."</TE>
<TE>   In college, Klein transferred from California to C.W. Post, an
NCAA Division II school in Brookville, N.Y., and was a fourth-round
draft choice of the Atlanta Falcons in 1994. He never made it in the
NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Now living in Pacific Palisades, he works for his father selling
computer chips and has a 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. His
wife, Cari, coached Los Angeles Marymount to the state Division IV
championship in girls' volleyball the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be long before he tries to decide what high school his
children should attend. He has no intention of letting them move from
school to school even if it's a lot easier to transfer today because
of open enrollment, a 1994 state law that gave students the right to
transfer without moving.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love my son to go to Palisades High, but if he's an
aspiring film maker, I'm going to try my best to get him to
Crossroads, but I'm going to do it early," he said. "I wouldn't want
my son to go through what I went through."</TE>
<TE>   He said he doesn't want his wife to suffer the same anguish some
of his coaches experienced.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want her to lose any kids," he said. "The worst part
is when a coach and player have a great relationship and the player
leaves to go to a school to be seen or be on a [top] team."</TE>
<TE>   Wooley was a youth basketball player living in Van Nuys in the
early 1980s, a time when Granada Hills Kennedy had one of the best
programs in the City Section because of Darren Daye and Stuart Gray.
Both of those players went on to play at UCLA and in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 13," Wooley said. "I wanted to go to Van Nuys, but Van Nuys
wasn't a basketball power."</TE>
<TE>   He decided to attend Kennedy by using someone else's address so he
could play with his club teammates who lived in the Kennedy district.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Kennedy was getting transfer students from Los Angeles
Verbum Dei, Detroit and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   A guard named Zach Lieberman was gaining attention, because he had
attended Van Nuys Montclair Prep and Woodland Hills Taft before
enrolling at Kennedy. Lieberman's father was accused of trying to
recruit players for the Golden Cougars.</TE>
<TE>   Wooley was briefly declared ineligible but eventually played for
Kennedy, never becoming a standout.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to find my way as a youth," he said. "It gave me a
sense of power in my life. That's what's troubling me now.</TE>
<TE>   "I see kids being guided and recruited. I'm coaching at the youth
level and have a 10-year-old who coaches already are asking, 'What is
he going to do for high school?' The kid is in the fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want him to go through what I went through. We got
treated like stars. It's not real life. After the game is over,
nobody cares."</TE>
<TE>   Wooley spends his free time coaching 9- and 10-year-olds for the
Guardian Hoop Club, a youth basketball travel team. He sees high
school players transferring for promises of college scholarships or
exposure and wonders if they are being deceived.</TE>
<TE>   "All the transferring can't do anything once the game starts," he
said. "Either you can play or you can't."</TE>

<HD>San Francisco Streets Get Cleaner, Some Say Meaner</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Critics say city's scouring of sidewalks is an
out-of-character, illegal crackdown on the homeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Mohammed Nuru cruises past the notorious downtown corner known as
"6th and Mayhem," on the lookout for behavior he says has no place on any
city street.</LD>
<LD>   Things like dealing drugs and smoking crack, shooting heroin and
tossing away the spent needle as though it were just some crumpled
hamburger wrapper. Or using the soiled and smelly back alleys as outdoor
restrooms.</LD>
<LD>   On his orders, three times a day workers in boots, goggles and
jumpsuits fan out over a 30-block area, rousting squatters and scouring
the pavement with high-pressure hoses and pine-scented disinfectant.</LD>
<TE>   "People have to take responsibility for their city," says Nuru, the
deputy director of public works and the point man on a controversial new
city project.</TE>
<TE>   To Nuru, Operation Scrub Down is redefining compassion in a city that
prides itself on commitment to the poor. To advocates for the homeless,
who have filed suit, it's an infringement of civil liberties and an
ominous sign of a new callousness toward the least fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Under Nuru's gaze, crews sweep through the blighted neighborhood
around 6th and Market streets. The area is dotted with raucous bars,
pawnshops, check-cashing joints and scores of squalid hotels, and also
serves as a commuter route to freeways connecting San Francisco with its
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Shadowed by police cruisers, the workers awaken men and women they
find dozing in doorways or slouched against walls. They confiscate
shopping carts laden with personal belongings and remove public benches
where the homeless and unemployed congregate.</TE>
<TE>   Shop owners volunteer as "block captains" who act as watchdogs, and
public works employees patrol certain areas--even make citizen's
arrests--like cops walking a beat.</TE>
<TE>   Nuru, 39, lived in Nigeria as a boy, and he applies lessons learned in
a remote African village to the grim American streetscape. "We may have
been poor, but we treated one another as family," he says. "And it's no
different here than back home: You can't let people sleep in the alley.
You've got to help them help themselves."</TE>
<TE>   His 3-month-old program, which costs $11,000 a day, has enlisted the
help of public health workers and even city lawyers, who battle lawsuits
filed by activists alleging that officials are trampling the rights of
the needy.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Terence Hallinan has established an office in the area to
hasten the filing of charges ranging from public urination to drug
dealing. Some of the dozen charges filed since the operation began have
resulted in jail time for wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   Nuru sees the effort as a national model for cities with troubled
urban cores. But advocates for the homeless have denounced it as
overzealous and illegal. They call the operation a blatant attempt to
wash away the nagging problem of urban homelessness.</TE>
<TE>Drug Use, Assaults Are Rampant at Night</TE>
<TE>   On one recent day, Nuru's caravan of trucks and police squad car
threads its way along Market Street, a daytime business drag that after
dark becomes the scene of arrests for drug use and assaults. In just a
few blocks, they spot half a dozen men dozing on the sidewalk. Nuru
springs from his blue sedan and approaches one man shrouded by a blanket.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, you can't sleep here," Nuru says. "You've got to get up."</TE>
<TE>   A man who identifies himself as George Watson, a 36-year-old Tennessee
native who says he has been homeless since his wife left him in 1996,
groggily brings himself to attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so tired, man," he says. "Can't I just get some sleep?"</TE>
<TE>   "Not here, you can't," Nuru says. "But you can in a shelter."</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting his gray woolen cap and unlaced red sneakers, Watson snarls
at Nuru.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you people harassing me?" he says. "I've slept here for six
years without any problems. There's no room in the shelters. So get off
my back."</TE>
<TE>   Nuru knows the complaint: Many homeless say the shelters are
crime-ridden, and they assert a legal right to sleep outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Coalition on Homelessness have sued the city on behalf
of street dwellers who they say have had their blankets, winter clothing
and even medication confiscated without notice.</TE>
<TE>   "The job of the Department of Public Works is to clean the streets,"
said John Viola, a staff lawyer for the public interest group. "That
doesn't mean sweeping away homeless people and towing away their
belongings."</TE>
<TE>   The program, activists say, signals a hardening of the attitude toward
the destitute in a city long known for its empathy toward the poor and
downtrodden.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has recently banned loitering near automated teller
machines and public toilets. And Supervisor Gavin Newsom last week
introduced a bill to curtail panhandling on freeway ramps and median
strips.</TE>
<TE>   "The streets of San Francisco are getting meaner," Viola said. "The
city's attitude toward the homeless gets worse every day."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom said the city is simply getting smarter: "We're maturing. And
redefining what compassion is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the city will spend $100 million this year on direct
services for the homeless, such as shelters and mental health
programs--double the amount of only eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days, Newsom says, when the city would allow the mentally
ill to endure miserable conditions on the streets just because lawyers
said the homeless had a legal right to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been giving people the means to suffer by allowing them access
to sidewalks, streets and doorways," he says. "That kind of thinking
lacks any compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Ammiano calls the mayor's program inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "He's looking for Band-Aids to solve a chronic social problem," he
says. "We're trampling the civil rights of needy citizens. I don't think
one hand of this administration knows what the other is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Ammiano says supervisors recently voted down a bill backed by civil
rights activists that would have given the homeless 24 hours' notice
before their possessions were taken by city workers.</TE>
<TE>   With a sweep of his hand, Nuru dismisses such critics.</TE>
<TE>   City workers don't just shoo away homeless residents, he says, but
also offer them information on drug rehabilitation and services.
Belongings are carted away only after repeated warnings, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But activists have fought the property confiscations in court, and won
several cases. The city recently paid a homeless man $1,000 for having
taken his leather jacket and other items.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Willie Brown sought Nuru for the cleanup job because of his
reputation as a motivator and an urban design guru. A large man with a
booming laugh, Nuru is approached on the street by thankful merchants who
want to join his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I'm not out here to break knuckles," he says. "We want to
offer people a respectful way to live, but drive home the message that
we're not going to tolerate certain behaviors."</TE>
<TE>'Adopt a Sidewalk' Started by Nuru</TE>
<TE>   Born in England, Nuru moved to rural Nigeria as a boy and later
immigrated to the United States to study landscape architecture and urban
planning. He came to California in 1990 after working as an architect at
a Washington design firm.</TE>
<TE>   For five years, he ran the San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners, a
nonprofit organization that cultivated several youth gardening and
job-training programs for disadvantaged neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that he began an "Adopt a Sidewalk" program, which put
welfare recipients to work maintaining city streets while they trained in
computer use and other skills.</TE>
<TE>   Brown brought Nuru aboard as deputy director of public works in 2000.
Last October, Nuru started Operation Scrub Down.</TE>
<TE>   He has become a hero to local merchants tired of enduring the stench
of San Francisco's alleys and the seamy 6th Street corridor. His office
has received numerous letters of praise, and one department store is
donating uniforms for his cleaning crews.</TE>
<TE>   "Mohammed has helped us raise the bar on the standard of behavior
here," says Ana Bolton-Arguello, manager of the Seneca Hotel. "And now we
have a chain of access to the city's huge bureaucracy. When things get
tough, we call Mohammed's people."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Ramirez, a director at an addiction treatment center in the area,
once had to cover his nose when walking the alley outside his office.</TE>
<TE>   "The odor was just unbearable," he says. "But now the city brings
those trucks and sprayers in. No way is this program overzealous. They're
just taking care of business."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent sweep, Nuru encounters a group of homeless men shaking
their fists at city workers, hurling insults as he and his crew keep
their distance while requesting that the men move on.</TE>
<TE>   Peeling away his jacket to expose a bottle of King Cobra malt liquor,
40-year-old James Moulden says he'll obey orders this time--because Nuru
is courteous and "treated me like a human being."</TE>
<TE>   "But I'll be back," he says. "These are our streets. Willie Brown is
just an elected official. He works for us."</TE>
<TE>   Nuru hops back in his car, vowing that he, too, will be back.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to walk down these streets and remember them because of
their beauty," he says, "not their squalor."</TE>

<KH>A CHANGED AMERICA</KH>
<HD>The Bottom Line: Forget Business as Usual</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Sept. 11 changed the way companies operate, in everything
from shipping goods to protecting employees.</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is the fifth in an occasional series
exploring the effect of the Sept. 11 attacks on various aspects of
American society.
</SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although he was 3,000 miles from ground zero on Sept. 11, Roland
Furtado has felt the effects keenly.</LD>
<LD>   As the owner of a Los Angeles airfreight service, Furtado makes his
living placing cargo in the bellies of passenger jets. Even before the
attacks, his business was off more than 20% for the year.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist strikes dealt the economy a further blow. For Furtado
and many others, they also altered the business landscape in fundamental
ways. In early October, for instance, the Federal Aviation Administration
dramatically tightened rules on airfreight. Among other restrictions,
freight forwarders were permitted to place a package on a passenger
flight only if the sender was a long-term customer or one whose premises
they had personally inspected.</LD>
<TE>   The requirement forced Furtado's small operation, Roland International
Freight Services, to turn away business by the crate load.</TE>
<TE>   "Lately, we've said no to so many shipments because we can't visit the
customer," said Furtado, an India-born U.S. citizen. "I had a young kid
from France who wanted to ship a stereo set, books and clothes to Europe.
I had his passport, his green card, his driver's license. But we couldn't
handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Furtado's plight is one of numerous echoes of Sept. 11 resounding
across the business world. Although the repercussions for some
high-profile industries have been widely publicized--airlines and cruise
lines threatened with bankruptcy, vacation resorts begging for
customers--the broader effects on U.S. industry run deeper and may last
longer.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting employees, buildings and data has become a paramount
concern and a significant expense. Importing goods and supplies from
overseas is more complex, more costly and more prone to delay.</TE>
<TE>   On the labor front, the attacks have raised unexpected questions:
Should fear of flying qualify as a disability protected by the Americans
With Disabilities Act? Are businesses violating federal law by opening
employee mail in search of anthrax spores?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important change is the increasing intrusiveness of
government in the relationship between some businesses and their
customers. This is particularly evident in financial services.</TE>
<TE>   Federal laws enacted within weeks of the attacks will require banks
and other financial institutions to secretly scrutinize more private
transactions and report to government agencies any activities that appear
even faintly unorthodox--often without informing their customers.</TE>
<TE>   Other industries may find the government less involved in their
affairs--to their regret. Textile and pharmaceutical makers that have
relied on the U.S. government's big stick to advance their interests
overseas will have to adjust to a new foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11, the U.S. is defining its friends and enemies less by
how closely their economic and trade systems resemble ours and more by
their eagerness to embrace America's anti-terrorism doctrine. Agencies
that promoted U.S. corporate interests abroad will be otherwise engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "The Treasury and Commerce departments will focus on monitoring and
surveillance of finance and trade with terrorist networks," Jeffrey E.
Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and a former Commerce
Department official, said shortly after the attacks. "It is hard to
believe that these and other agencies will have the time and energy to
pursue normal commercial goals."</TE>
<TE>   This shift in priorities was brought home to pharmaceutical companies
after October's anthrax scare. As cases of exposure proliferated, the
U.S. government threatened to break Bayer's patent on the anthrax remedy
Ciprofloxacin to ensure an adequate supply. This was a sharp departure
for Washington, which long had supported the U.S. drug industry in its
insistence that developing countries honor patents on AIDS drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Garten and others also say U.S. companies will have to be more
attentive to opposition to globalization in the underdeveloped world,
where it often is seen as a force oppressing unskilled laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "The love of American values and hate of American power are found
among the same people because most workers don't see American politics.
They see American companies," said S. Prakash Sethi, a business professor
at the City University of New York and chairman of an independent
committee that oversees working conditions at foreign plants for Mattel
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We give them a picture of American values, but what they see is an
almost total indifference to workers," he said. "The practices of foreign
multinationals in these countries where workers are really suffering make
them breeding grounds for future terrorists."</TE>
<TE>A Preoccupation With Security</TE>
<TE>   The computer tape vault operated by Atlanta-based Recall Corp. deep
within the San Fernando Valley is a fortress whose defenses are high-tech
and almost invisible. Cameras inconspicuously track all visitors to the
nondescript two-story building. Guards patrol 24 hours a day. A
fire-safety system using halon gas can extinguish a blaze without getting
a drop of water on any of the 500,000 data cassettes.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, Recall's sales staff has spent hours fielding
questions about this vault, the 16 others the company operates around the
country and Recall's ability to store and protect data for its clients.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being asked to do more simulations," said Victor Mendes,
Recall's chief executive. "There's more interest by potential clients in
coming to the facilities to check security. We're getting inquiries from
customers about whether we can process their mail."</TE>
<TE>   American business executives have become preoccupied with security in
all its forms, from the uniformed sentries in their building lobbies to
the creation of "hot sites," backup facilities with computers, phones and
stored data where relocated personnel could carry on after a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Economists are hard-pressed to quantify the cost to the U.S. economy.
Some have estimated that spending on guards, padlocks and security
systems, along with shipping delays caused by tighter inspections at
ports and border crossings, will pare as much as 1 percentage point, or
$110 billion, from the annual U.S. gross domestic product. (That's
roughly equal to the annual net earnings of the 10 most profitable
corporations in America.)</TE>
<TE>   Not all security expenditures are a drain on the economy. Hotels and
resorts are laying off housekeepers, but security companies are staffing
up. And manufacturers' buildup of larger inventories of parts as a
cushion against shipping bottlenecks means bigger orders--at least
temporarily--for the factories that make those parts.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, economists believe that security spending will
inhibit growth. That's because tighter security does not make businesses
more efficient or their products more desirable.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the lengths to which companies have gone to ensure that
imported parts and supplies reach their destinations on time.</TE>
<TE>   During the nationwide grounding of air travel in the days after Sept.
11, Delphi Automotive Systems, the world's No. 1 auto components maker,
arranged backup routes for air cargo shipments from a plant in
Singapore--preparing to send the freight through Luxembourg to Alabama,
or through Anchorage to Los Angeles, depending on which route reopened
first.</TE>
<TE>   Once flights resumed, Delphi employees were mobilized to carry
critical parts, such as air-bag sensors and the silicon wafers needed to
make them, aboard international flights as personal luggage.</TE>
<TE>   The automotive industry is especially vulnerable to shipping delays.
Auto factories depend heavily on cross-border traffic between Detroit and
supply plants in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "The auto companies have gone to all-night traffic," said David
Littmann, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Detroit. "It's more
expensive, but it's what they did to alleviate three- or four-hour
tie-ups. They had pickups [in Canada] during the wee hours of the morning
so that transports could go over the bridge or through the tunnel before
traffic built up in the early morning."</TE>
<TE>Greater Oversight of Transactions</TE>
<TE>   When Congress turned its attention to combating terrorism, the
spotlight fell first on the business of money.</TE>
<TE>   Of the scant traces the 19 hijackers had left of their pre-attack
wanderings, most were financial records: international wire transfers,
checking accounts, cash-machine withdrawals and other mundane
transactions. That helped investigators, but it also whetted the appetite
of regulators and legislators in Washington for greater oversight of
private financial transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Among the leading provisions of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the first
major anti-terrorism bill to become law, are several that could open
traditionally confidential financial transactions to government scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks have been deputized to be spies on their customers," said Bert
Ely, a Washington-based banking consultant. This trend, he said, will
undermine the role of banks "as a trusted third party to hold private
financial information."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriot Act was enacted with little public debate, during a period
when few people or institutions dared question the motives or methods of
the anti-terror campaign. Its financial provisions, borrowed from
previous bills aimed at curbing money laundering by organized crime and
drug traffickers, include some that the financial services industry
previously had blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Many in law enforcement say the rules will help track suspect
financial transactions wherever they lead--to drug runners laundering
money or to terrorists accumulating war chests.</TE>
<TE>   But some financial experts are not so sure. Even as they maintained a
patriotic silence, bankers and other financial executives say they harbor
doubts that the new measures will be as effective as their proponents
claim.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is you don't pass a bill like this in five weeks. I think
there will be unintended consequences that will be very worrisome," said
Kathleen Quenneville, general counsel for Mechanics Bank, a regional bank
in Richmond, Calif., and a member of an American Bankers Assn. committee
on federal regulatory issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriot Act expands rules on money laundering beyond banks to
securities brokerages, insurance companies, even auto dealerships and
travel agencies that handle large cash transactions. It grants the
Treasury Department great latitude to draft regulations implementing the
law, a process that will take up to a year.</TE>
<TE>   The rules are expected to require stringent monitoring of accounts
held by foreign or affluent customers and higher standards of
identification for almost all banking clients. In some cases, the law
will require banks to ascertain not only their customers' identities but
also the source of their funds and how much money they expect to deposit
or maintain in new accounts. Any departure from such expectations might
rank as a "suspicious" event warranting secret notification of a
government agency.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators may not stop there. They may require that new accounts be
opened in person, a change that could cut deeply into the business of
online brokerages and insurance agencies that sign up clients over the
Internet and handle transactions potentially worth millions of dollars
without face-to-face contact with customers.</TE>
<TE>   Quenneville and others say they fear that any regulations that
increase banks' or brokerages' inquisitiveness will undermine their
relationship with customers.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone comes in to deposit a large check, I don't think they
want to explain to their banker how they're doing," she said. "There will
be a real sea change in how people view their bank."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, "it seems un-American to criticize this at all."</TE>
<TE>   New reporting requirements will add to an already overwhelming cascade
of paperwork. Financial institutions file 13 million Currency Transaction
Reports each year to the Treasury or Internal Revenue Service. The
reports document any cash transaction of $10,000 or more. Much more
subjective are the Suspicious Activity Reports filed when a transaction
appears to violate any of 25 specific financial crimes--such as money
laundering, check fraud or embezzlement--or looks otherwise shady.</TE>
<TE>   In part because financial institutions cannot be sued for filing the
reports, more than 180,000 were submitted this year--nearly four times as
many as in 1996, when they were introduced. Experts say banks and other
institutions, nervous about their potential liability for failing to flag
a transaction linked later to a terrorist act, will report any unusual
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire financial community is already filing a tremendous number
of reports," said Tom Heider, head of government affairs for Travelers
Express/MoneyGram, a leading money transmission service. "One has to
wonder if even the most sophisticated computer systems we have can look
at all that data and come up with useful information."</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics point to the transactions conducted by the Sept. 11
hijackers. Many were so routine that some industry observers say they
might not have raised red flags even under tougher reporting rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The popular myth is that this will allow [the government] to identify
terrorist activities," said James Rockett, a San Francisco bank lawyer.
"I think that belief is misplaced. The more likely impact on banks is
that they're not going to be able to identify terrorists any better, but
they're going to be held accountable."</TE>
<TE>Smoothing the Flow of Cargo and Vehicles</TE>
<TE>   In a white van at a Los Angeles port freight depot, Senior U.S.
Customs Inspectors Owen Teruya and Fred Henke subjected a container of
export oranges to radiological scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   As the van rolled forward at a steady speed of 3 to 4 mph along the
40-foot length of the container, a low-power gamma-ray unit mounted on
the van's extensible arm displayed a shadowy black-and-white computer
image of the container's interior.</TE>
<TE>   With the sweep of a computer mouse, Teruya and Henke peeled away layer
after layer of the image, looking for any indication that something other
than oranges was in the consignment. Finding only genuine California
produce, Teruya and Henke sent the container on to a ship bound for
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Few industries will be as heavily affected by Sept. 11 as
international shipping. Although the hours-long lines at Customs posts on
the Mexican and Canadian borders in the first weeks after the attacks
have abated, industry observers express doubt that procedures at the
crossings will ever return to normal.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new paradigm at the border," said Stephen Gross, president
of Border Trade Services in San Diego and president of the Border Trade
Alliance, an advocacy group for import-export service companies. "We're
told this is not a situation that's going to pass."</TE>
<TE>   Some in the shipping business say they hope Sept. 11 will spur a
recognition of the need to move cargo and vehicles in and around the port
faster and more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   Import entries have increased by half since 1995, to more than 20
billion trucks and containers a year, according to the General Accounting
Office, while the number of Customs employees has remained at 19,000. A
computerized system meant to identify and to track risky shipments is
several years behind schedule and far over budget, the GAO has reported.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened security imposed after the attacks has challenged the
system even more. Customs authorities have been operating at "Code Red,"
their highest state of alert. Not only has that meant more inspections,
but it also has forced Customs to shift its traditional emphasis from
contraband drugs and counterfeit merchandise to the search for weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the recognitions post-9/11 is that we need a better handle on
what is in the container, where it comes from and who loaded it," said M.
John Vickerman, a consultant on port design who worked on the long-range
master plan for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. "There are
technologies, particularly information technologies, that will empower
North American ports. We'll be installing them for security purposes, but
eventually they'll be used for efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Shipping professionals say Customs, the Coast Guard and other agencies
have managed to tighten security without significantly slowing the flow
of goods. But just as financial services firms wait uneasily for
Treasury's new regulations, shipping and transport companies are waiting
for Congress' next move.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed regulations run the gamut, from a plan by Rep. Duncan Hunter
(R-Alpine) to inspect every truck and container entering the U.S. to one
by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) to cooperate with foreign port operators
to ensure the security of U.S.-bound containers.</TE>
<TE>   But they all have the potential to disrupt the delicate balance among
shippers, importers, brokers and authorities that enables ports such as
Los Angeles to handle a huge volume of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-five percent of what we eat, drive with and consume comes to
us by vessel," Vickerman said. "If we tamper with it, we'll affect our
quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   On average, Customs inspects about 2% of all trucks and containers
entering the U.S.--400 million inspections a year. Customs officials
target shipments for examination based on an analysis of the country of
origin, the container's itinerary, the ship that carried it and other
factors.</TE>
<TE>   Doubling or tripling inspections could create chaos at the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach, the country's busiest ports complex.</TE>
<TE>   "It's overwhelming to think about examining 100%," said John Peterson,
Los Angeles branch manager for C.H. Powell Co., a leading nationwide
freight forwarder. "You'd need a freight depot the size of the L.A.

<HD>Colombia Leader Rejects Rebels' Peace Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS POZOS, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>President Andres Pastrana rejected a last-ditch proposal to save
Colombia's shattered peace process late Saturday, thrusting the country
to the brink of an all-out civil war.</LD>
<LD>   Pastrana's decision means that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, have been given 48 hours, ending Monday, to leave the
zone that they have made their de facto headquarters for the last three
years.</LD>
<LD>   Pastrana told a nationwide broadcast audience that the rebels' final
statement contained no new concrete proposal to restart the peace
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   "For the national government, it is not satisfactory," Pastrana said.
"What the country and the president were expecting was a clear and direct
response."</TE>
<TE>   The president was responding to a 14-point FARC proposal produced
after two days of meetings with a U.N. negotiator that ended with a
10-hour session Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel leaders could not be reached for comment. But earlier in the
day, they said the peace process was in the hands of the president.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here waiting for the president's decision with respect to the
future of the process of dialogue and negotiation," Joaquin Gomez, a FARC
negotiator, said before Pastrana's broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   James LeMoyne, the U.N. negotiator, characterized the talks as
"'difficult."</TE>
<TE>   "This effort was not easy. It's still not easy. But I still have
hope," said LeMoyne, who looked exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   Though the fighting has continued during the peace talks, the end of
the zone could mean a violent new surge in a nearly 40-year conflict that
already costs 3,500 lives a year.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana appeared to leave a small sliver of hope that peace talks
could resume if the guerrillas took concrete action to advance the
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Colombians want effective results," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The army and the rebels have used the three years of talks to build up
their forces. The FARC rebels are estimated to earn up to $500 million a
year from taxing cocaine production and kidnapping. Their army, now the
largest in Latin America, has an estimated 17,000 combatants, more than
double from a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian army has increased the number of professional soldiers
and bought millions of dollars of new equipment, including dozens of
Black Hawk helicopters to transport rapid-strike forces across the
nation's vast jungles.</TE>
<TE>   Violent right-wing paramilitary groups have begun moving into nearby
towns, killing citizens and public figures, and would probably rush into
the zone if it were dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the recent rupture in the peace process lie in new
restrictions that Pastrana imposed over a demilitarized zone in
Colombia's southern jungles that was created three years ago and ceded to
the rebels to start the process.</TE>
<TE>   Accusing the FARC of using the zone to train soldiers, imprison
kidnapping victims and launch military operations, Pastrana in October
stepped up military patrols and increased air force surveillance flights.</TE>
<TE>   FARC officials froze talks and demanded that Pastrana revise the
restrictions to guarantee the rebels' safety. But Pastrana said the
restrictions were nonnegotiable and broke off talks.</TE>
<TE>   He initially gave the rebels 48 hours to leave the zone, then acceded
to a U.N. request for two more days of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne flew into the zone Friday, spending the night with the rebels.
The two parties reportedly exchanged bottles of aged whiskey in a show of
friendship. The rebels brought out portable lights to continue meeting
after dark.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, as parrots flew overhead and a horde of media
representatives crowded against a chain-link fence to watch, the men
huddled in conversation. LeMoyne frequently emerged to consult with
Pastrana by phone. Finally, just after 9:30 p.m., LeMoyne and the rebels
emerged with the draft document in hand.</TE>
<TE>   In the document, the rebels promised to immediately discuss some of
the most controversial points of the peace process, such as a cease-fire,
an end to kidnapping and concrete government action against right-wing
paramilitary groups. Previously, they had insisted on waiting until later
this year to address those points.</TE>
<TE>   They also promised to activate two previously created commissions to
review complaints of any acts that might create barriers to the peace
process. The first would handle complaints within the zone, and the
second would handle complaints about the ability of foreigners to enter
the zone.</TE>
<TE>   These were seen as parallel tracks to the peace process, in which the
FARC would be able to raise specific concerns, for instance, about the
air patrols or paramilitary incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Though the document contained few new proposals, there was no specific
mention of the FARC's concerns about the security restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   One FARC official was careful to note, however, that the document was
a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only a draft, it's only a draft," said Andres Paris, a FARC
negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne said the guerrillas' draft represented a sincere effort to
work toward peace. "The draft reflects what the FARC were able to do," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the military continued its massive buildup around the zone,
about 200 miles south of Bogota, the capital. Tanks and troop transport
trucks streamed southward from a major army base east of Bogota.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora, the tough-talking leader of Colombian's army,
said plans were in place to retake the zone, a Switzerland-sized area of
rolling hills and rushing rivers that is populated by about 90,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready. We have a plan that we are executing," Mora said.</TE>
<TE>   In the five villages of the zone, residents wondered about the future.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic church on the main square in San Vicente del Caguan, the
biggest town in the zone, was overflowing with worshipers at a hastily
called Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Men, women and children crowded into the soaring chapel, many of them
waving white paper flags with the single word: "Peace."</TE>
<TE>   Father Miguel Angel Serna said he hoped that the gathering could sway
the negotiators to arrive at a settlement. And he issued a veiled warning
that the guerrillas needed to make some concessions to save the country
from a violent future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the moment for acts of peace, for a cease-fire, for an end to
extortions, for an end to kidnapping," he said.</TE>

<DL>ISHPONI BABA, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Ayub slowed as he approached the random checkpoint, manned, as it
were, by a boy with an AK-47 slung across his chest. The instant the
young guard lowered his hands from his gun, convinced that the car was
stopping, Ayub stomped on the accelerator.</LD>
<LD>   The feint earned the station wagon a precious second or two. The guard
whirled as the car sped past, unslinging his weapon. But he was perhaps
100 yards back and fading quickly into the distance by the time he had
nestled the rifle into his shoulder and taken aim. He didn't fire.</LD>
<LD>   "Ah, ha, ha!" called Omar Nassih, a translator in the front passenger
seat, slapping Ayub on the back. "He probably wouldn't have shot anyway.
He might get in trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Such incidents are hardly unusual now in many parts of Afghanistan.
The day before, two shots rang out as the same car drove through the
Shomali plain, three hours to the northwest. The day after, just up the
road from here, it was three shots, with an armed guard in the car
answering with a burst of his own.</TE>
<TE>   As Afghanistan's interim government tries desperately to move this
demolished country into the category of somewhat functional Third World
nation, one problem looms, perhaps above the myriad others: rampant
lawlessness.</TE>
<TE>   The outside world is trying to help bring some measure of stability to
the country. The United States, or "the Big Boss," as many here call it,
continues to bomb suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban hide-outs almost nightly
in the south and east of the country in an attempt to root out
terrorists. International peacekeepers are beginning to patrol the
capital, Kabul. Aid agencies are flying and trucking humanitarian
supplies as quickly as possible into a country where the United Nations
operates on its highest threat level.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such efforts, this is a land so perilous it can boggle the
mind of anyone who has lived in peace. Afghans say that, since the fall
of the Taliban, murder, bribery, kidnapping, extortion--crimes committed
primarily by soldiers working for one warlord or another, most
believe--have only grown worse.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders here and abroad are beginning to ask the question: How can a
nation be rebuilt when moving about it sometimes means courting death?</TE>
<TE>   "Security is the most important thing in any crisis in any nation,"
said one Western diplomat in Kabul. "If a country is secure, people will
stay, refugees will return, food will come, things will improve. More
than drought or famine or anything else, insecurity is the most
destabilizing force."</TE>
<TE>   Here in Ishponi Baba, insecurity is almost all there is.</TE>
<TE>   Forty miles east of Kabul, the village--if 15 men with a lot of
weapons, a one-room hut and a bag of onions can be called a village--is
perched 50 feet above one of the most dangerous roads in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Kabul-Jalalabad road has been a home for mayhem since it was only
a donkey trail between the capital and the eastern city. For perhaps
hundreds of years, several different tribes have claimed various parts of
the route and fought over it almost constantly.</TE>
<TE>   The geography of the area also makes the route a bandit's paradise.
The road, mostly dirt and gravel, is so rutted that vehicles can often
travel no more than 5 or 10 mph. Heading east from Kabul, the sheer
Mahipar mountains on the left are a stone barrier to escape and a
hide-out for brigands. On the right is another nearly vertical drop, down
to the Kabul and then Panjshir rivers.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody who loves his life cannot live here," said Gul Agha, one of
the soldiers here.</TE>
<TE>   The same is increasingly true for those who simply want to pass
through. Four international journalists were stoned and shot to death in
November just up the road, near Sarobi. A taxi driver, who was last seen
picking up a group of Northern Alliance soldiers in Kabul, was found dead
recently with four bullet wounds in his chest. His car is missing.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling British aid workers were stopped last month, robbed and
relieved of their vehicle. They were the only recent robbery victims, as
far as anyone can recall, who were not killed.</TE>
<TE>   Here, as in many parts of this mostly rural country, robberies that
don't lead to murder seem increasingly rare, with highwaymen apparently
finding it safer to eliminate witnesses then and there.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of the Taliban, everyone is convinced that the murder
rate has risen, although no one has the slightest idea of any statistics.
Though brutal and repressive, the Taliban did create a society of very
little violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that early optimism in the new government's ability
to keep order has waned considerably in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the growing sense of fear is the unpredictability of the
violence; one day a road is clear and safe, the next it's a gantlet of
unofficial checkpoints, where the guards may want $100 for passage, or
wheat bound for refugees, or your truck and in turn your life.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you will go to Kabul safely," said Rahmatullah, a tall, shy
soldier stationed at Mahipar Dam, a few miles up the canyon. "Maybe your
pockets will be robbed. Maybe you will be killed."</TE>
<TE>   The men here in Ishponi Baba are all ethnic Pushtuns, as were the vast
majority of the Taliban. They say they weren't Taliban, though everyone
else up and down the road says they were. Those who say the men of
Ishponi Baba were Taliban are themselves ethnic Pushtun soldiers, and
likewise are identified as former Taliban by virtually everyone at every
other post.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of former allegiances, almost every man living or working
along this road is a soldier, and in the service of a warlord, not
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Those here say they have not been paid for months. They have water,
but only the onions to eat. Most can't read, and those who can have no
books. They have no radio. They have nothing to do but climb around in
the rocks with their Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenade launchers
and watch the road below.</TE>
<TE>   "Our area is safe, but don't go any further," said the commander,
Ghuncha Gul. "Back that way where you came from is also maybe not safe."</TE>
<TE>   This is a refrain heard all along the route. The soldiers at the
previous outpost said the same thing, as did the ones farther up the
road.</TE>
<TE>   They may all be telling an odd truth. It is commonly believed that
bandits, whoever they are, strike travelers in another group's territory,
then rush back to their own. The safest place in this canyon may be at
the home base of a pirate.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if the men at Ishponi Baba and other outposts on the road
were bandits as well as soldiers, Atiqullah, a guard at the checkpoint at
the western entrance to the canyon, demurred. "Allah knows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without the national army that interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai
hopes to build, there is no way to close the pass and clear the armed men
out. Doing so would hardly address the problem, anyway, because this
route is not unique.</TE>
<TE>   Although a handful of regions is considered relatively safe--mostly in
the northeast and southwest--many more are deemed the opposite by
international relief and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations is operating in Afghanistan under rules known as
"Phase 5," meaning no workers are allowed to travel alone, or at night.
They cannot go anywhere without a two-way radio, or anywhere out of radio
range. In Kabul, U.N. workers must be in their homes by 9 p.m., an hour
before the official government curfew. In Kandahar, the former Taliban
stronghold, workers have been ordered to stay in their homes and not go
to work for more than two weeks now.</TE>
<TE>   The British-led International Security Assistance Force has begun
patrolling in and around Kabul during the past few days, with 1,500
international troops on the ground and 3,000 more expected to arrive over
the next several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   During negotiations in December near Bonn over the peacekeeping
mission, Interior Minister Younis Qanooni fought effectively to limit the
number of international soldiers and to restrict their operations to the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   After several kidnappings and killings in Kabul in recent days,
apparently for money, and amid a growing sense of instability in a city
that just a week ago appeared to be the one relatively stable urban
center in the country, Karzai and Qanooni have begun to suggest publicly
that they may ask for more troops--both for Kabul and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The kind of peacekeeping Afghanistan needs, however, may be enormous.</TE>
<TE>   "If you really want to stabilize Afghanistan, you're looking at
estimates ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 troops," said a U.S. diplomat in
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   At Ishponi Baba, Ghuncha Gul, the commander, had no hopeful words for
those expecting change in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He adjusted the wool hat on his head, pulled at his beard and pointed
down at the Kabul-Jalalabad road.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more problems now than before," he told his visitors.
"Robberies happen all the time, and if they can kill the people, they do
that. We don't care about our lives here. People who care about their
lives should go. The sun is going down."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Pledges to Curb Militants</HD>
<DH>South Asia: In address to nation, Musharraf bans five groups but
says he will continue to support Kashmiris in dispute with India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf vowed Saturday that Pakistan will
dismantle the structure of extremism in mosques and religious schools
that he said has bred violence and perverted Islam in this country. He
also banned five militant organizations, saying Pakistanis are tired of a
"Kalashnikov culture."</LD>
<LD>   In a 70-minute address to the nation, the four-star general did not
make any major concessions on the disputed Himalayan territory of
Kashmir, where India and Pakistan are facing each other in a tense
standoff, but he said the threat of war could be ended by dialogue. He
pledged that he will not allow Pakistani soil to be used for terrorism
aimed at India or anywhere else.</LD>
<LD>   Then, switching from Urdu, the national language, to English,
Musharraf said: "To the United States I say, as I have said before,
Pakistan rejects terrorism in all its forms. You must play an active
role" in bringing New Delhi and Islamabad to the negotiating table.</LD>
<TE>   The two countries have already fought two wars over Kashmir, and the
military buildup underway there is the biggest in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released in Washington, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell praised Musharraf's "bold and principled stand" and particularly
"his pledge that Pakistan will not tolerate terrorism under any pretext,
including Kashmir."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who is scheduled to visit India and Pakistan this week, called
Musharraf's assertion that the two countries could still resolve their
differences through dialogue "encouraging" and added: "This speech
reconfirms Pakistan's role as a front-line state in the war against
global terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Not every listener was so impressed, however.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of hype that this was to be a groundbreaking speech,
especially with regard to India," said Iffat Malik, a political columnist
with the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. "It wasn't. Most of what he said, he
has said before. It was reiterating his existing policies."</TE>
<TE>   India's government deferred its public response to a news conference
scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   Although the speech may have reiterated existing policy, few leaders
in the Islamic world have been as publicly critical of religious
extremists as Musharraf was Saturday. Extremists "have destroyed our
international image," he said. "We are projected as an ignorant and
backward nation. Our economy has been hurt. Export orders have been
canceled. Factories have closed, and workers have lost their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   All Islam has suffered because of extremism, he said, paraphrasing a
speech he gave last June: "The ulema [religious scholars] say Islam is
tolerant. And how does the world judge our claim? It looks on us as
terrorist. We are killing each other, and we want to spread violence and
terror abroad. Naturally, the world regards us as terrorist. Our claim of
tolerance is phony."</TE>
<TE>'Kashmir Runs in Our Blood'</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf again condemned attacks from Kashmir on India--calling those
involved terrorists--but he said Pakistan will go to war if its
sovereignty is violated.</TE>
<TE>   "Kashmir runs in our blood," he said, promising to continue moral and
political support for Kashmiris in the divided region.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian buildup in Kashmir started after five gunmen, believed to
be Pakistani-supported Kashmiris, attacked the Parliament in New Delhi on
Dec. 13, killing nine people before being killed. Musharraf began a
crackdown on militants in August, but India maintains that he has not
gone far enough and that Pakistan continues to support terrorist training
camps in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, 58, a former commando who came to power in a bloodless 1999
coup, delivered the speech that the government said he wrote himself with
a portrait of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founding father, over his
right shoulder. Jinnah was a secular Muslim who preached the tolerance
and compassion of Islam, and Musharraf gave every indication of intending
to return to that spirit by wresting power from religious zealots and
silencing the inflammatory rhetoric that flows from many mosques.</TE>
<TE>   The president said that mosques that have been used for nonreligious
purposes will be closed and that no new mosque will be allowed to open
without a government permit. The political messages that have blared
forth on loudspeakers from many mosques will be banned.</TE>
<TE>   Religious schools, he said, will be reformed and no longer permitted
to teach only religion. Mathematics, science, history and English will be
added to their curricula, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, he banned five groups involved with sectarian violence,
including two of the most notorious, Sipah-e-Sahaba and Tehrik-e-Jafria.
More than 250 of their leaders and supporters were detained before his
speech during raids on mosques and religious schools in the port city of
Karachi and southern towns.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups India accuses of being behind the Parliament attack,
Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, were also banned, as was
Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi, a group operating in northwestern
Pakistan that reportedly sent thousands of followers to Afghanistan in
October to fight alongside the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his ministers
have repeatedly said they will judge Musharraf by his actions, not his
words.</TE>
<TE>   Previous Pakistani leaders have promised to crack down on terrorism,
but terrorist attacks have escalated recently not only in Kashmir but
also elsewhere in India. New Delhi claims that Pakistan's military spy
agency, known as Inter-Services Intelligence, secretly arms and trains
the terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   By banning the Kashmiri separatist Jaish-e-Mohammed and
Lashkar-e-Taiba--the Indian military considers the latter especially
dangerous--Musharraf took a major step toward meeting India's demands for
an end to what it calls cross-border terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But Kashmiri separatist militias based in Pakistan have splintered and
changed their names before, and India insists that the leaders must be
put on trial and imprisoned as one step toward ensuring that the groups
are not allowed to re-form.</TE>
<TE>   India's top spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, has identified
what it says are at least 17 training camps in the one-third of Kashmir
under Pakistani control and in Pakistan proper. As New Delhi checks
Musharraf's rhetoric against reality, it will want to see those camps
closed--and not replaced by new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has detained hundreds of suspected terrorists, including the
leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. But so far, Pakistani
police have accused the leaders only of making inflammatory speeches, not
of terrorism, Indian officials complain.</TE>
<TE>   And although he insisted that "terrorism has no place in the Kashmir
cause," Musharraf said nothing about at least two other Kashmiri
separatist groups that India considers terrorists. One based in Pakistan,
the Harkat Moujahedeen, was named on the State Department's list of
"designated foreign terrorist organizations" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>Group's Leader Signed '98 Fatwa Against West</TE>
<TE>   The group's former leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, co-signed a fatwa, or
religious edict, that Osama bin Laden issued in February 1998 "calling
for attacks on U.S. and Western interests," the State Department report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is linked to another Kashmiri group, Al Faran, that
kidnapped six Western tourists in July 1995, the State Department report
added. Five were killed; one escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a senior Indian intelligence source said in an interview
that Harkat Moujahedeen trains its cadres in at least seven of the 17
alleged training camps in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   A second, much larger Kashmiri separatist group, the
Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, also apparently escaped Musharraf's ban.</TE>
<TE>   Syed Salahuddin, also known as Yousuf Shah, is the leader of the
Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen and one of 20 men whom New Delhi has demanded that
Pakistan extradite for trial. That is one of the main conditions
Vajpayee's government wants met before it will agree to discuss pulling
back any troops in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   India has accused Salahuddin of carrying out several terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf insisted that he will never hand over any Pakistani citizens
for trial in India, but he left the door open to discussing the
extradition of Indian citizens.</TE>
<TE>   At a briefing for reporters Friday, a senior Indian government
official said that 14 of the 20 men on New Delhi's list are Indian
nationals but that some are believed to have acquired Pakistani
citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Indian intelligence source said it would be a significant
victory if Musharraf sent Dawood Ibrahim, the alleged mastermind of a
string of bombings in Bombay, back to India. The terrorist attacks on
March 12, 1993, killed 257 people and wounded 713.</TE>
<TE>   Dawood is a potential gold mine of intelligence information on
Pakistani military intelligence's support for terrorism and has strong
links to Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, the intelligence source charged.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their demand that Pakistan eradicate terrorism, some
high-ranking Indian officials acknowledge privately that Musharraf is in
a dangerous position.</TE>
<TE>   India's government is "extremely mindful that rogue elements may well
wish to destabilize the situation" by secretly continuing the Pakistani
military spy agency's support for terrorists, a senior Indian government
official told reporters Friday.</TE>

<HD>White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted</HD>
<DH>That no warnings were issued as Enron collapsed raises the specter
of special treatment, critics charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though they mounted no formal effort to bail out Enron Corp.,
Bush administration officials are coming under fire for not publicly
disclosing the extent of the company's troubles when they became aware of
them.</LD>
<LD>   Some legal experts contend the administration was in a position to
sound a warning to the public or the Securities and Exchange Commission
after a series of phone calls from Enron executives to Treasury
Department officials last fall. The fact that they didn't, while Enron's
financial situation grew darker and its stock price declined steadily,
raises the specter of special treatment for a powerful corporation,
congressional critics say.</LD>
<LD>   But the Bush administration, despite close ties to Enron, did not help
the firm stave off bankruptcy as the federal government had done for
failing enterprises such as Long-Term Capital Management, Chrysler Corp.
and Lockheed Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Enron was different. Many experts on government-business relations say
the company's relationship with the Bush administration made aiding it a
potential political embarrassment. But others say the administration
decided not to help the company because its failure did not threaten
widespread damage to financial or energy markets and the economy as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the fact that Enron's failing condition went on without public
disclosure for so long--even as high government officials were apprised
of it--puzzled legal experts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if they [Treasury officials] didn't call the SEC,"
said attorney John Hanson, a specialist in bankruptcy cases for the law
firm Nossaman Guthner Knox Elliot LLP, which has offices in four
California cities, including Irvine and Los Angeles, and in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In October and early November, Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whalley
made a series of six to eight calls in which he asked Peter Fisher,
Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, to help secure loans from
the company's bankers. Fisher refused, and on Nov. 8 Enron Chairman and
Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill to tell him of Enron's dire financial situation.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, Enron filed documents with the SEC revising its
financial statements back to 1997, evaporating $600 million in
nonexistent profits and accelerating its stock plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Although the administration's accounts of what happened are
incomplete, it appears that neither Fisher nor O'Neill asked the SEC to
demand that Lay tell stakeholders and investors about the firm's
deteriorating condition, observers note. "I cannot comprehend why they
did not inform [SEC Chairman Harvey] Pitt," said a onetime lawyer for the
federal government who asked for anonymity because he still does business
with the government.</TE>
<TE>   "My counsel would have been to call Lay back and request him to do
full disclosure," said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1998 case of Long-Term Capital Management, a foundering
investment firm kept out of bankruptcy by a government-assisted infusion
of capital, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan communicated
constantly with then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and with the Treasury
Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) charged last week that Bush
administration officials had "done nothing to mitigate the harm of the
Enron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and shareholders." In
response, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Enron officials
had not provided the Treasury officials with any information that was not
already in the general news.</TE>
<TE>Stock Rose After Earnings Revision Filed</TE>
<TE>   But the record of SEC filings and public statements by Enron officials
shows that Lay and other company officials maintained publicly that the
company's energy trading business was strong and that it had the
financial wherewithal to survive the crisis even as some of the firm's
difficulties became evident in October and November.</TE>
<TE>   The company reported a $618-million loss and a reduction in its
shareholders' equity Oct. 16, and Nov. 8 it revised its earnings for the
previous four years, although without public reference to its
overwhelming debts or the financial peril it was telling Treasury
officials about. In fact, Enron stock rose almost 20% in the four days
after the Nov. 8 disclosures as investment analysts anticipated its
proposed merger with Dynegy Inc.--later canceled--and said most of
Enron's troubles were behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Because the precise dates of Whalley's phone calls to Fisher were not
released, it cannot be determined how much shareholder value was lost
between the time Fisher was first contacted and Enron stock plummeted (it
dropped from $33.84 a share on Oct. 16 to $8.41 on Nov. 8). But company
shareholders and employees lost more than $18 billion of market value in
that decline.</TE>
<TE>   From that point, Enron stock fluctuated until the end of November,
when its bonds were reduced to junk status, and the firm filed Dec. 2 for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Enron stock closed
Friday at 67.5 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts are not certain whether officials have a responsibility
to disclose information received in communications from private industry.
"It's a tough question," said Turner, the former SEC accountant.
"Officials can have confidential communications."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Enron "the courts will decide" whether government
officials should have pushed for public disclosure, said William Bagley,
a lawyer in private practice who in 1974 served as the first commissioner
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Matters of disclosure are only one part of the mounting debate
concerning Enron's collapse. Some say the Enron-Treasury discussions
alone raise serious questions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible precedent for the rest of the economy if major
companies feel like they have access to the highest levels of government
and feel comfortable asking the government to intervene in their private
negotiations," said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the
University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. Goolsbee termed the
Enron phone calls "borderline unethical."</TE>
<TE>   But Alice Rivlin, a former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and
a Clinton administration budget director, saw a responsibility for
officials to communicate.</TE>
<TE>   "When a really big company is in really big trouble, having the CEO
call to say 'You ought to know what's going on' is a good thing," Rivlin
said. "If they had gone down and not said anything, that wouldn't have
been responsible. I think the reaction of the Treasury secretary, if that
had happened, would have been, 'Why didn't somebody tell me?' "</TE>
<TE>Some See Secrecy as Part of Problem</TE>
<TE>   Others see Enron's secrecy in all things as part of the firm's
difficulties. "There's a front door in government and a back door, and
most of these contacts were through the back door, hidden from public
scrutiny," said Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the
Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   More appropriate, Light said, would have been public appeals by Enron
for bailout legislation, filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission "or other above-board, in-the-sunshine approaches for help."</TE>
<TE>   But many experts see Enron's political influence as a reason for its
failure to get a bailout. Politically, the Bush administration already
had been on the defensive for taking massive contributions from Enron,
which in California had been pilloried for allegedly trying to gouge the
public during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But Edward Muller, an investor in energy projects and former president
of Edison Mission Energy, said Bush administration energy officials did
not rely on political considerations in their decisions to withhold help.
"They simply decided that a bankruptcy of Enron would not disrupt energy
or financial markets or the economy," said Muller, who was in touch with
officials last fall in connection with his own business interests.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, despite generating massive revenues, did not employ hundreds of
thousands of workers, as did Chrysler in the 1980s or Lockheed in the
1970s. And unlike Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s, its collapse
did not threaten banks across the country and the world.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Enron's bankruptcy did not greatly affect prices for
electricity and natural gas, nor did it disrupt markets that trade in
those commodities. One effect of Enron's bankruptcy, energy analysts
said, has been to make bankers and financial institutions more cautious
about lending and investing in power companies. But such caution
typically follows any publicized bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, lawyer Bagley explained, federal bailouts are not easy to
do. "There is no institutional structure, so it takes extraordinary
action by Congress--as in Chrysler or Lockheed." (In 1971, Congress
narrowly voted special financing to save the aerospace firm from
bankruptcy after an unwise investment in building a commercial airliner.)</TE>
<TE>   Long-Term Capital was saved by emergency bank financing, but that was
organized by the Federal Reserve. Enron could have been "rescued" by a
similar infusion of capital, Bagley noted. "But where would the capital
come from? The Bush administration would have had to seek congressional
action for Enron." And given Enron's closeness to the White House, such
an effort may well have raised political difficulties too great to
surmount.</TE>

<HD>Lauren's Ugly 'Boo-Boo' Spurs a Quest for Help</HD>
<DH>Medicine: As birthmark obstructs toddler's eyesight and playmates
call her a monster, parents refuse to take surgeons' no for an answer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN SKOLOFF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>Strangers can't help but stare.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes they even intrude. "My God, what's wrong with your child?"
they say.</LD>
<LD>   The doctors say surgery at this age would be too dangerous, blood loss
too risky, that maybe the spongy mass of tissue growing between her eyes
would go away on its own.</LD>
<TE>   Lauren is 2 1/2 and the mass has swelled to the size of a lemon. She
shies away from mirrors. Children call her a monster.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette and Glen Dillow are medical nomads, scouring the Internet and
medical research material in search of a cure for the deformity. This is
their little angel. How could they accept it when doctors say, "There's
nothing we can do"?</TE>
<TE>   In a couple of hours, they will know if they've found the right
doctor. Or if their daughter's face will always evoke pity.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren was born a healthy 7-pound, 6-ounce baby 2 1/2 weeks'
premature. She is Jeanette and Glen's first child.</TE>
<TE>   Several days after birth, a dime-size red mark appeared on her
forehead.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Lauren was 5 months old, the red mark began to protrude
like a tumor. It looked like a third eye. A four-month cycle of steroids
failed to control it.</TE>
<TE>   "We think she's gorgeous, but we're parents," Jeanette said. "Every
time you go out, you get different reactions--fear, pity, shock. I always
have to explain to kids and parents that it's not contagious."</TE>
<TE>   Strangers in the grocery store have accused Jeanette of child abuse.
She and Glen are bombarded with questions: "What have you done to your
child?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's always there," she said, "all the time, like a constant
underlying stress."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors diagnosed the mass as a hemangioma, a ball of tissue and blood
vessels growing just under the skin. It's actually a type of birthmark
that grows out of control like a tumor as cells divide rapidly, filling
the mass with blood.</TE>
<TE>   The word is derived from hemangio, meaning blood vessel, and oma,
meaning tumor. According to recent studies, one in 10 children will have
a hemangioma, but rarely as dramatic as Lauren's.</TE>
<TE>   In her case, doctors said it would eventually go away without
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren refers to it as "my bump."</TE>
<TE>   "She asked once if this is going to grow as large as an elephant's
trunk," Jeanette said.</TE>
<TE>   The mass eventually began obstructing Lauren's eyesight. Jeanette and
Glen worried that it might soon affect her mental development, and that
as she became more aware of its presence, it could have long-lasting
psychological effects.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids were beginning to respond to her badly," Glen said. They'd say,
"Oh, look at the monster."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette and Glen couldn't wait any longer and began seeking a doctor
who would remove the mass. What they found were pockets of physicians
around the country, most of whom would not operate on a child this young
for fear of massive blood loss.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually found Dr. Milton Waner, a pediatric ear, nose and
throat doctor and facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Arkansas
Children's Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very unique surgery," said Waner, one of a few doctors in the
world who will do this type of procedure on a child under age 3. "People
are concerned. . . . They're worried about the child bleeding to death on
the table."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Waner said, "Lauren would not have been able to find
anyone to operate. She would've waited four or five years, and eventually
someone would have done something to make her look more normal.</TE>
<TE>   "But by the time she was 6 or 7 years old, she'd have pretty severe
psychological trauma," Waner said. "She's starting to develop self-image.
. . . She knows she has a problem."</TE>
<TE>   It's 7:30 on a rainy October morning at Arkansas Children's Hospital.
Jeanette, Glen and Lauren are in a crowded waiting room just down the
hall from where a surgeon will work to change Lauren's life.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to keep moving," Glen says, pacing as nervously as a new
father.</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting her turn in the operating room, Lauren wanders over to a
little girl with a hemangioma slightly smaller than hers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a little boo-boo, too," Lauren says, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   She turns to her dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Da da, I want to go home," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get there soon, but now we're having a big adventure," Glen
replies.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere under there is a very pretty girl," Glen whispers to
Jeanette. "She must just be a little bombshell under there."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit nervous that when the unveiling does arrive, I won't
recognize her," Jeanette says. "It's going to be like seeing a whole new
face in front of me."</TE>
<TE>   In the operating room, Waner cuts carefully around the red mass with a
fine inch-long blade. His goal, he says, is to leave no mark, maybe a
hairline scar.</TE>
<TE>   To limit blood loss, Waner has perfected his craft using various
methods of injecting adrenaline into the site and cutting carefully with
a heated blade and a laser that seals off blood vessels and limits
scarring.</TE>
<TE>   He performs about 500 of these surgeries a year.</TE>
<TE>   "She may lose about 3 tablespoons of blood," Waner says.</TE>
<TE>   For about 90 minutes, Waner snips and cauterizes, then pulls the
hemangioma free. Lauren has lost less blood than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanette comes into the recovery room alone.</TE>
<TE>   She wears a silver angel on her shirt collar.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at my baby," she says, tears rolling down her cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   She picks Lauren up from the bed--the child is still sleeping--and
settles into a rocking chair, cradling Lauren in her lap.</TE>
<TE>   "She looks so beautiful," Jeanette whispers. "She looks like a
different little person. . . . She's just beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Glen comes in and drops to his knees in front of them. He strokes
Lauren's cheek and blond hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen her before," he whispers, smiling through his sobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like the day she was born," Jeanette says.</TE>
<TE>   Waner boldly tells parents, "I can fix your child." When asked if the
procedure is risky, he replies, "Not in my hands."</TE>
<TE>   The Dillows liked Waner's confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery isn't cheap. It can cost from $15,000 to $40,000, but the
hospital has a special fund to help pay for those who cannot afford it.
And Waner has been known to waive his surgical fee.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want people to struggle, so if they can't afford it, we'll
find a way to help them," Waner said. "We've never turned a child away."</TE>
<TE>   He says it took five years to perfect the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all self-taught," he said. "I was always fascinated by things
that have never been done. . . . I don't like to work in the box."</TE>
<TE>   Waner went to medical school in his home country of South Africa. He
spent three years in Australia at the University of Sydney, practicing
and researching the surgery he would later perfect before coming to
Arkansas in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Waner says he worked with a physicist in Sydney to develop a special
laser that limits scarring. The initial laser that physicists working
under him continue to advance came from an unlikely source. It was a
copper-vapor laser used in bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Waner says he sought out the inventor for help in modifying the laser
for use in surgery. He now has a team of physicists helping him develop
even more advanced lasers.</TE>
<TE>   Their motivation comes from the very people who need their help.</TE>
<TE>   "We can land people on the moon, surely we can do something to fix my
child," Waner recalled one frustrated parent saying to him.</TE>
<TE>   "No parent accepts no for an answer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And Waner is trying to find the cause of hemangiomas.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we really understand where they come from, then maybe we can
stop them," Waner said. "That's the dream."</TE>
<TE>   Back at home in Cedar Hill, Texas, the Dillows can't take their eyes
off their daughter's cherubic little face. The scar is barely noticeable
now and, in a year or so, after a few laser treatments, it should be
virtually invisible.</TE>
<TE>   There are no stares at the grocery store, no more invasive questions
from strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren "tells people that her bump is gone," Jeanette said. "She says,

<HD>Mormons to Let the Games Reign</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Church has lowered its profile, but Utah 'theocracy' will
be seen and felt nonetheless.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>When the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics unfold next month, the
world will see the Mormon Tabernacle Choir starring at the Opening
Ceremony, the Mormon Temple soaring above the nightly medal presentation,
and a Mormon bishop, the Games' affable organizer, welcoming athletes and
guests from all over the globe.</LD>
<LD>   The XIX Winter Olympics will be a showcase for both Salt Lake City and
the institution that dominates the city: the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, as the Mormons are formally known.</LD>
<LD>   But the games also pose a dilemma for a religion with 60,000
missionaries. How to capitalize on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
promote its message to an international audience yet avoid a heavy hand
lest they offend visitors in town just to watch the curling competition?</LD>
<TE>   To combat criticism that the church may turn the Games into a
prime-time bully pulpit, Mormon leaders have already dramatically lowered
the church's profile in its hometown.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormons banished their dark-suited missionaries from downtown
streets, forbade them from going to the airport or Olympic venues, and
instructed the 200 "missionary guides" who work at the downtown Temple
Square to refrain from proselytizing.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Pace, head of a citizens group concerned about the public cost
of the Games and one of the church's critics, laughed when asked if the
church would have a high profile during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "From a local perspective, the question is, 'Why would it be any
different during the Olympics?' " said Pace, a local business consultant.
"The church has never shown much of a gift for having a light touch with
anything. Utah is a theocracy. The reason they don't go overboard in
their excesses is that you have this complication called the U.S.
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon Church is an inescapable fixture on Utah's landscape. This
city and the state have been, for more than 150 years, headquarters for
what is now the world's fastest-growing religion and its massive network
of missionaries in 162 countries.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of the state's 2.2 million population is Mormon (1.8% of
the U.S. population is Mormon), although in Salt Lake City the figure is
less than 50%. The state's entire congressional delegation is Mormon, as
is the governor and 90% of the state Legislature, all of the state
Supreme Court justices and 85% of Utah's mayors and county officials.
Even the local television station that will broadcast the Games is owned
by the church.</TE>
<TE>   The church's influence in Utah's secular life is a subject of constant
debate; Mormon leaders are not reluctant to weigh in on political issues.
Some say the line between church and state is blurred.</TE>
<TE>   "The church is a major player regarding legislation in Utah," said Dan
Wootherspoon, editor of Sunstone, a magazine of independent Mormon
thought. "Just 10 days ago, a delegation from the church met with some
legislators in a pre-legislative session to talk about tightening alcohol
laws. Certainly they have a right, like any big corporation, to make
their views known. The difference here is that there is a reluctance on
the part of the legislator, when it's his faith, to go against the wishes
of his leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Although the church was officially neutral during the bidding process,
church-owned businesses donated $211,000 to Salt Lake City's campaign to
host the Games. Since then, the church has donated millions of dollars
and loaned substantial tracts of land to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the reputation of Utah, the reputation of Salt Lake City and
the reputation of the church is tied up together," said Michael Otterson,
the church's chief spokesman. "Because this community is so strongly
identified with the Mormon Church, we have to try and debunk the Mormon
Games thing. We understand why it's there, but it's not fair or accurate.
This is a religious organization. It's not a commercial organization
looking to market its goods."</TE>
<TE>   The stage is certainly set for extraordinary exposure. The church
loaned the 10-acre site in front of the massive tabernacle and the
majestic temple for the Medals Plaza and gave $5 million to transform the
former parking lot into a pedestrian mall. As many as 100,000 people are
expected to gather there every night, not to mention the anticipated 3
billion people watching on TV.</TE>
<TE>   It amounts to free advertising for the church, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   "Uninformed nonsense," Otterson said, adding that news organizations
are going to include shots of church buildings in their coverage anyway,
as part of the city skyline, much as the Opera House in Sydney was a
lasting visual impression of the 2000 Summer Games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to throw a shroud over" the temple, he said. "It's
going to be a widely seen image, with or without the Medals Plaza."</TE>
<TE>   Mitt Romney, the head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and a
Mormon bishop, wants the temple to play a symbolic role during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail obtained by the Salt Lake Tribune through an open records
request, SLOC board member Ken Bullock wrote to Romney: "As you shared
with me some months ago, I know your ultimate goal is to have the LDS
Temple serve for the Salt Lake Games the role that the Buddhist Temple
served for the Nagano Games, namely the structure the world remembers."</TE>
<TE>   Romney and other Olympic officials have been patiently dealing with
this topic for months. His responses illustrate the knife-edge community
leaders here walk: Acknowledge the church's prominence but don't
overemphasize it.</TE>
<TE>   "The church is an important strand in the community fabric," said
Romney, the son of former Michigan governor and presidential candidate
George Romney. "But it would demean the extraordinary contributions of
all faiths in the community to think that it was just the Mormon Church
that pulled this off. Conversely, we couldn't have done it without the
Mormon Church."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City's mayor, Rocky Anderson, says the church is fully
integrated into the image of the city, and he has no problem with that.</TE>
<TE>   "To talk about coming to Salt Lake and not experiencing the presence
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is like going to Rome
and not expecting to notice the presence of the Catholic Church,"
Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, a former Mormon, acknowledges his town is different,
saying, "There are little things in our culture that are odd."</TE>
<TE>   City boosters proudly tout Salt Lake City, home to 80% of the state's
population, as a clean, safe and prosperous large city. But it takes a
divergent path with its conservative social agenda, a reflection of
Mormon mores.</TE>
<TE>   Its alcohol laws are one example. Alcohol is available in restaurants,
but diners may not order a double. And drinkers must also be diners--no
alcohol is served to non-eaters.</TE>
<TE>   The state's convoluted liquor laws irritate Anderson, and he's
launched a campaign to educate visitors. His office has produced a
pamphlet to be distributed during the Games informing Olympic tourists
how to get a drink in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 10,000 international media in town, there will be
public relations efforts on many fronts. Winter clothing and ski
equipment manufacturers will be here, as will all Olympic product
sponsors. Protesters of all stripes will converge on Salt Lake City. And
other religious denominations have let it be known they have no intention
of keeping a low profile.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon Church has a downtown information center for Olympic media
and a sophisticated Web site that pitches "100 great story ideas"
relating to Mormonism, in 12 languages. A "Friends to All Nations"
campaign--emphasizing the church's increasing ethnic diversity--is in
full swing. Months ago, Mormon leaders met with NBC officials to preview
the church's educational "Myths and Realities" video. A Tom Brokaw
interview with LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley will be aired during the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "From our point of view, it's not an opportunity to convert people,
it's more of an opportunity to educate and inform," said Otterson, the
church spokesman, adding that, while people around the world have heard
of the church, many know little about its precepts. For example, the
church banned multiple marriages in 1890, but the idea persists that
Mormons practice polygamy.</TE>
<TE>   Mormons understand they must define themselves to a skeptical world.
Otterson said it was likely the church would do some polling after the
Games to gauge the success of their educational effort.</TE>
<TE>   The church-owned daily newspaper here has already anticipated media
portrayals of Mormon culture: "They'll talk about how wholesome we are
and point out the irony of our role in the biggest scandal in Olympic
history," the Deseret News editorialized. "They'll walk over to [the
mall] and buy that old standby, the 'Eat, Drink and Be Merry, for
Tomorrow You May Be in Utah' shot glass. At some point they'll mention
Donny Osmond. We'll emerge as caricatures of ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Utah and its Mormon population may be weary of their cultural
stereotypes, but that doesn't prevent them from poking fun at themselves.
Among the myriad official Olympic pins is one depicting a jiggling bowl
of green Jell-O, named Utah's official snack food last year by the state
Legislature, and another with a foaming mug of beer, with 3.2 stamped on
the front, making fun of the local brews' low alcohol content.</TE>
<TE>   One of the hottest sellers: a colorful pin showing two Mormon
missionaries feverishly pedaling bicycles, hot on the trail of a convert,
their black ties flying behind them in the wind.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Worries Iraq Is Next on U.S. List of Targets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>INCIRLIK, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>With a deafening roar, a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet streaks across
the sky above this drab town about 320 miles west of the Iraqi border.</LD>
<LD>   "The Americans are heading for Afghanistan again, but soon they will
be hitting Iraq," says Adem Yavuz, whose souvenir shop caters to about
3,000 American military personnel and their families at the U.S. air base
here. "More American soldiers will come. It will be great for business."</LD>
<LD>   His enthusiasm is not shared by Turkey's leaders. Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, scheduled to meet Wednesday with President Bush in
Washington, is expected to convey his unease over the prospect that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein will be the next target of the U.S. war on
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   One concern is that such an effort, whether it succeeds in toppling
Hussein, might fragment Iraq. That might create a breakaway Kurdish state
along Turkey's border and revive separatist unrest among the nation's 12
million Kurds. The Turkish army fought for 15 years before taming a
Kurdish insurgency in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Another worry is that Hussein will point his weapons of mass
destruction at Turkey if U.S. forces use bases on Turkish soil to attack
Iraq. Ecevit is expected to seek the return of Patriot missiles that were
deployed at Incirlik after U.S. airstrikes against Iraq in 1998 but were
withdrawn in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials and U.S. senators have begun sounding
out Turkish leaders and Iraqi Kurds about supporting a drive to oust
Hussein, who survived the 1991 Persian Gulf War after his army was driven
out of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. encouragement, Kurds in northern Iraq rebelled against
Hussein during that war, then felt betrayed when U.S.-led forces stopped
short of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. The outcome left Turkey uneasy as
well, and both parties have been noncommittal about supporting a new
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turks fear that the Americans will create a situation of chaos
and turmoil in Iraq and then not end it in some definitive way," said
professor Dogu Ergil, a Middle East specialist at Ankara University in
the Turkish capital. "Bush will need to persuade Ecevit as well as the
Iraqi Kurds . . . that this time [the Americans] are going to finish the
job."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for Washington is that the Ecevit government wants
assurances that Iraqi Kurds will not gain independence, said a senior
Western diplomat in Turkey, and the Kurds want "guarantees that they will
get something pretty close if not independence."</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit can expect a sympathetic hearing at the White House thanks to
Turkey's unwavering support for the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan.
About 260 Turkish troops are heading to South Asia this week as the first
predominantly Muslim force in a British-led peacekeeping mission. Since
October, Afghan-bound U.S. bombers and transport planes have refueled at
Incirlik.</TE>
<TE>   The base was a staging point for allied airstrikes during the Persian
Gulf War, and U.S. and British warplanes stationed there have since
monitored a "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq to protect 3 million Iraqi
Kurds from attack by Hussein's forces.</TE>
<TE>   If Turkey is asked to back a new assault on Iraq, use of the base will
be an issue. In an hourlong meeting this month between Ecevit and nine
U.S. senators, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said he told the
Turkish leader that the war on terrorism will not be over "until the
toppling of the Saddam regime in Baghdad," but that "everything will be
made in consultation with Turkey vis-a-vis Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Since that assurance, some Turkish officials have softened their
public misgivings about targeting Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not concerned about Saddam Hussein; we want a democratic
Iraq," Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, Turkey's armed forces chief, said Monday.
"It is Iraq's territorial integrity that concerns us."</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans will need Incirlik again if they really want to get rid
of Saddam, and the signs are that they do," said another senior Turkish
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If so, we cannot stand in
their way, we can only try to extract maximum compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Such were Turkey's expectations during the Gulf War. Turkish leaders
now complain bitterly that, after Iraq, their nation was that conflict's
biggest loser. Turkey has lost an estimated $40 billion in trade because
of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdish-dominated provinces bordering Iraq have been the hardest
hit. Their losses have been softened somewhat by the region's sale of
about $250 million a year in food, construction materials and
humanitarian supplies to Iraq under a U.N.-approved "oil-for-food"
program, but a new war would kill that trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the war we used to be able to bring bread to our table. Now we
can barely survive. A second war will make us starve completely," said
Bedrettin Karaboga, chairman of a regional entrepreneurs' lobby in
Turkey's largest Kurdish-dominated city, Diyarbakir.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment in the impoverished Kurdish provinces prompted thousands
of youths to join the uprising against the Turkish army. The vacuum left
by Hussein's forces in northern Iraq drew the rebels there to set up
bases, from which they staged cross-border raids against Turkish security
targets.</TE>
<TE>   In Incirlik, the idea of going after Hussein is popular. Yavuz, the
souvenir seller, said, "I don't like war, but I like Saddam even less. I
hope the Americans get him this time."</TE>

<HD>Eating Disorders on Rise for South African Blacks</HD>
<DH>Health: More young women are drawn to the Westernized idea of
beauty. Experts cite a marked increase in anorexia and bulimia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The pencil-thin models in the glossy Western fashion magazines
seemed to beckon to Gcina.</LD>
<LD>   A rape victim with low self-esteem, the attractive black teenager
began to copy their looks and style.</LD>
<LD>   On some days she would starve herself; on others she would binge on
junk food, purging later with vomiting or laxatives. She followed a rigid
exercise regime--two hours a day, seven days a week.</LD>
<TE>   Still, at 5 foot 3 and just over 100 pounds, at her heaviest, Gcina
considered herself fat, and her then-boyfriend agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, [supermodels] were normal because they were thin," said Gcina,
17, who requested that her last name not be used for reasons of
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   More and more black teenagers in South Africa appear to be adopting
this view. Experts on eating disorders have noticed a marked increase in
the number of cases of anorexia and bulimia among blacks in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In the white community, such disorders have long been in the public
spotlight, but there is a general lack of awareness among blacks, whose
medical and psychological well-being was given second-rate attention
under apartheid-era regimes, medical experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Rotundity is still considered a sign of good health, prosperity and
allure in many traditional African societies; slim women are often viewed
as being less feminine and unlikely to be able to bear children. For this
reason, many young blacks struggling to cope with an eating disorder
often suffer in silence, their families ignorant of their condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an emerging problem, the extent of which we are not quite clear
on," said Christopher Paul Szabo, a professor of psychiatry and head of
the eating disorders and adolescent unit at Johannesburg's Tara Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   However, anecdotal evidence and the numbers of black patients being
admitted to hospitals for treatment suggest that eating disorders among
blacks are on the rise, Szabo said.</TE>
<TE>   So popular is the quest to be thin that many black teenagers and young
adults are even having their jaws wired shut for a few weeks and
consuming only liquids through a straw, according to local news reports.
The procedure typically is used to immobilize fractured jaws, and the
country's main dental association says using it for weight loss is
unethical.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of apartheid and the installation of black-led
governments in South Africa, black women have adopted a more dynamic and
high-profile role in the country. Looking good--read, in shape--is a
prerequisite for high-status jobs, some women executives say.</TE>
<TE>   An onslaught of Western culture and diet fads in recent years has also
influenced African perceptions of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is a kind of departure from tradition," Szabo said.
"We all have in our minds the stereotypical image of traditional black
beauty. The truth of the matter is those stereotypes might be shifting.
We are starting to see the slender hips, the Westernized idea of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Gcina was aspiring to, until her friends detected her
curious eating habits and rapid weight loss, and persuaded her to check
into Tara Hospital in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit rock-bottom," said Gcina, whose weight plummeted to about 70
pounds. "I was collapsing all the time. I was scared I was going to kill
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Like many African parents, Gcina's were not initially convinced that
their daughter had a real ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "My father thought it was too white," said Gcina, who is scheduled to
remain in the hospital until Feb. 1. "My mother tried to understand, but
she didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts said the reaction is common among traditional
older-generation blacks, who simply don't understand why eating disorders
occur.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the patient's race, Szabo said, anorexia and bulimia
typically are linked to problems in personal relationships, control
issues and trauma.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Gcina was raped by a stranger after she got lost on her way
to a job interview. Fear and shame prevented her from reporting the
crime. She felt hopeless, and when her boyfriend told her she was getting
too heavy, her long-held desire to be thin became an obsession.</TE>
<TE>   "The slimmer I got, the more confident I felt," Gcina recalled. "I
felt I was so much in control."</TE>
<TE>   One effort to change the perception that being big equals being
unattractive is South Africa's Miss Fats, a local beauty pageant open
only to contestants weighing at least 176 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found that real African women have big bums," said Prince
Tshabalala, 24, a former model and choreographer, who started the
competition in 1999 to foster appreciation for heavy women. "Big women
symbolize African beauty."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show the world that we fuller-figured women preserve the
features of the African woman," said Mmamakgadi Masilela, 24, who entered
the contest last month, weighing in at more than 300 pounds. "I'm not
ashamed of myself. Whatever a skinny woman can do, I can do better. I
have confidence in myself."</TE>
<TE>   Many young women here believe that large women have a harder time
attracting men.</TE>
<TE>   Black South African men might indeed admire a woman with a slender
physique--but they would probably opt to marry one who is larger, said
Tshabalala, the beauty pageant promoter and a man with a petite frame.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true among the older generation, said Marion
Goldspink, an international technical consultant for Sofn'Free hair and
beauty products in Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that when they are mature, they like their women to be
built like real women--childbearing hips, fuller figures," Goldspink
said. "They would class the model-like woman as a career woman. But when
a woman has [a fuller] body, they think she is going to be loving and
more caring and she is going to take care of their needs."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists here say one of the keys to physical and mental
well-being is learning how to appreciate what you have.</TE>
<TE>   After a rocky start at the hospital, Gcina feels that she is on the
right track. Her food intake has more than doubled to about 2,000
calories a day, and she now weighs more than 90 pounds. She feels happier
and already more confident.</TE>
<TE>   "I have learned how to love myself," Gcina said. "Beauty is not about
being thin. You are never beautiful when you are too thin. It creates
problems. We should accept ourselves the way we are."</TE>

<HD>Costly Lessons of Argentina's Financial Folly</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Its predicament illustrates how not to handle the
economy. Political fallout remains a danger for the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Once the poster child for Latin American market reforms, Argentina
is now a cautionary tale, its deepening misery raising fears not so much
of financial contagion but of ideological spillover that could dampen the
region's appetite for liberalization and democratization.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few years ago, hopes were high that Argentina would become
Latin America's shining example of how foreign investment and the
privatization of state monopolies could streamline an economy, and create
prosperity. Those hopes are now buried under the political and economic
debris from Argentina's devaluation and abandonment of its currency's
one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Argentina illustrates how not even a flood of foreign investment can
wash away institutional and political flaws, that there are right and
wrong ways of selling off state-owned monopolies and that linking a
nation's fortunes to the dollar does not ensure stability.</LD>
<TE>   Although the financial contagion of the sort caused by the Mexican
devaluation and Russian default of the 1990s is unlikely, political
fallout remains a danger. Brazil and Colombia will hold presidential
elections this year, and within Argentina, leftists will seize on
economic woes as an opportunity to rally voters against further
privatizations and efforts to open markets to foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has known Argentina was going down the drain, and the
financial world was prepared for it," said Nancy Birdsall, president of
the Center for Global Development in Washington and formerly the
second-ranking executive at the Inter-American Development Bank. "But the
risk of intellectual and ideological contagion is far more subtle and
more important."</TE>
<TE>   How much Argentina's problems spill over into other Latin American
countries will depend on how the events of the coming weeks and months
unwind. Appointed by Congress Jan. 1, President Eduardo Duhalde has
embarked on the extremely delicate task of trying to bring the region's
third-largest economy back from collapse.</TE>
<TE>   There are many who don't think that he will succeed. "I'd give him no
better than a 50-50 chance," said Mauro Guillen, a political scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</TE>
<TE>   Restoring political stability may be even tougher. Duhalde said
Thursday that the nation is "one step away from a blood bath."</TE>
<TE>   Although most Argentines blame their leaders' mismanagement for their
current fix, many also blame the foreign companies who in the 1990s spent
billions of dollars buying utilities and state-owned companies.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find an Argentine these days who has a good word to say
about multinational companies here. Most seem to concur with the thinking
of Buenos Aires psychologist Elsa Am.</TE>
<TE>   "They have looted everything in this country with the complicity of
the politicians," Am said as she waited in line at a downtown exchange
house Friday to buy dollars with her devalued pesos. "Everything could
blow up in the next 10 minutes. There is no stability."</TE>
<TE>   Argentines on the street cite the bungled privatizations of former
state-run services ranging from telephones to water, for having raised
rates and their cost of living in a time of recession and high
unemployment. Sporadic rioting has targeted the branches of multinational
companies here.</TE>
<TE>   "The main fallout from Argentina's crisis is that there will be
greater anti-markets, anti-globalization rhetoric," said Sebastian
Edwards, a professor at UCLA's Anderson School and former economist at
the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   That resentment toward foreign companies could spill into continuing
violence and increase a political backlash against free-market reforms
that some say is already in progress.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Guillen notes that four leaders who were
"champions" of privatization--Peru's Alberto Fujimori, Chile's Augusto
Pinochet, Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Argentina's Carlos
Menem--are either in exile, having left the country in disgrace, or have
been under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Having abandoned the Argentine currency's 10-year peg to the dollar,
devalued the peso by nearly 30% and declared a default on $135 billion in
public debt, Duhalde faces a painful process in which Argentines will see
things worsen before they improve.</TE>
<TE>   The disgust of Argentines is high. There already have been sporadic
outbursts of violence in the capital. Deepening violence could cause
further disenchantment with market liberalization if crowds continue to
blame foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   This is all an unexpected turn of events for a nation that only three
or four years ago exemplified the so-called Washington Consensus, whose
underlying assumption was that opening markets to competition and foreign
investment would cause reforms bringing improved productivity, human
rights and better standards of living to all levels of society. The
consensus refers to the school of economic and political thought that the
best and shortest route to the First World is through free markets.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina privatized everything from railroads and the post office to
telephones and oil. For the first half of the 1990s, the flood of cash,
mainly from foreigners, helped paper over Argentina's structural problems
involving labor laws, its pension system and the peculiar habit of
Argentine provinces to spend more money than they collected in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But most Argentines and plenty of outside observers say the government
mishandled privatizations by auctioning state services and companies at
terms too favorable to the outside investors and not creating enough
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer was not at the top of the government's priorities,"
Wharton's Guillen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Privatizations gave too much to the companies, too much profits,
beyond reasonable," said Marcelo Fernandez, secretary of Proconsumer, an
Argentine consumer advocacy group.</TE>

<HD>The Hills Are Alive With the Hopes of the MacLeods</HD>
<DH>Scotland: Clan chief says he has to sell wild mountains on the Isle
of Skye so that he can renovate his dilapidated castle. Conservationists,
some neighbors, object.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DUNVEGAN CASTLE, Scotland
</DL>
<LD>In the wild mountains of the Isle of Skye, the chief of Clan
MacLeod is seeking his family's salvation.</LD>
<LD>   He's doing it in the time-honored way of hard-pressed British
aristocrats--by selling a family heirloom. In this case, the Black
Cuillin mountains.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been in this part of the world since the beginning of
recorded time," said John MacLeod, 66, standing on the battlements of the
castle owned by his family for 800 years. "It is dreadful, but there is
nothing else I can do."</LD>
<TE>   The castle, perched on a slab of rock on the edge of Loch Dunvegan, is
the crux of his problem. It's so dilapidated that he is trying to sell
the range of mountains for about $14.5 million to raise the money for
urgent repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The Black Cuillins, a rugged stretch of peaks, are considered among
the most beautiful in Scotland and dominate the southwestern corner of
Skye, an island just off the west coast of Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   The price includes a hill farm, two salmon and sea trout rivers, 14
miles of coastline and a campsite for the climbers who practice on the
Cuillins' sheer crags and cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeod insists the sale is the only workable option for restoring the
castle, which is itself a major tourist attraction and an important
source of employment on the island.</TE>
<TE>   The plan angers some locals and conservationists, who argue MacLeod
shouldn't be able to sell the bleak crags and heath land.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is diabolical," said Jim McKechnie, who runs a youth
hostel in the nearby fishing village of Portree. "The Cuillin Hills are
the most eye-catching bit of the whole island. Nobody should be able to
own something like that."</TE>
<TE>   But after public complaints, a government commission confirmed that a
charter of 1611 gave MacLeod's family title to the 35 square miles of
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeod then offered not to sell the hills, if the government would
pay for repairing his castle--and he was accused of blackmailing the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   An affable character with bouffant white hair, dressed in a tartan
kilt and sheepskin jerkin, MacLeod insists he has explored all ideas for
repairing the castle, and the sale is the only option.</TE>
<TE>   An offer by the Historic Scotland preservation agency to provide
$145,000 in grants over four years is not enough, he says. Without an
immediate, huge cash injection, he says, the medieval castle would be
covered in scaffolding for 10 years--spelling commercial doom for the
tourist attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that the tourist market hates is scaffolding," MacLeod
said. "The Cuillin Hills are unchanging and will remain freely accessible
to all, but the other national treasure for which I am responsible,
Dunvegan Castle, is not so durable. It is the castle's need for
fundamental maintenance, which is the reason behind the sale."</TE>
<TE>   The rooms open to the public are beautifully preserved. Walls are
lined with imposing family portraits and glass cabinets display the
MacLeod clan's heritage, including a horn from which new clan chieftains
must drink almost two pints of claret in one go.</TE>
<TE>   But behind the polished oak doors marked "private," the castle is
crumbling. Paint and plaster flake from ceilings. The air is musty with
rising damp. Walls are marred by holes where contractors have ripped out
woodwork to test for dry rot.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen years ago my guests had to put up umbrellas in their bedrooms
as the roof was leaking so badly," MacLeod said. "The thought of the
Cuillins on the market causes me intense inner grief, and I deeply
sympathize with those members of the public who share that feeling. But I
had to do something drastic."</TE>
<TE>   Guy Galbraith of FPD Savills in Edinburgh, the sales agent, maintains
that whoever buys the mountain range will have to preserve it. Rare
Carabid beetles scuttle around the mountaintops, making the hills an
officially designated "site of special scientific interest."</TE>
<TE>   The public also has the right to roam freely in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the sort of property that will be bought by an expat with
philanthropic wishes, who wants to preserve a bit of Scotland," Galbraith
said.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeod hopes a buyer can be found soon, so he can start repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "An American said to me once, 'You, sir, are living history,' said
MacLeod with a wry smile. "It is an enormous privilege, but it can feel
like a millstone."</TE>

<HD>Russians Target Rebels in Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The Kremlin rejects the U.S. State Department's
complaints of human rights abuses in the breakaway republic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia
</DL>
<LD>Moscow sent bombers and helicopters in aerial assaults against
rebels in Chechnya, pressing a campaign that has drawn renewed U.S.
allegations of rights violations--and a sharp Kremlin retort to the
American claims.</LD>
<LD>   An official in Chechnya's Moscow-backed administration said Saturday
that Russian aircraft bombed two areas in the breakaway republic during
the previous 24 hours, while helicopters struck another region and
artillery was used elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Five Russian soldiers and police officers were killed and five wounded
in fighting or land-mine explosions, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   He said more than 100 suspected rebels were detained in security
sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   The official spoke two days after Russian troops lifted a blockade of
Chechnya's third-largest town, Argun, following a roundup of suspected
rebels that prompted clashes and protests involving residents who claimed
that they were abused by Russian troops.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington on Thursday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said: "The latest information on Russian operations in Chechnya indicates
a continuation of human rights violations and the use of overwhelming
force against civilian targets."</TE>
<TE>   He also said Moscow had failed to pursue contacts with Chechen
separatists to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In a Kremlin information office statement carried by the Itar-Tass
news agency late Friday, President Vladimir V. Putin's administration
rejected Boucher's remarks and said it regretted the tone of his
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Itar-Tass report also quoted the chief prosecutor and the prime
minister in the government of Chechnya as saying that no human rights
abuses had occurred during the Russian operations in Argun.</TE>
<TE>   As it has since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, Russia
equated its campaign in Chechnya with the U.S.-led war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Our experience in Chechnya and America's experience in Afghanistan
show how hard it is sometimes to reach terrorists and to prevent any harm
on civilians. Nevertheless, that is the goal of Russia and the United
States," Itar-Tass quoted the Kremlin as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Putin threw his country behind the United States in the wake of the
terror attacks, improving relations between the two nations and softening
Washington's criticism of Russia's war in Chechnya.</TE>

<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland
</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic postal worker was shot and killed as he arrived
for work in Belfast on Saturday, and an outlawed Protestant group claimed
responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel McColgan, 20, was shot several times outside a Royal Mail
sorting office in northern Belfast's largely Protestant Rathcoole area
just before 5 a.m., police said. He died two hours later in a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Two men with scarves pulled across their faces were seen fleeing the
scene in a silver car that was later found abandoned nearby, police said.</LD>
<TE>   A group called the Red Hand Defenders said it had carried out the
killing. Security sources in the British province say the Red Hand
Defenders is a cover name used by two Protestant groups, the Ulster
Defense Assn. and the Loyalist Volunteer Force.</TE>
<TE>   The killing followed a quiet night in the divided Ardoyne district of
Belfast, the provincial capital, after two nights of rioting in which
hundreds of Catholic and Protestant youths hurled firebombs, acid bombs
and stones at police trying to keep them apart. More than 80 police
officers were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The violence flared near Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school at the
center of clashes last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they would increase their presence in the district.</TE>
<TE>   The Communications Workers Union said that as a mark of respect to
their slain colleague, they would not collect mail today or make
deliveries Monday.</TE>

<LD>   Paying for that treatment forced Xing's parents and grandparents to
sell their furniture and then their dirt-floored farm, including their
chickens and pigs. When the bills kept coming, they borrowed heavily from
relatives and neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   "We lost everything we had. The hospital was like a bottomless hole,"
said the boy's grandfather, Xing Shuke.</LD>
<TE>   For many of China's hundreds of millions of farmers, injury or major
illness can mean financial ruin. The near universal health care the
communists introduced after seizing power in 1949 and the peasants they
trained as "barefoot doctors" are now just a memory.</TE>
<TE>   They've been replaced by increasingly expensive private clinics and
hospitals, with doctors who pad meager incomes by prescribing expensive
and unnecessary drugs and tests.</TE>
<TE>   Most farmers bear the costs alone. By the government's own estimate,
more than 800 million people--90% of rural Chinese--have no health
insurance or social safety net.</TE>
<TE>   Rising medical costs have become a leading cause of poverty in the
countryside. Because farmers can't afford treatment, dangerous but
curable diseases like tuberculosis and childhood parasites are rife.
Childhood death rates have begun creeping up again, reversing decades of
progress.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, China had 60 million people below the government's poverty
line of 25 cents a day. Nearly half of them--some 25 million people--were
put there by catastrophic medical expenses, according to a U. S. study.</TE>
<TE>   Malnourished farmers succumb to "a vicious cycle of illness that
produces poverty, which, in turn, causes more illness," said one of the
study's authors, Harvard University researcher Yuanli Liu.</TE>
<TE>   Prohibitive medical costs have political ramifications too. The Falun
Gong religious sect's philosophies of health through meditation attracted
Chinese unable to afford decent care. Alarmed by its popularity,
communist leaders outlawed the multimillion-member group in 1999,
labeling it a cult.</TE>
<TE>   Providing farmers with modern health care was once one of the
communists' proudest achievements. Subsidized clinics staffed by peasant
doctors trained to set bones and treat basic ailments helped slash infant
mortality and almost double average life spans.</TE>
<TE>   That system collapsed in the early 1980s as China embraced capitalist
reforms, privatizing agriculture and making clinics increasingly pay for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Government-run media say the government in Beijing simply can't afford
to insure 900 million people. Rural communities have been left to find
their own alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of villages and counties have experimented with insurance
plans. Most have failed, however, because of corrupt or inept managers,
or because the number of people enrolled was too small to form a
self-sustaining insurance pool.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's abandonment of rural areas contrasts with the billions of
dollars it is promising to patch up social services in cities, where the
Communist Party fears worker unrest. Yet even in cities, millions lack
health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say insuring the countryside will only get more expensive the
longer a fix is put off.</TE>
<TE>   "As the declining health of the rural population puts a greater
financial burden on society, how can China develop?" said Chen Ningshan,
a health policy expert in the eastern province of Shandong.</TE>
<TE>   Xing Dongliang almost died after falling into the caldron of boiling
water on the floor of his mother's kitchen in May 2000. The three-month
stay at a hospital near his home in Liangtang, a village in rural Henan
province in central China, cost the equivalent of $9,000.</TE>
<TE>   His father's yearly cash income from farming was just $120--average in
that part of Henan.</TE>
<TE>   Selling the farm and other possessions, combined with the loans from
family and friends, covered just half the bill.</TE>
<TE>   In desperation, the boy's 15-year-old uncle quit high school to work
at a restaurant. The boy's father was arrested in October for briefly
abducting the owner of a Chinese herbal clinic, who had charged $700 for
remedies that didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was finally paid by the hospital's own staff and donors after
a local newspaper ran the boy's story, which was extreme but not
uncommon. Today, the child still can't lift his left arm above his
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Another big health problem in our family would mean death," his
grandfather said. "No money, no life!"</TE>

<HD>Mideast Expected to Again Lead the U.N. Agenda</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The world body is likely to devote considerable funds
and time to the issue despite having had little to show for its efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Security Council began its first session of the new year by
hearing an impassioned demand that it pay more attention to the Middle
East. The preoccupation with Afghanistan threatens to make the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute a mere "footnote" in deliberations here, said
Syrian Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe.</LD>
<LD>   But if half a century of diplomatic history is any guide, the fears of
the Arab bloc's representative on the council would seem misplaced.</LD>
<LD>   If there is anything that can be confidently predicted about the
United Nations in 2002, diplomats say, it is that it will once again
devote an extraordinary amount of time, money, documents and oratory to
the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Already, with a raging controversy over clandestine arms shipments to
the Palestinians and continuing gun battles, there are renewed calls for
U.N. intervention.</TE>
<TE>   But after hundreds of conferences and resolutions on the Middle
East--far more than on any other regional dispute--the U.N. has had
frustratingly little to show for its efforts, many officials here
concede.</TE>
<TE>   Most frustrated of all are the Israelis and Palestinians. Israel says
a majority of member states remain hostile to the very premise of a
Jewish state. And the Palestinians complain that despite their many roll
call victories here, the U.N. has not brought them closer to their goal
of an independent state.</TE>
<TE>   In its last official act of 2001, the General Assembly condemned
Israeli occupation of territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
called for an international monitoring mechanism to oversee a cease-fire
and Israeli withdrawal. It was a now-familiar ritual: The resolution was
vetoed by the United States in the Security Council, where it would have
had binding legal force, then passed overwhelmingly in the one-nation,
one-vote assembly, where resolutions are not binding.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the only opposition came from the U.S., Israel and--in one
of those enduring U.N. oddities--the Marshall Islands and Micronesia,
American protectorates and Israeli aid recipients.</TE>
<TE>   "Any Israeli ambassador knows that his country is more or less
completely alone in this so-called family of nations," said Yehuda
Lancry, Israel's representative at the world body.</TE>
<TE>   For the Palestinians, who acknowledge that last month's resolution
moved them no closer to independence, Israel's isolation is precisely the
point.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we don't have that much to show for it doesn't make it
any less important," said Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinian representative
here. "It is important for us to feel that we are not alone."</TE>
<TE>General Assembly to Take Up Mideast Issue</TE>
<TE>   When it reconvenes this week, the General Assembly is certain to pick
up the Palestinian cudgel again. In the Security Council, Syria can count
on a solid majority of the 15 members to support its insistence on
immediate Middle East debates and briefings by U.N. envoys. And
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to return to the region for more
hands-on diplomacy, as he has every year.</TE>
<TE>   Some diplomats say the U.N.'s devotion to the Arab-Israeli dispute is
wildly disproportionate, given the myriad unresolved conflicts elsewhere
in the world, from Kashmir to Colombia to Congo. But others--noting the
Middle East dispute's capacity to inflame a vast region--say the world
body should do much more to force a negotiated settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The chief adversaries here insist that there is no personal animus in
the conflict. Lancry, in his third year as Israeli representative, says
his relationship with Kidwa is "correct, and beyond correct." The two men
say they converse regularly, alternating between Arabic and English,
notwithstanding the Israeli Cabinet's announced severing of ties with the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider him a good professional," Lancry said. "And he is a man
who at a personal level is without hatred."</TE>
<TE>   Kidwa returns the compliment: "The Israelis have a very reasonable and
decent representative here. Whether he really represents [Prime Minister
Ariel] Sharon is another question."</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis would concede that Kidwa has a point. Lancry's office
features a portrait not of Sharon or Foreign Minister Shimon Peres but of
David Levy, the past foreign minister who appointed him.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no question as to whom Kidwa represents. Yasser Arafat is
his uncle--the Palestinian Authority president's sister, who lives in
Gaza, is Kidwa's mother--and sent him to what was then the Palestine
Liberation Organization's U.N. office 14 years ago. Trained as a dentist,
Kidwa has practiced only diplomacy since.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a brilliant negotiator," said Nancy Soderberg, who served as a
deputy U.S. representative to the U.N. under the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Soderberg, like many U.S. foreign policy experts, contends that
the Palestinian representative's victories here have been pyrrhic,
creating an illusion of progress toward statehood but undermining that
cause by alienating Washington and reinforcing Israeli fears.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian attempt to use the Security Council and the General
Assembly to score points for their political victimhood doesn't work,"
Soderberg said. "They have been doing it for 40 years, and they will
probably keep doing it, but it hasn't worked yet."</TE>
<TE>   But the Palestinians have unquestionably succeeded in keeping their
cause at the forefront of the U.N. agenda. Their legal status here has
improved to the point where "we have everything but the vote," said
Kidwa, who as the "permanent observer from Palestine" enjoys full
speaking rights in the General Assembly and other U.N. forums.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, meanwhile, is only now emerging from "international pariah
status," Lancry said.</TE>
<TE>   Blackballed from joining other Middle Eastern nations in the Asian
regional caucus here, Israel could not gain a seat on the Security
Council or U.N. committees, where its conduct was so often criticized.
But two years ago, acceding to pressure from Washington, the Western
European group admitted Israel as a member.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 also improved its
standing here, Lancry noted. The pullback was monitored by U.N.
cartographers, and as Israeli forces fought off subsequent cross-border
attacks from Hezbollah guerrillas, the world body for the first time in
decades sided with Israel in a dispute with an Arab neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Annan was instrumental in securing this support, said Lancry, calling
him "by far, from Israel's view, the best secretary-general the U.N. has
ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Since the U.N. was founded, the Security Council has passed more than
250 resolutions dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict. And the General
Assembly's tally is approaching 1,000. So voluminous is the record of
debates, hearings, reports and declarations on the issue that the U.N.
has an entire computerized information system--known as UNISPAL--devoted
exclusively to "the question of Palestine."</TE>
<TE>Palestinian, Israeli Views of United Nations</TE>
<TE>   "The United States and Israel see the U.N. as a kind of virtual
universe, but the Palestinians use it as a counterbalancing forum, and
they use it brilliantly," said David Makovsky, an analyst at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a pro-Israel think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Israel also takes the U.N. seriously: Its very creation as a state
was one of the first orders of business when the world body was created,
and the U.N.'s original two-state solution for the former British
protectorate of Palestine has been endorsed by Israel and Palestinian
leaders in the last decade as the ultimate formula for resolving the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides, moreover, accept in principle that the U.N. is the
ultimate adjudicator of the dispute. Israel and Palestinians cite the
same Security Council resolutions--242, adopted in 1967, and 338, passed
in 1973--as the legal basis for a negotiated settlement, echoing the
stated position of the United States and the world body.</TE>
<TE>   Yet 338 is essentially a demand for the implementation of the 1967
resolution--and for more than three decades the Palestinians and Israelis
have disagreed not only about what Resolution 242 requires but also about
what it says.</TE>
<TE>   In English, the 1967 text--adopted unanimously shortly after the
Six-Day War--demanded the "withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from
territories occupied in the recent conflict." The resolution did not
define precisely what those territories were, and Israel contended then
as it does now that the extent, timing and terms of a withdrawal are
subject to negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   But in French, an equally official Security Council language, the
resolution required withdrawal from "des territoires occupes"--the
occupied territories--language that "leaves no room for any ambiguity,"
the French ambassador at the time told the council, asserting that it
applied to all of Gaza and the West Bank, including the Old City of
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Most council members explicitly endorsed the French interpretation,
which the Palestinians have cited since. But the omission in English of a
modifying "the" before "territories" was no accident: The British
drafters sought to avoid a veto by the U.S., which opposed any resolution
that might prematurely turn the pre-1967 armistice line between Israel
and its neighbors into a permanent border.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said it was not bound by Resolution 242 in any language. Lancry
says arguments over the resolution's meaning "can only be resolved
politically, in negotiations, with everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lancry expects any future negotiations to be managed by
Washington, Kidwa hopes that the U.N. can "internationalize" a Middle
East settlement, with European and perhaps Asian, African and Latin
American participation as well.</TE>
<TE>   Though they live on Manhattan's East Side, the two men move in very
different worlds, culturally and politically. In New York, where Israeli
diplomats have long been a part of local political life, support for
Israel is broad and deep. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made four
trips to Israel while in office.</TE>
<TE>   For a Palestinian official, New York seems less welcoming. Kidwa
bitterly recalls how Giuliani barred Arafat from city-sponsored
diplomatic functions.</TE>
<TE>   In elite American society, Kidwa said, he is a nonentity at best, a
suspected "terrorist" at worse. "If we were in Washington, he wouldn't
give me the time of day," he said, referring to his Israeli counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   "But here," he says, smiling as he greeted an effusive stream of
well-wishers in the U.N. Delegates Lounge, "he has to chase me."</TE>

<HD>Ground-Zero Workers Air Concerns Over Health Impact</HD>
<DH>Jobs: Some firefighters and others around the World Trade Center
site since the Sept. 11 attack have had breathing problems--and wonder if
the worst is yet to come.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MALCOLM RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Many firefighters who raced to save victims of the Sept. 11 World
Trade Center attack now are facing their own health problems because of
the contaminated air at the disaster site.</LD>
<LD>   Some have asthma. Others have troubles ranging from a persistent cough
to diminished lung capacity that can interfere with their physically
demanding jobs. A few hundred are on medical leave or working light duty
because of respiratory illness.</LD>
<LD>   It's too soon to tell how many firefighters will be permanently
disabled and forced to retire because of the respiratory problems, said
Fire Department spokesman Frank Gribbon. But so far about 30 firefighters
have started the retirement process because of respiratory problems after
working at the trade-center disaster, which either caused their lung
ailments or made prior ones worse, Gribbon said.</LD>
<TE>Like a Ticking Time Bomb</TE>
<TE>   Apart from those with current symptoms, medical experts say some
firefighters and other ground-zero workers may be at risk of developing
cancer decades from now.</TE>
<TE>   One attorney said he has filed legal documents on behalf of more than
700 firefighters with respiratory symptoms to preserve their right to sue
the city later.</TE>
<TE>   Many firefighters who participated in the rescue effort are easily
winded, suffer from chronic cough or have developed symptoms of asthma,
said Tom Manley, health and safety officer for the Uniformed Firefighters
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Some on medical leave may not be able to return to their old jobs, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be fighting fires with asthma," said Manley, a firefighter
for 19 years. "Smoke irritates asthma severely. And when you climb
stairs, you are shot by the time you get up there. You're going to be out
of wind."</TE>
<TE>   One fourth-generation firefighter, who worked at the trade center site
18 hours a day for the first three days after the disaster and then every
other day for about a week, said his first signs of breathing trouble
appeared about a month later.</TE>
<TE>   He noticed he became easily winded when exercising or doing job
activities like climbing tall ladders. "I knew there was something
wrong," he said. "I was getting tired too quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The man, who asked not to be identified because he thought his
superiors would disapprove of his talking to the media, said he went to a
Fire Department doctor for a checkup. The doctor gave him medicine, and
the department put him on medical leave and told him to limit his
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago he started getting congested with a gritty phlegm. He
said his doctor told him it was a sign his problem is clearing up. "I can
live with that for now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But there's also the dry, raspy cough he's had since the first week
after the disaster. "It's always there," although the severity comes and
goes. Once or twice a week, he said, "your lungs hurt from coughing, you
get a pain in your back."</TE>
<TE>   Manley, who was at the trade center when the towers collapsed, also
continues to be nagged by the so-called World Trade Center cough.</TE>
<TE>   "In the mornings it's heavy," he said. "It feels like a powder on the
back of your throat."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the cough, "you can't take a deep breath sometimes," he
said. He said he has been helped by an inhaler and medication. Gribbon
said many firefighters with persistent cough are on the job and improving
with treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Barasch, the attorney who has filed the legal notices on
behalf of firefighters, said one fireman who used to run marathons now
finds he can't even carry his 3-year-old daughter up the stairs because
of lung disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys who are waking up every morning with horrible coughs,
spitting up blood," Barasch said.</TE>
<TE>   The notices he has filed are intended to preserve the firefighters'
right to sue the city under the claim that the city failed to follow
federal regulations and provide protective respirators soon after the
attack, the attorney said. Besides the 700 firefighters, he said he has
also filed on behalf of about 300 police officers, fire marshals and
emergency medical technicians.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers who are studying the health effects of Sept. 11 say the
failure of many rescue workers to wear respirators is a major factor in
their health. The firefighter on medical leave said he didn't wear one
for the first few days because "there were none around."</TE>
<TE>   Manley said that with so many off-duty firefighters and volunteers
pouring in to help, there simply weren't enough to go around early on.
Some used surgical masks, he said, but those can't keep all the
potentially hazardous materials out of the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Gribbon said that even when respirators were available, some
firefighters chose not to wear them. The equipment is uncomfortable, he
said, and makes communication difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Respirator use by workers at ground zero improved after the first few
days but "could certainly be better," said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan,
chairman of the department of community and preventive medicine at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the trade-center disaster is "bigger than anything we've
seen before," Landrigan said nobody can predict completely what the
long-term consequences will be for worker health.</TE>
<TE>   Among the substances that escaped from the 1.2-million tons of debris
at ground zero are asbestos, benzene, dioxin, and polychlorinated
biphenyls, known as PCBs. These are linked to cancer, although experts
said in many cases the exposures were low enough that the risk appears to
be small.</TE>
<TE>Higher Mercury Levels Detected</TE>
<TE>   Recently, four Port Authority police officers who worked at the site
were reassigned after they showed elevated levels of mercury in their
blood. It wasn't clear whether the mercury came from ground zero, and the
officers were in good health, officials said. Gribbon said no elevated
mercury has been detected in firefighters, who are getting special
medical evaluations because of their search and rescue roles at the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Landrigan said his top concern is asbestos. Some 20 years or more
after exposure, it can cause mesothelioma, a rare cancer affecting the
sac lining of the chest or abdomen. Most people with the disease have
worked in jobs where they breathed asbestos. Asbestos exposure can also
cause lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say how big the mesothelioma threat is, Landrigan said,
because nobody knows how many workers were exposed to various levels of
asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   And the exposure isn't over yet. Every time a worker picks up a beam
that contains asbestos, "that stuff is kicked into the air" and could be
inhaled by workers who aren't wearing proper protection, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dr. Stephen Levin, medical director of Mount Sinai's Irving J.
Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, said he
believes the risk of asbestos-related disease in ground zero workers is
relatively low. While he doesn't want to trivialize their exposures, he
said, they are lower and briefer than the typical lifetime exposures seen
in construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   As for dioxins and benzene, Landrigan said, they probably pose much
less risk than asbestos. Levin said he suspects the risk from those
chemicals and PCBs is small.</TE>
<TE>   A key concern experts cite is dust--a mix of such things as pulverized
concrete and fibrous glass, and mineral dust, mixed with irritating
gases. Dust can cause respiratory problems that last a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said doctors at his medical center have found more than a dozen
people who, in the wake of the disaster, experienced a first episode of
asthma. The cause isn't clear, but it could be dust, gases or a
combination.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has appeared in rescue workers and people who were just
nearby when the disaster happened. The worst cases have shown up in
people caught in the dust cloud that spread from the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   When asthma is triggered that way, Levin said, the lungs can become
more reactive to other irritants like cigarette smoke and bus exhaust, or
just going from a warm room to cold outdoor air. So some of the new
asthma cases may end up as lifetime chronic disease, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But with quick treatment, he said, it's reasonable to hope that won't
happen.</TE>
<TE>Early Treatment Is Important</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, doctors have also seen workers and others near the site
develop sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinus linings that can cause
facial pain, stuffy nose and a persistent cough, Levin said. Again, that
can turn into a chronic lifelong condition, but the hope is that early
treatment can prevent it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Planned studies of people exposed in the disaster might show whether
early treatment--say, within the first two or three months--with inhaled
steroids really does lower the risk that newly diagnosed asthma or
sinusitis will become lifelong conditions, Levin said. Most rescue
workers apparently didn't get such early treatment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the fourth-generation fireman who served at ground zero and is
now on medical leave, he's taking his medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to relax," he said, "and I'm hoping it will all go away."</TE>

<DL>SOCORRO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>The snow is pocked with tiny furrows of blast powder. A piece of
2-inch galvanized pipe is on the ground, one end blown open. A short
distance away lie pulverized shards of a watermelon.</LD>
<LD>   A technician strides by, camera slung over his shoulder. He spots Van
Romero, vice president of research for New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology, looking over the damage.</LD>
<LD>   "Hello, Van," he calls. "It's a beautiful day to blow up the
neighborhood."</LD>
<TE>   It's all in a day's work at Tech's Energetic Materials Research and
Testing Center, a 40-square-mile test field of winding canyons, pinon-
and cactus-covered volcanic hills and old mining tunnels. Here, the
school does everything from training foreign police officers to using
small arms to test what a blast in a luggage compartment could do to a
passenger plane.</TE>
<TE>   On this cold afternoon, three dozen or so police officers and
firefighters have just gotten a taste of what they could face responding
to an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, Tech has trained firefighters and officers--the first
responders in most disasters, human-caused or otherwise--how to save
lives, protect themselves and preserve any crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the school--with a student body of fewer than 1,700 in a town
of 9,000--has trained thousands of first responders, who in turn train
others in their departments.</TE>
<TE>   The science and engineering university that grew out of the New Mexico
School of Mines has done military research for decades. But after the
1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, it began moving
more toward anti-terrorism programs. Since Sept. 11, it has ratcheted up
those programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our old-hat training has got to change," said University City, Mo.,
police Lt. Christine Keim, a class member. "Fools rush in--and that will
be us if we don't change."</TE>
<TE>   She said Tech's course would help first responders figure out if they
can safely rescue someone or simply become another victim in the attempt.
"We're not superheroes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntsville, Ala., police Lt. Henry Reyes was scheduled for the class
after the terrorist attacks. Before then, he said, a lot of
administrators didn't view such training as important.</TE>
<TE>   "They were saying it's not a big deal, it'll never happen in our city.
. . . Now they understand how serious [it is]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There's a six-month waiting list for the class. Salt Lake City-area
departments are getting priority because of the Winter Olympics, which
start in February.</TE>
<TE>   Six tests for this day are set up on wooden platforms on a broad,
snow-covered field. Some of the explosives were placed in PVC or
galvanized pipe as pipe bombs. Watermelons were duct-taped to two
platforms to simulate a human body.</TE>
<TE>   The explosive charges ranged from a fraction of a pound up to 10
pounds in an arena test, set off at ground level inside a circle of steel
and wooden poles topped with "One Way" and other signs.</TE>
<TE>   Different explosives are used, including the arena test's ammonium
nitrate and fuel oil--the mix used in the Oklahoma City bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI wants to know, as you approach the site of an event, is there
anything you can learn as you approach," said Ray Tobin, associate
director of safety and ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "Time is important," he lectured the class. "You want to catch the bad
guy as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The class crowded into a bunker atop a hill about 1,500 feet away to
watch the detonations from a periscope-type arrangement of double rows of
mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   A countdown of "3-2-1," then a sharp, sonic boom-like sound as the
tests go off. Some explosions leave a puff of white smoke; some a streak
of black; a smokeless powder one leaves no obvious sign. The final blast,
the arena test, rattles the bunker.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the field, street signs are warped on their poles. Holes,
chest-high and fist-sized, are punched in a piece of plywood set up near
the arena test to see if a human could survive behind it.</TE>
<TE>   All these are telling signs to look out for on the way to a disaster,
said Romero, a physics professor.</TE>
<TE>   "Alarms are going off, you're driving up and see one-way signs, stop
signs, street signs bent over. Well, that wasn't caused by a fire," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Test results also let experts extrapolate what a larger blast would
do.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's 10 pounds here, we know how much more would get bent with 100
or 1000 pounds, or how much it would be bent if it was farther away,"
Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   A white two-room 16-by-20-foot wooden building sits nearby, each room
containing a desk, a chair with a dummy and an old computer printer.
Technicians will set off a letter bomb and a package bomb.</TE>
<TE>   From experience, Romero knows what the blasts will do. The letter bomb
blows the hands off the dummy, smashes a hole in the desk, knocks over
the computer equipment. The package bomb blows the dummy back, destroys
the equipment, shatters windows, knocks down ceiling tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Later, an old blue Chevrolet Celebrity packed with ammonium nitrate
and crashes into the structure, the 63rd car-bomb test for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell by the way the metal is bent if the car held the
explosive device or was a car parked next to it," Romero said. "If it's
the car, you can get the vehicle identification number and can track back
that way."</TE>

<DL>BILBAO, Spain
</DL>
<LD>A car bomb exploded on a downtown street in this Basque port city
Saturday, wounding two people who were hit by flying shards of glass,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said a caller claimed that the Basque separatist group ETA
was responsible.</LD>
<LD>   The midafternoon blast shattered windows in several buildings. Police
had evacuated the area after a caller phoned a warning to a newspaper and
claimed that the ETA had planted a bomb, but they were unable to find it
before it exploded.</LD>
<TE>   Television footage showed police frantically waving people away from
the area of banks and shops minutes before a car exploded in flames. The
security chief for the region, Basque Interior Minister Javier Balza,
said the car had been stolen Saturday morning and was loaded with up to
44 pounds of dynamite.</TE>
<TE>   The ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has been blamed
for the deaths of about 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for Basque
independence.</TE>

<HD>Turks Protest Destruction of Castle in Mecca</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>About 300 Turks burned pictures of the Saudi king Saturday to
protest the destruction of an Ottoman-era castle in the Muslim holy city
of Mecca.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration outside the Saudi Embassy signaled a rise in
tensions between the two Muslim countries, both U.S. allies.</LD>
<LD>   The 200-year-old Al Ajyad Castle was destroyed a few weeks ago to
allow for construction of a trade center and hotel to accommodate
pilgrims to Mecca.</LD>
<TE>   Saudi officials have defended the destruction as a matter of national
sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   But Turkey, which emerged from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, has
compared it to the Taliban's destruction last year of ancient Buddha
statues in Afghanistan and said it would lodge a protest with UNESCO, the
United Nations agency responsible for the preservation of cultural
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make them pay the price for Al Ajyad," the protesters
chanted. They set fire to three pictures of King Fahd, one labeling him
as an "infidel" and another depicting the monarch as a demon.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters also carried banners that read: "Osama bin Laden equals
King Fahd," and "Down With Saudi Dictatorship."</TE>
<TE>   Travel agents in Turkey said Saturday that they would protest Saudi
Arabia's "cultural massacre" at international fairs.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia have been uneasy. Predominantly
Muslim Turkey has strict secular laws that separate religion from the
state, and Turkish leaders have criticized Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic
laws.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, a government-controlled newspaper Saturday criticized
what it called Turkey's ambivalent attitude toward Muslims and its ties
to Israel.</TE>

<HD>Effort to Disarm Kabul Leaves Some at the Mercy of Criminals</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Kabul has been declared weapons-free, but Mohammed Sabir reflects
the capital's grim reality--he was shot the day the new Afghan government
ordered all armed men off the streets.</LD>
<LD>   His home has also been burglarized and his brother kidnapped, all
within the last week, reflecting how the crime rate has soared with the
departure of the Taliban and the grim kind of law and order they
enforced.</LD>
<LD>   Sabir was shot as he was trying to flee gunmen Wednesday, the same day
the government ordered all men with weapons off the streets within 72
hours. As the deadline passed at midnight Friday, there were no real
signs that Kabul would be anything near safe soon.</LD>
<TE>   Although there was a noticeable reduction in the number of men
sauntering down dusty streets with Kalashnikov rifles hanging at their
sides and vehicles packed with armed men roaring down the streets, men
with guns remained a common sight.</TE>
<TE>   "We see them on the streets, but we stay away from them. They are
still here," said Isatullah Barakzai, a fruit and vegetable vendor.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, store owner Mohammed Zubai, his dirty brown woolen cap pulled
low over his ears, complained about rising crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to finish with these armed men. Only men in uniforms should
be allowed in the street" with guns, Zubai said.</TE>
<TE>   A policeman for 18 years, Sabir, lay in a grimy hospital bed with a
gunshot wound to his side. He blames the soaring crime rate on the armed
men who swarmed into Kabul when the repressive Taliban regime fled on
Nov. 13 in the wake of relentless U.S.-led bombing. Within hours, heavily
armed troops of the U.S.-backed northern alliance took control of the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of Kabul to the Northern Alliance, the crime rate has
soared. A security official at an international aid organization, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said more than 400 cars have been stolen
in the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   There also have been nightly break-ins at homes in every Kabul
neighborhood. In just the last two weeks, three high-profile killings
have occurred--two doctors and one of the richest businessmen in the
capital, robbed of $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If you couldn't take care of the security, then why did you let these
thieves into Kabul?" Sabir asked. "George Bush should replace everything
I lost."</TE>
<TE>   International peacekeepers have started making rounds in Kabul to help
the fledgling interim regime establish security--this week British
soldiers began joint patrols with Afghan policemen. But the troops--to
number 4,500 at full deployment--are slow to arrive, with only 1,000 in
the capital by Friday</TE>
<TE>   Nighttime is the most dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Aziz, known as "the most famous baker in Kabul" for his
traditional Afghan sweets, was held hostage for several nights by armed
men who then robbed him and stole his car, said a neighbor, Mohammed
Kabir.</TE>
<TE>   But daytime doesn't stop crime--Mohammed Ibrahim, the richest
businessman in Kabul, was shoved into a car by gunmen, robbed and killed
a week ago, all in broad daylight.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul security chief Mohammed Qadir said Northern Alliance commanders
and the armed men loyal to them have been ordered out of the city. But
some still remain, he acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir said those who don't go voluntarily will be forced to leave--or
asked to join the army, if they've committed no crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to teach them what a military is, discipline them," he said.
"We can teach them to be military men, to be officers, to work for the
country not against it."</TE>
<TE>   In a televised speech to the nation last week, interim Prime Minister
Hamid Karzai said he wants to see a national army formed to unite his
nation and bring the troops of the many warlords under one command.</TE>
<TE>   On the street, any mention of security quickly gathers a crowd, all
with stories about gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   All agreed the presence of international forces alongside the police
was the only guarantee that Afghans with guns would not fight each other
or ordinary residents</TE>

<LD>Government-backed militants embarked on a new looting campaign of
white-owned farms this month, forcing 23 landowners from their homes, a
Zimbabwean farmers organization said.</LD>
<LD>   One farmer was given five minutes to vacate his property, and another
had to barricade himself inside his house, said Jenni Williams, a
spokeswoman for the Commercial Farmers' Union.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the reported incidents were in the Raffingora area, north of

<HD>Non-Muslims in Pakistan Seek a Political Voice</HD>
<DH>Asia: A 'separate electorate' system discriminates against
Christians, Hindus and other minorities in the Islamic republic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The Christmas tree festooned with lights and tinsel still stands in
Cecil Chaudry's living room, a cluster of unwrapped presents at its base.
He knows, of course, that most other Christians in this Islamic republic
have already taken down their trees, but he has dawdled, preferring to
keep the spirit of the season alive.</LD>
<LD>   Besides, he has been busy. A retired air force general and highly
decorated veteran of two wars against India, Chaudry is at the forefront
of a challenge to change the soul of Pakistan. He wants to end what he
calls the "religious apartheid" that was written into the constitution in
the 1980s and has given an unrepresentative voice to the heavy-handed
tactics of an extremist Islamic minority.</LD>
<LD>   Chaudry is one of at least 1 million Pakistani Christians, the
country's largest non-Muslim minority. Lahore's cathedral is full for
Sunday Mass, and Catholics worship there without fear of persecution. But
the day he was passed over for promotion in the air force--because, he
believes, he is Christian--he left to fight a new battle.</LD>
<TE>   At the heart of grievances Christians and Hindus have is the "separate
electorate" amendment that Gen. Zia ul-Haq, the late military ruler,
wrote into the constitution. It takes religious minorities out of the
political and social mainstream and represents one of many attempts by
former dictators to manipulate for personal political power the one force
without which Pakistan wouldn't have existed--Islam.</TE>
<TE>Population Is Divided Into Five Groups</TE>
<TE>   The law divides Pakistan's 140 million people into five groups:
Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Ahmadis (an Islamic sect whose members are
viewed as apostates and thus non-Muslims) and other, smaller religions.
Pakistan is about 97% Muslim. Each group votes separately and is
represented by candidates of similar faith.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim politicians have local constituencies; non-Muslims do not. The
latter are elected at large as national representatives and often
represent Hindus or Christians many hundreds of miles away. The 217-seat
parliament guarantees 207 seats for Muslims, 10 for non-Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the problem in Pakistan--the state has legislated against
minorities," Chaudry said. "This has led to sectarianism and laws that
are then grossly abused by the religious extremists. The laws have
created a wall that divides people and makes religion part of politics.
It means we live in groups. Eventually, I am sure, we can end this
system, but it will take time."</TE>
<TE>   Chaudry and his supporters collected 200,000 signatures in 40 days
last summer, asking President Pervez Musharraf, who suspended the
constitution after coming to power in a 1999 coup, to scrap the "separate
electorate" system in favor of "joint electorate." When Musharraf
refused, most Christians and Hindus boycotted local elections last
August.</TE>
<TE>   Death threats notwithstanding, Chaudry continues to lobby for
religious tolerance, if not secularism, aware that Muslim zealots
consider it un-Islamic to kill a national hero who has fought for his
Islamic homeland.</TE>
<TE>   For a campaign of this sort, Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city,
is the perfect battlefield. It is the cultural and educational center of
Pakistan and, in many ways, the country's political nerve center. It is a
hotbed of debate and conflict between extremists and moderates. When
people take to the streets in Lahore, residents like to say, governments
change.</TE>
<TE>   "Through the 1970s, this was a very moderate Islamic country," said
Kamila Hyat, 33, joint director of Pakistan's feisty, independent Human
Rights Commission, which has its national headquarters here. "My
generation didn't know discrimination against any group. We were all just
Pakistanis. But since the '80s, religion--rather than becoming less
important as it has in many societies--has become more important."</TE>
<TE>Nation Undergoing 'Talibanization'</TE>
<TE>   In its report for 2000, the most recent available, the commission
lists 315 women who were victims of so-called honor killings for being
unfaithful to Islam, the vandalization of at least five Hindu temples,
plus rapes and other crimes that authorities failed to investigate when
they learned that the victims were Christian. Musharraf said Saturday
that 400 people were killed last year in sectarian violence.</TE>
<TE>   The strife is testimony to how far Pakistan has moved from the vision
of its founding father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who studied law in England,
was married to a non-Muslim and created a state that was secular,
tolerant and moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The incremental steps toward the "Talibanization" of Pakistan have
subjugated the timid majority that still believes in the Jinnah
principles to the zealous minority that has never shown strength in
elections or attracted vast crowds at rallies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, Pakistan became an Islamic republic. Bars and nightclubs were
closed and alcohol banned. In the 1980s, Islamic law, Sharia, was
imposed, including amputations for thieves and stoning to death for
adulteresses. The penalty for blaspheming the prophet Muhammad was death.
The harsh penalties have not been carried out, nor have blasphemous
infidels been executed, but religious parties continue to agitate for
Sharia's enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, many Pakistanis are now hopeful that another military
dictator will turn the country back toward Jinnah's vision.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Musharraf started moving against religious extremists a month
before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. Since then,
Musharraf, a secular man, has continued his crackdown and spoken of the
need to make Pakistan a country viewed by the world as a decent and
responsible place. Thus far, the religious parties have been
uncharacteristically acquiescent.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to think that if we acted against the militants, there
would be mayhem and violence," Hyat said. "But sometimes when a bully
gets punched in the nose, he runs away and you discover he doesn't have
the strength you thought he did. For the first time, the religious
militants don't have the backing of the establishment, and it was that
backing that gave them the strength to destabilize governments."</TE>

<HD>Historic Lessons for a Terrorist Tribunal</HD>
<DH>Courts: As Bush administration considers military prosecution, some
experts say there are lessons to be learned from proceedings that
followed Lincoln assassination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Less than three months after an assassin shot Abraham Lincoln, a
military tribunal sentenced three men and one woman to death by hanging
and put four other defendants behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Their 1865 trial before nine senior Army officers is one of several
historic precedents relied on by the Bush administration as it considers
prosecuting 21st century terrorists before a military commission rather
than a federal court.</LD>
<LD>   The death sentences in the Lincoln conspiracy trial were carried out
in a heavily guarded prison courtyard at 1:21 p.m. on July 7, 1865, just
one day after the defendants learned of them.</LD>
<TE>   Frantic bids for presidential clemency were rejected, even in the case
of Mary Surratt, the boarding house owner who became the first woman
executed by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the objections now being raised to the use of military
tribunals rather than civilian courts also were registered 136 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a trial is not only unlawful, but it is a gross blunder in
policy," said former Atty. Gen. Edward Bates. "If the offenders [are
sentenced] to death by that tribunal, however truly guilty, they will
pass for martyrs with half the world."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, attorney George Templeton Strong noted with approval the
vigorous opposition of the city's newspapers to the use of a military
court.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be reasons for the course adopted of which we know nothing,
but it seems impolitic, and of doubtful legality," Strong wrote in his
diary.</TE>
<TE>   The trial and the fate of the accused are recounted in a new and
handsomely illustrated book, "Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial and
Execution," by James L. Swanson and Daniel R. Weinberg.</TE>
<TE>   The authors note that Atty. Gen. James Speed concluded a military
trial was fully warranted, reasoning that the assassination of the
commander in chief and the attempted murder of Secretary of State William
Seward were acts of war committed during an armed rebellion against the
lawful government.</TE>
<TE>   One senior officer contended years later that a disciplined military
court was the better alternative because the public was so inflamed by
Lincoln's murder that asking private citizens to serve on a jury would
have thrown the accused "to the mercies of an angry and revengeful mob."</TE>
<TE>   John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln at Ford's Theatre on the evening of
April 14, 1865. Booth was already dead, mortally wounded by his pursuers,
when the trial of his alleged conspirators opened on May 9 at the Old
Arsenal Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next seven weeks the panel of Army generals and colonels
heard 361 witnesses and produced a 4,900-page transcript.</TE>
<TE>   But many thought the procedure was badly flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys had no time for pretrial preparation or consultation
with their clients who, when they were not in court, were held in
solitary confinement, their legs and hands shackled and their heads
covered with canvas hoods.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers, Swanson writes, "had insufficient time to locate,
prepare and call the witnesses they wished and little time to investigate
the government's witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Lt. Col. Richard A. Watts, a lawyer who had observed the
trial, concluded: "This tribunal was a law unto itself."</TE>
<TE>   History has concluded that three of the executed defendants were
guilty as charged: Lewis Powell, who tried to kill Seward; David Herrold,
who accompanied Booth on his flight from Washington; and George Atzerodt,
who flunked his assignment to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson but told
no one of the plot to murder Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   But debate has never ended over the fates of Mrs. Surratt, who kept
the boarding house where the conspiracy was discussed, and Dr. Samuel
Mudd, the Maryland country doctor who set Booth's broken leg after the
assassination and was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Some hostile 19th-century observers called Mrs. Surratt's execution
"judicial murder." They noted that President Johnson, Lincoln's
successor, ignored a recommendation for clemency from a majority of the
military judges.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd and the other living Lincoln conspirators were pardoned at the
end of Johnson's term in 1869.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd's ancestors have struggled ever since to clear his name by
getting the conviction overturned.</TE>
<TE>   That has stirred a reaction by people determined to prove Mudd's guilt
once and for all, an effort made clear in the title of a recent book on
the issue: "His Name is Still Mudd."</TE>

<HD>Saudi-Backed Web Supports Terrorism, Book Asserts</HD>
<DH>France: 'Forbidden Truth' details kingdom's role in funding Bin
Laden and contends geopolitical concerns have influenced U.S. policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>An unlikely bestseller has emerged lately in France, dueling head
to head with the memoirs of the president's wife, a biography of Victor
Hugo and a philosophical treatise on good and evil.</LD>
<LD>   The upstart competitor? An "instant book" written in three weeks and
titled "Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the book is one of a wave of titles about Osama bin Laden,
terrorism, Islam and Afghanistan that has swept France, and the rest of
the world's literary marketplace, since Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   But "The Forbidden Truth" is not the kind of esoteric analysis that
draws French intellectuals like flies. Nor does it feature shootouts or
car chases. Instead, authors Jean-Charles Brisard, 32, and Guillaume
Dasquie, 35, serve up a dense, conspiracy-minded portrait of
Saudi-dominated banks, companies and tycoons, all allegedly
interconnected, that they maintain have helped fund Bin Laden's holy war.</TE>
<TE>   The book asserts that Saudi Arabia has played as big a role in the
spread of Islamic terrorism as has Afghanistan. But according to the
authors, geopolitical concerns--chiefly oil--have led U.S. and European
governments to go soft on Saudi rulers and even prompted the Bush
administration to negotiate secretly with the Taliban before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Our economic development is based on alliances with
petro-dictatorships and encourages the latter to promote the most
backward ideas," Brisard and Dasquie conclude. "Sooner or later the
terrorists will be judged and probably also the states that harbored and
supported them. But more uncertain is what should be done to those who
inspired and financed them by action, commission or interest."</TE>
<TE>   That controversial stance helps explain the book's appeal in France--a
nation of voracious readers and considerable anti-American sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, France has been a stalwart ally of the U.S. in the war
against terrorism. French government agencies have worked closely with
American investigators. President Jacques Chirac was the first head of
state to visit President Bush after the September attacks and displayed
Rudolph Giuliani-style empathy during a tour of ground zero. According to
polls, the French public has supported military action against
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been less friendly gestures too. Although French
investigators contributed to the indictment of Frenchman Zacarias
Moussaoui in connection with the Sept. 11 hijackings, some Cabinet
ministers here responded to the indictment by criticizing the United
States' death penalty and the proposed military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Brisard, a financial investigator with experience in the law
enforcement and intelligence communities, and Dasquie, an investigative
journalist specializing in intelligence issues, deny any kinship with
snide America-bashers. They see "The Forbidden Truth" as an indictment of
the hypocrisy of numerous Western governments that have allegedly ignored
persistent ties between the Saudi elite and Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is not the only one," Dasquie said in a recent interview.
"The question is why developed countries need to do commercial deals with
Saudi Arabia and if those commercial deals are why they must close their
eyes about the reality of the Saudi Arabian kingdom. Since the 18th
century, Saudi Arabia has been focused on conquering the world."</TE>
<TE>   The book opens with a scoop: Brisard recounts conversations last
summer with an FBI counter-terrorism official who complained that his
investigation of the Saudi role in supporting Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network was blocked for political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   That agent was John P. O'Neill, formerly the bureau's leading Bin
Laden expert, who resigned to become security chief at the World Trade
Center--and died in the rubble Sept. 11. Brisard got to know O'Neill and
other U.S. investigators in 1997, when the Frenchman was preparing a
report on Bin Laden's finances for France's DST intelligence service.</TE>
<TE>   As chronicled in "The Forbidden Truth," O'Neill told Brisard at a
dinner in July that he was exasperated by interference from the State
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "All the responses, all the keys to dismantling the Osama bin Laden
organization are in Saudi Arabia," O'Neill said, according to the book.
That helped convince Brisard that U.S anti-terror operations were being
hurt by "two conflicting points of view": the FBI and CIA agents "hunting
Bin Laden every day" versus diplomats and White House policymakers more
concerned about big-picture politics.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government has denied allegations that it has bankrolled
Islamic extremism in general and Al Qaeda in particular. The kingdom's
leaders have declared their determination to track down Saudis involved
in terrorism and say Western criticism of the nation amounts to an
assault on Islam. Both the monarchy and Bin Laden's family claim to have
declared the terrorist leader persona non grata years ago because of his
anti-Western violence.</TE>
<TE>   But the book alleges that a global web of financial institutions still
connects the Bin Laden clan and the sternly religious Saudi establishment
to Muslim charities and other front groups funneling millions of dollars
to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "The book shows it's institutional and shows why the royal family has
kept its support for Bin Laden," Brisard said. "It shows that at least
six members of the Bin Laden family were in contact with him, supported
him financially or materially over those years and had been subject to
U.S. investigation."</TE>
<TE>   As debate about American policy toward Saudi Arabia has grown in the
United States, a Texas congressman has called for an investigation of
"The Forbidden Truth's" account of the Saudi connection and of alleged
Bush administration attempts to secure control of Caspian Sea oil and to
persuade the Taliban to surrender Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the enemy is defined and understood, it cannot be accurately
targeted or vanquished," Republican Rep. Ron Paul said in a speech on the
House floor in November. ". . . The charges made by these authors deserve
close scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics, on the other hand, have faulted Brisard and Dasquie's
hasty writing and have questioned their book's darkly suspicious
depiction of the big-oil connections of Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney
and other officials.</TE>
<TE>   A review in the Toronto Sun said the book "has the whiff of an
old-fashioned conspiracy theory starring the usual panoply of villains."</TE>
<TE>   "Still," the review went on, "the details that Brisard and Dasquie
provide . . . do not contradict what was already known about the
relationship between Washington and its soon-to-be archenemy."</TE>
<TE>   American readers may shortly be able to judge for themselves. The
authors have a U.S. literary agent looking for an English-langugage
publisher. New information will advance the story, Brisard predicted. And
that story, he said, did not end with the fall of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "What is important for the future is that the U.S., especially the
FBI, knew a lot about those networks, but they couldn't really
investigate for political and diplomatic reasons," he said. "That's the
point to remember: We don't attack the big fish--the main sources of
finance."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Begins to Rebuild as U.S. Siege Narrows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>This country increasingly feels like two countries: a southeastern
swath that is under siege from American bombing where suspected Al Qaeda
operatives are believed to be hiding, and the remainder, which is
starting the process of rebuilding.</LD>
<LD>   In eastern Afghanistan on Saturday, U.S. warplanes continued to strike
areas around the eastern city of Khowst, and a disarmament operation was
underway in the southern border city of Spin Buldak.</LD>
<LD>   Spin Buldak, which is southeast of Kandahar, is a former stronghold of
the deposed Taliban regime. The BBC Pashto-language news reported that
the city was closed for a second day while interim government troops,
aided by American forces, went through the town disarming people.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile in Kabul, the capital, the Defense Ministry took the first
steps toward building a national army. After holding a meeting of
commanders from all ethnic and tribal groups, interim Defense Minister
Mohammed Qassim Fahim ordered every province to send 200 men between the
ages of 20 and 25 to Kabul to form the basis of an army. There are 30
provinces in Afghanistan, so the initial force would be at most 6,000
strong.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Saturday, several government officials were in the
midst of discussions about the amount of money their sectors will need to
rebuild. Haji Mohammed Mukhaqiq, who is in charge of planning for the
six-month interim administration, said the country needs at least $15
billion for immediate reconstruction and will present its proposals to a
pledging conference of more than 50 countries in Tokyo on Jan. 21-22. At
the moment, not even the government ministries have telephones, vehicles
or computers, so it is difficult for them even to start the job of
organizing a reconstruction effort.</TE>
<TE>   The need for money as soon as possible was underscored by Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), who was in the midst of a three-day visit to the
Afghan capital. Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, called for an immediate infusion of money to help the new
government begin to operate before the country slides back into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively smaller financial aid packages that arrive swiftly, he
said, are needed more than promises of larger sums in six months or a
year.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, Biden said, is considering unfreezing Taliban
assets--as much as $100 million locked up in banks worldwide following
the attacks of Sept. 11--to provide quick assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, he said, would "literally give the Afghans back some of
their money."</TE>

<HD>Trade Center Site's Future Is a Prism of Plans</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Opinions on what to build there range from a park to a
museum to offices. The choice could set the tone for a nation's memory.</DH>

<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>It's a jagged hole in the heart of lower Manhattan, a 16-acre
moonscape that continues to trigger fury, grief and numbing disbelief in
those flocking to see it.</LD>
<LD>   But the emotions flaring now at the World Trade Center site, powerful
as they are, may be nothing compared to those ahead.</LD>
<LD>   As the first phase of cleanup at ground zero nears completion, New
York--and America--must confront a difficult question: What exactly
should be done with the sprawling vacant lot? And how can the final
decision, months or years away, possibly satisfy all those demanding to
be heard?</LD>
<TE>   On a recent wintry day, as chilling winds ripped through the crowds
viewing the site, New Yorkers offered radically different suggestions.
Some, shaken by the devastation, said the area is hallowed ground, a mass
grave that must not be defiled with buildings. Others could barely
contain their anger at the terrorist attacks, saying the area must be
rebuilt--and quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do the right thing here," said a Brooklyn teacher,
gazing sadly at the wreckage below. "I mean, this is not just real
estate."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, victims' families, survivors, real estate brokers,
politicians, community leaders, businesspeople, historians, museum
curators, developers, architects and bankers have voiced a flurry of
ideas for rebuilding. The proposals range from sweeping monuments and
memorials to vigorous new office construction that would rejuvenate the
community's beleaguered economy.</TE>
<TE>   The newly formed Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corp. will sift through
all of these ideas before agreeing on a final plan, but major
construction at the site is not expected to begin until later next year.</TE>
<TE>   And long before then, there will be lengthy, perhaps rancorous, public
hearings. The outcome is unclear, many experts say, because what
ultimately takes shape at the World Trade Center site will say as much
about how America chooses to remember Sept. 11 as it does about the
future of development and commercial growth in downtown Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "This could wind up being one of the most visited sites in the world
when it's finally completed," said Richard Anderson, president of the New
York Building Congress, an amalgam of developers, contractors and
Realtors. "And to think we can decide what to do based on office vacancy
rates or real estate trends is ludicrous. The whole country will be
watching us."</TE>
<TE>   A key player is Larry Silverstein, the Manhattan developer who won a
99-year lease to the World Trade Center buildings for $3.4 billion and
wants to rebuild them with a mix of offices, retail shops and a memorial.
But the land is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
and before any construction is approved, a long list of state and city
officials, plus zoning, engineering and planning agencies, must give
their blessings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the redevelopment corporation began forming task forces on
various aspects of the rebuilding project, and for now the watchword is
"inclusion," according to panel chief John C. Whitehead. New York's new
mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has voiced confidence that the panel will
honor victims' feelings above all and find a design that most New Yorkers
can support.</TE>
<TE>   But for many observers, it still seems premature to talk of concrete
plans. Even though the World Trade Center surface area is expected to be
cleaned up by June, paving the way for quick repairs on subways and other
underground facilities, the clamor of different voices has only begun to
surface.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are entitled to sit at the table," said Edward T.
Linenthal, author of "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American
Memory," a study of the city's response to the 1995 terrorist attack.
"This site belongs to Mr. Silverstein, but it also belongs to city and
state officials, to victims and survivors. It belongs symbolically to the
larger culture. Whatever gets built at ground zero will be the flagship
statement of what Sept. 11 means to America."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Linenthal believes New York might learn from Oklahoma City's
experience. Although local officials there were initially determined to
quickly rebuild the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, they eventually
formed a huge task force to come up with a "vision statement." It took
nine months to write the statement, and the community finally decided to
construct a quiet memorial park honoring the 168 bombing victims.</TE>
<TE>   But Oklahoma City is light-years from Manhattan, which abhors a real
estate vacuum and is unlikely to turn 16 acres of real estate into
parkland. Still, the voices calling for just that won a major ally last
month, when departing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani urged the city to forgo
development on the site and instead build a memorial with a museum. He
said Silverstein could be easily compensated with office development
rights elsewhere in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's plea drew a swift response from Bloomberg, who backed a mix
of office and retail development on the site and said his predecessor had
become "emotional" on the subject. Yet many more emotions are likely to
surface in the months ahead; the battle is certain to spark one of the
most intense planning fights in the history of New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has to stop and ask: 'What are Americans 50 years from now
going to think of what we did at ground zero?' " said Nancy Biberman,
president of the Women's Housing &amp; Economic Development Corp. "There will
be lots of proposals, but whose will have the most lasting value?"</TE>
<TE>   A cluster of victims' organizations want little or nothing done to
disturb the site. Monica Iken, who lost a husband at the World Trade
Center and heads September Mission, opposes any development.</TE>
<TE>   "You watch," she said. "Before it's over, this will be a struggle
that's all about money."</TE>
<TE>   Marian Fontana, who heads the Sept. 11 Widows and Victims Family
Assn., is repelled when she hears people discuss the site in terms of
economic development. "It's hard for me to hear builders talk about
construction and making money when we're still pulling bodies out of
there," Fontana said.</TE>
<TE>   Architects and museum curators, however, see an important opportunity
to build something provocative and meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never again have a chance to build on so much open land in
Manhattan," said Kathleen Hulser, a historian at the New York Historical
Society. "We don't need a clunky monument. We need something understated,
something with value years from now."</TE>
<TE>   The ideas are pouring in: Some architects envision a memorial with two
huge beams of light to replace the vanished twin towers. Others have
called for a blending of open space and a park where people can post
informal memorials, such as paintings and photographs.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to simply rebuild the old World Trade Center, but a
"living, energized city" with new commercial buildings should be as much
a part of the site as any memorial, according to Carol Willis, founder of
New York's Skyscraper Museum.</TE>
<TE>   For others, the bottom line is business. Many local merchants have
been clamoring for a swift economic revival in lower Manhattan,
contending that development must be put on a fast track to aid their
beleaguered community.</TE>
<TE>   Just how much development, though, is a thorny issue. There is a
projected 17% office vacancy rate in lower Manhattan, due primarily to a
steadily worsening economy, according to a report by Grubb &amp; Ellis Inc.
As a result, Silverstein's plans have drawn mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   During recent comments before New York University's Real Estate
Institute in midtown Manhattan, Silverstein said new construction is not
just about making money "but about taking a scar on the urban landscape
and healing it."</TE>
<TE>   Others at the meeting disagreed, urging fiscal caution.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we commit to build a lot of space?" asked Michael
Fascitelli, president of Vornado Realty Trust, a large New York landlord.
"I don't think you should be building that amount of space going into [an
economic] downturn."</TE>
<TE>   Developers seem united, however, on the idea that the site cannot be
left simply to a memorial. Anderson said that "the people who died here
weren't sitting in a park on Sept. 11. They were sitting at desks in an
office building, and that has to be a part of any final development we
approve."</TE>
<TE>   The hard part, he said, will be to build a memorial that attracts
attention years from now, evoking a painful yet pivotal moment in time.</TE>
<TE>   New York tried to do this once before, after the 1993 bombing attack
on the World Trade Center. The Port Authority installed a granite circle
with the names of the six victims in the wind-swept plaza in front of the
twin towers. But it attracted little attention, and the monument was
buried in the rubble of the World Trade Center last year.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed now, some say, is a remembrance that lets people
interact and express their feelings. New Yorkers created such
mini-monuments with flowers, paintings, personal notes and pictures in
key locations around the city. Some still exist, attracting a steady flow
of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, the way in which the city decides what to do with the
World Trade Center site may be as important as the design itself,
according to Marilyn Taylor, who chairs Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, a
prominent architectural firm involved in the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we listen to as many people as we have to before deciding,"
Taylor said. "This could take us a very long time to agree on. But I
really hope that it doesn't. I hope that it takes a thoughtful amount of
time."</TE>

<HD>Suitcases Hold Clues to Broken Lives, Forgotten Souls</HD>
<DH>History: Baggage found in a former mental hospital serves as time
capsules for another era. Exhibit is planned for 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HILL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WILLARD, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>She came to the asylum in the summer of 1930 with a suitcase
stuffed with hand-stitched baby booties and quilts.</LD>
<LD>   She was worn out. At age 40, she had endured a miscarriage, the death
of two of her four children and a broken marriage.</LD>
<LD>   The cloistered grounds of the Willard Psychiatric Center in the Finger
Lakes would be her home for the rest of her long life. By the time
Willard closed in 1995, her story was forgotten--like those of thousands
of other patients here.</LD>
<TE>   Then they found her suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   Workers combing through the center in its last days found the
alligator-skin bag 65 years after it was packed, sitting in a filthy
attic jammed with some 400 other old trunks and suitcases that had been
brought with patients.</TE>
<TE>   The dingy cases turned out to be leather-bound time capsules packed
with a cornucopia of intimate items: letters, wedding photos, a dog
figurine, a windup alarm clock, a school cap, a diary, ice skates, dog
tags, a curling iron.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are piecing together the lives of the owners for a 2003
New York State Museum exhibit that would tell their stories. It's a
bedeviling task. They know the patients' names, but cannot reveal them
because of confidentiality laws. How can the researchers capture the
essence of people who endured so much using only the likes of booties and
trinkets?</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a jigsaw puzzle, but you don't have a clue what the picture
is," says museum curator Craig Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Willard Asylum for the Insane opened in 1869 on the eastern shore of
Seneca Lake. Its mission: Treat the chronically insane with "gentle and
kindly understanding." At first blush, Willard looked like a bucolic
world apart, complete with sloping lawns, tall trees, a steamboat landing
and a rail connection (station stop "Asylum").</TE>
<TE>   Patients took part in plays, parades, social dances and calisthenics.
At Christmas, a patient choir would sing carols. They worked on Willard's
farm, or in the tin shop or laundry.</TE>
<TE>   Willard dropped "Asylum" from its name in 1890, being called in turn a
hospital and a psychiatric center. But it remained the sort of
mega-institution that was viewed as a dinosaur with the rise of
community-based mental health care and psychotropic drugs in the latter
part of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   In a wave of institutional closings, New York handed over Willard to
state prison officials in 1995 for a drug treatment center, its current
use.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the suitcases were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Courtwright found them with a co-worker as she rushed to
complete a final inventory of the center. The attic of an old workshop
was one of the last stops. Nothing much was up there, but the women did
find a metal-clad door sealing off one end of the attic.</TE>
<TE>   They pulled the door open with a "Whoosh!" and saw it: a vista of
neatly racked cases and trunks coated with dust and pigeon droppings.
Shafts of light from the attic windows shone through, and Courtwright
swears she felt some kind of energy under the rafters that day.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt sacred and hallowed to me," she says. "I didn't want to
disturb it. I didn't want anyone to disturb it. It was all that was left
of them. I was like: 'Let them rest.' "</TE>
<TE>   Courtwright told Williams, who was there to save pieces of Willard's
history.</TE>
<TE>   An ad hoc rescue squad--many of them about to be laid off from
Willard--performed a sort of suitcase triage. They put on spare surgical
masks and gloves to bag up the dusty relics and seal them with surgical
tape. Williams recalls seeing the people dressed like surgeons and
thinking: "They're operating on people's memories."</TE>
<TE>   The suitcases were stored at the State Museum's warehouse near Albany.</TE>
<TE>   State Mental Health Commissioner James Stone gave the OK for a study
of the Willard baggage in 1997. Williams was joined by Peter Stastny, a
psychiatrist at the Bronx Psychiatric Center and a documentary maker.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 400 suitcases, about half were empty and another 100 contained
maybe just shoes or a coat. The last 100 were full. Twenty were chosen
for study.</TE>
<TE>   Most had been packed between 80 and 50 years ago, by the patients or
someone else. They were probably carried up to the attic upon admission
after some choice items were plucked out. Since Willard handled long-term
cases, many trunks stayed there into their owner's old age and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "These were the people who ended up in the bottom drawer," Stastny
says. "Willard was the last stop."</TE>
<TE>   Who were these people?</TE>
<TE>   A World War I veteran. A photographer. A nun. An Italian immigrant. An
amateur boxer. A World War II refugee.</TE>
<TE>   Old case files reveal that the woman with the baby booties really was
a seamstress. She was born near Ithaca in 1889 and was married at 18 to a
plumber--a man she said drank too much and ran around with other women.</TE>
<TE>   The years before her institutionalization in 1930 were marred by
sickness, the deaths of two of her four children and finally, according
to case files, psychotic episodes.</TE>
<TE>   "My stars and garters, I was sick!" she told one doctor. "My daughter
was going to be married and I was just all tired out and had had just one
thing after another."</TE>
<TE>   The seamstress died at Willard in 1973. She was 83.</TE>
<TE>   One suitcase with worn shoes and little else led researchers to a
letter written at mid-century by the case's owner, a German immigrant who
dug the graves at Willard's cemetery. The man asked administrators if he
could leave and be paid for the 400 graves he dug. He was denied. He went
on to dig graves for another 20 years until his death. (Altogether,
almost 6,000 graves, most unmarked, cover a hillside by a lake at
Willard.)</TE>
<TE>   Another suitcase included a bit of everything--pressed flowers, a
little metal Washington Monument thermometer, an English-German
translation book, pictures of people in traditional Ukrainian garb--and
told the tale of a talented artist with a troubled life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Poland in 1916, he endured labor on a farm in Nazi-occupied
Austria and life in a postwar displaced-persons camp. In 1949, he and his
wife made it to the United States, where he found a job and a home. But
in 1951 his wife had a miscarriage and died. That's when things fell
apart for him.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at Willard in 1953, he eventually started painting a picture
a day. Williams found one of those paintings showing a Ukrainian village
with a church in the center. The use of color and perspective made the
artist seem rather like an Eastern European Grandma Moses.</TE>
<TE>   These inanimate items have a powerful, almost haunting, effect on the
people studying them. Williams says he has trouble distancing himself
from the work. He has even dreamed about the Ukrainian artist.</TE>
<TE>   Stastny likens the old attic where the suitcases were found to a
spiritual space.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this level of intimacy and closeness to these people--albeit
they're dead--because you're touching and working with very personal
items," Stastny says. "You feel a presence, a very close presence, of the
person through these items."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that many--if not most--of these people would not face
long-term institutionalization today adds to the sense of poignancy. Some
of the patients, like the seamstress, passed up chances to leave Willard.</TE>
<TE>   One man, institutionalized since 1917, was told in the '60s that he
could leave.</TE>
<TE>   He replied: "Where am I to go?"</TE>

<HD>Gubernatorial Races Hinge on Fiscal Fitness</HD>
<DH>Politics: Candidates will be judged on their approaches to closing
sudden budget shortfalls caused by the recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After 14 years as lieutenant governor, Republican Scott McCallum
finally inherited Wisconsin's top job in February, when Gov. Tommy G.
Thompson joined the Bush administration as secretary of Health and Human
Services.</LD>
<LD>   Along with a nicer office, McCallum inherited something else: a gaping
state budget deficit that could stretch to as much as $1.3 billion. Now,
even after two rounds of across-the-board spending reductions, McCallum
is bracing the state for stinging new budget cuts he plans to submit this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Slashing popular programs isn't the way McCallum wanted to launch his
campaign for a full term in November's elections. His only solace may be
that he has plenty of company in his misery.</LD>
<TE>   Across the nation, state officials are scrambling to close sudden
budget shortfalls caused by the recession. This fiscal tumble is forcing
governors to choose among unpopular options: cutting spending, deferring
new initiatives and, in rare cases, raising taxes. And that promises to
make the 36 gubernatorial races on tap for 2002 the most volatile in
years, especially compared to the late 1990s, when governors of both
parties largely waltzed to reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget squeeze is going to have a huge impact," says Democratic
pollster Mark Mellman. "If you look at the national picture, it is going
to be the determining single factor in these governors' races."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have the most to lose simply because they must defend more
seats--23 governorships held by Republicans will be at stake in November,
compared with 11 for the Democrats. (Two more are held by independents,
in Maine and Minnesota.)</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats aren't immune to the undertow: Among the governors most
threatened by darkening budget situations are Democrats Jim Hodges in
South Carolina, Donald Siegelman in Alabama and Gray Davis in California.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is a head-spinning reversal from the last half-decade.
With the booming economy swelling state revenues in the late 1990s,
governors of all ideologies handed out tax cuts for state residents and
spending increases for favored programs, such as education and children's
health care.</TE>
<TE>   The result was soaring approval ratings and reelection rates that
approached those of one-party nations in the old Soviet bloc. From 1996
through 2000, just three incumbent governors were defeated, while 33 won
reelection. By comparison, 12 governors were ousted in the slump years
from 1990 through 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, the good times are over. Revenue is running below
expectations in more than 40 states, according to the National Conference
of State Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Gov. George Pataki is warning that state receipts could
drop $3 billion to $6 billion in the fiscal year that begins this spring.
Michigan staggered through a $1-billion shortfall in the current fiscal
year and confronts a $1.4-billion deficit next year. Minnesota projects a
$2-billion hole in the two-year budget that began in July. Arizona's
Legislature just completed about $650 million in cuts for the current
fiscal year--and still faces a $1-billion deficit in the 2003 budget it
will begin debating this month.</TE>
<TE>   California's situation may be the bleakest. Scrambling to close a
budget shortfall estimated at $12 billion or higher, Democrat Davis could
become the poster child for the deficit dilemma facing governors.</TE>
<TE>   From one side, the three Republicans competing to oppose him in
November are poised to attack any tax increase; from the other, key
legislative Democrats are warning him not to try to balance the budget
with spending cuts alone and are floating possible tax hikes on affluent
families.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has talked about closing the gap primarily with spending cuts
and borrowing. He will not propose tax hikes himself, he said last week
in his State of the State speech. But he avoided any commitment to block
increases pushed by legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Other governors similarly are steering clear of tax increases to
address budget deficits. Instead, they are mostly relying on reserve
funds, squeezing programs and diverting money states received from their
legal settlement with tobacco companies, said Arturo Perez, a fiscal
analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   Perez warns that governors may not be able to avoid raising revenues
indefinitely: "If the situation continues to worsen for states, it may be
beyond their ability to cut spending and tap reserves to balance their
budget."</TE>
<TE>   So far, only a few governors have seen their approval ratings slide
along with their state's bottom line. Among those suffering the biggest
declines have been Davis, Massachusetts Republican Jane Swift and
Minnesota independent Jesse Ventura--each of whom has been afflicted by
political problems on other fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts say it's not surprising that most governors have
not yet felt the full effect of the fiscal storm. Few states have acted
yet to close their budget shortfalls; the tough choices will come in
legislative sessions that get down to business in the next few weeks. And
as those choices translate into headlines about reduced spending on
education or highways, professionals in both parties expect many
governors to pay a price.</TE>
<TE>   "The salad days of governors having high approval ratings . . . are a
thing of the past," GOP pollster Neil Newhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   McCallum's situation in Wisconsin may be typical. He starts in a
precarious position because he was so overshadowed as an understudy to
Thompson. Last fall, even before the budget reached a crisis stage,
McCallum's approval rating stood at just 49%--in the danger zone for any
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Since assuming the top job, McCallum has faced steadily widening
estimates of the potential shortfall in the state's two-year budget. As a
result, he's already had to impose two across-the-board cuts in programs
totaling around 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's awaiting the release of final deficit numbers and warning
that they may demand further across-the-board cuts of as much as an
additional 12%. Only a state program subsidizing prescription drugs for
seniors will be exempt from cuts, he has said; while ruling out tax
increases, he has pointedly left schools on the block for cuts.</TE>
<TE>   McCallum aides predict that the response to his proposals is likely to
be the deciding factor in his campaign this year. "The governor has made
it clear to us . . . that this is the election right here," said Tim
Rowby, his communications director. "We have one shot at this . . . and
if it is not handled appropriately, the rest of 2002 is going to be a
long year."</TE>
<TE>   The four Democrats seeking to oppose McCallum, led by state Atty. Gen.
Jim Doyle, have been accusing the governor of mismanaging the state's
finances and waiting too long to issue his plan for closing the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrats may be hamstrung in their ability to draw contrasts
with McCallum because they have shown no inclination to talk about
raising taxes to cover part of the deficit. That means they will be
debating not if, but what, to cut.</TE>
<TE>   This follows the trend nationwide. While high-profile Democratic
challengers such as Andrew Cuomo in New York and Janet Reno in Florida
are accusing incumbent Republican governors of fiscal mismanagement, they
aren't talking about repealing any portion of the large tax cuts those
states approved in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   That has left many Democratic gubernatorial candidates in a position
similar to their counterparts in Congress, who have shied away from a
direct confrontation on President Bush's tax cuts despite the impending
return of federal budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bush, incumbent governors may be able to defend unpopular budget
decisions by pinning them on an economy sent spinning by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. "That may serve as some insulation for incumbents,"
Newhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Further clouding the political effect of the state fiscal squeeze is
the large number of gubernatorial races featuring open seats. Incumbents
are stepping down in 11 seats now held by Republicans and six by
Democrats. Some analysts say it may be tougher for the party out of power
to benefit from unpopular budget decisions if the incumbent who makes
them isn't on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts say the budget woes may actually pose a greater
threat to the party in power in cases where an incumbent is retiring.
Incumbents, they note, can draw on an extended relationship with voters
to blunt any backlash against this year's spending and tax decisions.
Those chosen to succeed popular incumbents must bear the brunt of
discontent over the budget without the benefit of those existing ties--as
McCallum, for one, may discover.</TE>

<HD>Fishermen Wary as Seattle Casts a Wider Revenue Net</HD>
<DH>Economy: Adding private boats at the terminal is a survival issue,
the city says. But others fear the area could become 'one great big
tourist stop.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>Years ago, the Seattle waterfront was a grimy testament to man's
ability to haul a living out of the sea. Fish canneries lined the harbor,
along with cold-storage lockers and loading docks for timber and coal.
Today, they've given way to restaurants, trinket shops, an Imax theater
and an outdoor concert stage.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember fish slime in the street every day," John Garfield, who
fished out of Seattle for much of his life, recalls fondly. "Now, you
don't see a single fishing boat down there. It's just one great big
tourist stop."</LD>
<LD>   The evidence that Seattle remains the headquarters of the North
Pacific Fishing Fleet lies a few miles away at Fishermen's Terminal, the
last major urban commercial fishing port left on the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Its tarred docks, piles of fishing nets and rows of trawlers are a
window into the old Seattle--the workingman's town that was here before
the dot-com explosion, before the mirrored downtown high-rises and
biotech companies, before many of the small boats that sailed out of
Elliott Bay had sunken bathtubs and cocktail bars.</TE>
<TE>   Now, even that corner of the past, it seems, is opening the door to
the new Seattle. The Port Commission last week voted to open the gritty
harbor for the first time to recreational boats, a move many fishermen
fear will propel the terminal toward the same fate as San Francisco's
Fisherman's Wharf and Monterey's Cannery Row.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said today, 'Seattle's becoming a playground for the rich.'
Where's our sense of values here?" complained Peter Knutson, a college
professor and longtime commercial gill-net fisherman.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody hates a class war, and I think in a lot of ways that's what
we have here," added John Foss, head of seafood procurement for a local
food co-op. "We don't want to lose the small family fishermen that tie up
to the . . . wall and provide us with seafood."</TE>
<TE>   Harbor officials emphasize that fishing boats will always have
priority at the 89-year-old terminal, home to about 300 fishing vessels
that ply the North Pacific from Oregon to Alaska's Bering Sea. But the
collapse of the fishing industry over the last 20 years, they say, has
left them with no choice but to consider other customers.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, more than 30% of the slips stand vacant, and without new
sources of revenue, officials say, finding money to maintain and upgrade
fishing facilities will be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it good stewardship to allow one of your facilities to run with a
30% to 40% vacancy rate?" general manager Jim Serrill asked. "My personal
view is it's better to have recreational boats in there and keep the
place viable than it is to have the place not be viable."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the Fishermen's Terminal was full, with a waiting list.
But that was before the collapse of the Pacific salmon runs that fed much
of the Puget Sound fleet. Seattle-based fishermen turned to Alaska, but
even there, many stocks are down, huge industrial trawlers dominate the
market and the price of wild salmon has plummeted with farm-raised fish
flooding the market.</TE>
<TE>   Coho salmon revenue in Washington was $23.6 million in 1987; last
year, it was $1.6 million. The number of commercial salmon fishing
licenses has declined by more than 70% since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen's Terminal remains a major industrial center, generating
5,300 jobs, $246 million in wages and $200 million in purchases even in
recent down years. But with mounting vacancies, the Seattle Port
Authority went from breaking even on the terminal to losing money every
year--as much as $1.6 million in 1995. The port broke even for the first
time this year, only by turning to real estate as a revenue source.</TE>
<TE>   The $250,000 in new revenue that could be generated by bringing in
recreational boats--from small sailboats to luxury yachts--could keep
rates low for fishing boats by shifting costs for $10 million worth of
improvements to pleasure boaters, harbor managers said.</TE>
<TE>   The steady deterioration of the terminal has been a point of friction
for years. Fishermen say rotting docks and poor support services--the
terminal's only large crane began working only this week after nearly a
year of disrepair--is contributing to the high vacancy rate by driving
fishermen to other harbors such as Port Townsend, Bellingham and
Anacortes.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor officials admit that repairs are sorely needed and point out
that recreational boat revenues could help pay for more by providing
leverage to take on new debt. The terminal is midway through a
$38-million repair and upgrade program intended primarily to benefit
commercial fishing vessels.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Port Authority can't find fishing boats to fill the vacant
slips, it may make more sense to tailor some of the new docks for private
boats, Serrill said. "How do you deal with a facility with a decreasing
customer base when we have marketed to the customer base and they still
don't seem to be there?"</TE>
<TE>   For fishermen, the greatest fear is that recreational boat owners will
arrive and begin complaining--about the noisy generators that operate at
all hours of the night, the smell of fish, the welding, the painting; all
the unpleasant facts of life in a working harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start bringing those . . . yachts in here, in a few years
there won't be a single fisherman left on these docks," Garfield said as
he loaded fishing equipment out of an old building once used by fishermen
to drape their nets.</TE>
<TE>   "They did it to the loggers, and now they're doing it to the
fishermen. A guy can't work for himself anymore. We're all supposed to
work for Boeing. Except Boeing's leaving town."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Broxon, a recently laid-off dock worker and former fisherman who
testified before the Port Commission's vote last week, called it "the
yuppification of Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   "Any city that does not support its white-collar work force with a
solid blue-collar work force that is producing something will have its
monument to being a world-class city built on the sand of dot-com [that
is] dot-gone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Once recreational boaters arrive, many fishermen fear, it's only a
small step to new restaurants, espresso stands, retail shops--and
potentially lucrative industrial park development in the upland areas of
the terminal, now devoted to net sheds and marine supply and service
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Commission has vowed it will never succumb to building condos
in the harbor. But they do not rule out other forms of industrial and
business development as long as it does not conflict with the fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Knutson, the gill-netter, is suspicious. "I believe yachts are a red
herring to take people's eyes off the real prize: land."</TE>
<TE>   "They can say this is just paranoia, but all anybody has to do is
drive around Seattle and see the real estate market is driving the
transformation of the city. It's a land grab."</TE>

<HD>Skydivers Unbowed by Recent Deaths</HD>
<DH>Risk: Aficionados defend hobby, downplay danger despite October
mishaps at Chicago-area club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRANDON LOOMIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>One day in October, six members of a skydiving team were gliding
toward a normal landing on a typical practice jump when they heard the
yell.</LD>
<LD>   Above them, two members of the team had become entangled. Their
canopies collapsed and the pair plunged to the ground with no time to
trip their backup parachutes.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a week later, witnesses watched helplessly as another
veteran skydiver spun out of control, deploying his backup chute too late
to soften the fatal fall.</LD>
<TE>   It was the fourth death of 2001--the 11th since 1993--at the Skydive
Chicago club, located amid farm fields 70 miles southwest of the city.
That accident rate prompted an inquiry from the sport's sanctioning body,
the U. S. Parachute Assn., and questions from LaSalle County officials
who would like to see more regulation.</TE>
<TE>   But skydiving veterans say what's happened at Skydive Chicago amounts
to bad luck--a reminder of the risks they're willing to take doing what
they love.</TE>
<TE>   "It's human flight. It's the dream you want to fulfill as a kid," said
Donovan Bartlett, 29, an instructor at Skydive Chicago. "It's about the
most freeing experience you can have."</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett was engaged to 27-year-old Deborah Luhmann of Ottawa, who
died along with 44-year-old Steven Smith of Ohio, Ill., when they became
tangled in midair during the Oct. 6 team practice.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's detective testified at a coroner's inquest that witnesses
could only see one skydiver because Smith and Luhmann were so
intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure exactly what happened. The victims were careful divers,
according to their friends, and toxicology tests showed that they were
sober. The deaths were ruled accidental.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no different than [a driver] making a decision at an
intersection and slamming into her," Peggy Denz, Luhmann's mother, said
after the inquest. "Somebody made a decision and she's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Denz said that her whole family likes to go skydiving and that the
sport isn't to blame. Bartlett was jumping again a week after the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But even as he was getting back into the air Oct. 14, there was
another tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said 38-year-old Bruce Greig, a club regular, inexplicably
began spiraling out of control during his jump. He had plenty of time
while spinning to ditch the parachute and deploy his backup, but didn't
until it was too late, according to interviews detailed at the coroner's
inquest.</TE>
<TE>   Coroner Jody Bernard said a toxicology test found the drug Ecstasy in
Greig's system, although there is no standard for determining at what
level it could be an impairment. Traces of marijuana and cocaine were
also found, she said, but at levels indicating that he was not impaired
by them during the accident. His death was ruled accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Skydive Chicago owner Roger Nelson declined repeated requests for an
interview with the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   But on Oct. 15, the club's Web site carried the following note on
Greig's death, ostensibly written by Nelson: "Tragedy struck all of us
again as Bruce Greig--Muskrat--died after a low cut-away. . . . What is
known is that Bruce was observed spinning for quite awhile and [discarded
his primary parachute] between 150 and 250 feet. Our minds are at a loss
for words as our hearts have yet to heal."</TE>
<TE>   There are roughly 30 skydiving deaths a year in this country,
according to the U. S. Parachute Assn. Considering Americans make more
than 3 million jumps a year, the risk of death is about 1 in 110,000.</TE>
<TE>   By that standard, Skydive Chicago's four deaths make for a bad year:
The coroner reports that there are about 75,000 jumps a year with the
club, one of the largest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The parachute association has some oversight--it inquires about deaths
and can withdraw its sanction. Gary Peek, the group's central region
director, talked to Nelson after the last death. The skydivers were
experienced--not newcomers who put themselves entirely in Nelson's hands.
Peek concluded that there was nothing amiss at the club.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to remind ourselves that it's a potentially dangerous
sport, but we also remind ourselves that there are much gorier things on
the highway," Peek said. "There's lots of ways to die."</TE>
<TE>   But with more people falling from the sky than falling prey to
murderers in rural LaSalle County, some authorities are frustrated at
what they consider a lack of oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a very regulated sport," said LaSalle County State's Atty.
Joe Hettel, who examined the cases and concluded that there was nothing
he could do. "If this is going to be something that people make money on,
I think the government should be more involved in safety."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration regulates skydiving. It designates
drop zones, inspects planes and requires that an FAA-licensed rigger pack
the reserve parachute. But the agency's responsibility appears to end
there.</TE>
<TE>   Hettel approached state Sen. Patrick Welch, who represents LaSalle
County. Welch was concerned enough--his own son had scheduled and backed
out of a jump at Skydive Chicago after the deaths--but he found no
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if you're jumping out of a plane, you have to know there's
a lot of risk," Welch said. "I haven't seen any legislation in other
states that would help this problem."</TE>
<TE>   Other skydivers are not deterred by the deaths. They say their motto
is, "There is nothing to be feared, only understood."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel less safe. It's a personal responsibility thing," said
Ken Adams of Hinckley. "I take care of my own gear. If you're going to do
something like this, you have to learn about it. You have to take
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Adams jumps at Skydive Illinois, located down the road from Ottawa at
a tiny airstrip in Morris. Regular skydivers there say they stay away
from Skydive Chicago, a busy organization where hundreds might jump on
any weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At the smaller club one recent Saturday, there were only a dozen
skydivers, all on a first-name basis.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to trust them," said 35-year-old Troy Church, explaining why
he jumps at Morris with people he knows. "But you also have to be very
defensive. I'm always looking around. Who's next to me? Where are they
going?"</TE>
<TE>   Adams, 38, and others say that's why they shy away from crowds, where
strangers could be high on Ecstasy or try twirls and stunts too close to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to preserve his sport's emphasis on self-reliance and fears
more regulation could hamper the freedom he craves.</TE>
<TE>   "The leniency allowed is probably a good thing," Adams said. "But I
don't know."</TE>

<HD>Midyear College Tuition Hikes Raising Eyebrows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ SIDOTI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Students at some public universities are finding bigger bills
awaiting them after winter break: Their schools took the rare step of
raising tuition in midyear to offset state funding cuts.</LD>
<LD>   For Jason Roudebush, a senior at Kent State University, that will mean
shelling out an extra $138 and working more at the campus ice arena where
he drives the Zamboni, cleans locker rooms and fixes bleachers.</LD>
<LD>   "In the beginning of the year, I just kind of expected to pay more,"
said Roudebush, 23, who pays for school through loans and income from his
maintenance job. "But when they jacked it up in the middle of the year,
it was surprising. I didn't plan for it."</LD>
<TE>   Last summer, schools throughout the country approved tuition increases
for the entire academic year in anticipation of state budget cuts.
Public, four-year institutions increased tuition by an average of 7.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Midyear increases last occurred in the early 1990s and generally are a
last resort after schools have trimmed departmental programs, limited
travel and frozen hiring, said Travis Reindl, director of state policy
for the American Assn. of State Colleges and Universities.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can't just nip and tuck on the edges to remedy $1
billion shortfalls in state budgets," Reindl said. "Tuition is an escape
valve for lawmakers. It's a user charge and people are going to pay it
because they're used to paying it."</TE>
<TE>   Five of Ohio's 13 public, four-year universities--Kent State, the
University of Akron, the University of Cincinnati, Cleveland State
University and Youngstown State University--increased tuition as much as
6% for this semester. Schools in Missouri, South Carolina and
Massachusetts also are raising the cost of attending school.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio increases came after Gov. Robert A. Taft and state lawmakers
cut higher education funding by 6%, or $121 million, to help balance a
$1.5-billion state budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio schools had already raised tuition last summer for the entire
academic year by an average of 7.1%. The new hikes came on top of those
increases.</TE>
<TE>   At least four Missouri universities also raised tuition for this
semester because the higher education budget was cut 10%, or $95 million.
In-state undergraduates at Southwest Missouri State University, which
lost $4 million in state aid, will pay about $90 more this semester, or
$1,755.</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina, at least three schools that already had increased
tuition more than 5% for the academic year raised tuition again for this
semester by about 4%.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Massachusetts also increased tuition, but the 7.8%
increase is the first this academic year.</TE>
<TE>   Students at four Massachusetts state campuses must pay an average of
$366 dollars more this semester to help make up half the $19 million the
university lost in state funding. The increase will take effect at a
fifth campus next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the increase, UMass is still a bargain," said university
spokesman John Hoey in Amherst, Mass. "We've done everything possible to
hold the line on costs for the past six years, so our costs still are not
as high as other universities."</TE>
<TE>   The midyear increases hurt low-income, minority and first-generation
college students who already were scraping by to pay last summer's
increases, said Corye Barbour, legislative director for the United States
Student Assn., a national coalition of student governments.</TE>
<TE>   "The students who can will pay, the students who can't will drop out,"
Barbour said.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>A city councilman who drove without a license for 25 years had his
new driver's license suspended for six months.</LD>
<LD>   Angel Ortiz, 60, was convicted Friday of two of seven citations for
driving without a license, and paid a $550 fine. He faced a maximum of
three years in prison if convicted on all seven citations.</LD>
<LD>   "I stand on my record. My record either survives or not," Ortiz said.
"It's up to the people."</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz has had a city car since he became records commissioner in 1984.
He has served on the City Council since the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   After he was confronted by a TV news crew, Ortiz admitted never
getting a Pennsylvania license after moving from New York in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Ortiz questioned the use of a news video to prosecute the
case, noting that Ortiz was never stopped by police for driving without a
license. Police mailed the summons Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no authority by the cameraman to issue a ticket," said
lawyer Obra Kernodle.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Ortiz paid more than $3,000 to settle 53 unpaid parking
tickets. He also got the new license that was suspended Friday.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Shift Clouds Arms Deal</HD>
<DH>Defense: Decision to store, rather than destroy, warheads
undermines hopes for an accord with Russia. Any pact must be
'irreversible,' a Kremlin official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Hopes for a new U.S.-Russian arms deal have been suddenly clouded
by an American decision to store, rather than destroy, some of the
thousands of warheads Washington plans to withdraw from active
deployment, U.S. and Russian officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Even as negotiators prepared to begin work on an agreement, the
Pentagon disclosed in a major report on nuclear forces last week that it
wants to hold on to the weapons as a hedge against new threats to U.S.
security. Defense officials said that in light of the world's
uncertainties and dangers, they need to be able to rebuild U.S. nuclear
forces in a relatively short time.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush began promising during the 2000 presidential campaign
that he intended to move past the United States' dangerous Cold War
relationship with Russia, in which each side maintained thousands of
warheads to deter the other from nuclear attack. He said he planned to
"leave the Cold War behind" and late last year announced with fanfare
plans to unilaterally reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal of deployed
warheads from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200.</LD>
<TE>   But Russian officials have pointed out that a new arms deal would have
little meaning if the warheads taken off submarines, missiles and bombers
could be redeployed in weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   Any deal must be "irreversible, so that strategic defensive arms will
be reduced not [just] on paper," Alexander Yakovenko, a spokesman for the
Russian Foreign Ministry, said last week.</TE>
<TE>   A Pentagon official, J. D. Crouch, insisted that though some of the
warheads will not be destroyed, their decommissioning will have a "very
positive benefit" because it will mean that fewer weapons will be armed
and available for use in a crisis. And he said he believed that the
Russians "will be doing a very similar thing."</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official who asked to remain unidentified said the
American side hopes to work out a written agreement in the latest talks,
which are scheduled to begin in Washington this week. The official said
the American side intends to find a solution that will be verifiable and
"transparent" to Russian negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   But nuclear arms analysts in both countries say the U.S. move has made
it far less likely that the Russians will be offered the kind of terms
they can accept.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have made clear that they would prefer
to have no treaty agreement, lest it limit their options. The president
has agreed at Russia's urging to try to work out some kind of written
document to codify the arms reduction plan he and Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin reached in an oral agreement in November.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say the Russians may have a hard time acceding to any
deal knowing that the Americans will continue to have an uncertain number
of warheads in storage. There are believed to be several thousand U.S.
warheads already stockpiled.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of the warheads may also make it less likely that the
Russians will agree to further unilateral reductions in their arsenal, as
the Americans have hoped, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. retains more missiles, so will Russia," predicted Charles
Pena, a defense analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank in
Washington. "And the Chinese will likely view the entire U.S. strategic
arsenal, not just deployed weapons, as a threat and act accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   He called the move "an accounting sleight of hand, bad arms control
and bad policy."</TE>
<TE>   Pena also argued that if the Russians follow the U.S. model and put
their warheads in stockpiles, the weapons may be unsafe. Hence, "taking
the U.S. weapons off operational deployment without destroying them could
possibly lessen U.S. security rather than enhancing it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predict that the U.S. move could also cause the Russian
military to increase pressure on Putin to take a tougher line against the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian military leadership has been strongly behind Putin, even
though he raised only mild objections in December when U.S. officials
announced their plans to abrogate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty sought to block a further buildup of missiles by barring
the two countries from deploying national antimissile systems.</TE>
<TE>   The American decision to keep its warheads in stockpiles rather than
destroy them comes after a year in which the Bush administration has
drastically reshaped strategic security policy.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have announced that they intend to leave or ignore arms
control treaties and proposals that they believe bind the United States
while allowing other countries to cheat.</TE>
<TE>   They have announced plans to build a multibillion-dollar antimissile
defense system even as they insist on preserving their option to rebuild
an offensive arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said in last week's nuclear review that although they
intend to continue to observe the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing,
they want to reduce the time it would take to prepare a test if they
decided to end the 10-year-old moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   They have also left open the possibility that they might seek to
develop a new kind of "penetrator" nuclear bomb that could be used to
destroy the deeply buried bunkers that more and more countries are
building as a defense against U.S. air power.</TE>

<HD>Bush Puts Food, Jobs in Budget</HD>
<DH>Spending: President, mindful of his father's misstep, says he'll
seek more money for food and Job Corps programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Saturday that his budget will propose funding
increases for popular nutrition and job-training programs, likely
exceptions in a fiscal plan that will see a return to federal deficits.</LD>
<LD>   The budget will call for an additional $364 million for the
$4.3-billion Women, Infants and Children nutrition program and $73
million more for the Job Corps, currently funded at $1.5 billion, the
president said in his weekly radio address.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's budget of more than $2 trillion for the 2003 fiscal year will
be presented to Congress on Feb. 4.</LD>
<TE>   Such social welfare programs are not usually a priority for
Republicans. Indeed, Bush emphasized that defense, homeland security and
a renewed debate over tax cuts to spur the economy remain his leading
concerns. But he is also trying to avoid the political misfortunes that
befell his father, who as president was labeled as insensitive to the
plight of Americans in an economic downturn and lost his reelection bid
in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "My budget focuses on the pressing needs of our country and on the
basic needs of our citizens," Bush said in his Saturday speech. "I am
committed to building a strong economy that spreads its benefits to
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   In the Democratic response, Rep. Mike Ross (D-Ark.) said GOP
priorities are tilted toward "big corporations and special interests" and
called on Bush to "find common ground" on domestic policy as he has in
the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are pressing for more generous benefits for laid-off
workers--including help in paying for health insurance. And they favor
more modest tax cuts, aimed at middle- and low-income workers.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, Bush began preparing the public for a red-ink budget on
the heels of several years of surpluses. "We had a national emergency,
we're trying to win a war and we're in a recession. . . . We may not
balance the budget for this year," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee has projected that
the 2003 deficit will be at least $43 billion. The analysis also forecast
a $3-billion deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are increasingly blaming the vanishing surplus on Bush's
10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut passed in May. In a speech scheduled for
Wednesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is expected to raise the
stakes in the debate by calling for suspending parts of the tax cut law
that benefit upper-income individuals, according to a source familiar
with Kennedy's plans.</TE>
<TE>   Other Democratic congressional leaders so far have resisted proposing
such changes, even as they have increased criticism of the tax cut's
effect on the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The two programs cited by Bush in his radio address enjoy a rare level
of bipartisan support. WIC provides food, health screenings and other
services to low-income pregnant women, new mothers and their children
under age 5. In August, nearly 7.5 million people were receiving benefits
through the program. Bush said the additional funds would allow WIC to
serve 8 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Job Corps is a training program for low-income teenagers and young
adults, with most of its clients coming from urban centers and rural
areas. Trainees live away from home and receive classroom and on-the-job
instruction. Job Corps has trained nearly 2 million people since it was
started in the 1960s and has a solid track record with many employers.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Associated Press, White House Budget Director
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. said the administration estimates the 2003 budget
deficit at less than $100 billion, but he didn't give a specific figure.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels said the budget will call for significant increases in
military and domestic security spending. The $15-billion increase in
domestic security would double such spending in this year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the homeland security spending will go to a new Transportation
Security Administration, which will employ more than 30,000 people and
have responsibility for air, seaport, rail and roadway counter-terrorism
efforts. Bush also will call for higher funding levels for law
enforcement agencies and public health programs.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Bush is expected to propose a 3.4% spending increase for
defense and most domestic programs, meaning that some agencies will have
to absorb sharp cuts to make room for the spending increases. However,
benefits for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are set by law and
not subject to annual funding decisions.</TE>
<TE>   With bad news such as Ford Motor Co.'s announcement Friday that it
will cut 35,000 jobs still looming over prospects for an economic
recovery, Bush has been seeking to steer his focus on economic policy. On
Monday, he will begin a three-day swing from Illinois to New Orleans to
tout his free-trade proposals as a way to create jobs.</TE>

<HD>Warming Trend Seen for Northeast</HD>
<DH>Environment: Report commissioned by Congress predicts the region's
temperatures will rise at least 6 to 9 degrees in this century.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL POWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>New England's maple trees stop producing sap. The Long Island and
Cape Cod beaches shrink, shift and disappear in places. Cases of
heatstroke triple.</LD>
<LD>   And every 10 years or so, a winter storm floods portions of Lower
Manhattan, Jersey City and Coney Island with seawater.</LD>
<LD>   The Northeast of recent historical memory could disappear this
century, replaced by a hotter and more flood-prone region where New York
could have the climate of Miami, and Boston could become as sticky as
Atlanta, according to the first comprehensive federal studies of the
possible effects of global warming on the Northeast.</LD>
<TE>   "In the most optimistic projection, we still end up with a six- to
nine-degree increase in temperature," said George Hurtt, a University of
New Hampshire scientist and co-author of the study on the New England
region. "That's the greatest increase in temperature at any time since
the last Ice Age."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioned by Congress, the separate reports on New England and the
New York region explore how global warming could affect the coastline,
economy and public health of the Northeast. The language is often
technical, the projections reliant on middle-of-the-road and sometimes
contradictory predictive models.</TE>
<TE>   But the predictions are arresting.</TE>
<TE>   New England, where the regional character was forged by cold and long,
dark winters, could face a balmy future that within 30 to 40 years could
result in increased crop production but also destroy prominent native
tree species.</TE>
<TE>   "The brilliant reds, oranges and yellows of the maples, birches and
beeches may be replaced by the browns and dull greens of oaks," the New
England report concludes. Within 20 years, it says, "the changes in
climate could potentially extirpate the sugar maple industry in New
England."</TE>
<TE>   The reports' origins date to 1990, when Congress passed the Global
Change Research Act. Seven years later, the Environmental Protection
Agency appointed 16 regional panels to examine global warming, and how
the nation might adapt. These Northeast reports, completed last fall, are
among the last to be released.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists on the panels employed conventional assumptions, such
as an annual 1% increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They
conclude that global warming is already occurring, noting that, on
average, the Northeast became 2 degrees warmer in the last century. And
they say that the temperature rise in the 21st century "will be
significantly larger than in the 20th century." One widely used climate
model cited in the report predicted a 6-degree increase, the other 10
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency summarizes the findings on its Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing regional climate could alter forests, crop yields, and water
supplies," the EPA states. "It could also threaten human health, and harm
birds, fish, and many types of ecosystems."</TE>
<TE>   Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn is more skeptical. He agrees that
mild global warming seems likely to continue--but argues that a slightly
hotter climate will make the U.S. economy in general, and the Northeast
in particular, more rather than less productive. A greater risk comes
from spending billions of dollars to slow emissions of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the extreme scenarios, the northern United States benefits
from global warming," said Mendelsohn, editor of the forthcoming "Global
Warming and the American Economy." "To have New England lead the battle
against global warming would be deeply ironic, because it will be
beneficial to our climate and economy."</TE>
<TE>   The scientists on the Northeastern panels estimated that Americans
have a grace period of a decade or two, during which the nation can adapt
before global warming accelerates.</TE>
<TE>   "We will face an increasingly hazardous local environment in this
century," said William Solecki, a professor of geography at Montclair
State University in New Jersey and a co-author of the climate change
report covering the New York metropolitan region. "We're in transition
right now to something entirely new and uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, global warming could change flora and fauna, and
perhaps the culture itself.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a century ago, the report notes, ice melts a week
earlier on northern lakes. Ticks carrying Lyme disease range north of
what scientists once assumed was their natural habitat. Moist, warm
winters have led to large populations of mosquitoes, with an accompanying
risk of encephalitis and even malaria.</TE>
<TE>   "The present warming trend has led to another growing health problem,"
the report states, "in the incidence of red tides, fish kills and
bacterial contamination."</TE>
<TE>   Hot, dry summer months, the report continues, "are ideal for
converting automobile exhaust . . . into ozone." Because winds flow west
to east, New England already serves as something of a tailpipe for the
nation. The report notes that a study of ozone pollution and lung
capacity found that hikers on Mt. Washington, New Hampshire's highest
peak, ended their treks in worse condition than when they started.</TE>
<TE>   These findings are not definitive. Rising temperatures could
exacerbate the effects of harmful ozone--but antipollution laws are also
cutting emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a little tendency to be alarmist in global warming studies,"
said Patrick Kinney of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia
University. "We could keep ozone in check."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>New York City, the nation's densest urban center, is armored with
heat-retaining concrete and stone, and so its median temperature hovers
five to six degrees above the regional norm. The city, a New York report
on global warming predicts, will grow warmer still. Within 70 years, New
York will have as many 90-degree days a year as Miami does now.</LD>
<LD>   If temperatures and ozone levels rise, the report says, the poor, the
elderly and the young--especially those in crowded, poorly ventilated
buildings--could suffer more heatstroke and asthma.</LD>
<LD>   But such problems might have relatively inexpensive solutions, from
subsidizing the purchase of air conditioners to planting trees and
painting roofs light colors to reflect heat.</LD>
<TE>   "The experience of southern cities is that you can cut deaths and
adapt rather easily," said Patrick Kinney of the Mailman School of Public
Health at Columbia University, who co-authored the federal report on the
possible effects of global warming on the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Rising ocean waters present a more complicated threat. The seas around
New York have risen 15 to 18 inches in the last century, and scientists
forecast that by 2050, waters could rise an additional 10 to 20 inches.</TE>
<TE>   By 2080, storms with 25-foot surges could hit New York every three or
four years, inundating the Hudson River tunnels and flooding the edges of
the financial district, causing billions of dollars in damage.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly is untenable," said Klaus Jacob, a senior research
scientist with Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,
who worked on the New York report and is an expert on disaster and urban
infrastructure. "A world-class city cannot afford to be exposed to such a
threat so often."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob recommends constructing dikes and reinforced seawalls in lower
Manhattan, and new construction standards for the lower floors of
offices.</TE>

<LD>Former Clinton administration Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
entered the gubernatorial race Saturday, pledging to end political
gridlock caused by eight years of conflict between a Republican governor

<LD>   "All too often the answer from Santa Fe has been gridlock, bickering
and no to initiatives that help people. That way has failed," Richardson
said in the state capital.</LD>
<TE>   New Mexico has the nation's highest rates of poverty and uninsured

<HD>Prison Guards' Trial in Inmate Death to Begin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STARKE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Frank Valdes could have left prison a young man, but he killed a
guard and wound up on death row. Now a jury will decide if four other
guards beat him to death.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say Valdes was killed to keep him from telling the media
about beatings and mistreatment of other inmates.</LD>
<LD>   Valdes was found lifeless in his cell on July 17, 1999, with 22 broken
ribs, partial boot prints on his stomach and neck and fractures of his
sternum, vertebrae, nose and jaw, among other serious internal injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Opening statements in the case begin Monday, after almost three months
of jury selection in this town where the prison is a major employer.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers say that the Florida State Prison guards didn't know
about Valdes' plan to talk to reporters and that he inflicted the
injuries himself by throwing himself from his bunk onto the bars and
concrete floor of his solitary cell.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes entered the Florida prison system when he was 17 to serve a
three-year sentence for burglary. Before his term was up, he was
sentenced to death for the shooting death of prison guard Fred Griffis
while attempting to help a fellow inmate escape in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Diagnosed with latent schizophrenia, Valdes was an uncooperative and
violent inmate; files show he once pulled a homemade knife on a guard,
punched an officer in the nose on another occasion and was known to
scream profanities and racist slurs at guards.</TE>
<TE>   He spent his last two years and three months in the prison's
disciplinary wing, the same place where he was found dead at age 36.</TE>
<TE>   Former corrections officers Timothy Thornton, 36, Charles Brown, 28,
Jason Griffis, 28, and Andrew Lewis, 31, were arrested and charged with
second-degree murder and aggravated battery. If convicted, they face life
in prison. All four were fired.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent hearing, inmate Robert Krebs, 64, who worked in the
prison's law library, testified that Valdes was trying to get guards to
stop beating five inmates who had been transferred after a fight at
another facility that caused a guard to have a miscarriage.</TE>
<TE>   Krebs said Valdes feared for his life for standing up to the guards.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he would never live to be executed," Krebs said.</TE>

<HD>Enron Chief Misled Employees, Waxman Says</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Kenneth Lay's e-mails painted a bright future for the
firm, even as its stock was faltering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Key congressional investigators charged Saturday that Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay misled his 21,000 employees late last summer when
he gave them a rosy picture of the company's financial health, even as
the giant energy conglomerate was sliding toward financial ruin.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, the ranking Democrat on the House
Committee on Government Reform, released copies of e-mails sent by Lay to
employees in August that suggested all was well with the company and that
its stock would rebound.</LD>
<LD>   But Waxman said Lay must have known then that Enron was falling into
deep financial trouble.</LD>
<TE>   The e-mails were sent as Enron shares tumbled in the wake of Jeffrey
Skilling's abrupt Aug. 14 resignation as company president.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron
was prospering and that its stock price would rise," Waxman said in a
letter to Lay, asking him to respond by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated calls seeking comment from officials at Enron's headquarters
in Houston went unanswered Saturday. But Enron spokesman Mark Palmer told
Associated Press that the company was on solid footing when Lay sent the
e-mails and that its financial problems did not become clear until later.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Lay was telling the truth," Palmer said. "We had had 21
consecutive quarters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive
quarters of volume growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in
better shape."</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 14 e-mail, Lay told employees "that I have never felt
better about the prospects for the company."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, on Aug. 27, an e-mail advised employees that his work
to shore up investor confidence in the company likely would "result in a
significantly higher stock price."</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Saturday, two Republican House leaders, Reps.
W.J. "Billy" Tauzin of Louisiana and James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania,
called on Enron accounting firm Andersen to turn over additional records
to congressional investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, the Chicago-based company disclosed that from
September to November it had destroyed thousands of documents involving
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin and Greenwood asserted in a letter to Andersen that the
documents were "knowingly destroyed" and said they did not want to risk
the loss of any other paperwork. They gave the company until Monday to
produce some documents and until Friday for others.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said, "We are committed to being
forthright and doing the right thing in this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based watchdog
group that studies political fund-raising, said a review of federal
disclosure forms shows that 14 of the Bush administration's top 100
officials owned Enron stock. Based on the disclosure forms, in which
officials provide an estimated range of their assets' values, the Enron
holdings by the administration officials were worth between $284,000 and
$886,000.</TE>
<TE>Bush Officials Were Shareholders</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials who owned stock included Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld; Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political advisor; and Peter
Fisher, an assistant Treasury secretary. It was disclosed Friday that a
top Enron executive called Fisher several times in the fall asking him to
help the company secure a bank loan. White House officials say Fisher did
not intervene in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Lay has been a friend of Bush, and he and other Enron executives have
contributed about $550,000 to the president's political endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron officials have been generous to Democrats as well,
contributing to Al Gore, Bush's opponent in the 2000 presidential
campaign, and to more than half the 50 Democrats in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials have acknowledged that, during the latter part of last
year, they were desperately trying to save the company from the
bankruptcy filing that occurred in December. As a result of the company's
collapse, thousands of families who owned Enron stock lost money.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, new details emerged about company executives, including
Lay, seeking help from Bush administration officials to stave off the
company's demise. Those contacted included Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans; both have said they took no
action to help Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails offer a glimpse into the inside world of Enron at a time
when its financial problems were growing but before company executives
turned to O'Neill and Evans for help.</TE>
<TE>   Though he cited personal reasons for leaving the company, Skilling's
departure Aug. 14 triggered a battering of Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the
prospects for the company," Lay's e-mail read that day.</TE>
<TE>   "All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over
the last few months. One of my top priorities will be to restore a
significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   He added that "our performance has never been stronger; our business
model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the finest organization in American business today."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 27, Lay sent another e-mail to employees, who received a grant
of stock options, and told them that "one of my highest priorities is to
restore investor confidence in Enron."</TE>
<TE>   He added that his efforts "should result in a significantly higher
stock price."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, in his letter to Lay about the e-mails, noted that, by the
time of the second computer message, the stock price was at $37 a share,
down from a high the previous August of $90.56.</TE>
<TE>   "You had already sold $40 million of Enron stock during 2001 and over
$100 million since October 1998," Waxman told Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Enron stock hit a low of 26 cents a share Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>As Stock Fell, So Did Severance</TE>
<TE>   Waxman further noted that, while the company stock was plummeting, Lay
sought a $60-million severance package for himself. When employees
objected, Waxman said, "you proposed reducing your package to $40
million."</TE>
<TE>   And when Enron employees again objected, Lay decided in mid-November
not to accept the severance package compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said he was bothered that Lay told his employees everything was
fine, but less than two months later he was telling Bush officials in
Washington that the company urgently needed help to prevent a bankruptcy
filing.</TE>
<TE>   "At a minimum," Waxman said, the statements by Lay "create the
appearance that you misled Enron employees about the value of their
investments in Enron and the security of their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were accurate, it would be a gross betrayal of your
employees' trust, as well as possibly illegal conduct."</TE>

<HD>Young Athletes Risk Back Injury, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Exercise by young athletes--especially by those who train in one
sport--can cause stress fractures of the back, doctors say.</LD>
<LD>   Spondylolysis, often-painful tiny cracks in spinal bones, may account
for almost half of low back pain cases among active teenagers who seek
medical attention for their pain, according to a report in the January
issue of the medical journal The Physician and Sports Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   And spondylolysis is more common than doctors visits indicate, the
article said. Teens "often cope with the condition by hoping it will just
go away," the journal reported.</LD>
<TE>   In many cases, it does go away, or teens play despite the pain. But
treatment can reduce the pain and possibly head off a recurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Spondylolysis typically happens to young athletes who specialize early
in a sport such as gymnastics that can require the athletes to repeatedly
bend far backward, putting pressure on bones in the lower spine, said Dr.
James L. Moeller. Chairman of sports medicine at William Beaumont
Hospital in Troy, Mich., Moeller was co-author of the journal article.</TE>
<TE>   Risk of injury rises with the level of competition and time spent in a
sport, Moeller said. The risk is greater in college or pro activity than
in middle or high schools, he said, but young athletes who specialize
early in one sport face similar dangers.</TE>
<TE>   It would be better if kids varied their sports while they were young,
and didn't decide on a favorite until they were in their early teens,
Moeller said. This would reduce the risk of overuse injury, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Young athletes also can reduce their risk by strengthening muscles in
the abdomen, as well as hip flexors and other muscles that support the
back, Moeller said. Typically, however, coaches prefer to focus their
limited training time on muscles needed for the sport instead of on
prevention of injury, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they work on this prior to any problems, they might be
able to avoid the problems altogether," Moeller said.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors look for the condition by having the patient bend backward. If
it hurts, that's a sign of spondylolysis. The tiny cracks also can show
up on X-rays, but more sophisticated imaging may be needed to make a
diagnosis, the journal article said.</TE>
<TE>   The cracks can heal in two ways--the bone fuses back together, or a
softer material called collagen fills in the crack. Collagen self-repair
is less stable, however, and increases the possibility of a recurrence of
spondylolysis, said Dr. John Sarwark, a professor of orthopedic surgery
at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors treat the condition with painkillers, a back brace to
stabilize the area of the spine affected, and time away from physical
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "If we got the kids early and brace right away, most go back to all
activity in two months," Sarwark said. "Kids we got later--after six
months or more of symptoms--took longer."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the later cases had to wait as long as year to play without
pain, said Sarwark, who reported on injuries in 2000 in the Journal of
Pediatric Orthopedics.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors differ in their opinions on when young athletes are fit to
play. Sarwark allows children to play while wearing the brace, as long as
the pain is manageable. Moeller prohibits play until the brace is
removed.</TE>
<TE>   However, the doctors agree that spondylolysis is highly treatable and
that few cases go on to require surgery.</TE>

<HD>White Supremacists' Rally Sparks Clashes</HD>
<DH>Race: Group holds its event in York, Pa., scene of continuing
racial tension. Police keep protesters away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>Witnesses reported minor confrontations in the streets Saturday as
police kept hundreds of demonstrators at bay during a rally by white
supremacists in a city still feeling the effects of deadly race riots
more than 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Hale, leader of the white supremacist group World Church of
the Creator, spoke to about 70 supporters inside a library while police
officers in riot gear, some on horseback, separated shouting groups of
his supporters and anti-racist protesters.</LD>
<LD>   "We seek the advancement of white people, our people, without any
apologies, any compromise, any groveling before anybody," Hale told
supporters and spectators inside the library.</LD>
<TE>   Marion Kinard, 31, of York, said he attended the speech with his two
sons, ages 4 and 6, to teach them about racism.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my children to know that they're teaching it to their
children," said Kinard, who is black.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported seeing car windows broken and minor confrontations
in the streets throughout the afternoon. Witnesses reported a clash
between the two sides before Hale arrived, although police did not
confirm it.</TE>
<TE>   State, city and federal authorities provided security, which included
blocking off several streets around the library where Hale made his
speech. They also frisked people in the crowd for weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Police said 25 people were arrested, most for disorderly conduct, and
several guns were confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Hale was whisked away in an unmarked police van.</TE>
<TE>   Hale was supported by Rob Griffin, 27, who said he heads the Peabody,
Mass., chapter of the World Church of the Creator. He said he wasn't
afraid of the protesters and didn't mind all the police.</TE>
<TE>   Most Hale supporters attending the speech did not wish to give their
full names or hometowns.</TE>
<TE>   Hale's group has been accused of helping hone the racist beliefs of a
man who went on a shooting rampage in 1999. The gunman, Benjamin Smith,
killed two people and wounded nine in Illinois and Indiana before taking
his own life. All the victims were Jewish, black or of Asian descent.</TE>
<TE>   Two Hale appearances in Illinois in 2000 ended in violence, with
people arrested after each melee.</TE>
<TE>   York was the scene of riots in July 1969 after a black teenager was
wounded by a white man. A police officer was killed on the second night
of the violence while he rode in an armored car. Four days later, a black
woman was slain by shots fired from a white mob as she and her family
drove to a grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, nine white men, including Mayor Charlie Robertson, were
charged with the murder of the black woman. Two black men were arrested
in October and accused of killing the police officer. Robertson dropped a
reelection bid and is awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   Hale has said he picked York, a racially mixed town of 41,000 in
south-central Pennsylvania, for his appearance because of its high
profile in race relations and because Pennsylvania has been a hotbed of
racial division.</TE>
<TE>   The library conference room was reserved in November by Michael Cook,
director of the World Church's York-area chapter, who told the library
that his "church" would be meeting there, officials said. It was only
this month that library officials learned that the church was a white
supremacist group.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials concluded that canceling the event would not hold up
to a legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Ray Crenshaw stayed a few blocks from the
library and said he tried to ignore the demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying my best to act as if it's not happening, because it's a
disgrace," said Crenshaw, who is black.</TE>
<TE>   He said he realized the protesters have a constitutional right to
demonstrate but believed their racist comments infringed on the rights of
others.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have let them in here in the first place," Crenshaw said.
"You have young kids who are scared to death."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A New York real estate heir charged with the dismemberment murder
of a 71-year-old neighbor in Galveston doesn't plan to fight extradition
because he wants to return to Texas, his attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Durst is scheduled to appear in court in Northampton County,
Pa., on Jan. 25 and is expected to waive his right to an extradition
hearing.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Durst wants to come back to Texas. He's not guilty of murder, and
he wants a trial," Houston lawyer Dick DeGuerin said.</LD>
<TE>   Durst has been jailed without bail in Pennsylvania since his Nov. 30
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Galveston killing, investigators want to question Durst in
the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen, and the Christmas Eve
2000 slaying of one of his friends, Los Angeles writer Susan Berman.</TE>

<LD>Nevada's teen pregnancy rate continues to drop, and state health

<LD>   The teen pregnancy rate in 2000 was 43.2 births per 1,000 girls ages
15 to 17. The year before, it was 48 per 1,000 girls, according to the

<TE>   The most recent statistics from the federal Centers for Disease

<HD>Now, a Down-to-Earth Approach to the Stars</HD>
<DH>Astrology: School offers diplomas for students, who learn to write
horoscopes and offer advice based on position of celestial bodies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>For 10 years, Dave Campbell worked as an astrologer, ran an
astrology bookstore and nurtured a flourishing business giving private
readings. Things seemed great, but something was missing.</LD>
<LD>   Legitimacy.</LD>
<LD>   "People will ask, 'Where did you get your training, where did you get
your education?' " Campbell said. "People ask serious questions and they
want to work with someone who is properly trained. I got tired of not
being able to show them my diploma."</LD>
<TE>   Soon he can. Campbell is enrolled at the Astrology Institute, the
country's first nationally accredited school of astrology.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked into two classrooms at the back of a former elementary school
in this suburban enclave, the institute is teaching students how to write
horoscopes and give financial, business and relationship advice based on
the position of celestial bodies. By the start of its school term in
April, the institute should be certified to offer federal financial aid
and grants to a budding crop of advice-givers. That, the U.S. Department
of Education says, would be a first in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Astrologers study the position of planets, moons and even asteroids,
believing their movements influence human affairs. People from all walks
of life consult astrologers--Princess Diana was said to have relied on
the advice of an astrologer, as did former First Lady Nancy Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   While many debunk astrologers' predictions as mere parlor tricks,
others argue astrology is a legitimate field of study. Renowned physicist
Albert Einstein said it is "a science in itself and [it] contains an
illuminating body of knowledge. It taught me many things."</TE>
<TE>   The institute is turning out practitioners into a growing field. Cindy
Craig, one of three graduates of the school's first class in 1999, has a
private practice that concentrates on relationship issues. She charges
$100 for a one-hour reading for one person and as much as $150 for a
couple--about the industry average.</TE>
<TE>   Her other big source of business is conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "They set up tables and I do quick readings. Everyone loves it," Craig
said. "I have to turn down business because I get so many requests."</TE>
<TE>   The school's founder, Joyce Jensen, said that most graduates go into
private practice but also find work in bookstores, at resorts and on
cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   "The field is wide open," Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   Astrologers often specialize, giving advice about an auspicious time
to expand a business or the best time to buy stock. She said many
businesses consult astrologers, but such work is hush-hush.</TE>
<TE>   "They make us sign confidentiality agreements because these Fortune
500 companies don't want to be ridiculed," she said. "It's really a great
tool for business strategy and planning. We can help them determine good
times to do things."</TE>
<TE>   Schools seeking national accreditation must first select an
accrediting agency that most closely matches their educational mission.
Jensen chose the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of
Technology. Based in Arlington, Va., the agency is approved by the U.S.
Department of Education to award accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The accrediting agency does not question the nature of the school but
examines whether the school is capable of providing the education it
claims. A trade school, for example, could be accredited if it
successfully teaches its students to rebuild automobile transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other types of career schools accredited: cosmetology,
dice/blackjack dealing, hotel cleaning and instruction to become a nanny.</TE>
<TE>   The stringent two-year process involves multiple site inspections and
close analysis of the school's staff and curriculum. The school is
required to have qualified teachers and train its graduates to be placed
in jobs. The Astrological Institute gained accreditation in August.</TE>
<TE>   The institute, which has about 50 students, offers day and evening
classes on astronomy, physics and psychology. Tuition is $5,300 a year
for 450 hours of instruction, and graduates receive a diploma.</TE>
<TE>   Students tend to be, like Jensen, passionate about the stars.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say I've been obsessed about astrology, really, since I was
about 10 years old," said Jensen, an affable and confident Scorpio.</TE>
<TE>   She has been teaching since about 1985, and for the last decade she
worked on making her astrology school legitimate. Too many in her
profession, Jensen said, do the work but aren't properly educated. Too
many outside it, she said, devalue astrology in part because its
practitioners lack educational credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have been practicing astrology for years are amazed at
what they don't know," Jensen said from her desk in the former physical
education teachers' office. "There is much to it, and I think if the
public could know what's involved they would be less questioning."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen envisions bigger things and hopes one day to offer associate
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   According to the charts Jensen prepared for the school, this year
looks like a good time for business success. The plan is to move from the
nondescript location and incorporate a bookstore and gift shop into the
campus.</TE>
<TE>   "They made me jump through hoops, but I am a very determined person,"
Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this is something I had to do. It's been 600 years since
astrology has been part of the academic world. We need to get back there.
And here we are."</TE>

<CX>   Astrology--A story that appeared on Jan. 13 in Section A reported
that physicist Albert Einstein said astrology is "a science in itself and
[it] contains an illuminating body of knowledge. It taught me many
things." Though such a quote is listed on several Web sites popular with
astrology followers, there is no proof that Einstein ever made this
statement.</CX>

<HD>Gettysburg Museum Plans Unveiled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GETTYSBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>Architects unveiled the design of a new museum and visitor center
at Gettysburg National Military Park, where modern, spacious facilities
will be concealed in a complex that looks like a cluster of old farm
buildings.</LD>
<LD>   "The story of Gettysburg is so big, it needs a bigger, better
facility," said Chris Rebmann, a Gettysburg resident and president of the
Assn. of Licensed Battlefield Guides. "To have one that blends into the
landscape, instead of intruding on it, is going to be wonderful."</LD>
<LD>   The public got its first look Friday at a New York architecture firm's
plans for the $95-million museum and visitor center. The new complex is
to be built less than a mile from the current visitor center, which is
near the cemetery where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg
Address.</LD>
<TE>   Although it is designed to look like a turn-of-the-century
Pennsylvania farm--complete with a stone grain silo and tin-roofed
circular barn--the center will house two theaters, a cafeteria, a
bookstore, classrooms, interpretive exhibits and other modern amenities.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to draw on the strong building traditions of the area,"
said Jack Robertson, a principal in the architecture firm Cooper
Robertson &amp; Partners. "The structure should look like it belongs in this
beautiful, pastoral, agricultural landscape."</TE>
<TE>   The 45-acre site of the new center was chosen because of its relative
lack of significance in the 1863 battle, a turning point in the Civil
War.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the current visitor center is in Zeigler's Grove on
Cemetery Hill--the site of the Confederate assault called Pickett's
Charge, which brought the Battle of Gettysburg to its climax.</TE>
<TE>   The old building and the Cyclorama Center will be demolished after the
new museum is completed in about four years.</TE>
<TE>   Funds for the project are being raised by the Gettysburg National
Battlefield Museum Foundation, a nonprofit group.</TE>

<HD>CSUCI Invites 1st Students, Fills Staff for Its Stretch Run</HD>

<LD>When the letter arrived last week, tucked neatly into an ordinary
business-sized envelope, Thousand Oaks resident Craig Stankis had no way
of knowing his place in history.</LD>
<LD>   There he was, receiving what equaled a written handshake for earning
admission to the soon-to-open Cal State Channel Islands campus near
Camarillo, without any clue he was among the first students to get in.</LD>
<LD>   A student at Moorpark College, the 41-year-old warehouse worker said
all he knew was that the four-year campus provided the perfect
opportunity to pursue his dream of becoming a teacher.</LD>
<TE>   Now he has set his sights on another history-making moment: joining
the university's first graduating class in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been saying they were going to build a university out here
for years and years," said Stankis, who grew up less than five miles from
the Channel Islands campus. "When the opportunity came, I knew I wanted
to go there."</TE>
<TE>   After more than 30 years of planning and preparation, with
heartbreaking setbacks and heart-pounding successes, Ventura County's
first, four-year public university will open Aug. 26 at the former
Camarillo State Hospital complex.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating a $21-million budget for next fiscal year, and having
generated nearly $13 million in private support for scholarships and
capital projects, the university stands on a threshold.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the year marks the stretch run for the long-awaited
campus, the 23rd in the Cal State University system and the first
launched since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   And when it formally opens for business, amid ribbon cuttings and
spirited speeches, it will mark the culmination of a hard-fought campaign
to make higher education more accessible in a region where generations of
students have had no choice but to leave if they wanted a state college
degree.</TE>
<TE>   "People won't realize, until it has happened, what a tremendous impact
this university will have," said Carolyn Leavens, a Ventura farmer and
business leader who has worked for years to bring a Cal State campus to
the county.</TE>
<TE>Community Opposition Slowed Progress</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us who signed on at the beginning ever said,
'This is not going to happen, we might as well give up,' " she said. "We
signed on for as long as it took."</TE>
<TE>   On the drawing board since 1969, plans for a local campus had fallen
well down on the CSU system's priority list over the years, as community
opposition thwarted one proposal after another and CSU trustees soured on
the project for lack of support.</TE>
<TE>   By 1990, when after months of contentious deliberations CSU trustees
eliminated from consideration a sweeping hillside bluff near Ventura for
the new campus, Ventura County held the distinction of being the largest
county in the state without a public, four-year college.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a proposal, floated in 1996 and endorsed a year later by the
Cal State governing board, to convert the aging state hospital into a
modern-day campus, a move that ultimately resulted in creation of the
long-promised university years earlier than anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   Now the launch date is fast approaching and there is still plenty to
do.</TE>
<TE>   Admissions officers have received more than 300 applications for the
approximately 800 full- and part-time slots that will be available at the
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Because admission is restricted this fall to upper-division transfer
students--the first freshman class won't show up until fall
2003--applications from community college students are expected to flood
the campus in the next couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the university's founding faculty members are busy
whittling down more than 4,000 applications for 25 teaching positions
that must be filled before the university opens. And senior staff members
are busy filling up to 70 staff positions.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the behind-the-scenes work to be done, from making sure
the emerging university stays on pace to earn accreditation by 2006 to
figuring out how to operate two campuses--Channel Islands and a satellite
campus of Cal State Northridge--on the same site.</TE>
<TE>   The CSUN branch opened at the site in 1999 as a precursor to Cal State
Channel Islands. CSUN's off-campus operation is set to be phased out over
the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what's expected every week and every month; for me, it's just
the same as shaving each morning or breathing the rest of the day," said
Channel Islands President Richard Rush, whose chief job is to hold it all
together as the stretch run comes down to the wire.</TE>
<TE>   "We are right on schedule with everything we've done so far," he said.
"We all feel that we are carrying the responsibility of everybody's hopes
and dreams, and the fact of the matter is, we take that very seriously."</TE>
<TE>Founding Faculty Works on Curriculum</TE>
<TE>   Opening a university may be serious business, but that doesn't mean
faculty and staff can't enjoy themselves along the way.</TE>
<TE>   In the faculty conference room, professors were huddled last week
around an oval table littered with candy, cookies and soft drinks--quick
energy for the monumental tasks at hand.</TE>
<TE>   In coming months, the 13 founding faculty members will put the
finishing touches on the university's curriculum and complete an
exhaustive search for additional faculty needed to teach in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Recruited from universities around the world, the founding faculty has
been busy since the summer, planning and drafting the hundreds of Channel
Islands courses that will appear in the fall catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Courses will be offered in eight majors: biology, business,
environmental science and resource management, English, fine arts,
liberal studies, computer science and math. The university also will
offer a credential program for aspiring elementary school teachers.</TE>
<TE>   While the catalog will feature many of the standard courses available
at any university, there has been an emphasis at Channel Islands on
cross-breeding disciplines to create a new strain of courses as
innovative as they are functional.</TE>
<TE>   For example, arts professor Jack Reilly has teamed with the English
department to offer a course in art history that delves into literature
and the Renaissance. And economics professor Dennis Muraoka has been
working on a class about the drug industry that combines the chemical
aspects with the business side.</TE>
<TE>   Muraoka, who doubles as chairman of the university's Academic Senate,
said this broad-based approach better prepares students to confront
problems they may face in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   "Too often, students can develop tunnel vision if they become too
focused on their majors and lose sight of other ways of thinking," he
said. "Virtually every one of the programs we've developed has extremely
interesting connections to other disciplines."</TE>
<TE>   It is that kind of academic flexibility, the once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to craft a college curriculum on what is largely a blank
slate, that has drawn the founding faculty members from as far away as
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   And it's that same opportunity that has generated 4,200 applications
for the remaining faculty positions.</TE>
<TE>   That pool has been whittled down to fewer than 250. And of those,
about 80 will be invited to the campus next month for interviews.
University officials hope to make job offers by mid-April.</TE>
<TE>   "There are university jobs open every day, but starting up a new
university, that's very special," said Ira Schoenwald, associate vice
president for faculty. "The work that these people are doing will have an
impact 10 to 15 years from now, maybe longer. You can imagine how
exciting that is and why people want to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the sprawling 600-acre campus, a ready-made
university dominated by rolling lawns and Spanish-style buildings, a
different kind of recruitment is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Recruitment director Sue Saunders has led a team of outreach
specialists to schools, conferences and college fairs to whip up
excitement among potential students about the developing campus.</TE>
<TE>   She said for the most part she's finding it to be an easy sell,
especially in this region, where people are hungry for news of the
Channel Islands campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has waited so long to have a four-year public institution in
Ventura County," said Saunders, who came to Channel Islands from a
similar job at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. "I think we're
all starting to feel it. I start to get goose bumps when I think about
how this fall we'll start admitting our first students."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rush feels it too.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he's been through it before, having played a key role in
the late 1980s and early 1990s in the development of Cal State San
Marcos, Rush remains awed by what he and other university officials are
about to accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there are budgets to pore over, enrollment targets to worry
about. But he said anyone who looks at the effort with a narrow scope is
bound to miss the bigger picture.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a millennial endeavor we are engaged in," he said. "When you
put it into that context, it really is kind of awesome."</TE>

<HD>For Some, Happiness Is a Weekend Gun Show</HD>
<DH>Business: The two-day event draws collectors, hunters and their
families with firearms, toys and clothes. One vendor says Ventura doesn't
hassle them.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Several thousand people jammed two exposition buildings at
Ventura's Seaside Park on Saturday for the start of a two-day gun show
that draws novice and veteran shooters, collectors, history buffs and
vendors.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which runs through today, also seeks to attract families by
offering toys for children, clothes, camping gear and Arizona real
estate.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the best [shows]," said vendor Gary Hallett, a Rancho
Cucamonga retiree who sells custom-made leather holsters and belts.
"Ventura is gun-friendly. We never get hassled."</LD>
<TE>   Wearing a black cowboy hat studded with buffalo nickels, Hallett, a
former construction worker, attends gun shows every month to supplement
his retirement income.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Jones, a mortgage broker-turned-gun dealer, sells rifles and
shotguns at shows throughout the state every weekend. One of his guns
costs more than $45,000.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of customers and the job's low stress appeal to Jones, who
owns a gun shop in Penryn, just north of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really low-negativity business," Jones said. "You also have a
lot of quality sportsmen in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Seaside Park hosts five large gun shows a year, and vendors say big
crowds turn out every time for the variety of merchandise offered.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of a pile of empty ammunition boxes and camouflage
clothes, vendor Milt Carter said the show also draws former military
personnel looking for items from their past.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors sell a lot of military surplus, including sleeping bags,
backpacks, parachute cords and olive-green fatigues in all sizes.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, shoppers searched for antique guns or hard-to-find items,
such as metal body armor, swords, riding chaps and authentic bullets from
the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   With 600 tables to look through, seeing the show can take hours.</TE>
<TE>   As several children checked out tables of Beanie Babies, dolls with
bobbing heads and wall posters, adults searched for bolo ties, pistol
grips and earplugs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a walking museum in a way," said Clint Torres, a local
vendor.</TE>
<TE>   The show continues from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today. Admission is $8 for
adults, and children 11 and younger are free.</TE>

<HD>To Protect and Preserve?</HD>
<DH>Culture: As ancient carvings found in Irvine show, the county is
still not sure what relics to save or how.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can see the past etched into the face of a boulder in the
Bowers Museum courtyard, a maze of thin lines created by Native Americans
thousands of years before Orange County's landscape succumbed to
cul-de-sacs and freeways, industrial parks and glass cathedrals.</LD>
<LD>   This ancient maze, hauled in from the nearby Santa Ana Mountains, is
one of the few samples of tribal rock art on exhibit locally. The rarity
of such carvings has added weight to demands that rock carvings recently
discovered in two Irvine caves be preserved.</LD>
<LD>   But preserving such artifacts does not necessarily mean making them
available for public viewing. Although laws require that newly recorded
historical items--ranging from rock art to cooking pits to human
remains--be identified and recorded, few regulations deal with what
happens to them afterward.</LD>
<TE>   That has led to such oddities as an Orange County warehouse filled
with the bric-a-brac of the past, a 15,000-cubic-foot collection so
disorganized that even those charged with watching over it don't fully
know what they have.</TE>
<TE>   Although the current debate centers on faded images carved in stone,
the disclosure of the Irvine rock art underscores the ongoing debates
among preservationists, developers, government officials and Native
Americans over what items ought to be preserved. Complicating
preservation efforts, archeologists and others say, are laws that are
simply insufficient to protect irreplaceable relics of times gone by.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly challenging is the preservation of rock art, which by its
nature often is immovable--and prey to the elements, vandals and illicit
collectors.</TE>
<TE>   In the current debate, one of the Irvine caves containing a small
carving--described as a 4-inch squiggle with a circle at one end--could
be demolished as part of a 2,500-home development at the edge of the San
Joaquin Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The other cave, containing a large carving of a rattlesnake, will be
ceded to the city of Irvine as part of 1,000 acres of open space
adjoining the Irvine Co.'s Shady Canyon development between Turtle Rock
and Sand Canyon Avenue, south of the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   That cave, and six others nearby, will become part of wilderness area
open to the public, but the caves will remain off-limits, said Sharon
Heider, Irvine open space administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the caves secure, though, is not easy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, they're not mapped, we don't have trails to them and, if
there are ways that we can do it, we'll plant cactus and those kinds of
things that would keep people from wanting to go in those areas," Heider
said. "The last ditch scenario is if the sites are highly attractive,
we'd patrol them."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest risk, said Heider and others, is damage from vandals or
collectors chipping the art from the cave walls.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very important cultural resource that provide a lot of
information about our connection with this land," Heider said. "They need
to be protected. There is a bigger basis for public good than just
letting people tour them."</TE>
<TE>   Countless sites in the deserts have been damaged or destroyed over the
years by vandals, and sometimes by well-meaning aficionados making
rubbings of primitive carvings. Though Orange County has more than 1,600
registered archeological sites, most are abandoned cook sites or similar
leavings of daily life. And while there are some 6,000 rock art sites
across California--mainly in the southern deserts--such discoveries are
rare in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that ancients passed the region by. Rather, experts say, the
sandstone that predominates in Orange County--canvases for the rock
artists--erodes more quickly than rock in the deserts. And, they believe,
an unknowable number of artifacts were destroyed by developers' plows
before laws required them to catalog their findings and alert
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I would assume, given the fact that the surrounding counties have
rock art, it must have been made in Orange County as well," said Phyllisa
Eisentraut, an archeologist and assistant professor of anthropology at
Cal State Fullerton. "Most likely it was done in rock shelters and
caves."</TE>
<TE>   Some sites were identified during a 1930s Works Progress
Administration program, she said, but "those sites have since been
subject to development."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Selway, director of the Orange County Historical Commission, which
oversees the county's collection of historical relics, said he knew of no
other rock art sites in Orange County. Local archeology enthusiasts were
similarly hard-pressed to identify locations.</TE>
<TE>   However, Damien Shilo, chairman of the Juaneno Band of Mission
Indians, said the tribe's archeological committee has recorded an
unspecified number of sites, and he has visited at least seven--including
those announced recently in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Shilo declined to identify the other sites, most of which he said are
unknown to mainstream archeologists and hard to get to. One in Laguna
Hills, he said, requires rappelling gear.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep it off the beaten path because, more often than not,
when we've said where they are, we get the vandalism and the kids hang
out," said Shilo, 43, a Los Angeles firefighter who lives in San Juan
Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   Some rumored sites turn out to be mirages. One depiction of a hand
discovered decades ago in a canyon in present-day Crystal Cove State Park
disappeared when the cave collapsed during the El Nino storms of 1982-83,
rangers said. Another off Laguna Canyon Road has reportedly faded so much
that it's barely discernible. And reports of petroglyphs at Aliso &amp; Wood
Canyons Wilderness Park--including a mention on a county Harbors, Beaches
and Parks division Web site--are erroneous, park rangers there said.</TE>
<TE>   However, rock paintings can be seen off Ortega Highway just over the
Riverside County line, near the El Cariso ranger station. And Riverside
County's Mockingbird Canyon, near Lake Matthews east of Corona, contains
pictographs that archeologists believe were involved in solstice
celebrations by Luiseno and Gabrielino tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Few such sites, though, have been found south of the Santa Ana
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not really dealt with that issue very much," Selway said.</TE>
<TE>   But the flatlands and coastal hills have been a treasure trove of
other artifacts from native civilizations, including village sites and
massive burial grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Under preservation guidelines dating to the late 1970s, relics
discovered during projects that require county permits--such as building
or grading--are turned over to the county. Human remains fall under
different guidelines and usually are turned over to local Native American
groups for reburial.</TE>
<TE>   The county began accepting artifacts--ranging from million-year-old
whale bones to Native American grinding stones--with vague intentions of
displaying them in a museum but no guidelines for amassing and monitoring
the collection.</TE>
<TE>   One attempt to establish a museum failed in 1992 when the nonprofit
Natural History Foundation of Orange County went bankrupt, souring donors
who had come up with $550,000 for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors has supported a natural history museum in
concept, but said it would not fund one, Selway said. And despite a
feasibility study from the early '90s that laid out blueprints for
establishing a center, none has been developed, Selway said.</TE>
<TE>   The development boom in the '80s uncovered large amounts of artifacts
and ecofacts--shells, bones and plant remnants--that overwhelmed the
county's ability to store them, and the facility stopped accepting new
material in 1992. That means unknown numbers of artifacts are being
stored privately by developers, contractors and others involved in
development projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, people were just happy to preserve them and get them out
of the ground from in front of development," Selway said. "People were
not as farsighted about curation and the condition the artifacts would be
in when there were accepted."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the county has boxes and boxes of raw material from
identified archeological sites, agglomerations of dirt and material still
waiting to be sifted and sorted.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three years ago, the county contracted with Cal State
Fullerton--using a combination of parks money and federal grants--in a
$400,000 project to devise a means for curating the massive collection.
That project, directed by Eisentraut and Cal State Fullerton
paleontologist John D. Cooper, is in its third year.</TE>
<TE>   Eisentraut said the collection consists of about 15,000 cubic feet of
material.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done an initial inventory and have a box-by-box sense of what
kinds of collections we have for both archeological and paleontological
remains," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have also devised a system for cataloging the collection
as it is analyzed, she said. A full report on the project is due in the
next year.</TE>

<LD>A small sewage spill forced the closure of a portion of Newport Bay
on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The spill was caused when a pipe in the county's pump-out station
sprang a leak sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning, said
Orange County Harbor Patrol Sgt. Ron Peoples. The county posted signs
warning of the health hazard about 8 a.m., Peoples said.</LD>
<LD>   The closure was expected to continue through today, when the pipe was

<HD>Legal Team to Probe Alleged Campaign Finance Violations</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Independent counsel will investigate a complaint that
Councilman Neal Andrews used political action committee he controlled to
buy ads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Ventura has hired independent counsel to determine if
first-term Councilman Neal Andrews violated a city campaign finance law
in the days leading up to his narrow election.</LD>
<LD>   Two Santa Barbara lawyers will look at whether Andrews controlled
Pacific Action Consortium, a committee that paid for ads promoting his
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   If Andrews had decision-making authority over how the consortium spent
its money, or communicated with the group about its plans, he could
become the first city official to be fined or criminally charged under a
campaign finance reform law approved by Ventura voters in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   The ordinance prohibits a candidate from controlling more than one
committee spending money on his or her behalf. It also allows the city to
take charge of prosecutions rather than forward complaints to the state.
Penalties range from fines to six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm prepared to cooperate fully," he said. "I don't think there's
anything that was wrong or inappropriate, certainly nothing intentional."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said he formed the Pacific Action Consortium in 1997 as a
public-policy think tank for clients in the health-care industry. It
later turned into a political action committee, donating funds to
candidates throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews told fellow council members in a meeting last week that the
accusation against him stemmed from a politically motivated smear
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The legal team met for a briefing with city officials Friday but
declined to comment on the session. The team consists of former Santa
Barbara Dist. Atty. Stanley M. Roden, who previously served on the state
Fair Political Practices Commission; and Carpinteria City Atty. Peter N.
Brown, head of a California city attorneys group and a former Santa
Barbara County deputy district attorney. The city has agreed to pay $250
hour for the lawyers' services.</TE>
<TE>Council Election Foe Brought Complaint</TE>
<TE>   The allegation was raised by challenger Mike Osborn shortly after he
lost to Andrews by 147 votes in November. Finance reports filed with the
county elections office last week by Pacific Action Consortium show that
the group spent $974 on newspaper ads supporting Andrews in the final
days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Osborn said Friday that he had been reviewing earlier Pacific Action
Consortium materials and noticed that the handwriting on committee
paperwork looked like Andrews'. Further research revealed Andrews was
listed as the committee's general partner in 1997, Osborn said.</TE>
<TE>   That alone would not constitute a violation, but officials say the
issue is whether Andrews was involved in committee decisions at the time
of last year's race.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said he dropped out of decision-making when the group became a
political action committee.</TE>
<TE>   In his complaint to the city, Osborn also said he found radio scripts
in which lines indicating that ads paid for by Pacific Action Consortium
had been crossed out and replaced with lines saying they were paid for by
Andrews' campaign committee.</TE>
<TE>   "If I would have won and found this out, it still would have been an
issue to me," Osborn said. "We all have a duty to help uphold the law."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews said that after the consortium endorsed him, one of his
campaign workers suggested having the group sponsor radio ads. That plan
was scrapped and the campaign ended up paying for the ads, he said.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Steve Bennett, who drafted the city finance law when
he sat as a council member, declined to comment on the specifics of
Andrews case. But he said the prohibition on candidates controlling a
second committee to benefit themselves is important, because the city
limits the amount that can be contributed to candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "When you institute campaign contribution limits and voluntary
spending limits, the incentive to launder money increases, and one of the
ways to launder money is through a separate campaign committee," Bennett
said. "That's why candidates can't have influence over a second committee
in any way."</TE>

<HD>Piru Looks to the Future</HD>
<DH>Development: Ground broken for a $2.2-million town square, which
will feature a replica train depot, offices and a bandstand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials see Piru Town Square as a tribute to the community's rich
history and resilience, and a sign of future prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   Those aspirations were voiced Saturday as about 150 county officials
and local residents gathered at groundbreaking ceremonies for the
$2.2-million project.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a fabulous day in Piru and a long-awaited day," said Marty
Robinson, a Ventura County regional development administrator, who is
working on the project.</LD>
<TE>   The town square, which will include a train station, outdoor gazebo
and picnic tables, is one of the first major construction projects in
Piru since the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 private homes and 14 of the community's 15 businesses
buckled in the quake. Buildings that once housed banks and markets remain
boarded up in the small downtown area along Center Street.</TE>
<TE>   The damage in Piru and nearby Fillmore reached nearly $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of giving up, Piru residents and officials decided to
revitalize this sleepy town, which is circled by citrus orchards and
nestled in the grassy foothills along California 126.</TE>
<TE>   "This was basically a ghost town and people wanted services back,"
Robinson said. "Residents made a list of what they wanted and that
included new sidewalks, businesses and a place to gather."</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to pay for the new town square through a combination of
county funds and federal grants from the Departments of Commerce and
Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   The town square, which is expected to be completed in the fall, will
feature a train depot that is a replica of Piru's 1880s station.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the depot will be office space and a visitors center, and
outside there will be a concrete bandstand and train platform.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to bring a scenic train to town, utilizing old tracks
between Santa Paula and Piru.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one more link in the tourism development in the Heritage
Valley," said Jim Garfield, president of the Heritage Valley Tourism
Assn. "There are so many people in Los Angeles and the San Fernando
Valley who don't know we exist."</TE>
<TE>   Guests at the groundbreaking ceremony had a taste of life along the
rails when a wood-burning steam locomotive chugged into Piru on Saturday
to punctuate the historic theme of the new town square.</TE>
<TE>   As the engine belched smoke and whistled, officials also talked about
a new 2 1/2-mile bike path that will connect the town square with Rancho
Camulos east of Piru, a historic 1,800-acre citrus farm.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are excited about the new depot but also anxious for more
downtown revitalization.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Habitat for Humanity has built an entire neighborhood. A
gasoline station and minimarket are also near completion.</TE>
<TE>   "[The depot] will promote the downtown area and maybe we will get some
antique shops and boutiques," said Felix Noriega, chairman of the town's
film location committee.</TE>

<LD>Brea Police Chief William C. Lentini was honored for his 31 years
of service to the communities of Brea and Yorba Linda with a retirement
party Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   During his tenure, Lentini began a bike patrol unit, opened a police
substation downtown and initiated a citizens police academy that takes
residents through the same types of training the city's uniformed
officers undergo.</LD>
<LD>   Brea Mayor Marty Simonoff credited Lentini, 54, for maintaining a
strong and harmonious police force. "When a chief can come in and have a
positive impact on a department and leave knowing that he helped make it
a quality organization, that says a lot about an individual," said
Simonoff.</LD>

<HD>Garofalo Fallout? Not in Surf City</HD>
<DH>Politics: Residents glad it's over, say they don't expect lasting
damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Councilman Dave Garofalo's guilty pleas to
conflict-of-interest charges last week may one day take a prominent place
in the Huntington Beach history books. But on the streets of Surf City
this weekend, many residents took a "chilled out" attitude about the
affair.</LD>
<LD>   "People have a short memory as far as politicians go," said Gerald
Chapman, a local dentist. "For the short term this is probably bad, but
for the long term, no."</LD>
<LD>   Although Garofalo's case generated much media attention, Chapman and
others doubted the city would suffer a lasting black eye and that its
reputation will continue to rest on its beaches and surfing rather than
allegations of political corruption.</LD>
<TE>   Garofalo, who resigned from office last month, pleaded guilty Thursday
to one felony and 15 misdemeanors for numerous votes on matters involving
companies that bought advertising from his publishing business.</TE>
<TE>   He was given a suspended sentence and placed on three years'
unsupervised probation. He must pay $49,700 in fines and complete 200
hours of community service by April 1, 2003. He also is barred from
running for public office unless he can persuade a judge to clear his
record after three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what he did was crummy," said a 43-year resident of the city
who asked that her name not be used. "I think he hurt the city's image,
but I don't think that he damaged the city."</TE>
<TE>   Others said they still strongly believe in Garofalo, saying he
provided years of service to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Dave a lot," said Mary Jo Jeffs, 79, who organizes dances at
the Michael E. Rodgers Senior Center. "The good he did for the city
outweighs the bad."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, there was relief that the shadow cast on the city by
the lengthy investigation is gone.</TE>
<TE>   The Garofalo affair was just the latest in a series of setbacks the
city has suffered.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the beach was closed for most of the summer after extremely
high bacteria readings, which health officials suspected were caused by
raw human sewage hitting the beach. The closure wreaked havoc on the
coastal economy and tarnished Surf City's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   In March the city pleaded guilty to felony charges for allowing
millions of gallons of raw sewage to leak from aging pipes.</TE>
<TE>   To many, the environmental problems--and the criminal charges related
to the aging sewer system--are more troubling than the Garofalo matter
because they relate to the beaches and surf for which the city is best
known.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they said Garofalo's fall has prompted them to more closely
scrutinize the behavior of elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The city definitely will recover from this," said Robert Bailey, 47,
manager of Rockin' Fig Surf shop. "We've just got to look at our elected
representatives closer than we have."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, the dentist, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This probably reinforces some of the citizens' feelings about city
government," he said. "But shoot, we need to pick up the pieces and go
on."</TE>

<DH>Environment: Trabuco Canyon mother turns activist to fight plans to
expand a juvenile center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear Shelly Black describe her Trabuco Canyon community, with
its flowing mountain streams, 200-year-old oaks and miles of hiking
trails, it's easy to see why she becomes emotional.</LD>
<LD>   "We see deer and coyotes all the time up here. There's just so much
wildlife that it's pretty incredible," said Black of her neighborhood
nestled near the foothills of the Cleveland National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why the mere mention of plans to build a 90-bed juvenile
detention center behind her home causes the 38-year-old
mother-turned-activist to condemn county government for threatening to
spoil her private paradise.</LD>
<TE>   "We're portrayed as NIMBYs, that we don't care about juveniles, but we
do believe there is a need for more juvenile beds," she said. "But there
are other areas in the county to build a juvenile facility without
destroying the environment."</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, Black has been one of the community leaders
rallying opposition to the proposed $17-million Rancho Potrero Leadership
Academy in the small community, where a general store is the commercial
hub.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't something I would normally do," Black said. "But if you
want to have a rural lifestyle, kind of off the grid, you got to fight
for it. Nobody wants to let you have that."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy, which includes Trabuco
residents, sued to stop construction of the academy, which was approved
by county supervisors last month.</TE>
<TE>   The county probation department plans to build the academy on the
grounds of the Joplin youth center, a 64-bed treatment camp for boys that
covers 338 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials say existing facilities such as Joplin and
Juvenile Hall in Orange are overcrowded and won't be able to meet the
projected need in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   They estimate they will need 726 "secure" beds in a locked, guarded
facility such as juvenile hall by 2005; it has 538 now. They say they
will need 605 "nonsecure" beds, such as those at Joplin, by 2005. They
have only 314 there now.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say a camp setting helps build character in
nonviolent offenders by removing them from the influence of gangs and
putting them in a wilderness environment. They add that if they are
forced to delay construction, they will miss a 2003 deadline set by the
state Board of Corrections, which is providing $8.4 million for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years since Joplin opened in 1956, residents have learned
to coexist with its unique problems, including runaways.</TE>
<TE>   But when plans called for dozens of heavy construction trucks rumbling
up narrow Rose Canyon Road, posing potential traffic hazards for the
children who frequently ride horses through the heart of the mountain
community, residents' frustration turned to action.</TE>
<TE>   They also turned to Black, a longtime canyon resident who has
motivated others to attend hearings and speak out.</TE>
<TE>   "Shelly was one of those residents with an incredible passion," fellow
community leader Gloria Sefton said. "She's wonderful at organizing and
getting people to attend things, especially if we've called a last-minute
town hall meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gomez, a spokesman for the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy,
said part of Black's strength is that she's not afraid to confront
people, including elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   When county supervisors approved the project, Black zeroed in on
Supervisor Todd Spitzer, whose district includes Trabuco Canyon. She
called the project, "Spitzer's Scheme," and accused him of compromising
"our environment," family safety and fiscal responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has said he told residents he agreed that trucks would pose a
hazard. As a result, the Probation Department will build a road to handle
construction trucks and future academy traffic.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the new road would cross private land and require the
county to pay for the land and construction, which added $5 million to
the original $12-million project.</TE>
<TE>   While residents such as Black criticize the project as the "nation's
most expensive" juvenile facility--costing $250,000 a bed--probation
officials contend the figure is $133,000 per bed.</TE>
<TE>   The project became more controversial when county planners chose to
create the Joplin Boys Ranch District as a planning mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   The conservancy's lawsuit alleges that the county created the special
district to circumvent environmental laws that would make it more
difficult to cut down 200-year-old oaks and pave a road through Trabuco
Creek. Both probation and county planning officials deny that charge.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't bypass the law, this complies with it," said Brian
Murphy, a spokesman for the county planning department. "Zoning laws
allow for [districts] for public purposes, and this is a project to serve
the entire county."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the lawsuit, residents have shifted their focus to raising
funds for legal costs. Already, $35,000 has been raised, mostly from
individuals, Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Black, Gomez said her leadership role also has changed.
"Initially, Shelly was trying to do it all, but now we're more
organized."</TE>
<TE>   Committees have been set up for fund-raising, public relations,
accounting and legal issues, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've also learned to delegate so we can focus on being effective,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Black, who dropped out of Laguna Hills High School in 10th grade, said
her activism has been on-the-job, "real-life" training.</TE>
<TE>   Many county officials begrudgingly paid her and other community
leaders respect.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been very organized," said Thomas G. Wright, chief deputy
probation officer. "They've been good adversaries, though not
well-informed at times. But I can appreciate their passion."</TE>

<HD>Judge Presiding in Rocketdyne Trial to Stay</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A motion to remove a federal judge in Riverside from the trial of
two former Rocketdyne employees charged with environmental crimes was
rejected Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Phillips.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys made the motion after learning that U.S. District
Court Judge Robert J. Timlin once helped a key prosecution witness hire a
lawyer to sue Rocketdyne. The witness is the widow of one of two
scientists killed in a 1994 explosion at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field
Laboratory southeast of Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Charged in the case are Joseph E. Flanagan, 60, of Stanwood, Wash.,
and Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth. Neither man is charged with the
deaths, but each faces two counts of illegally disposing of hazardous
wastes.</LD>
<TE>   Flanagan , who was director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group,
also is accused of illegally storing the materials. If convicted, they
face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the
counts.</TE>
<TE>   Timlin is presiding over a case stemming from the same blast.</TE>

<LD>I wanted to applaud you for your article on "Club Offers Support
for Deaf Students" (Jan. 7). I believe that the article conveys a strong
message and, with any luck, will promote other clubs and recreation
centers to follow their example. I, personally, have not seen too many
programs for deaf or blind students. If places have to be
wheelchair-accessible, I see no reason that they shouldn't have to be
accessible to blind and deaf people as well. These disabilities are just
as serious and deserve just as much care and attention. After reading
this article, I will definitely suggest that we start such programs at
the recreation center where I work.</LD>
<LD>   The government spends incredible amounts of money on programs to keep
teens out of trouble. Well, they should spend some money teaching the
parents of deaf students sign language because, as the article stated,
without that, they have no means of communication, and without
communication, trouble is exactly what these teens will be getting
themselves into. So again, thank you for printing this article. I only
hope that others find it as eye-opening as I did.</LD>

<HD>Red Light Cameras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We read with amusement and disbelief the short article: "Thousand
Oaks; Council Rejects Red Light Cameras."</LD>
<LD>   The rejection was based on the results of a private study that
determined that not enough people run red lights in the city to justify
the program's cost.</LD>
<LD>   The private study must have been completed by Oscar the ostrich with
his head in the sand. There are four or five street crossings in Thousand
Oaks where we have observed people running red lights consistently during
high-traffic times. The Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Westlake Boulevard
crossing has one of the highest rates of people running red lights. About
three years ago, the rate of people running red lights that we observed
randomly at high traffic times was two to three per light. Early in 2001,
the rate went up to four to five per red light. Recently, we observed a
maximum rate of nine running one red light. The first eight were the end
of the double left turn line onto Thousand Oaks Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Then as we started to drive, No. 9 nine came racing through the light,
almost hitting our car. She was frightened, as expressed by the look on
her face, and she knew she had broken the law, but there was no one there
to ticket her. If you project the number of people running red lights out
to 2004, the rate may be as high as 10 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Getting back to the private study results, it is conceivable the study
was based on the Red Skelton character Freddy the Freeloader. A friend
asks Freddy what he was looking for at 15th Street and Grand. Freddy
tells his friend that he lost some money at 14th Street and Grand. The
friend asks Freddy why he was looking at 15th Street and Grand. Freddy
says, "There is more light at 15th Street and Grand." Maybe Oscar the
ostrich was surveying the wrong street crossings or doing a lot of
invalid averaging in his analysis.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Alex Fiore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As our community starts this New Year together, we begin without
one of our city's all-time leaders.</LD>
<LD>   He was elected to the original City Council in 1964, served a record
seven terms, never lost an election.</LD>
<LD>   He was mayor six times. His name has been affixed to Little League
baseball fields, an affordable housing complex and most recently our
community Teen Center.</LD>
<TE>   When he retired from the council in 1994 after 30 years of public
service, he was honored as our city's mayor emeritus. From 1964 through
his retirement, he provided the key quality of great leadership--vision.</TE>
<TE>   If there was ever a man who could be legitimately be called "Mr.
Thousand Oaks," it was he. For those of us who have lived in town since
before 1994, you already know his name. For the new folks, his name is
Alex Fiore.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, our city has been blessed over the years with excellent
community leaders who in their own way helped shape our city. But Alex
Fiore stands above all. Here's why.</TE>
<TE>   During his time on the council, Alex could be found most every
Saturday morning sitting at a card table at the Janss Mall. He would
answer questions, listen to concerns, talk about current events; and, I
am told, he even did your taxes if you asked.</TE>
<TE>   In round numbers, that's 1,440 Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Fiore was not content to just have a seat on the council. He was
a true leader who was willing to take measured risks and endure political
attack for things he believed in. And what did Alex Fiore believe?</TE>
<TE>   In short, he believed in a self-supporting community, fiscally sound
with a balanced budget every year, a standard which is still maintained
to this day. A General Plan that provides a balance of housing needs,
supported by a strong industrial and commercial base that both sustains
employment and creates revenues that make it possible to provide city
services. All surrounded by a ring of public open space.</TE>
<TE>   You knew exactly where he stood on every issue, and whether you agreed
with him or not, you appreciated his thoughtful and persuasive reasoning.
In the end, Alex Fiore accomplished what we should all strive for: He was
devoted to his family, he worked hard to be part of something positive,
he provided value to his community and in doing so he clearly made
Thousand Oaks a better place.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Fox</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem of Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   I mourn the death of Alex Fiore, the former mayor and city councilman
of Thousand Oaks. Even though I may have had my differences with him, I
cannot deny his devotion to the city of Thousand Oaks and his driving
ambition to create the city that he envisioned. Since we arrived in
Thousand Oaks, we've seen the creation of The Oaks mall, the Civic Arts
Plaza, Circuit City, the Teen Center (aptly named for Alex Fiore), Goebel
Center, the revamping of the Janss mall, the creation of the park behind
the main library, the creation of the Brimhall Library and the Newbury
Park Library and Dos Vientos. His accomplishments were many, and his
legacy will live for many years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Much to my surprise and amusement, I recall seeing Alex Fiore perform
in a local production of "Taming of the Shrew" at the Scherr Forum
shortly after its opening.</TE>
<TE>   I also recall the time I met Mr. Fiore at a forum I attended. The
conference was one of the "1,400" he attended in his time.</TE>
<TE>   Working on a committee recently at the Goebel Center in preparation
for a celebration of the center's founding, I had the opportunity to pore
over many pages of the center's scrapbooks documenting the center's
history. There were many pages in the book with Alex Fiore inspecting the
building of the center and being present at the opening day ceremonies
after the center was built. I recall the leadership Alex Fiore exhibited
to have the new Goebel Center rebuilt after a fire destroyed the complex
when it was close to completion. It would be fitting and proper to name a
room for Alex Fiore at the Goebel Center to complement the Fiore Teen
Center next door.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors' Push for Open Space</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would like to congratulate the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors on what will be regarded as a historic vote to back the
creation of an open-space district. I believe this action by our
supervisors will be as critical to the long-term quality of life in
Ventura County as the previous voter approval of the SOAR initiative.</LD>
<LD>   In deciding to vote for an open-space district, much was made by our
elected officials of the overwhelming support by county residents for
open-space preservation both at the ballot box and in polls. All
indications are that those same residents are just as concerned that the
Ahmanson Ranch be preserved as open space.</LD>
<LD>   I still find it amazing that the 1992 Board of Supervisors voted to
approve a project that so blatantly ignored their own development
policies in the Guidelines for Orderly Development. The current board
cannot reverse that vote but will soon have to decide whether to call for
a new environmental impact report on this project. The current EIR is so
old that it bears little relationship to the present realities. It is
only proper that the Board of Supervisors should ask for a new one.</LD>
<TE>   Neither side in the Ahmanson Ranch debate has shown any reluctance to
go to court over their differences, so I have no doubt that whichever way
the supervisors vote, Ventura County will end up in a litigious battle
over this.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors might want to consider this question when
voting on whether to call for a new EIR. Do the voters want Ventura
County's time and money spent fighting to force Washington Mutual to
produce a relevant environmental document or to oppose local
environmental groups who want an up-to-date analysis of the proposed
Ahmanson Ranch development?</TE>

<LD>I've lived a couple of blocks from Wildwood Elementary School for
19 years (Sheriff's Deputy Hurt When SUV Hits His Motorcycle," Jan. 11).
Driving past during rush hour used to be polite chaos; now, it borders on
urban warfare. I suspect that it's much the same around other schools.</LD>
<LD>   With the arrival of huge SUVs, cell phones, portable cappuccinos,
etc., many young mothers (pardon the usually accurate stereotype) have
become downright dangerous. Self-righteous behavior--such as double
parking while chatting with friends, parking illegally, blocking traffic,
making illegal and unsafe turns, crossing the street with total disregard
for traffic and flipping off anyone who would give them a short beep of
the horn--adds insult to injury.</LD>
<LD>   Many local residents drive way too fast around the school and on
adjoining streets. That's why the officer was working in this area. It's
sad and ironic that he met his fate at the hands of one he was there to
protect.</LD>
<TE>   Why don't the city, the school district, and the police work together
to address all aspects of these problems?</TE>

<HD>Deputies' Retirement Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When working Californians cannot even take full advantage of new
federal tax incentives to save for retirement and their children's
education, how can the Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. complain
about their already excessive retirement plan?</LD>
<LD>   The demands of the association are preposterous and the only reason
they have spiraled out of control is most people are too busy earning a
living, making ends meet and trying in between to put away for retirement
or children's college to get involved with politics. So the sheriffs
association greedily takes advantage of the situation. However in today's
fragile economy, where in addition to being financially prudent, we have
to be prepared for the unexpected, from earthquakes to terrorist attacks.
We cannot afford to bankrupt the county with outlandish retirement
demands and automatic salary increases.</LD>
<LD>   Most companies in the state are "at-will employers," which means that
employees can be let go at any time for almost any reason.</LD>
<TE>   If the deputies do not like their economic package, let them go
somewhere else. If they threaten to strike or walk out, replace them like
President Reagan did to the [air traffic] controllers. We need political
leaders like county Supervisor Judy Mikels that will stand up for what is
fiscally right for the majority and not function as a lobbyist for a
special-interest group--the Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs Assn.</TE>

<HD>Everything Seemed So Normal About Teen in Internet Scam</HD>
<DH>Profile: Cole Bartiromo is a bright student-athlete with an
affinity for trading sports cards. Friends, coaches are shocked by 'choir
boy's' alleged role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even by most teenagers' hectic schedules, Cole Bartiromo would have
been hard to keep up with.</LD>
<LD>   In November, the 17-year-old from Mission Viejo was going to high
school, attending baseball practice every weekday morning, pet-sitting
for a family next door, flipping pizzas at a neighborhood restaurant and,
according to federal authorities, masterminding an elaborate online
investment scam that swindled more than $1 million from investors
worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The next month, the curly-haired teenager neighbors call "choir boy
Cole" was selling candy for a baseball fund-raiser, working out with
teammates after school, shooting hoops with children on his suburban
cul-de-sac and, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
dodging investigators while brazenly stringing along his victims with
sophisticated e-mails.</LD>
<TE>   And three days after Christmas, in an unrelated incident, the bright
student-athlete was arrested at his house for allegedly shining a
powerful green laser at an Orange County sheriff's helicopter on routine
patrol over his neighborhood. When confronted, Bartiromo told deputies he
bought the laser on the Internet for $1,500 as a Christmas present for
himself, but didn't say what he planned to do with it. He was released to
his parents that night.</TE>
<TE>   The laser case is pending in juvenile court, but deputies viewed it as
frivolous horseplay, nothing serious like the SEC accusations that have
made Bartiromo the second youngest person to allegedly run afoul of
federal regulators in an Internet scheme.</TE>
<TE>   If what the SEC said in its civil complaint is true, Bartiromo is as
stealthy as he is sweet, as unscrupulous as he is industrious, as
arrogant as he is reserved. Yet not even his closest baseball teammates
seemed to have an inkling that there was anything out of the ordinary in
Cole's life.</TE>
<TE>   Cole and his parents have refused interviews since the SEC on Monday
accused the teenager of civil securities fraud. The agency said Bartiromo
agreed to turn over $900,000 that had been transferred to an account at a
Costa Rica-based casino, which he did on Friday. The teenager may have to
return additional funds as the SEC investigation continues, said an
agency attorney. And while the SEC's complaint did not name other
defendants, officials have declined to say whether Bartiromo acted alone
or had help.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing's mind-boggling," said Tim Ellis, Bartiromo's head
coach at Trabuco Hills High School, who has known the boy since his
freshman year. "I don't even know what to think."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with friends, neighbors and teammates, as well as various
court documents, depict Bartiromo as the eldest child in a close-knit
family that has at times been under significant stress, with two
bankruptcy filings, a foreclosure of their home and work-related injury
claims by Cole's father, John Bartiromo. Cole and his father are said to
be particularly close, and over the years they shared an escalating
passion for dealing in the sports memorabilia market.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Kiel, who coached Little League with John Bartiromo and has known
Cole since he was 10, says he thinks the boy's interest in sports card
trading led to his current troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "Cole has a heart of gold," said Kiel of Mission Viejo. "But he's also
very cunning and witty. He always had a great ability to put a deal
together, and it all started with the baseball trading cards."</TE>
<TE>Dreamed of Playing in the Big Leagues</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster, Bartiromo had dreams of playing in the big leagues.
And early on he showed promise. He was an all-star who helped his team
clinch a state championship and an outfielder who hit home runs when it
mattered.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a really good work ethic because he wanted to please his dad,"
said Ryan Clinkenbeard, a former Trabuco Hills teammate who last year
transferred to El Toro High School. "He wanted to help out his family and
repay his dad for everything he did for him."</TE>
<TE>   At home, Bartiromo's father was struggling to support a family of five
on a modest income working as a material handler for Southern California
Edison, where he has been employed for 16 years, according to court
records. In April 1993, with three small children in the house and
Bartiromo's mother, Jeanise, having just launched a home day care
business, the Bartiromos filed for bankruptcy. The filing shows monthly
income of $2,800 and almost $23,000 in credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, the Bartiromos were $23,000 in arrears on their
mortgage payments, and that prompted John Bartiromo, 44, to file another
bankruptcy petition. But the court dismissed the case, and in the summer
of 1997 the bank foreclosed on the Bartiromos' three-bedroom, two-bath
home.</TE>
<TE>   The Bartiromos did not move out, however. John Bartiromo's younger
sister, Donna Smallwood, and her husband bought the house from the lender
for $220,000.</TE>
<TE>   "John made payments to my husband, and we paid the mortgage company,"
Smallwood said. About a year later, property records show, John Bartiromo
purchased the house from the Smallwoods, then refinanced the loan in
November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   It was around that time, friends say, that Cole became increasingly
savvy in his sports cards dealings. He paired up with his dad to sell and
trade them on the Internet. They took regular trips to Seattle to track
down then-Mariner Ken Griffey Jr. for an autograph. They opened an EBay
account together under the screen name "TigerWoods" and boasted to
friends about getting handsome payouts for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   So occupied did Cole become with his collection of rare sports
cards--and with selling them over the Internet--that friends grew tired
of hearing about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It would get old after a while," said Kyle Allen, a former teammate
at Trabuco Hills who now pitches at Orange Coast College. He recalled the
living room walls at the Bartiromos' house as being plastered with
baseball pictures, posters and metal sports signs.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd always call him up to see what he was doing, but he'd just say
he was hanging out at home," Allen said. "Eventually, we just stopped
calling him."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cole and his father were apparently branching out into
other online business deals, and often bragged about the money they were
making. Tom Burson, whose son, Matt, has played baseball with Bartiromo
since Little League, recalled sitting in the stands with John Bartiromo,
watching the game and listening to him chat about successes in
day-trading stocks. Burson said Cole, too, talked about buying and
selling stocks at a time when the market was soaring a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were doing pretty well there for a while," Burson said.
"But then . . . they didn't mention it again. I assume because they got
hammered like everyone else."</TE>
<TE>Part of Time Share in Las Vegas Sold Online</TE>
<TE>   Last April, saying he needed money to put his two kids through
college, John Bartiromo sold part of the time share he owns at the Jockey
Club Resort in Las Vegas. The buyer, Darlene Tornes of Ohio, said she
bought the time share--a penthouse suite on the Strip--on EBay for
$5,600. Property records show Bartiromo bought the time share for $10,000
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was only making $200 or $300 a year by renting the week
out," Tornes said. "So I'm sure the money he got by selling would help
him with his kids." The Bartiromos also have two daughters, 15 and 11.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, John Bartiromo was contending with a job-related back
injury, according to a state Workers' Compensation Appeals Board file. A
doctor's report last March said he first injured his lower back lifting
70-pound rolls of guy wire in 1986 and re-injured it several times in the
following years, records show.</TE>
<TE>   Edison and Bartiromo settled the workers' compensation claim in 1999,
although there appeared to be ongoing issues. Bartiromo recently returned
to work in a new position as a business analyst, according to an Edison
spokesman and Bartiromo's sister.</TE>
<TE>   "He was home a lot there for a while," said neighbor Michael
Greenwood. "But I don't think he ever missed a baseball game."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether John Bartiromo was working during November and
December, when SEC officials said Cole pulled off the intricate scheme.
Jeanise Bartiromo, 44, is employed as a substitute clerk for a local
school district, working on an as-needed basis.</TE>
<TE>   Cole and his dad were often together, friends say, and by last summer
they had become successful enough in the world of sports card trading
that ESPN took an interest. In an August interview, the father and son
spoke to a reporter about their Tiger Woods cards from Sports
Illustrated's SI for Kids magazine.</TE>
<TE>   An investor on EBay, John Bartiromo said, had indicated to them that
one of the cards--deemed to be the closest thing to a rookie card for the
golf superstar--had "six figure potential," but he wouldn't name the
investor and it is unclear whether a sale was ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Baik, who owns a sports card shop in Mission Viejo, said Cole
Bartiromo often stopped in before or after school last fall, and
excitedly chatted about the sales he made on the Internet. While deciding
on which pack of baseball cards he wanted to purchase from Baik that day,
Cole sometimes talked about money.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a lot," Baik said. "I know he made a lot more at it than I
do. One time he said he sold a card for $1,700."</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents and interviews with investors, however,
it was sporting events rather than trading cards that was at the core of
the Web site Invest Better 2001. Beginning on Nov. 1, the SEC said Cole
promised investors huge short-term returns with no risk by letting him
pool their cash and place bets with online sports books.</TE>
<TE>   On the site, Cole offered a "Christmas Miracle" package, with returns
of up to 2,500%.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Bartiromo actually placed bets or kept the money is not yet
known. But whereas Bartiromo was once boastful about his online earnings,
he didn't reveal the slightest clue about his new venture, which would
have added to his already hectic schedule as the holidays were nearing.</TE>
<TE>Worked at a Pizza Parlor for 3 Weeks</TE>
<TE>   In early November, Cole approached Baik at the sports card shop in
Mission Viejo and said he wanted to get a job to earn some money for the
holidays. Baik directed him next door to a Rubino's pizza restaurant, and
Cole started working in the kitchen part time. He quit about three weeks
later, according to manager Joe Chiappone, but didn't say why.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and teammates said they didn't notice a difference in
Bartiromo's lifestyle. Jim Byrne, who has lived next door to the
Bartiromos for 12 years, said he asked Cole to watch his dog over the
Thanksgiving holiday while they were out of town.</TE>
<TE>   "We paid him $10," Byrne said. "And he sure was happy to get that."</TE>
<TE>   By early December, authorities said, Cole knew they were closing in
and he sought to evade them by telling investors he had to take his
operation "private" and communicate only through e-mail. But angry
investors already were barraging Invest Better 2001 with complaints about
not receiving scheduled payouts. Cole defended his program as the "real
deal" and quickly deleted critical feedback from the site, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the teenager, who plays outfield for his baseball team, was
working out in the gym after school and making all his morning practices.
Cole had been a reserve player in his junior year on the varsity team,
but mostly sat on the bench. This year, Cole has been designated to
start, and the gangly left fielder, with good speed, a quick bat and a
below-average throwing arm was getting ready for the season.</TE>
<TE>   During December, he could also be seen regularly shooting baskets with
younger neighborhood children in front of his house. About the only
entrepreneurial streak he displayed publicly was for a team fund-raiser,
in which he put peanut butter cups in a small cooler and carried it to
class, to keep the candy from melting.</TE>
<TE>   "He figured they were better cold," said former teammate Ryan
Clinkenbeard. "He was the only kid walking around with an ice chest full
of candy and selling them in class."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 13, the SEC filed an action in federal court in New York to
stop Invest Better 2001, without naming any individuals in the complaint.
The week before Christmas break, authorities said, Cole removed the
Invest Better 2001 Web site and the operation collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure that the accused is a 17-year-old who is so ordinary--a
kid who adores Ken Griffey Jr., rap music and his stripped-down blue
pickup truck--has puzzled and shocked Cole's world, on and off the
baseball field.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Kiel, who has gone fishing with the Bartiromos in Dana Point,
said he e-mailed John Bartiromo after news of the SEC settlement came out
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He replied by saying, 'There goes the college fund,' " Kiel recalled.
" 'I'll hire the best attorneys I can . . . and see if we can get out of
this."'</TE>
<TE>   At a winter league baseball game last week, John Bartiromo showed up
to coach as planned. But before the game, he chatted with other parents
in the stands and apologized for the "media circus" that had surrounded
Cole and the team over the prior few days.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Cole played solidly in left field, and hit a line drive up
the middle in his first at bat. He made it safely to first.</TE>

<HD>Budget Cuts Hit Poor the Hardest</HD>
<DH>Spending: In attempting to ease a $12-billion shortfall without
raising taxes, Davis targets programs for some of the most vulnerable
members of society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Faced with a $12-billion budget shortfall, Gov. Gray Davis has
targeted his deepest cuts at some of California's most vulnerable
residents, from welfare recipients to low-income working parents to the
mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   Of the $2.6 billion in spending Davis has proposed shedding in the
2002-03 budget, about half comes out of programs relied on by the poor.
Programs that provide them with medical and dental services, child care
and housing would take at least a $1.1-billion hit.</LD>
<LD>   Davis conceded during the unveiling of his budget Thursday that some
of the cuts would be difficult to make. But his administration defended
the spending plan, saying the governor's proposal to overcome the
shortfall by borrowing more than $5 billion against future revenue rather
than making deeper budget cuts maintains the social safety net.</LD>
<TE>   Even critics of the Democratic governor quickly acknowledged that his
proposals pale in severity compared with cutbacks made by former Gov.
Pete Wilson, who faced a worse budget mess.</TE>
<TE>   Yet liberal lawmakers and social service advocates fear that the plan
erodes many of the gains they have made since Davis was elected in 1998.
Some are upset--but not surprised--that in an election year, the governor
would spare politically sensitive areas such as education and public
safety but take aim at programs for people with less political clout.</TE>
<TE>   "The cuts all seem to fall on the most disadvantaged Californians,"
said Casey McKeever, directing attorney for the Sacramento office of the
Western Center on Law and Poverty, an advocacy group for the poor. "Even
Gov. Wilson had some additional measures that affected upper-income
taxpayers and other parts of the population."</TE>
<TE>   The list of cuts Davis is proposing includes eliminating two elements
of CalWORKS, the state's welfare-to-work program: $36 million for adult
education and career training and $58 million to help community colleges
develop programs to assist welfare recipients. It also freezes a
cost-of-living increase in welfare benefits and aid to the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   A major budget-driven reform would require the state's child care
programs to do more with less, a strategy that some question.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials are pushing the changes because they
are concerned that the welfare-to-work program is resulting in a flood of
expensive new child care costs from former welfare recipients who are
moving into the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   They also are responding to criticism that low-income families that
were never on welfare have a harder time getting child care subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   But the reforms are expected to encounter resistance in the
Legislature, particularly from the Women's Caucus, which has pushed to
protect the quality of care. Davis' budget would add 100,000 children who
are currently on child care waiting lists.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it would toughen the eligibility requirement for
households seeking child care, from 75% of the state's median income to
as low as 60%, or from roughly $30,000 to $24,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   It also would increase co-payments for child care, as in the Wisconsin
model adopted under former Gov. Tommy Thompson, the welfare reform leader
who now heads the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And it
would lower state reimbursement payments for child care providers, which
critics fear would erode both the quality and availability of the care.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' proposal to tighten the income requirements for child care
strikes not at the poorest Californians but at working-class people
teetering on the edge of insolvency, said Bruce Fuller, a UC Berkeley
professor of education and public policy.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a choice between massive child care bills and staying home,
some low-income parents might choose unemployment, reversing a critical
welfare-to-work incentive strategy, Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   "You knock out of the subsidy system thousands of families that earn
between $24,000 and $34,000 a year," he said. "You're not talking about
the hard-core poor, but you're talking about folks who are working at a
Denny's in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "The upside [of the Davis budget] is he wants to stay the course on
school reform," Fuller added. "The downside is that he doesn't want to do
anything that erodes his support in white suburban areas. Bad times can
give a window for serious structural reform, but Davis is so risk-averse
that he forgoes that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Repeated cuts under Wilson left many social service agencies with
diminished expectations and an attitude of defeat. Their sense of
gratitude for gains made in Davis' first three years has somewhat diluted
their outrage at his proposed cuts this time around.</TE>
<TE>   "We were wildly ecstatic that we got anything," said Randall Hagar,
legislative director for the California chapter of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they worry about giving back ground on programs that, in many
cases, are still in formative stages. One example of the turnaround:
Under Davis' proposal, a housing initiative by the Department of Mental
Health would lose 75% of its $25-million allotment.</TE>
<TE>   "That just really hurts," Hagar said.</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates said the seesawing,
give-in-one-year-then-take-away-the-next elements in Davis' budget
present a more systemic problem: Programs don't ever take root, making
long-term progress much more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to address the instability of the state budget," said Jim
Keddy, director of the Pacific Institute for Community Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be so reliant on the stock market and capital gains. We need
to look more at taxes and fees, for income streams that will be steady."</TE>
<TE>   Though Davis is clearly trying to chart a middle course, his budget is
being assailed by Republicans, who say the state needs to cut more
programs instead of mortgaging its future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the beginning of a football game, and the first play he's
calling is a punt," said Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), vice
chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not really dealing with the fundamental issue of the imbalance
between revenues and spending. When he takes 60% of the deficit and deals
with it with loans and accounting changes, he is not dealing with the
issue."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, leading Democrats, including Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco), support raising taxes rather than eroding
the level of social services.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Davis faces a tough political fight in getting the two-thirds
approval he needs to pass the budget this summer as he attempts to wade
between liberals and conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I am not prepared to accept we have to make these
cuts. You have to make sure you are not being penny wise and pound
foolish," said Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), who heads the
Assembly's budget subcommittee on health and welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a value judgment we have to make. We're Democrats, and I think
we need to consider other sources of revenue."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker-elect Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) believes that
lawmakers will find ways to make the cuts more acceptable. But the
seriousness of the shortfall will clearly require some difficult choices,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned, without a doubt, but I am not alarmed [about cuts in
social programs], because I know we will have a deliberative process," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when we have a surplus, the budget is a painful exercise, and
this is going to be a more painful exercise."</TE>

<HD>Torchbearers' Trip of Triumph</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Many of the people who will carry the flame through
California this week have surmounted daunting odds.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a short jog, less than the length of a running track. But this
is not a race about speed or distance.</LD>
<LD>   The scores of people who will carry the Olympic Torch through
California this week have already run the distance in ways both
incredible and modest. They have survived rare illnesses, founded
charitable groups, rescued the injured, lived long and been just plain
nice to others.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, a few celebrities such as astronaut Sally Ride, Olympic
gold medalist Rafer Johnson and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger will join
their ranks as the relay wends its way through California streets--from
San Diego through Newport Beach, on to Los Angeles and north to San Luis
Obispo.</LD>
<TE>   As they run, walk or roll wheelchairs down the road beginning Monday
and ending Thursday, the torchbearers intend to hold high the flame that
unites them.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I find is that everybody I know who had been chosen is part
of a community," said torchbearer Gilbert Martin of West Covina, a
neonatologist who for years has healed the tiniest of babies. "My whole
life is wrapped up in next Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   For Martin and others, carrying the torch seems to embody their life's
work and focus their triumphs into one proud moment, a rare opportunity
for friends and family to publicly cheer them on.</TE>
<TE>   "For this country, it offers an opportunity to take part in something
immensely symbolic," said Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur
Athletic Foundation, which was founded with money generated by the 1984
Los Angeles Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a part of something so big and so good . . . so reaffirming to
me," said Judy Willis, 52, of Santa Barbara, a doctor who traded her
neurology practice for the classroom. In the last five years she has
survived a skiing accident that tore up her leg and battled cervical
cancer. Today she is cancer-free and teaching fifth-graders at Laguna
Blanca School.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that Evita LaVoie, an 18-year-old high school
student from Banning, has had to acknowledge that, yes, she is
extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 8, her skull was fractured in a car accident, requiring
brain surgery that resulted in a frontal lobotomy and a 50-50 chance of
survival.</TE>
<TE>   She lost all memory and physical abilities. "I had to learn to walk,
read and write all over again," she said. Today, Evita is a varsity
cross-country runner, soccer and basketball player at Banning High. And
an honor student.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, she said, pain shoots through her head right behind her
eyes, sometimes requiring hospitalization. But her 7:40 a.m. run down a
Laguna Beach street Tuesday--to the applause of classmates and
family--will be yet another saving moment:</TE>
<TE>   "When I run, it eases my mind," she said. "It's the only time I don't
have headaches."</TE>
<TE>   When the torch passes through Los Angeles, the public is invited to
three-city sponsored celebrations Tuesday. Spectators should plan on
gathering about 11 a.m. at Olvera Street, 2 p.m. at the Coliseum and 7
p.m. at Universal CityWalk.</TE>
<TE>   The first torch relay was created for the 1936 Berlin Games by Dr.
Carl Diem of Germany, who was inspired by Greek drawings, according to
information on the Salt Lake City Games' Web site. During the ancient
Olympic Games in Greece, a sacred flame burned at the altar of Zeus, in
whose honor the Games were played.</TE>
<TE>   A white-robed actress playing the role of priestess lighted the flame
for the 2002 Games on Nov. 19 in Olympia, Greece.</TE>
<TE>   The Torch Relay, which culminates Feb. 8 with its arrival for opening
ceremonies in Salt Lake City, includes 11,500 U.S. torchbearers, who will
have traversed 13,500 miles through 46 states.</TE>
<TE>   The karate coach, the school principal, the soldier and the mom were
each nominated by someone who considers him or her a hero. Anyone could
go into a Chevrolet dealership and fill out a nomination form, buy a can
of soda from a participating Coca-Cola retailer and pick up a form from
the cashier, or go online and tell the Olympic Committee why this person
embodied the Olympic spirit. In the end, more than 210,000 nominations
flowed into the sponsors, along with 100-word-or-less essays. Chevrolet
and Coca-Cola randomly selected their nominees and then verified the
stories. The Olympic Committee assigned groups of community leaders to
select its pool.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the torchbearers didn't know they had been nominated. One was
close to purging his e-mail notification, thinking it was spam.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just checking my e-mail and saw: 'Congratulations, you have
been selected to carry the Olympic Torch,' " recalled Mark Johnson,
assistant principal at Salesian High School in Boyle Heights. "I was
going to delete it and then for some reason decided to open it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's sister Tracy nominated him because, as she wrote, he is a
"teacher, coach, friend, and motivator . . . but most importantly . . .
the BEST big brother."</TE>
<TE>   Another athlete attempted to shrug it off.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I thought it was a joke," said Dean Maccabe, 38, of
Santa Ana. A stranger, moved after reading about Maccabe in a newspaper
article, submitted his name.</TE>
<TE>   Maccabe is a Paralympic gold medalist. He lost the use of his legs two
decades ago when he broke his neck diving off a rocky crag near Corona
del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not so bad; I get some great parking spaces now," Maccabe said.
"You have to have a sense of humor. Life is too short."</TE>
<TE>   It was a rough start, though. A couple of years were mired in
depression and physical therapy. Maccabe eventually found his love of
sports again in the form of wheelchair rugby. He is a member of the U.S.
team, which won the gold medal at the Paralympic Games in Sydney,
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a visit to the White House and an article about his life in
a local newspaper. Early last year, a man who saw Maccabe at a local
Kinko's recognized him from the news article.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Maccabe got a call from that stranger, who explained
that he had submitted a nomination for him and that it had been accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Walker, the Torch Relay spokesman, has accompanied the 50-Chevy
caravan since the beginning and can recount many poignant moments:</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad Ali lighted the torch in Atlanta and passed it to Peggy
Fleming, who ran the first leg. Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
carried it in honor of emergency workers who died Sept. 11. Torchbearers
who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks ran with it through New
York. In Oklahoma, the torchbearer paused at the reflecting pool memorial
at the site of the Oklahoma City bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The nominating essays told their stories in a few moving sentences.</TE>
<TE>   First Sgt. Maryann Enciso of the Air National Guard has served in the
military for 18 years. The Hemet woman is dedicating her run to her
troops. "This one is for you, because you are always there when we need
you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Bernal of Twentynine Palms served in the Marine Corps and
California Highway Patrol for 20 years. She was severely injured when she
was hit by a drunk driver. It took her four years to recover, but she is
not back on duty and "she's helping me through college," her son wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Granados of Bellflower emigrated from Mexico as a teenager with
little education, worked to support her family of four children, learned
English, graduated from high school, became a citizen and recently
completed the L.A. Marathon. "She is amazing," her nominator wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The selection committee was so moved by the essay written by Nicole
Ostoya's husband, Jacek, that they are both running. The Los Angeles
couple's first child, Milla, was born with a rare genetic disorder that
left her physically and mentally handicapped. Then Jacek, an architect,
was diagnosed with cancer in his right hand, for which he is undergoing
chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Nicole was our pillar of strength, never letting adversity get our
family down. . . . She inspired all to stay positive and productive,"
wrote Jacek, who will pass the torch to his wife Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is "everywoman" Eve Jaffe, 38, of Pacific Palisades, whose
husband wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "She represents every mom that toils to inspire her children. . . .
She doesn't make headline news and doesn't win contests. But at the end
of the day she hopes she has lit the spiritual torch in her children."</TE>
<TE>   Eve Jaffe hears the words for the first time and gets all choked up.
"You know, I'm fairly unremarkable. . . . But I just love him to pieces
for doing this for me."</TE>

<HD>Milking the Legend of a Weeping Apparition</HD>
<DH>Sales: Ad centers on a Latin American myth about a woman who killed
her children and then herself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would you buy soap from Jeffrey Dahmer or a used car from Ted
Bundy? No? Then would you drink milk on the recommendation of a weeping
ghost who murdered her children?</LD>
<LD>   That's what California milk producers are about to find out. Beginning
Monday, the milk board famous for its "Got Milk?" campaign will initiate
a $2-million advertising blitz featuring La Llorona, the subject of a
Latin American legend about a woman who killed her children, then
herself, after losing her husband's affections.</LD>
<LD>   The legend is so deeply embossed on the fabric of Latin culture that
all it takes to correct a wayward child is for a parent to warn, "If you
don't behave, La Llorona will come for you."</LD>
<TE>   In the commercial, the shrouded ghost goes to the refrigerator for
milk and, finding the carton empty, goes off weeping. If the idea is
radical, the team behind it is just as unusual. The campaign was
developed by four Latino students at the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   For Tania Sosa, the project was the chance of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's overwhelming," said the 27-year-old woman who lives in Marina
del Rey. "I never thought I'd have a commercial so soon."</TE>
<TE>   Though pleased that Sosa and her fellow students incorporated a
cultural legend in a mainstream ad campaign, some in the Latino community
wonder if it makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother used to say, 'La Llorona is coming to get you,' " said
Gabriela Lemus, director of policy for the League of United Latin
American Citizens in Washington. "I don't know if I'd buy milk from
someone who was trying to kill me."</TE>
<TE>   The only word spoken by the ghost is leche, Spanish for milk. But
producers are confident that the "Got Milk?" campaign is so well
imprinted that it won't be a problem for non-Spanish speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Manning, spokesman for the California Milk Advisory Board in
Berkeley, said the ad will represent one of the few times that Spanish
has been used to sell a product on English-language TV.</TE>
<TE>   Though recognizing that the choice of a murderous ghost as a
pitchwoman could be controversial, milk board officials said it would
have been indefensible to do nothing in the face of statistics showing
that teenagers are drinking less milk.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we taking a chance? Absolutely," said Manning. "I hope it's an
intelligent risk."</TE>
<TE>   He said that teenagers are a large part of the milk market but that
consumption is "trending down." They drank milk about 4.5 times a day in
2000, down from 6.9 times a day in 1993, according to the board. Part of
the reason might be that youths are also eating less cold cereal, the
board says.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about this trend, producers commissioned a study two years ago
to find out what was going on. They got good and bad news.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, Latino teenagers, especially the critically important
bicultural youths whose families had been in America a generation or two,
were very familiar with--and liked--the "Got Milk?" campaign. They could
even recall early spots such as the one showing a young man eating a
peanut butter sandwich trying to answer the phone-quiz question, "Who
shot Aaron Burr?"</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, that didn't make them drink more.</TE>
<TE>   That left the producers and advertising people in a quandary.
Penetration and likability are measures of success, but they aren't
success. So they decided to use kids to sell to the kids, contacting Art
Center and offering to let students design the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The center gathered together four Latino students: Sosa, Jose Rennard,
David Delgado and Ali Alvarez. Though they were older than the target
audience, Manning said, they were young enough to know the culture, yet
sophisticated enough to brainstorm effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa said one advantage was that they came from a variety of
backgrounds. Her father was an architect in Mexico City. Another
student's family owns a restaurant chain, Fiesta Grande. Another is
half-Irish, half-Argentine.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of sleepless nights," Sosa said. "We would get together
with a ton of coffee" at a restaurant in Hollywood. Initially, they came
up with 23 ideas.</TE>
<TE>   One that wasn't accepted revolved around a jalapeno-eating contest.
Another featured a contest between dueling disc jockeys trying to knock a
glass of milk off a speaker. The La Llorona idea came up early.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us knew the story," said Sosa. "That's how we knew we might
have something."</TE>
<TE>   They went to San Francisco and pitched it to Manning and Jeff Goodby
of Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, which launched the original "Got
Milk?" campaign in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was kind of scared" of the idea, Sosa said of Goodby.
"It's a really gross story."</TE>
<TE>   The legend surrounds a young woman who bears her husband two children.
Afterward, he loses interest in her and she becomes disconsolate. Out of
her head, she drowns her children. Then, realizing what she's done, she
kills herself. Now a spirit, she stalks the Earth looking for her
children.</TE>
<TE>   Lemus of the League of United Latin American Citizens said the
commercial is not offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand she's a symbol," said Lemus, who holds a degree in
marketing. "From an artistic perspective, it's really a powerful legend."</TE>
<TE>   She's just not sure how it will stimulate the appetite.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment at least, milk officials don't consider that a problem.
For one thing, a primary target is Latinos who speak Spanish but watch
many of the same shows that whites do. It also has the advantage of doing
something radically different.</TE>
<TE>   "People are familiar with 'Got Milk?' " said Manning. The problem is:
That familiarity makes it "progressively more difficult to surprise" the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question, many people who are Anglo will not understand the
myth of La Llorona," he said. "That's a risk we're willing to take."</TE>
<TE>   In test screenings, he said, Latino teenagers reacted with pleasure to
the ad. "They thought it was interesting that we unearthed something only
they knew about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The whites in the group were puzzled. When they asked who she was, the
Latinos all shouted, "She's La Llorona."</TE>
<TE>   "If that happened in high schools around California, I'd be a happy
guy," Manning said.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial will run only in California at first, but is being
offered to other regions.</TE>

<DL>JAMESTOWN
</DL>
<LD>Several years ago an editor suggested I might want to develop a
stable of column "characters," regulars with quirky lives or droll habits
who could be written about on the proverbial rainy day.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, I believe the editor was trying to tell me, with polite
indirectness, to stop writing so much about workers' compensation reform,
the raging issue of the day.</LD>
<LD>   I scanned my universe, searching for family members or friends with
"character" potential. Alas, there was not a single wisecracking
pickpocket or philosopher-plumber in the bunch. Fortunately, it was
around this time that I came to know Ron DeLacy.</LD>
<TE>   DeLacy by day covers the Gold Country for the Modesto Bee. His
journalistic reputation was secured when he managed to navigate into
print a defense lawyer's complaint that the prosecutor had continually,
and with mischievous intent, passed gas throughout closing arguments,
distracting the jury.</TE>
<TE>   By night DeLacy is a musician, performing comedy folk music with a
band, Doodoo Wah. He writes most of the songs, and on stage is a master
of the hangdog expression and the comic pause. He also is a prankster.
Years ago DeLacy and a few friends formed a mythical organization called
the Men's Crisis Center. It was meant as a spoof on gender warfare, a
frequent Doodoo Wah theme: Alimony, Sally honey / keeps me thinking of
you. . . . Etc.</TE>
<TE>   In short, DeLacy is a character, and over seven years of friendship he
has proved to a reliable source of bizarre material. He calls frequently
to pass along tips from the Mother Lode about strange legal proceedings
or weird animal stories or assorted oddities that occur in his personal
life.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I tell you about my court case?" he asked the other day. I had
stopped by his office in Jamestown on my way to Angels Camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago," he began, "I got a bulk-mailed letter from an
attorney in the Bay Area, telling me I was a potential litigant in a
lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   He'd received similar solicitations before, usually involving
credit-card cases. His practice had been to toss them in the trash.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason," he said, "I read this one and . . . oh, man. Men's
Crisis Center stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "The law firm was suing Wal-Mart on behalf of all men who went to a
Wal-Mart garage and got their oil changed on Ladies Day, and who
therefore were charged $3.74 more than women were charged.</TE>
<TE>   "My name had come up when the law firm subpoenaed some Wal-Mart
records. I could sign on to the lawsuit free, and if it was successful
I'd give the law firm a third of the loot."</TE>
<TE>   The letter was from Donald P. Driscoll, an Albany attorney who once
made headlines by running a sting operation against stores that sold
cigarettes to minors. Driscoll dispatched underage cohorts to thousands
of markets and liquor stores and the like. Those who sold cigarettes to
the youngsters would receive follow-up letters from the attorney,
proposing settlement terms.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Driscoll said the Wal-Mart case began one day in the
mid-1990s. The brother of his assistant, the attorney said, "needed an
oil change." He went to Wal-Mart. It was Ladies Day. The promotion seemed
on its face to run afoul of a 1985 ruling by the state Supreme Court, a
decision that had generated plenty of publicity at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The court had found that "ladies' nights" at bars, "ladies days" at
carwashes and the like violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act's provision on
sex discrimination. It would be equally unlawful to stage "Men's Nights"
promotions, the court held.</TE>
<TE>   The late Chief Justice Rose Bird wrote the unanimous decision, noting:
"Some may consider such practices to be of minimal importance or to be
essentially harmless. Yet, many other individuals, men and women alike,
are greatly offended by such discriminatory practices."</TE>
<TE>   Driscoll initially attempted to package the case as a class-action
lawsuit. When this effort was stymied, he contacted 1,770 males who,
according to Wal-Mart records, had paid full price--$18, plus change--for
oil changes on days when women were charged $15 flat. He invited them to
sue as individuals. The cases eventually would be consolidated.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Wal-Mart contended that it meant no harm. The idea was
to scatter its "express lube" business through the week, easing the
weekend crush.</TE>
<TE>   "We had Men's Day and Veterans Day and also a Ladies Day. . . .
Certainly there was no intent on Wal-Mart's part to discriminate against
anybody," Bill Wertz, a company official, said Friday. When asked his
title, Wertz said "spokesman for the company will do--or spokesperson,
depending on your style."</TE>
<TE>   DeLacy signed on for the legal ride. He took a vacation day to drive
down to Sacramento and be deposed by a Wal-Mart lawyer: "I wore my Men's
Crisis Center T-shirt, and swore under oath that I was a man."</TE>
<TE>   He subsequently received word that Wal-Mart was moving to jettison his
complaint on statute-of-limitations grounds. He figured the adventure was
over. In late November, however, there came another letter from Driscoll:
Now Wal-Mart was willing to settle for the minimum fine permitted under
the Unruh Act. If DeLacy agreed, he and more than 1,500 other plaintiffs
would receive $1,000 each--minus the $333.33 in attorney's fees, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   The check arrived on Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Ron if his conscience was troubled at all, accepting the
money.</TE>
<TE>   No, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No amount of money," he said, mournfully shaking his head, "can truly
compensate me for the shame and humiliation I felt, paying full price on
Ladies Day."</TE>
<TE>   And then, as characters will do at such moments, he winked.</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: DeLacy took his $666.67 and bought a 1966 Ford Econoline
van to haul around music gear. It broke down as he was driving it home
from the lot. And the goddess of justice grinned.</TE>

<HD>'Arrows' From the Heart Find Target</HD>
<DH>Cowboy culture: Baxter Black's careers include rancher,
veterinarian, poet and novelist. He also considered designing a different
sort of steed: cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE ARRILLAGA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BENSON, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>He calls them arrows in the sky, and Baxter Black has shot off
plenty.</LD>
<LD>   Take his introduction to country singer Red Steagall in 1979, by way
of a horse-clipper salesman. Black was working as a large-animal
veterinarian in Idaho, writing songs on the side. He sent a tape of his
ditties off with the salesman, hoping it would somehow land in the hands
of someone famous.</LD>
<LD>   It landed in Steagall's, who called Black and told him he wanted to
record one of his tunes. He invited him to his ranch in Texas, and there
the amateur troubadour discovered his true calling.</LD>
<TE>   One day, out on the porch, Steagall produced an autographed copy of
Carlos Ashley's "That Spotted Sow." Each took turns reading excerpts of
what Black could only describe as masterful cowboy poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just overwhelmed," Black recalls. "It was what I thought I was
trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Black hit the entertainment circuit full
time--performing poems rather than songs. Today he is revered as one of
the greatest cowboy poets of his time.</TE>
<TE>   Bull's-eye. The arrow struck, and he hasn't lost his aim since.</TE>
<TE>   From his chance beginning as a newspaper columnist to his six-year
stint on "The Tonight Show," his role as a cowboy commentator on National
Public Radio and his adventures as an author, Black has managed to turn a
fledgling career as a songwriter into a one-man entertainment empire.</TE>
<TE>   He credits the arrows. Steagall, a close friend since their first
encounter, cites something else.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees things that nobody else sees," Steagall says. "He has an
imagination that is unparalleled."</TE>
<TE>   With a shaggy mustache that curls down to his chin, his bright
bandannas and personalized spurs that read "Baxter," Black is the
quintessential cowboy humorist. He doesn't recite his poems; he performs
them. Eyes widen, arms flap, strange sounds come from his curled lips.
Like the Jerry Lewis of cowboy poetry, he falls to the ground,
sacrificing body and bones for the art.</TE>
<TE>   Through Black's eyes, shoeing a horse becomes a merry melee that ends
in "a cross between the tomb of Gen'ral Grant and a Puppy Chow explosion
at the Alpo Dog Food plant."</TE>
<TE>   Pickup trucks are like welding gloves: "The pockmarks are part of the
deal. Not pretty, just built to get the job done. Like the dummy behind
the wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Parsley puts a potato on trial for vegetable defamation ("You
incipient fern!"), and the tale of a runaway cow becomes a "Loose Cow
Party": "Helpful tourists waved and hollered, horsemen galloped to and
fro. Swingin' ropes like polo players, someone takin' video."</TE>
<TE>   Black's wild imagination almost led to a career designing cars, a
hobby when he was a boy growing up in rural West Virginia. It didn't take
long, however, for him to realize his future was animals.</TE>
<TE>   'Course, he thought he'd be raising them, not writing about them.</TE>
<TE>   Black's dad, an agriculture professor, was from a farm family, and
Black grew up milking cows and raising sheep. He attended agriculture
school at New Mexico State University, where he devised a plan to make
his entry into ranching.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured if I went to vet school and I wanted to get a job on a cow
outfit, they'd say, 'Well what can you do?' And I could say: 'I can fix
your cow.' "</TE>
<TE>   And so Black became a large-animal veterinarian. Not long after
graduation, he landed a job in Idaho as the company vet for one of the
largest cattle operations in the country. There, his world changed.</TE>
<TE>   He traveled the West visiting ranching operations, rubbing spurs with
all the cowboys and listening to their tales of life on the range. Soon,
Black was telling his own stories.</TE>
<TE>   "When somebody got bucked off at feedlot No. 1 and I went to the
dairy, I would tell the story," he says. "By the time I told that story
20 times, it was hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   Black was writing his songs on the side, hoping to make it big in
country music. Then one day he decided to combine his tunes and his
tales, and he turned one of his stories into a poem.</TE>
<TE>   When he recited it before a bunch of cowhands, he could see the
difference in their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly," he says, "I saw these people seeing themselves recognized
in a permanent way. Jokes and stories are built on slippery soil. But
when you write a poem, you are welding words into place."</TE>
<TE>   About the time he met Steagall and discovered that cowboy poetry could
be more than a hobby, Black left the ranching operation and took a job in
Denver diagnosing trouble calls for a pharmaceutical company.</TE>
<TE>   His duties included speaking at agriculture meetings, be it about
lameness or pneumonia or bovine viral diarrhea. He incorporated his poems
into the program and developed a following.</TE>
<TE>   In his two years with the company, he did some 250 programs. When he
was laid off in 1982, requests for Black kept coming.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time somebody called, I said, 'Well, can you pay me?' And
that's how it started," he says. "I spent five years keeping my vet
licenses up, thinking I was going to get another job. Finally I said,
'This is a job, I think.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of course, more arrows came into play. When he first started speaking
at the agriculture meetings, an editor for a small Colorado newspaper
approached him about writing a column. Black thought, "Why not?" Today,
his weekly column runs in 130 newspapers in the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the year of the great fires at Yellowstone National Park,
Black got peeved at National Public Radio for dedicating too little
coverage to the situation out West. He shipped them a few poems related
to fire and drought. Next thing he knew he was a commentator on NPR.</TE>
<TE>   Then a publishing company came calling after hearing Black on the
radio. It wanted to print his poetry, but Black already had been
publishing his own poetry collections and doing just fine, thank you very
much. "What else have you got?" they asked. Next thing he knew he'd
published his first novel, "Hey, Cowboy, Wanna Get Lucky?"</TE>
<TE>   And so it's gone for Baxter Black, the car designer turned
large-animal vet turned songwriter turned poet turned commentator turned
novelist.</TE>
<TE>   At 56, he's still going strong, although he whittled his show schedule
to about 70 appearances a year after the birth of his son eight years
ago. These days he tries to balance staying at home and working on his
ranch, south of Tucson, with hitting the road to tell the travails of
other ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Although my desire to perform is bone deep, I enjoy being home over
the weekend and being able to go with my boy and gather the cows," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he adds, "you gotta keep firing those arrows in the sky. I
still do that. That's my modus operandi. Shoot those arrows in the sky.
You're gonna hit something."</TE>

<HD>LAFCO Could Force Transfer of L.A. Assets to Valley, Lawyer Says</HD>
<DH>Secession: Breakaway city may not have to pay compensation, state
legal opinion contends. Some officials dispute findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contradicting lawyers for the county and city, a state attorney
Saturday said Los Angeles can be ordered to transfer police stations,
parks and other assets to a proposed San Fernando Valley city without
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   The legal opinion by the state legislative counsel sparked new debate
over how much power the Local Agency Formation Commission has in ordering
the division of assets if the Valley, harbor area and Hollywood break
away from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The county counsel, who advises LAFCO, and city attorney, who
represents Los Angeles, have released legal opinions that concluded LAFCO
does not have authority to order Los Angeles to transfer assets to the
proposed new cities without compensation or consent.</LD>
<TE>   "The county counsel ignored every scrap of case law on the subject and
now has been authoritatively repudiated by the very office that drafted
those laws," said state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who
released the state opinion during a news conference in front of the Van
Nuys government center Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials have attempted to use the leverage from the
county legal opinion to demand financial concessions from a Valley city
in exchange for giving consent to transferring assets to a proposed city
at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have offered to relinquish control of assets in the
Valley without requiring compensation, but only if the Valley reaches an
agreement that otherwise makes Los Angeles financially whole for other
costs.</TE>
<TE>   But because those costs, including lost revenue to Los Angeles, are
still in dispute, LAFCO's power to settle the issue is key.</TE>
<TE>   If compensation is mandated, it could threaten the financial viability
of a Valley city, which LAFCO has found would otherwise be able to
operate with budget surpluses.</TE>
<TE>Officials Disagree on Opinion's Weight</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the legislative counsel's report, city officials said the
opinion of LAFCO's own attorney, the county counsel, should weigh more
than an opinion by a third party.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of California and the legislative counsel does not
represent anyone involved in this process directly," said Ron Deaton, the
city's chief legislative analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the county counsel's office were not available to
comment Saturday, but a spokeswoman for Mayor James K. Hahn also
downplayed the significance of the latest legal opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already had two opinions on this," mayoral aide Julie Wong
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, argued
Saturday that the county counsel advises LAFCO as a matter of convenience
because the legislative counsel is not always available.</TE>
<TE>   Close also said he believes the state opinion will weigh more in
LAFCO's final determination.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Legislative Counsel Ben E. Dale said in the 16-page legal
opinion that transferring a property from one jurisdiction to another
"does not result in a compensable taking" under provisions of the
California Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   He also found it was not the intent of legislation regulating
reorganizations to mandate compensation for city properties that are
transferred.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO, the opinion found, has discretion to decide whether
compensation is warranted.</TE>
<TE>   That could strengthen the hand of LAFCO Executive Director Larry
Calemine, who had previously challenged the county counsel's opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials, including Councilman and LAFCO member Hal Bernson,
believe the issue may end up in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock and Close accused the county and city officials of trying
to deliberately obstruct a secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined at the news conference by 30 leaders and supporters
of Valley VOTE, including Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) and
former Assembly members Paula Boland and Richard Katz.</TE>

<HD>Remote Vehicle to Search Lake for 3 Bodies</HD>
<DH>Castaic: Families rent a robotic unit with a camera since depth is
too great for county divers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the county unable to help them, the families of four men
believed to have been killed in the deadliest boat crash in Castaic
Lake's 30-year history spent Saturday making plans for an unusual
recovery mission.</LD>
<LD>   Three employees and a customer of an Agua Dulce boat-building company
were testing a new luxury powerboat at high speed Friday when it
capsized, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The county closed the lake Saturday to allow a rescue team to search
for boat debris and three of the victims. The body of Ken Lane, 41, of La
Crescenta was recovered soon after the boat sank.</LD>
<TE>   But the second-day search turned up little more than boat pieces and
shoes. The wreckage rests 246 feet below the surface, far too deep for
county divers.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Tom Thompson of the Sheriff's Department dive team said that
"99.9% of scuba divers can't go that deep. The deeper you go, you get
into a different atmosphere. At that depth, air turns toxic."</TE>
<TE>   County officials said such depths are particularly dangerous at
Castaic because the lake's high elevation means the air has even less
oxygen. The lake, created as a backup water storage site for the
California Aqueduct, is 1,515 feet above sea level.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the families said Saturday that they had rented a
remotely operated vehicle with an attached camera to survey the wreckage
today.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Gonzalez, a friend of the victims who is a spokesman for all
the families, asked that deep-water divers volunteer to help with
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "They all died doing what they loved," Gonzalez said of the four men.</TE>
<TE>$200,000 Catamaran Was Being Tested</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred during what friends and co-workers described as
routine business.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Coulombe, 38, owner of the boat-building company High Torque
Marine, insisted on taking every new boat out for testing, co-workers
said. On Friday, he was making a second run in a 30-foot-long,
double-hulled catamaran with a $200,000 price tag and room for eight
people.</TE>
<TE>   Along for the ride were Lane, who built the twin 400-plus-horsepower
engines; Nelson Roy Brinkman, 30, of Phelan, who had mounted them; and
Chuck Wiseman, 47, who purchased a boat from Coulombe a year ago and
became a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a luxury boat to the max," said Roy Ayers, design engineer and
manager for High Torque. "It could run 45 mph all day long and cover a
long distance."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses and family members said one of the engines may have
unexpectedly seized. The boat banked hard to the left and appeared to
roll over.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether the craft was adhering to the lake's 35-mph
speed limit. Friends said the boat was capable of hitting up to 65 mph,
but that with four adult men in the boat, it couldn't have reached that
speed.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad wouldn't have gone that fast," Wiseman's 16-year-old son,
Charlie, said of witness reports that the boat had exceeded 60 mph. "If
the boat was going that fast, he would have gotten out so he could be
with us the rest of his life."</TE>
<TE>   All four victims courted speed, friends and family members said.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkman eagerly learned the details of engine performance from Lane.
Coulombe had driven fast cars since he was a teenager, said his cousin
Jim Stopp of Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   Lane raced drag boats under the name Obsession Race Team, customized
hot rods and once blew up the family lawn mower trying to make it go
faster, his brother said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had wheels or it could go on land or water, he raced it," Steve
Lane said. "It's what brought a smile to his face."</TE>
<TE>   Wiseman, owner of concrete foundation and subcontracting companies in
Castaic, often sought to get away from it all on his speedboat. He also
enjoyed wisecracks and was the sort of boss who would help employees buy
a house, said employee Felix Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   Wiseman's birthday was Wednesday. His friends had planned a surprise
party for him Friday night in Valencia.</TE>

<HD>Three New Priests Ordained in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Religion: They reflect the area's cultural diversity--and the acute
shortage of clergy in the archdiocese.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men, born in Vietnam, Mexico and Poland, were ordained as Los
Angeles' newest Catholic priests on Saturday, reflecting L.A.'s cultural
diversity, as well as punctuating the clergy shortage.</LD>
<LD>   They will be the only priests ordained this year for the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "Three is not enough," said Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, archbishop of
Los Angeles. "There are already 12 priests retiring this year."</LD>
<TE>   He said there was more need for outreach and recruitment of priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony officiated over the ceremony at St. Mel Catholic Church, where
Gilberto Monico Soltero, 41, Thinh Duc Pham, 33, and Slawomir Szkredka,
27, accepted their vows.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony's program was printed in English, Spanish, Polish and
Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   Soltero, Pham and Szkredka will be associate pastors in Encino,
Norwalk and Panorama City, respectively, said Vicar for Clergy Msgr.
Craig A. Cox.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenging life, and they will be stretched, yes," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   There are only about 540 parish priests in the archdiocese, Cox said.
The archdiocese stretches from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles and serves
about 4 million people.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the challenges will be for them to say, 'I can't do
everything. Jesus is the Messiah, I am not,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Helmut Hefner, director of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo,
helped train Soltero and Pham. Szkredka received his seminary training in
Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally in the U.S., many priests have come from the immigrant
population," Hefner said. "But when there's a shortage [of priests], it
becomes more obvious, and we've pretty much bottomed out right now."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, Soltero, Pham and Szkredka greeted hundreds of
parishioners lined up to receive a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   The three were philosophical about the challenges they face as members
of a dwindling clergy.</TE>
<TE>   Szkredka, who has wanted to be a priest "since I was a little kid" and
entered the seminary after high school, said: "Whatever I can't take care
of, God can."</TE>
<TE>   Soltero, a former professional soccer player and construction worker,
said, "I feel like a little seed beginning. I'll grow into whatever
responsibilities God gives me."</TE>
<TE>   Pham, who taught French at Cal State Los Angeles before entering the
priesthood, said: "We're not here to solve the shortage of priests, we're
here to try to bring people to God."</TE>

<HD>Red Desert a Battleground Over Energy, Environment</HD>
<DH>Land: Southwestern Wyoming region is studied for federal
protection, but there's interest in drilling for oil and natural gas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. BLACK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FARSON, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>In the 1870s, Jack Morrow had a reputation in the mining towns of
the West as a hard-drinking thief and swindler. He even killed a man in a
gunfight.</LD>
<LD>   The hills in southwestern Wyoming's Red Desert that bear his name are
unforgiving in their harsh climate and isolation. And they are the
subject of a rancorous battle among ranchers, environmentalists, oil and
gas companies, hunters and others.</LD>
<LD>   The Jack Morrow Hills, which lie mostly on federal land, have become a
testing ground of two Bush administration commitments: opening more of
the Rocky Mountains to drilling and protecting America's natural
treasures.</LD>
<TE>   In 1935, then-Wyoming Gov. Leslie Miller proposed the area as a
national park and, in 1961, Congress mulled creating a national monument.
Today, environmentalists are again advocating some type of federal
protection.</TE>
<TE>   With pressure to develop more domestic energy, drilling companies say
that locking up the area would deprive America of large reserves of oil
and natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 wells have already been drilled in the hills. Debate heated
up in 2000 when the U. S. Bureau of Land Management concluded that 65
more could be squeezed in.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Babbitt paid a visit in his last days as interior secretary and
announced that he was rejecting the BLM plan and ordering the agency to
adopt an alternative that leans more toward conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Then-President Clinton had already used the 1906 Antiquities Act to
create 19 monuments and expand three others, protecting 5.9 million
acres. Babbitt's move was seen by industry and Wyoming officials as
another way the Clinton administration sought to squirrel away Western
lands.</TE>
<TE>   But Clinton did not create a monument out of the Jack Morrow Hills
because he was not allowed to. Federal law prevents any new national
monuments in Wyoming without congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   The law was enacted in 1950 as a compromise when Grand Teton National
Park was enlarged over the objections of Jackson Hole ranchers and state
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Udall, interior secretary from 1960-69, tipped off Babbitt
about the hills. He said Babbitt's order was the only option the
administration had to protect the area in a state with a seemingly
unquenchable thirst for mineral tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for Wyoming," Udall said. "There's no voice in the
government for conservation in Wyoming today. My friend [former Wyoming
Sen.] Al Simpson used to have a sense of restraint on some things. But I
don't hear those things now. It's let 'er rip."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, man's presence is evident throughout the hills: cellular
towers dot high ridges, and scars from buried pipelines and cattle trails
crisscross the area.</TE>
<TE>   But because the Red Desert is so vast and underpopulated, many signs
of humankind go unnoticed. Breathtaking vistas of towering buttes,
volcanic formations and the largest shifting sand dunes in North America
still abound.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of more drilling say the area is so wide open that a few
more wells will not spoil the view nor harm herds of elk, mule deer,
antelope and wild horses that roam the high desert.</TE>
<TE>   "We honestly believe that we can have a balance between environmental
protection and economic growth. We do it all the time," said Dru Bower,
vice president of the Petroleum Assn. of Wyoming. "There is a tremendous
gas reserve in the Jack Morrow Hills, and we don't believe it should be
withdrawn or excluded from development."</TE>
<TE>   Mac Blewer, of the Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council, said too much
of the 4.5-million-acre Red Desert has already been developed, and enough
is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a world-class landscape," he said. "You can go from red-rock
country into a sea of sagebrush and then into a landscape resembling
Saudi Arabia. I know of no place in America where you can do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do we draw the line in the sand and say this is inappropriate?
What landscapes do we further have to sacrifice?"</TE>
<TE>   The hills draw not only drilling interests, but mountain and dirt
bikers, hunters, anglers, backpackers, horseback riders, rock climbers
and photographers.</TE>
<TE>   American Indians want protection of their ancestors' religious sites,
while paleontologists value the abundant fossils. Historians advocate
preserving storied South Pass and other remnants of the Oregon,
California and Mormon Pioneer trails that pass through the hills.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Kier of Larkspur, Colo., prefers the area not be roped off.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs to be a happy medium for everybody and it seems like a lot
of environmentalists push for either their way or no way," he said while
stopping to ride his all-terrain vehicle at the dunes during a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Charged with the thankless task of striking a balance among this
milieu of competing interests is the BLM, which has been studying a
622,000-acre area encompassing the hills for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Dorsey, field representative for the Wyoming Wildlife
Federation, a sportsmen and wildlife group, said the BLM's helter-skelter
leasing of wells has altered big game corridors hundreds of miles long.</TE>
<TE>   Although the agency has proposed development in stages to reduce the
effects on wildlife, Dorsey said it has not been done because the BLM
relies too heavily on the Mineral Leasing Act of 1919, "which encourages
sort of an Oklahoma land rush mentality."</TE>
<TE>   "Given the current political climate in Wyoming and Washington, D. C.,
which certainly favors big oil, the BLM does not seem inclined to go that
staged development route."</TE>
<TE>   After the BLM issued the draft of its initial plan in June 2000, it
received more than 12,000 comments, highest response in the agency's
history. Most comments opposed further development.</TE>
<TE>   A citizens' group comprising about 100 individuals and businesses then
offered a plan that would prohibit any new drilling and mining, a halt to
road-building, and restoration of habitat damaged by roads and pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   Because of issues raised by the citizens' proposal and the variety and
volume of comments, the BLM on Sept. 19 announced that it was taking a
new look at the hills, which prompted rare agreement among the competing
interests.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very pleased with this administration and the BLM's decision
to go back and overturn Bruce Babbitt's directive," Bower said. "What
this administration said was no, you can't determine the outcome before
you conducted the analysis."</TE>
<TE>   Said Blewer: "I think the Bush administration is showing its true
patriotism by giving the Red Desert a second chance. They could have
completely denied Babbitt's directive. At least by this decision, they're
going along with part of it."</TE>
<TE>   A final decision is expected in about 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the outcome, Leo Chapman, a Rawlins banker who recently
sold his cattle ranch east of the hills, says the pendulum has already
swung too far to the environmental side.</TE>
<TE>   Loggers and sheep ranchers have been targets for removal from public
land, he said, adding that environmentalists are now zeroing in on cattle
and drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "When that's gone, what's left?" he said. "When they get them all, I
don't know who's going to feed and clothe us and provide fuel for our
vehicles."</TE>

<HD>Leads Pursued in Slaying of Actor's Wife</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Detectives say they've made 'significant progress'
in the hunt for the killer of Robert Blake's spouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an eight-month investigation that has taken detectives to
four states, Los Angeles police officials say they have made "significant
progress" in the search for the killer of actor Robert Blake's wife, but
they are not ready to name a suspect.</LD>
<LD>   The detectives have spent much of their time pursuing possible leads
from videotapes, photographs, letters and other documents that belonged
to Bonny Lee Bakley, who was shot to death on May 4 in Studio City,
police officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the materials were provided by Blake's attorney, Harland W.
Braun, who insists his client had nothing to do with the killing.</LD>
<TE>   "Detectives have been working extremely hard and have made significant
progress," said Capt. Jim Tatreau of the Los Angeles Police Department's
Robbery-Homicide Division. "Significant work has been devoted to the
large amount of material turned over to the detectives."</TE>
<TE>Bakley's Relatives Growing Frustrated</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have worked alongside detectives since early in the
investigation, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   While the length of the investigation has frustrated Bakley's
relatives, they understand that the police are being thorough, said
family attorney Cary W. Goldstein. "They have no eyewitness and little
physical evidence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items Braun gave to the police shortly after the killing
were nude photos of Bakley that she allegedly sent to lonely men in
exchange for cash, plane tickets and bus fare.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau declined to comment on the investigation in detail, but said
detectives have combed through Bakley's possessions and conducted
follow-up interviews. The detectives have traveled to Arkansas, New
Jersey, Montana and Tennessee as a result of the material that Braun
provided, Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley, 44, was shot as she sat in the couple's car a block from
Vitello's, a Studio City restaurant where she and Blake had just finished
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police he had left the car to retrieve a gun he dropped in
the restaurant, said Braun, who added that his client carried the weapon
for protection. Blake returned to find Bakley fatally wounded in the
head, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives questioned Blake and searched his Studio City home at least
twice. They seized two handguns, ammunition, credit card receipts and
other items, but said at the time that Blake was not a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   By many accounts, Blake and Bakley had an unconventional relationship.
They married only after paternity tests showed that Blake was the father
of Bakley's daughter. The couple lived in separate homes on Blake's
property.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, an actor since childhood who is best known for starring in
the 1970s television series "Baretta," has since put the house up for
sale and moved to the west San Fernando Valley to be closer to his adult
daughter, who has been helping care for his and Bakley's infant daughter,
Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the investigation has become bogged down in "too much
evidence." He said the delays bother Blake because they have left "a
cloud over his head."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney has floated several theories about the killing, most of
them disparaging of Bakley. His latest is that a hit man hired by Bakley
to kill Blake turned on her instead.</TE>
<TE>   The police have not commented on Braun's speculation, which Goldstein
dismisses as baseless.</TE>
<TE>Police Learn From Simpson Case</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson said the LAPD is being
painstaking in the investigation because of lessons it learned from the
O.J. Simpson murder trial. Simpson's attorneys accused police of
mishandling evidence and ignoring leads pointing away from the former
football star. Simpson was acquitted in the killings of his wife Nicole
Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald J. Goldman. A civil jury later found
him liable in the killings.</TE>
<TE>   "The post-O.J. syndrome is that the LAPD realizes that when you are
dealing with celebrities, you better have all your ducks in a row and be
ready to go the day you bring the charges," Levenson said.</TE>

<HD>Sampling New Recipe for MacArthur Park</HD>
<DH>Revamp: Neighbors drop by for a rededication of the north end after
a $2-million face lift. The south section remains plagued by blight and
crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the four years that Inna Madueke has lived west of downtown Los
Angeles, she has taken her children to MacArthur Park just three times.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday afternoon, the mother of three watched her kids scamper
across a newly built playground on the north end of the troubled park.</LD>
<LD>   Although she said she appreciates how the city is trying to improve
the site, she worries that the efforts are not enough.</LD>
<TE>   "There's still drug dealers and people offering you those fake IDs,"
said Madueke, 28, referring to the other end of the park. "It will be
dirty again."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty new trees, mostly palms, now decorate the northeast end of the
park. There are the spacious gated playground, recently planted grass,
and new benches, tables and walkways.</TE>
<TE>   City officials rededicated the north end of MacArthur Park on
Saturday, unveiling the improvements after 18 months of reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the $2-million face lift, which was completed about a month
ago, crime and blight still plague the south section.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 100 children and parents visited the improved area Saturday
afternoon. Children happily played on slides and swings and watched
martial arts demonstrations, while their parents ate grilled hot dogs and
rested in the shade of palm trees near the newly paved walkways.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on the south side of the 32-acre park, nearly 100 homeless
people lined up near the lake to receive vegetables, fruit and soup from
volunteers from the Zion Gospel Mission. Nearby, a man slept under a
tree, wrapped in a sheet with only his toes exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal solicitors hawking fake IDs stood on the outskirts of the
park, hand-signaling to passing cars and pedestrians. Trash littered
walkways and hills. Dirt patches stood where grass should have been.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have homeless people, we still have people who have
psychological and mental problems," said Councilman Ed Reyes. "We need
stronger security, and parents need to be . . . careful in letting their
children play here; this is not a utopia."</TE>
<TE>Area Once Considered Fashionable</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said upgrades at MacArthur Park will continue. An additional $1
million has been set aside to renovate a building on the north end and
turn it into a community center. Also, an outdoor theater on the north
end will be refurbished. Those improvements are expected to be completed
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, no immediate plans have been made to beautify the south
end, Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   The park was named for World War II and Korean War leader Gen. Douglas
MacArthur. It was once surrounded by upscale residences. Charlie
Chaplin's former home lies a few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   But the park has deteriorated, along with its surroundings, since the
1970s. The area is now plagued by poverty and crime, and the open space
has become a magnet for such activity.</TE>
<TE>   "This park is sitting in one of the city's most violent areas," said
Officer Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart
Division.</TE>
<TE>   "We would love to have a constant presence here, but given the demands
on police services in this area, it's such a challenge," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Vargas, 34, took his two sons to the park Saturday. He
remembered a time when "there was no way you could even walk through here
and bring your family."</TE>
<TE>   Although he plans to take his children to the new playground at least
twice a month now, he is still wary.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have your kids playing out here, especially when they get
older, they get influenced by [the crime]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Madueke's two daughters played in the sand beneath a jungle gym,
she asked: "What are they going to do about safety?</TE>
<TE>   "I think police are so tired they just ignore [the criminals]. This
place could be safer, but right now it is not safe."</TE>

<HD>'Father of Television' Suffered Travails Worthy of a Soap Opera</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television's reach into modern life stretches from the ridiculous
to the sublime to the tragic--"Uncle Miltie" to "Masterpiece Theatre" to
the recent terrorist attacks. But none of these memorable TV moments
would have occurred without the electronic picture tube invented by the
father of television: Philo Taylor Farnsworth.</LD>
<LD>   Fittingly, it was in Los Angeles, the epicenter of entertainment, that
Farnsworth saw the man-made light that the rest of the world would soon
see too.</LD>
<LD>   In 1921, he was a 14-year-old Utah farm boy when he conceived the idea
of what he later called "capturing light in a bottle." He was tilling a
potato field with a horse-drawn harrow when he realized that light, in an
electron beam, could scan images just as he was plowing the field: line
by line.</LD>
<TE>   Farnsworth, who had been born in a log cabin on the family farm in
1906, somehow saw beyond the arid landscape to a scientific universe.
Every day he rode horseback four miles to the nearest school, and as a
12-year-old, persuaded his chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, to let him
take a senior chemistry class and tutor him on the side.</TE>
<TE>   "He devoured electrical encyclopedias like other students wolfed down
popcorn," Tolman said.</TE>
<TE>   Farnsworth was 15 when he drew on Tolman's chalkboard and on a scrap
of paper his design for the first electronic tube. Tolman, who kept the
paper for the rest of his life, persuaded Brigham Young University to
allow Farnsworth to take an advanced physics course.</TE>
<TE>   Farnsworth's academic career was cut short when his father died, and
he dropped out to help his family, earning money by repairing radios. By
1926, the young genius had come to the attention of a Community Chest
fund-raiser, who paid for the 19-year-old inventor and his 18-year-old
bride, Elma, his research assistant, to move to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>Apartment Blast Causes Neighbors to Call Cops</TE>
<TE>   Behind closed curtains in his apartment in Los Feliz, Farnsworth began
experimenting with glowing tubes. Once, he blew up his equipment, and his
neighbors, suspecting that Farnsworth was running an illegal liquor
operation during Prohibition, called the cops.</TE>
<TE>   After police raided his apartment and found nothing, Farnsworth and
Elma moved to San Francisco--fittingly to a tiny laboratory at the bottom
of Telegraph Hill. There, he perfected and patented the first operational
all-electronic television transmission tube (a forerunner of the modern
TV camera). He was 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, in 1927, with the backing of more investors, he devised
the first operational television system, with a crude receiver and a
camera. The world's first TV show was a vertical black line swinging back
and forth like a pendulum against a lighted background.</TE>
<TE>   An excited investor quickly cabled another investor: "The damned thing
works."</TE>
<TE>   To bring in more investors and attract a large company, Farnsworth
began to give demonstrations. The technique worked--and then it
backfired. Radio Corp. of America wanted in on the ground floor of TV,
and its interest triggered a seven-year court battle. Farnsworth won, but
it left him ailing and broken.</TE>
<TE>Farnsworth Rejects $100,000 RCA Offer</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Thomas Edison, Farnsworth never gained the riches or
recognition he deserved. Although he won in a court of law, he lost
against RCA, one of America's largest and most powerful corporations,
which co-opted some of his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   In his excitement about his creation, Farnsworth showed many of his
secrets to all comers. RCA already had a man working on the TV concept.
Russian American scientist Vladimir Zworykin, who had separately
conceived major components for TV, visited Farnsworth's lab in 1930.
Fearing the competition, RCA chief David Sarnoff offered Farnsworth
$100,000 for his services and patents. But Farnsworth rejected the offer,
wanting royalties.</TE>
<TE>   "RCA doesn't pay royalties," Sarnoff allegedly said. "We collect
them."</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, Farnsworth was working for Philco Radio to help it break into
the television business. That same year, his youngest son died from a
throat infection and Philco refused him even the time off to bury his
son.</TE>
<TE>   With his personal world crashing in, Farnsworth was sued by RCA for
patent interference, and a legal battle ensued over who invented
television.</TE>
<TE>   Farnsworth kept plugging away, amazing the world in 1934 with
demonstrations of images of tennis players and other athletes at play,
along with the face of actress Joan Crawford--all transmitted from one
room to another. He had also started his own company, Farnsworth
Television Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In court, RCA lawyers were contending that Zworykin's 1923 patent had
priority over Farnsworth's later patents, but they never presented a
working television tube. Farnsworth did, thanks to that long-ago drawing
his chemistry teacher preserved. It was his greatest triumph and his
legal vindication.</TE>
<TE>   But the victory proved costly. RCA continued to muscle him out of the
picture, tying up his patents with appeals. However, RCA was forced to
pay Farnsworth $1 million over 10 years beginning in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   But during World War II, the government suspended sales of TV sets,
and by the war's end, Farnsworth's key patents were close to expiration.
When they did expire, in 1947, RCA grabbed them and started a propaganda
campaign that claimed Zworykin as the "father of television," backed up
with photos of him holding a cathode ray tube.</TE>
<TE>   Zworykin's own attitude toward television was clear: "I would never
let my children come close to this thing."</TE>
<TE>Mystery Guest on 'I've Got a Secret'</TE>
<TE>   Driven to ulcers and depression made worse by drinking, Farnsworth
withdrew to a house in Maine. He soon had a mental breakdown, spent time
in hospitals and submitted to electric shock therapy. As if that weren't
enough, his house burned to the ground in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   By then, television was coming of age, from the broadcasts of the
Army's McCarthy hearings to the 1949 live coverage in Los Angeles of the
effort to rescue a little girl who slipped down a well in San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Farnsworth appeared as a mystery guest on "I've Got a
Secret," where he was identified as "Dr. X," an inventor of "a machine."
The first question from a panelist was: "Is this a machine that might be
painful when used?" Farnsworth quipped: "Yes. Sometimes it's most
painful." None of the panelists guessed what his machine was, or his role
in developing TV.</TE>
<TE>   Later, like Zworykin, Farnsworth would say that he felt that he had
created a monster.</TE>
<TE>   Worn out by the industry he helped to create, he died from a
perforated ulcer in 1971, at age 64. Newspaper headlines credited him as
the "father of television."</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S. Capitol, each state gets to place statues of two of its
most accomplished citizens. A dozen years ago, a group of persistent Utah
elementary school children lobbying the Senate got Farnsworth's statue
raised up alongside that of Utah's Mormon founder, Brigham Young.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MORONGO INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Construction has begun on a $26-million Arrowhead Mountain Spring
Water bottling plant on the Morongo Indian Reservation.</LD>
<LD>   The economic venture will allow the Morongo tribe to diversify its
economy beyond gaming through the sale of spring water to Arrowhead
Mountain Spring Water, a subsidiary of Perrier Group of America. Perrier
is the nation's largest water bottler, and its Arrowhead label, the
leading seller in the West, is distributed throughout California,
Arizona, Nevada, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   The arrangement helps the tribe diversify its economy, tribal chairman
Maurice Lyons said. The tribe operates a casino and several small
businesses along Interstate 10, 80 miles east of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The reservation bottling facility will operate two production lines by
summer, then expand to four lines and eventually to 10. When fully built,
it will be the largest water-bottling plant in the United States,
employing 260 workers.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Water War Taking Ugly Turn</HD>
<DH>Resources: Members of Indian tribes are targets of
shotgun-intimidation tactics by some residents irate over fish habitat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BARNARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHILOQUIN, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Perry Chocktoot was in front of his house working on the stereo in
his pickup when three guys drove by yelling, "Sucker lovers, come out and
fight!" They fired a shotgun at a portable outhouse across the street.</LD>
<LD>   The pickup drove around this town of about 500 that is headquarters
for the Klamath Tribes, firing at signs and buildings, and stopped for a
while behind a school bus, where the men asked kids headed for a
basketball game whether they were Indians, Chocktoot said.</LD>
<LD>   "They shot over one kid's head," said Chocktoot, a tribal member. "You
know what that tells that kid? 'White people hate me. Not for anything
I've done, because I haven't done anything.' That is so wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Though no one was hurt, taunting Indians with the word sucker--an
endangered fish sacred to the Klamath that became an icon of last
summer's federal decision to reserve drought-depleted water for fish over
farms--potentially converted the Dec. 1 shooting from rabble-rousing to
criminal racism.</TE>
<TE>   Three men from the farming community of Bonanza were arrested three
weeks later and charged with felony intimidation, unlawful use of a
weapon, conspiracy, criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. They
have yet to go to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say ranch hand George Curry, 23; logger Richard Sharp, 26;
and Adam Lee, 27, no occupation listed, were goose hunting and drinking
beer when they decided to shake up the Klamath Tribes.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests came on the heels of an Oregon State University draft
report on last summer's water wars noting that "racism that mostly lies
below the surface of social life in the basin emerged as some framed the
issue as 'Indians vs. farmers.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tribal officials say the shooting was bound to happen, given the
tensions over irrigation cutbacks mandated by the Endangered Species Act
to assure water for the endangered suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, as well
as threatened coho salmon in the Klamath River.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it took the drought of 2001 to bring to the surface how
deeply embedded racism is in this community," said Joe Hobbs, tribal vice
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Though water dedicated to the salmon tipped the balance away from
farmers for the first time since the Klamath Project irrigation system
opened in 1907, the local focus was on suckers.</TE>
<TE>   People at rallies carried anti-sucker signs and denounced the sucker
as an inedible bottom-feeding trash fish. Bumper stickers said, "Save a
farmer, fillet a sucker fish." Signs announcing a "Sucker Special" were
left at the tribes' Klamoya Casino.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand how significant these fish are to us," said
tribal chairman Allen Foreman. "To them it's a trash fish.</TE>
<TE>   "Through their minds they associate us with trash. That's the way they
view us. 'The fish is useless and using it takes away from our
livelihoods.' "</TE>
<TE>   But to the Klamath people, the C'waam (TCH-waam), or Lost River
sucker, and Qapdo (KUP-doe), or short-nosed sucker, are sacred gifts of
Creator, celebrated with an annual ceremony to mark the spring spawning
run just as Columbia River tribes celebrate the return of the salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates on how long the Klamath people have lived in the basin go
back more than 10,000 years. One of their ancient stories tells of a time
when a monster was on the land, eating the people. Creator killed the
monster and carried the body to the middle of Upper Klamath Lake, where
he ripped it apart and transformed the bones into the white-fleshed
C'waam.</TE>
<TE>   Creator told the Klamath people that as long as the C'waam survived,
they would survive. And when the C'waam disappeared, the Klamath people
would be no more.</TE>
<TE>   Besides feeding the Klamath people, the suckers supported a popular
sport fishery. But after state-regulated harvests plummeted from 12,500
in 1966 to 687 in 1986, the fish went on the endangered species list.
Biologists blamed overfishing, and declining water quality and habitat
from overgrazing, agricultural runoff, and draining marshes for pasture.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between whites and Indians have been tense from the start.
Hudson's Bay Co. trapper Peter Skene Ogden reported friendly contacts
with the Klamaths in 1826, but complained of raids by the neighboring
Modocs. Klamaths attacked explorer John C. Fremont's expedition in 1846,
killing three men, and Fremont retaliated by burning a Modoc village.
Reports of Modoc raids on wagon trains in the 1850s were repaid with a
massacre of Indians.</TE>
<TE>   After the treaty of 1864 put the Klamaths, Modocs and Yahooskins
together on a reservation at Chiloquin, a band of Modocs complained of
mistreatment by the Klamaths and left. When the Army tried to force them
back in 1872, the Modocs held out for months in one of the last of the
Indian wars.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government assigned shares of the reservation to
individuals in 1887 and in 1954 dissolved the tribes, paying people for
their shares of the reservation, which became a national forest and
wildlife refuge. The money was quickly spent and the tribes descended
from one of the most economically successful in the nation into poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Since regaining tribal status, the tribes have been trying to regain
the reservation as a key to their economic revival.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since protesters forced open irrigation head gates last July 4,
Klamath County Sheriff Tim Evinger has been trying to avoid violence. He
was concerned enough about racism to call in two U.S. Justice Department
mediators, but says they found no problem. He investigated complaints of
Indians refused service by merchants, and found no basis for criminal
charges.</TE>
<TE>   He compares the bumper stickers to a similar focus on the northern
spotted owl when national forest harvests were cut back in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "A bumper sticker is one thing. Discharging a shotgun in a city is a
whole other issue," Evinger said. "I think it's important that we set the
tone that people not be put in fear, especially over this water thing.
Because I don't believe we're out of the woods yet."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kandra, an alfalfa and grain farmer who has been a leader in the
water fight, says no reasonable person would support the shooting spree
in Chiloquin, but added that farmers have legitimate differences with the
tribes.</TE>
<TE>   The tribes intervened on the side of the federal government in the
irrigators' lawsuit last year challenging the irrigation cutbacks. Tribal
research went into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion
that led to the irrigation cutbacks. And irrigators had to go to the U.S.
Supreme Court to see water documents passed between the tribes and the
U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The tribes as a business entity, they have had opportunities to work
with the community and were not very cooperative," Kandra says. "If I
make a comment that the tribes could have done this better, am I a racist
when I say that?</TE>
<TE>   "When you are doing business with somebody and they have treated you
unfairly, you really don't want to do business with those kind of folks."</TE>
<TE>   As for cooperation, the tribes note that irrigators dropped out of
court-supervised mediation looking for long-term solutions.</TE>
<TE>   But farmers may find themselves having to go to the tribes for water.
A formal process of adjudicating water rights has begun, and the tribes'
treaty guarantees them water to sustain traditional fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   Elwood Miller, the tribes' director of natural resources, said there
is hope of resolving the Klamath water wars, but the entire ecosystem
needs to return to a more natural condition to sustain both suckers and
farms.</TE>
<TE>   To do that, "people have to be able to come together and respect each
other," Miller said. "We are concerned about the livelihood of the
farmer, but they have to be concerned about the livelihood of the Klamath
tribes."</TE>

<HD>Rock Art Preservation Is Often Uncharted Terrain</HD>
<DH>Culture: The discovery of ancient carvings in some Irvine caves
spotlights how few rules govern such relics once their existence is
recorded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can see the past etched into the face of a boulder in the
Bowers Museum courtyard, a maze of thin lines created by Native Americans
thousands of years before Orange County's landscape succumbed to
cul-de-sacs and freeways, industrial parks and glass cathedrals.</LD>
<LD>   This ancient maze, hauled in from the nearby Santa Ana Mountains, is
one of the few samples of tribal rock art on exhibit locally.</LD>
<LD>   The rarity of such carvings has added weight to demands that rock
carvings recently discovered in two Irvine caves be preserved.</LD>
<TE>   But preserving such artifacts does not necessarily mean making them
available for public viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Although laws require that newly discovered historic items--ranging
from rock art to cooking pits to human remains--be identified and
recorded, few regulations deal with what happens to the material
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   That has led to such oddities as an Orange County warehouse filled
with the bric-a-brac of the past, a 15,000-cubic-foot collection so
disorganized that even those charged with watching over it don't fully
know what they have.</TE>
<TE>   Although the current debate centers on faded images carved in stone,
the disclosure of the Irvine rock art underscores the ongoing debates
among preservationists, developers, government officials and Native
Americans over what items ought to be preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating preservation efforts, archeologists and others say, are
laws that are simply insufficient to protect irreplaceable relics of
times gone by.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly challenging is the preservation of rock art, which by its
nature often is immovable--and prey to the elements, vandals and illicit
collectors.</TE>
<TE>   In the current debate, one of the Irvine caves containing a small
carving--described as a 4-inch squiggle with a circle at one end--could
be demolished as part of a 2,500-home development at the edge of the San
Joaquin Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The other cave, containing a large carving of a rattlesnake, will be
ceded to the city of Irvine as part of 1,000 acres of open space
adjoining Irvine Co.'s Shady Canyon development near the Turtle Rock
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   That cave, and six others nearby, will become part of an undeveloped
area open to the public, but the caves themselves would remain
off-limits, said Sharon Heider, Irvine's open space administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the caves secure, though, is not easy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, they're not mapped, we don't have trails to them, and if
there are ways that we can do it, we'll plant cactus and those kinds of
things that would keep people from wanting to go in those areas," she
said. "The last-ditch scenario is: If the sites are highly attractive,
we'd patrol them."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest risk, Heider and others said, is damage by vandals or
collectors chipping the art from the cave walls.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a very important cultural resource that provide a lot of
information about our connection with this land," she said. "They need to
be protected. There is a bigger basis for public good than just letting
people tour them."</TE>
<TE>   Countless sites in the deserts have been damaged or destroyed over the
years by vandals and sometimes by well-meaning aficionados making
rubbings of primitive carvings.</TE>
<TE>   Although Orange County has more than 1,600 registered archeological
sites, most consist of abandoned cooking spots or similar leavings of
daily life. And while there are about 6,000 rock art locations throughout
California--mainly in the southern deserts--discoveries of such relics
are rare in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that ancients passed the region by, experts say. Rather, the
sandstone that predominates in Orange County--canvases for the rock
artists--erodes more quickly than harder rock in the deserts.</TE>
<TE>   And, they believe, an unknowable number of artifacts were destroyed by
developers' plows before laws arose requiring that builders catalog their
findings and alert authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I would assume, given the fact that the surrounding counties have
rock art, it must have been made in Orange County as well," said Phyllisa
Eisentraut, an archeologist and assistant professor of anthropology at
Cal State Fullerton. "Most likely it was done in rock shelters and
caves."</TE>
<TE>   Some sites were identified by a 1930s Works Progress Administration
program, she said, but "have since been subject to development."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Selway, director of the Orange County Historical Commission
overseeing the county's collection of relics, said he knew of no other
rock art sites in the county. Local archeology enthusiasts were similarly
hard-pressed to identify locations.</TE>
<TE>   But Damien Shilo, chairman of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians,
said that the tribe's archeological committee has recorded an unspecified
number of sites and that he has visited at least seven himself, including
those announced recently in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Shilo declined to identify the other sites, most of which he said are
unknown to mainstream archeologists and hard to reach. To view one in
Laguna Hills, he said, requires rappelling gear.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep it off the beaten path because, more often than not,
when we've said where they are, we get the vandalism," said Shilo, 43, a
Los Angeles firefighter who lives in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   Natural forces also take their toll on some of the art.</TE>
<TE>   One depiction of a hand discovered decades ago in a canyon at
present-day Crystal Cove State Park disappeared when a cave collapsed
during the El Nino storms of 1982-83, rangers said.</TE>
<TE>   Another off Laguna Canyon Road has reportedly faded so much that it is
barely discernible.</TE>
<TE>   And some rumored sites turn out to be mirages. Reports of petroglyphs
at Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park--including a mention on a
county Harbors, Beaches and Parks Division Web site--are erroneous, park
rangers said.</TE>
<TE>   But rock paintings can be seen off Ortega Highway just over the
Riverside County line, near the El Cariso ranger station. And Riverside
County's Mockingbird Canyon, near Lake Matthews east of Corona, contains
pictographs that archeologists believe were involved in solstice
celebrations by the Luiseno and Gabrielino tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Few such sites, though, have been found south of the Santa Ana
Mountains. "We have not really dealt with that issue very much," Selway
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the flatlands and coastal hills have been a treasure trove of
other artifacts from native civilizations, including village sites and
massive burial grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Under preservation guidelines dating to the late 1970s, relics
discovered during projects that require county permits--such as building
or grading--are turned over to the county. Human remains fall under
different guidelines and usually are turned over to local Native American
groups for reburial.</TE>
<TE>   The county began accepting artifacts--ranging from million-year-old
whale bones to Native American grinding stones--with vague intentions of
someday displaying them in a museum but with no guidelines for amassing
and monitoring the collection.</TE>
<TE>   One attempt to establish a museum failed in 1992 when the nonprofit
Natural History Foundation of Orange County went bankrupt, souring donors
who had come up with $550,000 for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors has supported a natural history museum
in concept, but said it would not fund one, Selway said.</TE>
<TE>   And despite a feasibility study from the early 1990s that laid out
blueprints for establishing a center, none has been developed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The development boom of the '80s uncovered large amounts of artifacts
and ecofacts--shells, bones and plant remnants--that overwhelmed the
county's ability to store them, and the facility stopped accepting new
material in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   That means unknown numbers of artifacts are being stored privately by
developers, contractors and others involved in construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, people were just happy to preserve them and get them out
of the ground from in front of development," Selway said. "People were
not as far-sighted about curation and the condition the artifacts would
be in when there were accepted."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the county has boxes and boxes of raw materials from
identified archeological sites, agglomerations of dirt and material still
waiting to be sifted and sorted.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three years ago, the county contracted with Cal State
Fullerton--using a combination of parks money and federal grants--in a
$400,000 project to devise a means for curating the massive collection.
The project is directed by Eisentraut and Cal State Fullerton
paleontologist John D. Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done an initial inventory and have a box-by-box sense of what
kinds of collections we have for both archeological and paleontological
remains," said Eisentraut, who is in charge of the archeological portion
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have also devised a system to catalog the collection as it
is analyzed, she said. A full report on the project is due in the next
year.</TE>

<LD>A parole board has tentatively agreed to free a Sonoma County
murderer who has spent 23 years in prison for killing his ex-wife in
Petaluma in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   Both commissioners who reviewed the case of Jimmie Dale Sole oppose
his release, but said they are obligated to follow an order issued by
Sonoma Superior Court Judge Elliot Daum that called for a release date to
be set.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling now goes to the parole board's review committee for
confirmation and probably will be sent to Gov. Gray Davis, Commissioner
Sharon Lawin said.</LD>

<LD>A woman who said she abducted her children to protect them from her
ex-husband, a convicted sex offender, was sentenced Friday to a year in
jail.</LD>
<LD>   Debra Schmidt, who was convicted last month of felony child abduction,
also was ordered to pay $44,000 in restitution and attorney's fees to the
children's father, Manuel Saavedra, and to have the two children returned
to California within 120 days.</LD>
<LD>   Saavedra, 44, pleaded guilty in 1992 to lewd conduct with his
13-year-old niece. After completing a sex offender program, a counselor
deemed he posed no risk to children if he did not drink alcohol.</LD>

<LD>A couple who ate "death cap" mushrooms are being watched for signs
of liver failure.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified couple, described as experienced mushroom hunters in
their 50s, ate the Amanita phalloides mushroom, which can destroy the
liver. If they show signs of liver failure, they may need liver
transplants.</LD>
<LD>   The couple reportedly picked the mushrooms when they were visiting
relatives in Watsonville. They prepared and ate a stew Tuesday. Hours
later, they began suffering from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe
cramps, and checked into a local hospital.</LD>

<LD>Lillian Green Caran, 85, veteran Broadway, radio and television
actress remembered from such pioneering series as "Fibber McGee and
Molly," died Jan. 2 of heart failure in Long Island, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Caran made her stage debut at age 3 and went on to perform in 42
Broadway shows and thousands of television and radio programs, among them
"Ellery Queen," 'The Goldbergs" and the "Fibber McGee" show. Her most
recent work was reading voice-overs for commercials.</LD>
<LD>   When she no longer had the energy-or time-to act, Caran taught her
craft to generations of children and adults at the Masque Theatre
workshop and studio in her Long Island home. She helped those with speech
impediments and simple shyness as well as those intent on entertainment
careers.</LD>
<TE>   Some of her former students include Jerry Orbach of TV's "Law &amp; Order"
and Eddie Karr of TV's "Promised Land."</TE>

<LD>Judge Oversaw School Busing in Milwaukee</LD>
<LD>   John W. Reynolds, 80, the Wisconsin federal judge who oversaw
integration of the Milwaukee public schools in the 1970s, died last
Sunday in a Milwaukee hospital of complications from heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   His nomination to the federal bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
1965 capped a notable political career. Reynolds, a Democrat, served as
Wisconsin's attorney general from 1958 to 1962, a job his father had held
three decades earlier. The future judge also served as governor from 1963
to 1965, establishing the state's first women's commission and arts
council and working to improve conditions at mental hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   As a jurist, Reynolds became chief judge of the Federal District Court
in Milwaukee from 1971 to 1986. He attracted national attention in 1976
when he ordered the Milwaukee Board of Education to racially integrate
its schools. The litigation ended three years later when the board agreed
to an out-of-court settlement that included widespread busing.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Green Bay, Wis., Reynolds earned an economics degree from the
University of Wisconsin, and after serving in World War II, earned his
law degree there.</TE>

<HD>Bear Cubs Released Back Into Wilderness</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two black bear cubs were released into the Yosemite wilderness
Friday, nearly seven months after they were captured and their mother
killed for breaking into cars, tents and trash bins.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists have raised the cubs since they were 4 months old. They
were captured June 14, the same day the cubs' mother was tranquilized and
later killed after she was caught breaking into a car for food with her
cubs in tow.</LD>
<LD>   The cubs' mother, an 8-year-old, 250-pound black bear named Eenie, had
been a problem bear in the park for years, said park spokesman Scott
Gediman.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to kill the mother angered some campers and saddened park
rangers, who tried unsuccessfully to relocate Eenie.</TE>

<HD>18 Inches of Rain Replenishes Reservoir</HD>

<LD>A year after officials were fretting about a dwindling water supply
and discussing rationing, winter rains have replenished the Loch Lomond
reservoir to the point that it is overflowing.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, 18 inches of rain fell in the Newell Creek watershed,
which drains into the reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason it's a big deal is everybody looks at it as an indicator
of the water health of the community," water director Bill Kocher said.
Still, it's only about 20% of the city's annual water supply.</LD>

<HD>Cyrus R. Vance, 84; 'Superb Statesman'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cyrus R. Vance, only the second U.S. secretary of State to resign
over a principle of conscience-in his case, President Carter's ill-fated
attempt to rescue American hostages from Iran-has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Vance, who served as the nation's top diplomat from 1977 to 1980 but
helped shape foreign policy for more than three decades, died Saturday at
Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York after a long battle with Alzheimer's
disease.</LD>
<LD>   "Cy Vance was an old-fashioned patriot," Warren Christopher, secretary
of State in the Clinton administration, said Saturday night shortly after
learning of his friend's death. "He devoted his enormous abilities to the
nation and to the cause of world peace. To those who had a chance to work
with him and the opportunity to know him, he was just an inspirational
role model.'</LD>
<TE>   Whatever their differences two decades ago, Carter was equally
gracious in his comments Saturday night on behalf of himself and his
wife, Rosalynn, calling Vance "a champion for peace and human rights.'</TE>
<TE>   "He was a superb statesman, who served me and other presidents well,"
Carter said. "We will miss his friendship, and the world will miss his
humanitarian work and goodness.'</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell described Vance as "the pride of a
generation of Americans who valued public service as the highest good.'</TE>
<TE>   One of the last of his breed of Ivy League-educated, wealthy
intellectuals who dominated the U.S. foreign policy establishment for
most of the 20th century, the shy, self-effacing Vance was a loyal
servant to numerous Democratic administrations. But nothing in his long
career attracted the attention like his resignation from the highest
office he ever held: secretary of State.</TE>
<TE>   Vance achieved modest success in the post-working to normalize ties
with China, negotiating new Panama Canal treaties and keeping Israel and
Egypt at the bargaining table until they signed the Camp David peace
accords in 1978. He is also widely credited with instilling the
international quest for human rights into U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   But he held the post during a demoralizing decline in American
prestige and power around the world, highlighted by events in Iran. He
was also overshadowed throughout his tenure by Carter's outspoken
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, whom many viewed as the
administration's voice on foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Vance's decisive break with Carter came in April 1980, when the
president launched his ill-fated attempt to rescue 52 American hostages
held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The raid came to an embarrassing and
tragic end when a helicopter and a cargo plane collided in the Iranian
desert, killing eight U.S. servicemen and injuring five others.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's initial go-ahead for the abortive mission came at a National
Security Council meeting attended by Brzezinski while Vance was out of
town. Vance, describing himself as "stunned and angry that such a
momentous decision had been made in my absence," returned to Washington
to argue against the mission.</TE>
<TE>   He said it would cause deaths of hostages and Iranians and also enrage
American allies who wanted to give sanctions time to work before taking
military action. Finding no support for his stand, Vance followed the
historic lead of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, who resigned
from the Woodrow Wilson Cabinet prior to World War I, and handed Carter
his letter of resignation without waiting to see how the mission fared.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew," Vance wrote in his memoirs, "I could not honorably remain as
secretary of State when I so strongly disagreed with a presidential
decision that went against my judgment as to what was best for the
country and for the hostages.'</TE>
<TE>   Born in Clarksburg, W.Va., Cyrus Roberts Vance majored in economics
and then law at Yale University, where he was a classmate of President
Kennedy's National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy and Kennedy's
brother-in-law Sargent Shriver. Vance served as a Navy gunnery officer
during World War II and practiced law on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   But the lawyer, described by Yale classmates as having "a Rolodex file
in his head," was quick to aid his government. In 1957, he was named
special counsel to a Senate subcommittee on military preparedness by
then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, beginning their long working relationship.
Vance also served as counsel for the Senate Special Committee on Space
and Astronautics and helped establish NASA.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Vance was quickly brought into the Kennedy administration as
chief legal officer of the Department of Defense. A year later, Kennedy
named him secretary of the Army.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, President Johnson appointed Vance deputy secretary of Defense
and made him a trouble-shooter to handle various crises, including the
Detroit racial riots in 1967. There he first worked with Christopher,
then a Justice Department aide, whom he later made his deputy secretary
of State. Vance's thorough report of the Detroit events won praise from
black leaders as well as government officials.</TE>
<TE>   At Johnson's behest, Vance also lent his calm, no-nonsense and
persevering negotiating skills to help avert a war between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots in 1967 and went to South Korea to assure continued U.S.
support after North Korea seized the U.S. intelligence ship Pueblo in
1968. Johnson also sent Vance to the Paris Peace Conference on Vietnam as
Ambassador Averell Harriman's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Vance "has always placed his country before himself,"
Johnson awarded him the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian
honor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Vance joined social scientist Daniel Yankelovich to form
Public Agenda, a New York-based nonpartisan public opinion research and
citizen education organization.</TE>
<TE>   Although he practiced law during the Nixon and Ford presidencies,
Vance remained such a presence in foreign policy that many dubbed him the
"secretary of State-in-waiting," and few were surprised when Carter named
him to the post.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to his New York law practice after the Carter years, Vance
headed the Federal Reserve Bank from 1988 to 1990 and continued to work
for world peace. In 1991, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
named him a special envoy to try to end the war in the former Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   With British foreign secretary David Owen, Vance successfully brokered
a cease-fire in Croatia and devised the Vance-Owen plan to divide Bosnia
into territories for all groups including Serbs. The Clinton
administration rejected the controversial plan, however, saying it
wrongly rewarded Serbs for aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Many foreign policy observers said the rejection was a crushing blow
to Vance, although he maintained his customary dignified reticence.
Others still consider his solution more equitable than what the Clinton
administration ultimately devised with the Dayton accords in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Vance largely removed himself from the foreign policy arena after
Bosnia. He continued to practice law, his son Cyrus R. Vance Jr. told the
Associated Press Saturday, until Alzheimer's disease began to curtail his
activities a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Vance is survived by his wife, five children and two grandchildren.</TE>

<DH>Tennis: Like other U.S. favorites in this Australian Open, Andy
Roddick will have to negotiate a tough draw to win the upcoming Grand
Slam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Athletes In Acting.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it's always harder than it appears. For every star turn, like
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in "Airplane," there is a wooden Wayne Gretzky on
"Saturday Night Live."</LD>
<LD>   Teenager Andy Roddick was finding this out shortly before Christmas at
the Los Angeles Tennis Club, even though he was playing himself, not
required to sing or dance. "I probably wouldn't have been caught dead
doing a play," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood wanted him to be himself. No problem ... once the cameras
stopped rolling on the set of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch." Sabrina,
played by Melissa Joan Hart, was spraying balls, off the court, and right
at Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   "You hit the ball well, Sabrina, you just have to learn how to hit it
in the court," Roddick said.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick was asked to project more. There are similarities to his day
job, of course, doing the same thing over and over for hours. Once you
get something right, something else goes wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the dialogue right and then I don't step out," Roddick said.</TE>
<TE>   He's had those days on the court, too. The serve is fine, but the
volley isn't.</TE>
<TE>   At the club, there was no crowd of 15,000, cheering his every gesture.
In some ways, it's tougher in front of the small crew and cast on
location. "I just don't want to mess up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Roddick couldn't help Sabrina, who had to resort to magic to
compete against her boyfriend on the court. And, maybe there should have
been some sort of cosmic tradeoff--she could have summoned her powers to
change his lousy draw at the Australian Open, which starts Monday.</TE>
<TE>   You begin to wonder about magic, superstitions and flat-out bad luck
for the top Americans when the 13th-seeded Roddick landed in the same
quarter of the draw as two-time defending champion and third-seeded Andre
Agassi, No. 8 Pete Sampras and No. 9 Marat Safin of Russia. What's this?
Legends vs. kids?</TE>
<TE>   Still, any conspiracy theories are dismissed when the case of
Australian favorite Lleyton Hewitt is considered. The U.S. Open champion
and top-ranked player, who is recovering from a recent run-in with
chicken pox, was not exactly handed a cure when the draw came out. He
will open against Alberto Martin of Spain and is in the same half as
Agassi, Sampras, Roddick and company.</TE>
<TE>   The women's draw is not nearly as unbalanced. Venus Williams, seeded
second, will try to win her third consecutive Grand Slam, following her
Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles in 2001. For the first time, she has put
in early preparation in Australia, winning the Gold Coast tournament two
weeks ago. Williams is unbeaten in 20 matches since losing to Meghann
Shaughnessy in Palo Alto in July.</TE>
<TE>   She could meet her younger sister, fifth-seeded Serena Williams, in
the semifinals if Serena gets past a possible quarterfinal against No. 3
Martina Hingis of Switzerland. Hingis, who was trying to win her first
tournament in 11 months on Saturday in Sydney, has played in the last
five Australian Open finals, winning three. Her last Grand Slam title was
the 1999 Australian Open, but since losing the top ranking last year,
Hingis seems to have relaxed, adopting the role of challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport, recovering from knee surgery, will not play.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jennifer Capriati is coming off a shaky performance
in a three-set loss to Alexandra Stevenson in Sydney, and finds herself
in the same half of the draw as Belgians Kim Clijsters, seeded fourth,
and Justine Henin, seeded sixth. Stevenson and Anna Kournikova would be
considered two dangerous, unseeded floaters, if not for their first-round
draws.</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson will play No. 10 Shaughnessy in the first round, and
Shaughnessy beat her in the quarterfinals in Sydney and reached the final
when Serena Williams retired because of injury. Kournikova will meet
Henin in her first match at Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   An early Kournikova departure would turn full Australian attention
back to the fortunes of Hewitt and his troublesome draw. His quarter is
almost ridiculously loaded with talent. There's 11th-seeded Roger Federer
of Switzerland, No. 7 Tommy Haas of Germany and two former Australian
Open finalists, Carlos Moya of Spain and Marcelo Rios of Chile. Federer
won the tour event in Sydney after beating Roddick in the semifinals.
Rios, a former No. 1, is one of the most dangerous floaters, along with
Australian Mark Philippoussis, who is in the lower half.</TE>
<TE>   And, another former Australian Open finalist is in Hewitt's portion of
the draw: No. 15 Arnaud Clement of France, who lost to Agassi in straight
sets in last year's year's final.</TE>
<TE>   This tournament has not been kind to native sons. It has been almost
14 years since an Australian male reached the final (Pat Cash), and the
most recent singles champion was Mark Edmondson in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt lost early in Melbourne last year, but it seems more like five
years ago the way he has evolved. After winning the U.S. Open in
September, Hewitt has not relented, becoming the youngest player to reach
the No. 1 ranking. One of his lesser-known accomplishments, outside of
Australia, was his stunning victory in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup
against Gustavo Kuerten, on Kuerten's home clay turf in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The setting was different in New York at the Open, but it had a Davis
Cup-type feel when Hewitt faced Roddick in the quarterfinals. Roddick
exploded after a controversial overrule late in the fifth set and lost
the match, throwing one of the most explosive temper tantrums of his
young career.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick regained his equilibrium quickly after the loss, thanking the
crowd for the support. But it remains a defining episode and he spoke
about it during a break from trading shots with Sabrina.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost embarrassing," he said of his outburst. "That's something
I've been working on. I've been seeing a sports psychologist [in Boca
Raton], so I'll have my fire. But I'm going to have it in check. That's
definitely important. That's a big part of my energy and where my power
and energy come from. At the same time, I need to be able to step out of
the situation and see it, from the outside looking in, to say, 'Mellow
out.'</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at ways, if I feel myself wandering, to snap out of it
and get back into the flow. The fans there were so great. I didn't need
them to hear me crying about everything. I was lucky to be out there
playing. I saved my fumes for when I was away from everybody."</TE>
<TE>   So what's next, hypnosis?</TE>
<TE>   Roddick shook his head but was quick with a one-liner.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time, I hear a bell ring, I have to cluck like a chicken," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   This will be Roddick's first Australian Open as a professional. Last
year, he realized he needed more matches and went to a challenger event
in Hawaii, and won it, instead of making the long trip to Melbourne for
qualifying. Unlike others before him, he welcomes the hype, although not
indulging in it but taking the best it has to offer, like parts on WB
shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely different," he said. "I had a lot of exposure this
year. I'd rather have it that way than the other way because that means
you're winning matches. I like to set short-term goals, so I feel like
I'm close to it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you set something like, 'Career goal, I want to win 10 Grand
Slams.' But if you're sitting here at none, then it seems a little
unrealistic. If I set a goal, I want to be top-whatever [before]
Ericsson, it gives you something to strive for, something to go for."</TE>

<AU>RONALD BLUM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Rep. John Conyers Jr. would back off his call for Bud Selig's
resignation if the commissioner dropped his threat to eliminate teams
this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos are the likely targets of
Selig's contraction plan.</LD>
<LD>   Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said
Wednesday that Selig appeared to violate major league rules in 1995 when
he arranged a loan for his Milwaukee Brewers from a company controlled by
Twins owner Carl Pohlad. The loan, Conyers said, created an "irreparable
conflict of interest."</LD>
<TE>   "As an alternative, let me suggest that you immediately announce that
major league baseball will not contract any teams and not place any team
ownership in league control prior to the conclusion of the upcoming
season," Conyers wrote Selig on Thursday. "This would give us all the
time and opportunity necessary to consider the range of issues, including
potential conflict of interest problems, that have arisen."</TE>
<TE>   Selig replied to Conyers but did not respond to the congressman's
suggestion that contraction be put off.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the hearing on the grievance by the players' association to
block contraction resumed before arbitrator Shyam Das. On the eighth day
of the hearing, union head Donald Fehr completed his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Also, baseball general counsel Tom Ostertag and Atlanta Braves
chairman Bill Bartholomay met with Donald Watkins, who says he wants to
buy the Twins from Pohlad.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great day, a very positive and productive meeting," Watkins
said. "I finally found the welcome mat in major league baseball. I
couldn't have scripted a meeting any better if I had tried to write it as
a screenplay."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins' Pohlad, frustrated that Minnesota's government hasn't
approved a plan for funding a new ballpark, told Selig he is willing to
have his franchise folded as part of Selig's contraction plan.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins would like to save the Twins by purchasing the team. He would
be the first black controlling owner in major league history.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a chance for me to go over in great detail matters that were
covered in my application form," Watkins said, "particularly personal
background matters and financial portfolio matters, and to explain to
them the financing model and rationale for wanting to build a privately
financed stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Bartholomay was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very friendly, productive and informative introductory
meeting," Ostertag said. "We covered a wide range of topics in a
comprehensive manner and will continue to have discussions in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins intends to speak with Twins president Jerry Bell about getting
permission to review the team's financial records. Watkins said
Bartholomay and Ostertag encouraged him to contact the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "They suggested that I contact Carl Pohlad directly now and have my
first meeting with him," Watkins said. "I will do that when I get back to
Birmingham next week."</TE>
<TE>   Owners voted Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams, but did not select which
ones. Ten days later, a Minnesota judge issued an injunction that forces
the Twins to play next season, an order the team and baseball have asked
the Minnesota Court of Appeals to overturn.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the logistical difficulties in contracting at this late
juncture, the pending lawsuit in Minnesota, and the players'
association's complaint, it would seem that it is impossible to contract
at this point without creating even more problems for baseball, its
players, and most importantly, its fans," Conyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Conyers' staff and baseball are at odds over disclosure of the sport's
financial information. Conyers wants baseball to waive a confidentiality
clause that prevents the union from releasing financial information it
has obtained from management.</TE>
<TE>   In a Jan. 4 letter to Judiciary Committee chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner, baseball lawyer Bob DuPuy said the union could discuss any
of the information management released but could not release any figures
that were still confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Selig, in his letter to Conyers, claimed baseball and the committee
had agreed to a solution, but Conyers' staff disputed that.</TE>

told so, but who's to know? The way legends grow, no report is to be
trusted until we see it done. We knew the story's outline, that the old
man had been great, so good he might have led the NBA in scoring 10
times, might have won five MVP awards on six championship teams. Some
mythmakers insist he could've been the best player ever.</LD>
<LD>   But who was to know?</LD>
<LD>   We hadn't seen him.</LD>
<TE>   Imagine a great player never seen, a shadow, never on television,
never on billboards. Imagine that all we know is was what we heard, and
we heard only the legend. That every night he did something offensively
no one had done before. That on defense he knew what you'd do before you
thought to do it. Imagine seeing such a player for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Word came of his preparation. Camps in Chicago, California, Las Vegas.
"He played games every night," came word from Hubie Brown, a basketball
master, once the NBA's Coach of the Year, now a television analyst. "He
was already at his playing weight, he looked fantastic, and he crushed
everybody. Crushed them."</TE>
<TE>   And now, three months into this NBA season, we know.</TE>
<TE>   Myth can come to life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great story," Hubie Brown says, "You can't do what this guy's
doing, but he's doing it. It's the best damn thing that's happened to the
NBA in years."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it has been easy. The tall, bald, nameless one at age 38 is
too old to be running on wood two hours a day from October to June.</TE>
<TE>   Because his right knee hurt, he sat out practices to save the pain for
games. The tendinitis also limited his strength and movement in ways that
brought him down from the air; sometimes, grounded, he seemed more lie
than legend.</TE>
<TE>   The legend: He made his teammates better.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 fact: He made his teammates worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We stink," he said one night when he'd shot poorly and wouldn't stop
shooting and by his insistence on shooting had rendered his teammates
irrelevant, perhaps distrustful. The team's best young player, Richard
Hamilton, could build no rhythm because the old man worked to the rhythm
of his choosing and demanded, if not by words by actions, that everyone
fit their work inside his.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he hadn't said, "They stink." He'd said, "We stink," the plural
pronoun bringing the blanket of humiliation over himself as well as the
young players there with him. He included himself not for diplomacy's
sake but in the name of truth-telling, cold and hard; as he knew what
you'd do with the ball before you knew it, he knew he had played so far
beneath his standards as to be embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   The legend: "I love this game like a wife."</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 truth: "We stink."</TE>
<TE>   They'd lost eight in a row even before the night he smelled
incompetence. Offended by the odor, here's what the tall, bald, nameless
one did: he said, "I'm his sidekick now," acknowledging the stature of
the young star, Richard Hamilton. No longer would every possession move
to the old man's rhythms. Maybe he wanted the ball so much early on
because he'd been away so long. Maybe he was in a hurry to show us what
he could do. In any case, he came to know, and, more important, act on
this truth: He's an important player, but not the only player.</TE>
<TE>   His team's 7-foot rookie center, Brendan Haywood, suddenly owned the
defensive boards. Hubert Davis, Tyronn Lue, and Chris Whitney became
3-point gunners. Among the league's highest-scoring teammates, Richard
Hamilton and the old man now move alongside Shaq/Kobe, Pierce/Walker,
Stojakovic/Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after stinking out the place in Cleveland, his team won nine
consecutive games, tying the franchise's all-time record.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," Hubie Brown says, "he's playing with 10 teammates 25 years
old or younger. They're playing for a new coach, an old-school coach
who'll sit you down if you don't play the game right. They're all in a
new system. It takes months of education to get the timing down, to know
where everybody is going to be and when they're going to be there, how
they're going to play against each team."</TE>
<TE>   When the old man's team followed the winning streak by losing two in a
row, the second with him scoring six points on 2-of-10 shooting, Brown
said, "Again, people in the media murdered him."</TE>
<TE>   This, despite record crowds home and away, almost-doubled TV ratings
and statistics that identify him as one of the NBA's top 10 players. And,
after the six-point night, he came back the next game with 24 points in
the first quarter, 51 for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He claims he's getting stronger, and I believe him," Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to get 50 catches in a game, let alone score 51, is a big deal
because the other team always has its best defender on him."</TE>
<TE>   As to what the tall, bald, nameless one did the morning after the
51-point night, it is a measure of the legend's validity that at 8:30
a.m. he met his personal trainer. Kids may have slept. The old man worked
out.</TE>

<HD>All Should Agree Warner's the MVP</HD>
<DH>NFL: Ram quarterback's unique qualities ignored by some voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner, the Ram quarterback who, some believe, is football's
best passer since Joe Namath, isn't getting the heavy support he has
earned for the NFL</LD>
<LD>   Most Valuable Player or even for all-pro.</LD>
<LD>   When Warner was named league MVP by the Associated Press this week, he
gotonly 211/2 votes in a nationwide poll of 50 football writers.</LD>
<TE>   There were 28 votes--a clear majority--for other candidates. One man
split his ballot between two Rams, Warner and running back Marshall
Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven writers voted for Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre or
Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart or Chicago linebacker Brian
Urlacher.</TE>
<TE>   First-team all-pro votes this season have also gone to Favre and
Stewart as well as Warner.</TE>
<TE>   What accounts for this? Why is there a widespread reluctance to accept
Warner as pro football player of this era?</TE>
<TE>   The general problem is that the precise qualities that make football
players great are frequently elusive. Excellence is harder to see and to
measure in football men, particularly quarterbacks, than in baseball
players, for instance, or Olympic sprinters.</TE>
<TE>   In Warner's case, moreover, several things cloud the picture.</TE>
<TE>   First, and above all, Warner's coach, Mike Martz, is clearly the most
thoughtful and creative of modern coaches--producing an illusion that
Warner is a kind of puppet. Secondly, Warner is surrounded by what seem
to be the products of a giant talent-manufacturing machine--other Ram
talent starts with runner-receiver Faulk and continues through both
lineups, offensive and defensive--producing an illusion that any
quarterback could give this team what it gets from Warner. Some critics
have said exactly that.</TE>
<TE>   On a more personal level, Warner, for a modern quarterback, is slow
and small (smaller than his listed 6 feet 2 and 220 pounds) and he's no
scrambler. He comes across as neither a power-armed passer like Peyton
Manning or even Vinny Testaverde nor an audacious scrambler-passer like
Favre or even Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Warner, in other words, doesn't match the general perception of a
great quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Favre does, to be sure. And, this year, Stewart has.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, what Warner has that makes him an all-time quarterback is
unusually difficult to see.</TE>
<TE>   It IS easy to see his interceptions. And because the NFL's many
conservative coaches and commentators focus so heavily on turnovers,
football fans have been conditioned to overrate interceptions and
fumbles, failing to apprehend that turnovers rarely stop or even bother
Warner's kind of team, a passing team that almost always overcomes
interceptions by going back out to the field and throwing again. And
again. Often for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   So what does their quarterback have that makes him what he is and that
makes the Rams what they are?</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, Warner is a unique decision-maker. He makes up his mind
in a quarter of an instant to throw the ball to the right target in the
right place, and, in that same quarter instant, he actually unloads. And
who can see decision-making? Who can see magic? You can see the magician,
but not, really, what the magician does. Even in slow-motion replays of
Warner in action, it's all hard to see.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, he has never been wholly appreciated for what he is--or what he
does--by sports fans, by the media, or even by his own teammates, many
who consider Faulk the MVP.</TE>
<TE>   For \o7 anyone\f7  can see what \o7 Faulk\f7  does. And that's a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Like Warner, Faulk is unique and extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the playoffs last season, when Warner had a concussion, the
Rams tried to run the ball with Faulk and couldn't, losing to the New
Orleans Saints.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that, as great as Faulk is, it's Warner who makes the
Rams go--who makes his teammates seem exceptional.</TE>
<TE>   For one example, on a typical Ram play, the main reason the receiver
looks so wide open is that the passer has so quickly found him. In the
Martz system, there's always a man open, but not, of course, for long,
and Warner, the unique decision-maker, has already thrown him the ball.
It comes out of Warner's arm effortlessly, fluidly.</TE>
<TE>   He sees and does, sees and does.</TE>
<TE>   And, somehow, he not only hits the receiver in stride but in the
defensive hole that has opened however briefly.</TE>
<TE>   And so, after beating Atlanta last Sunday, 31-13, the Rams are 14-2
and favored in the Super Bowl run that began this weekend, when, along
with second-favorite Pittsburgh, they'll have a day off.</TE>
<TE>   On the Las Vegas lines, the Rams have been favored since the start of
training camp, currently at 4-5 to 1-2, with Pittsburgh next at 7-2..</TE>
<TE>   It takes some luck as well as fine quarterbacking to win a Super Bowl,
and the Rams, in a sport as rough as football, are assured of neither.
But as long as Warner remains in action, he will offer the most to
see--except that you can't actually see it.</TE>
<TE>The Size Is Right</TE>
<TE>   Also in the news this week was Emmitt Smith, who, for 12 seasons,
Emmitt Smith has been the Dallas Cowboys' principal running back,
starting the year he was drafted in the first round in 1990, continuing
through the Super Bowl seasons and the losing seasons</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday in Detroit, he became the first NFL ballcarrier to exceed
1,000 yards in each of 11 consecutive seasons. As a rookie, Smith had
finished fifth in the NFC with only 937 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Running backs don't do--can't do--what Smith has so effortlessly done.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, when good pro clubs start to break up, the running backs are
the first to go, then the receivers, then the defense, then the blockers,
then the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver Broncos, for instance, went through 11 running backs in
John Elway's 15 seasons. .</TE>
<TE>   At Dallas by contrast, runner Smith has outlasted \o7 his\f7  passer,
Troy Aikman--and everyone else except one or two linemen--prompting the
question that intrigues the league: What accounts for Smith's continuing
excellence and longevity--at \o7 that\f7  position?</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most important part of the answer is that he's the right
size exactly for an effective modern running back: very short and
stocky--at not more than 5 feet 9 inches and 209 pounds--with uncommonly
strong legs and arms.</TE>
<TE>   He has, in other words, the physical equipment to fight off the modern
defensive stars.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years preceding Smith, running backs changed markedly in
physical structure:</TE>
<TE>   * The first great one, Bronko Nagurski, was famous in his generation
for size (6 feet 2, 225 pounds), strength, and power.</TE>
<TE>   * A Nagurski contemporary, the extraordinary Red Grange, was lithe and
ghostlike, known, in fact, as the Galloping Ghost</TE>
<TE>   * Then came the anomalous Jim Brown, who combined Nagurski's size with
outrageous speed.</TE>
<TE>   * Along the way, the NFL introduced the game's noted specialists in
speed and moves, All-Pros like Hugh McElhenny and Gale Sayers, who were
succeeded by the fastest of them all, O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   * Another in the Simpson mold was Eric Dickerson, who at 6 feet 3 was
nearly as elusive and even taller.</TE>
<TE>   To his peers, Simpson, at 6 feet 1 and 212 pounds, seemed football's
ideal running back, all-time, and so he still seems, except for his
height. He would be too tall to make it big today. So was Dickerson, and
so, in fact, were Nagurski, Brown and the other big backs over all the
years.</TE>
<TE>   For the NFL's 21st-century defensive impact players have also changed
in shape and style. Height isn't the advantage it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   The defining asset now is the strength and ability, in one-on-one
contact, to drive up on one's opponent. Today you can't win hitting down
on your man, in either boxing or football. Indeed, today's football,
whether you're carrying the ball or attacking the ballcarrier, is chiefly
about who's driving up on whom. And Smith has the right asset for today's
game, as did the other short-statured strongmen who brought the modern
style to fruition, Walter Payton (who was 5-10) and Earl Campbell (who at
5-11 was almost too tall). One question is whether there will ever be
another All-Pro 6-footer at running back.</TE>
<TE>   Smith to be sure has more than size and style. He is of the generation
that is never out of shape, making it his life's work to work out
year-round. At gametime, in the incredible traffic one encounters in and
around an NFL scrimmage line, he has the sixth or seventh sense to
somehow avoid the solid hits that have crippled so many other players.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he has heart and gumption. When the Cowboys started along
the wrong track this season, Smith went public with an announcement that
if they'd more often give him the ball, they'd be better off. And he made
good on that perception and prediction. As a running back, Smith keeps
proving that he is one in thousands. And thousands.</TE>
<TE>Numbers Problem</TE>
<TE>   The people who think the NFL's weekly statistics are not only
incomplete but often wrong are probably right.</TE>
<TE>   It's obvious that the league could improve its statistical system
someday. The one now in use provides no more than a fraction of the
information you get in baseball's statistics. But the problem is that
like an errant forward pass, it's easier to see what's wrong than repair
it.</TE>
<TE>   For example, present weekly computations of total yards passing by NFL
quarterbacks, though generally meaningless, are beyond a quick fix.</TE>
<TE>   These numbers purport to identify the best passers in statistical
terms. Instead, the kind of thing they tend to show is that those who
throw passes for losing teams could well compile the most yards--a farce
that happened again when last Sunday's champion passer, Kerry Collins of
the New York Giants, was on the losing side in the Green Bay game.</TE>
<TE>   A principal explanation for this is simply that losing teams throw
more second-half passes than winning teams. So of what use are such
statistics? Whom do they inform?</TE>
<TE>   Similarly lacking in meaning are individual yards-rushing totals each
week.</TE>
<TE>   Game-day ground-gaining success is usually a function of what's
happening on the scoreboard. Thus, running backs for teams that fall
behind by one or two touchdowns get fewer carries and less yardage than
runners for teams protecting a second-half lead. Here's what you often
see in an NFL game:</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, when the running back for Team A is struggling
against Team B's eager, well-rested defensive line, his teammates open up
a lead with pass plays or breaks or both. In the second half, when the
Team B defense is tiring or demoralized or both during a losing cause,
Team A's running back explodes with a 100-yard day. Total statistics
reflect, of course, the full 60 minutes of the game. And so at the
winning coach's press conference a day later, he points to the
statistical sheet and says: "You win when you run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is far more complicated. During the stretches of the game
when the score was close and Team B's defense was fresh and charging,
Team A \o7 couldn't\f7  run the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The yards-gained-rushing statistic for that game was, as it usually
is, false--on balance--and, accordingly, no help to the coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Even more erroneous is the statistic known as "third down
conversions." Although the difference between third and one and third and
long is enormous--usually decisive--it isn't reflected, or even hinted
at, in the "third down conversions" table.</TE>
<TE>   A third-and-nine pass is so difficult to complete that it doesn't
effectively measure the passer's skill. No matter how gifted he is
technically, when nine yards are needed, he can't often get that much
with a third-down pass against an NFL team that understands pass defense
and executes properly.</TE>
<TE>   And it's about the same on third and six or seven. Thus,
third-and-long passes are a test not of pass offense but of pass defense.
When a passer completes one of those, as he does occasionally, the
football question raised isn't, "How good is the passer?" but, "How did
the pass defense fail?"</TE>
<TE>   What's really important in offensive football is staying \o7 OUT\f7
of third down altogether because the defensive advantage on that play in
today's football is so overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Rams led the NFL again in most points in part because
they made it a point to attack aggressively on first and second downs,
thus avoiding, where possible, the perils of third down. That could be a
valuable lesson to other teams, both intellectually and statistically,
except there's no statistic for it.</TE>

<HD>49ers Want to End Favre's Cold Spell</HD>
<DH>Conditions Should Be Right for Quarterback, Who Is 30-0 at Lambeau
When Temperature Is Below 35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now the truth comes out. San Francisco's Steve Mariucci used to
coach quarterbacks in Green Bay, and he has a steamy little secret that
helps explain why Brett Favre plays as if he has antifreeze in his veins.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to hold quarterback meetings in the sauna," said Mariucci,
whose 49ers play at Green Bay today in an NFC wild-card game. "I used to
go in there at halftime with Brett and Mark Brunell. We'd get warm real
fast."</LD>
<LD>   Aha, of course, the Finnish formula. So, Steve, is the visitors'
locker room equipped with a sauna too?</LD>
<TE>   "Heck no."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the Packers have never lost a playoff game at Lambeau Field,
and Favre is 30-0 at home when the temperature at kickoff is 34 degrees
or colder.</TE>
<TE>   "Cold is the key, and the quarterback being able to handle it,"
Mariucci said. "You've got to remember not to overdress with, like, 13
layers of thermals. You'll see guys burning their shoes on those
heaters."</TE>
<TE>   Once, during a game against the Los Angeles Rams in December 1992,
Mariucci spotted an opposing player inch too close to a sideline heater
featuring an open flame. The players' ankle tape caught fire and he wound
up with a singed foot.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Green Bay forecast calls for partly cloudy skies with
temperatures ranging from the mid-20s to the low 30s. Regardless of the
weather, the Packers are ready.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in it," running back Ahman Green said. "We go to the grocery
store, we go to our mailboxes, we drive home in it, and it's no big deal
for us to get ready for it on Sunday because we're in it every day, day
in and day out. That's how we get over the mental aspect of it real
quick."</TE>
<TE>   Mariucci, whose roster is loaded with young players, regaled them this
week with stories about the cold, the jet-engine-loud Green Bay fans, and
the 49ers' recent problems at Lambeau, where they haven't won since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But he also reminded them they had been picked to finish around
.500--not 12-4--and of how Garrison Hearst stunned everyone with his
comeback, how Jeff Garcia became the first quarterback in franchise
history to throw 30 touchdown passes in consecutive seasons, how their
defense has posted a franchise-record three shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done so many things this season that we weren't supposed to be
able to do," he said. "This is just another thing for us to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Never before has a team with 12 victories opened with a wild-card game
on the road. But the fourth-seeded Packers earned the right to host the
fifth-seeded 49ers by virtue of a better record in conference games.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, these teams have played four times in the playoffs, the
Packers winning the first three before the 49ers answered with a 30-27
victory in a wild-card game at San Francisco in 1999--Green Bay's last
appearance in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Owens won it for the 49ers with a 25-yard touchdown catch with
three seconds to play, hanging onto the ball while sandwiched between two
Packer defenders at the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's when Terrell Owens made a name for himself," defensive
end Vonnie Holliday told the Green Bay Press-Gazette this week. "That's a
very, very bitter memory of the playoffs. It was a great play, a great
throw and a great catch. But hopefully we can go out and create a new
memory."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers established the run this season, finishing with 2,244 yards
rushing--second to Pittsburgh's 2,774--and a No. 4 ranking overall. And
the Packer defense, a sometime thing, has been especially vulnerable to
the run, having allowed 1,769 yards rushing. The Tennessee Titans, with
only the eighth-ranking offense, amassed 423 yards in a mid-December
26-20 victory over Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, who has feuded with Mariucci all season, might be churlish and
divisive, but he's also one of the NFL's best receivers and Garcia's
favorite target. He has 93 catches for 1,412 yards with 16 touchdowns.
He's a good blocker, too, and will test a Packer secondary that has given
up only 14 touchdown passes, fourth in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   It's likely that Owens frequently will draw cornerback Mike McKenzie,
who is much more physical than fellow corner Tyrone Williams.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's 13th-ranked defense has made dramatic strides after
finishing 31st in 1999 and 29th last season. The 49ers have posted their
three shutouts in the last six weeks, and the unit also held Philadelphia
to a field goal, pulling off consecutive goal-line stands in that 13-3
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay's defense collected 52 sacks--20 more than the 49ers--which
was second in the NFC. End Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila had 131/2, third best in
the conference.</TE>
<TE>   But the real Packer stars are Favre, who finished third in MVP voting,
and Green, who rolled up 1,981 yards from scrimmage. Favre has a career
passer rating of 91.1 in the playoffs, and has thrown at least one
touchdown pass in 10 consecutive postseason games. And, as he has proven
time and again, he can get hot when it's cold.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us to another Mariucci secret, one that blows the cover on
Green Bay's mystique. Blasphemy, really.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," he said, "it's cold for them too."</TE>

<LD>At a time when high school transfers are rising at an alarming
rate, and administrators, coaches and parents are bickering over who's to
blame, Perry Klein and David Wooley offer lessons from the past.</LD>
<LD>   They played during a time when transfers were largely restricted.
Gaining athletic eligibility after switching schools occurred only if you
moved, created a false address, obtained a special permit or lied about
who you were living with.</LD>
<LD>   Klein was known as "Mr. Transfer" when he went from Palisades to
Carson to Santa Monica in a 10-month period during the 1988-89 sports
seasons.</LD>
<TE>   He passed for nearly 4,000 yards as a junior quarterback at Palisades
in 1987, then moved into a two-bedroom apartment near Carson High because
he wanted to win a City championship and play for his quarterback coach,
Steve Clarkson.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived there by myself," he said. "You can imagine what I had to
deal with. It was pressure and stress that was really undue."</TE>
<TE>   Carson won the City title in 1988 and Klein got a scholarship to
California. In the spring, he returned to his parents' home in Malibu and
played volleyball for Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Klein, 30, said he doesn't regret trying to fulfill his high school
football aspirations by transferring but has second thoughts about the
way he went about it.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason it was easy for me to do was I didn't have loyalty to a
particular school," he said. "I was the one who initiated it. People
think parents are the ones pushing their kids to do these things. When
you get to a certain age, you make decisions yourself. I didn't think of
the other ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   His mother and father occasionally stayed with him at the rented
apartment, but mostly he was on his own as a 17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a lot of [criticism] for what I did," he said. "I was pretty
high profile.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was like, 'Whatever.' That reputation followed me to
college and always had a negative connotation."</TE>
<TE>   In college, Klein transferred from California to C.W. Post, an NCAA
Division II school in Brookville, N.Y., and was a fourth-round draft
choice of the Atlanta Falcons in 1994. He never made it in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Now living in Pacific Palisades, he works for his father selling
computer chips and has a 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. His
wife, Cari, coached Los Angeles Marymount to the state Division IV
championship in girls' volleyball the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be long before he tries to decide what high school his
children should attend. He has no intention of letting them move from
school to school even if it's a lot easier to transfer today because of
open enrollment, a 1994 state law that gave students the right to
transfer without moving.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love my son to go to Palisades High, but if he's an aspiring
film maker, I'm going to try my best to get him to Crossroads, but I'm
going to do it early," he said. "I wouldn't want my son to go through
what I went through."</TE>
<TE>   He said he doesn't want his wife to suffer the same anguish some of
his coaches experienced. .</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want her to lose any kids," he said. "The worst part is
when a coach and player have a great relationship and the player leaves
to go to a school to be seen or be on a [top] team."</TE>
<TE>   Wooley was a youth basketball player living in Van Nuys in the early
1980s, a time when Granada Hills Kennedy had one of the best programs in
the City Section because of Darren Daye and Stuart Gray. Both of those
players went on to play at UCLA and in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 13," Wooley said. "I wanted to go to Van Nuys, but Van Nuys
wasn't a basketball power."</TE>
<TE>   He decided to attend Kennedy by using someone else's address so he
could play with his club teammates who lived in the Kennedy district.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Kennedy was getting transfer students from Los Angeles Verbum
Dei, Detroit and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   A guard named Zach Lieberman was gaining attention, because he had
attended Van Nuys Montclair Prep and Woodland Hills Taft before enrolling
at Kennedy. Lieberman's father was accused of trying to recruit players
for the Golden Cougars.</TE>
<TE>   Wooley was briefly declared ineligible but eventually played for
Kennedy, never becoming a standout.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to find my way as a youth," he said. "It gave me a sense
of power in my life. That's what's troubling me now.</TE>
<TE>   "I see kids being guided and recruited. I'm coaching at the youth
level and have a 10-year-old who coaches already are asking, 'What is he
going to do for high school?' The kid is in the fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want him to go through what I went through. We got treated
like stars. It's not real life. After the game is over, nobody cares."</TE>
<TE>   Wooley spends his free time coaching 9-and 10-year-olds for the
Guardian Hoop Club, a youth basketball travel team. He sees high school
players transferring for promises of college scholarships or exposure and
wonders if they are being deceived.</TE>
<TE>   "All the transferring can't do anything once the game starts," he
said. "Either you can play or you can't."</TE>
