<HD>A Big Break for 'Breaking News'</HD>
<DH>Television* After being shelved by TNT, which poured $20
million into its development, the series is rescued by Bravo and
begins airing Wednesday.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Breaking News" has had more than its share of bad news.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-paced drama about a 24-hour television newsroom was due
to premiere in January 2001 on the TNT cable network. But executives
kept pushing the debut back, while assuring the creator and executive
producer, Gardner Stern, that they liked the show.</LD>
<LD>   Stern was patient, but the delays continued. Production on the
13-episode order wrapped near the end of the year, but the series was
still not on the air.</LD>
<TE>   "All during the time where we were in production, TNT was so
supportive and complimentary about what we were doing," Stern said.
It wasn't until nearly a year ago that Stern got the news from
TNT--that the show was being shelved entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry, I was perplexed, I was disappointed," said Stern,
who has been a writer and producer on the series "NYPD Blue" and "Law
&amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of a network producing 13 episodes of a show and
then not airing it. There were 150 people who all operated in a
vacuum for the better part of a year. And I never got my phone calls
returned when I called executives to ask for an explanation."</TE>
<TE>   TNT was not only throwing away the work of a large cast and crew,
but also an estimated $20-million investment in the drama.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by AOL Time Warner-owned TNT to pull the drama also
angered others involved in the show. "I was, quite simply, furious,"
said Clancy Brown, who plays news division president Peter Kozyck.
"This is an important show, and there's nothing like it on
television. On the other hand, I'm a stockholder in AOL Time Warner,
and it just didn't seem right that they would spend so much just to
ax the show. It just smelled really foul."</TE>
<TE>   As for why TNT opted not to run "Breaking News," a network
spokesperson said, "The network has decided in assessing its upcoming
programming opportunities and resources that the original series
'Breaking News' will no longer be a part of our upcoming schedule."
No further explanation was offered, though industry insiders
speculate the $20-million investment will be a tax write-off.</TE>
<TE>   Stern and Brown are now celebrating the fact that "Breaking News"
will finally air on Bravo, beginning Wednesday at 8 p.m., as the
cable network's first original series.</TE>
<TE>   Said Brown: "I'm thrilled that it's going somewhere--I just wish
it had gone sooner."</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the show is actually a better fit for Bravo, which is
known for intelligent, thought-provoking programming," Stern added.
"TNT is known for 'Witchblade' "--a reference to the network's
current science-fiction series.</TE>
<TE>   The drama revolves around a hectic newsroom, its internal politics
and how various forces influence and shape the news that gets on the
air. In addition to Brown, the ensemble cast includes Tim Matheson as
Dan Rather-ish anchor Bill Dunne and Lisa Ann Walter as workaholic
executive producer Rachel Glass.</TE>
<TE>   After TNT shelved the series around June 2001, New Line
Television, which produces the series along with Trilogy
Entertainment Group, tried to sell it to another network. It was too
late.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing couldn't have been worse," said Stern. "Everyone had
just announced their fall schedules and were not in a position to buy
a show, especially not one they hadn't developed. We had to cool our
heels for four to five months."</TE>
<TE>   Bravo eventually came to the rescue late last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized a series with extremely high production values,
great writing, a great ensemble cast," said Francis Berwick, Bravo's
senior vice president of programming and production. "It was a
completely out-of-the-blue opportunity for us."</TE>
<TE>   However, should "Breaking News" become a big hit that the cable
network wants to continue beyond its initial run, there are
obstacles. The cast, writers and creative and technical crews have
already moved on to other projects.</TE>
<TE>   "If the series is a big hit, we will obviously find a way to
continue the series and bring back the key talent," Berwick said. "We
are backing this series with a significant marketing campaign, and we
wouldn't be doing that if we didn't believe in the show, and if we
didn't think there was a life to the show."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is one of those who has moved on to other projects but said
he would like to return if the series connects with audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be difficult, but I would bend over backward to do it,"
said Brown. "That's how much I believe in this show."</TE>

<HD>Southwest Chamber Fine-Tunes Quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reasons to celebrate abound in Southwest Chamber Music's summer
prognosis: Its eight-concert, July-August Festival Series sold out
two months ago and is now in its ninth summer season at the
commodious Huntington Library in San Marino.</LD>
<LD>   Most important, the organization's reconstituted string quartet,
which opened the 2002 concerts Saturday night, is a keeper.</LD>
<LD>   On the open-air Art Gallery loggia, the ensemble--violinists Mark
Menzies and Johnny Chang, violist Jan Karlin and cellist Paula
Fehrenbach--gave a tight and satisfying program and thorough, bracing
performances.</LD>
<TE>   The accomplishment thus represented is admirable, for the four
performed pieces require well-honed skills, abundant techniques and a
versatile stylishness, which they received.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Crockett's abrasive but rewarding Second Quartet (1994)
proved the apt centerpiece. It grabs and holds the listener taut
through contrasting episodes in its 24-minute length.</TE>
<TE>   Before the performance, the composer revealed to the audience that
this work has a program, part of which Crockett outlined. One
listener, however, enjoyed the performance purely on the abstract,
pure-sound level, as a series of continuous emotional musical events.</TE>
<TE>   The first movement, for example, carries ebullience past the point
of frenzy before it winds down, its energy spent. The gorgeous,
neo-Bartokian Adagio liberamente is as thoughtful as the opening had
been compulsive. The handsome and tricky finale flirts with a chaotic
scenario, using pizzicato and harmonics as its main languages.</TE>
<TE>   Stravinsky's tough and pungent Concertino for String Quartet
(1920) also exacted a visceral but clarified response from the
Southwest ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting Mozart quartets, the early K. 157 in C and the later
K. 458 in B flat, "The Hunt," opened and closed this pleasureful
evening. Both showed the ensemble as a tight, accomplished body in
which the skillful players enjoy making music together.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood's Newest Set of Bad Guys</HD>
<DH>A spate of gangster profiles and films firmly puts the
Irish in an uncomfortable place the Italians know all too well</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DAL CERRO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, "60 Minutes" ran a lengthy news piece on "Whitey" Bulger,
the vicious head of an Irish criminal gang in Boston. Last week, we
saw the premiere of "The Road to Perdition," a 1930s Irish gangster
epic starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Later this year, another
big-budget epic, "The Gangs of New York," starring Leonardo Di
Caprio, focuses on the Irish "Five Points Gangs," which terrorized
the Big Apple during the 1850s. To paraphrase Edward G. Robinson's
Rico at the end of "Little Caesar": "Faith and begorrah! Is this the
beginning of a cycle of 'Tough Terry' films?"</LD>
<LD>   Americans of Italian descent certainly hope not. In an era when
merely being a Muslim labels you a terrorist, it certainly doesn't
improve the multicultural atmosphere when Hollywood targets a new
ethnic group to tarnish. Although the movers-and-shakers will
predictably hide behind the curtain of "art," as producer Robert
Evans did with "The Godfather," the fact is that once Hollywood
enshrines a mythology, it is very hard to dislodge it.
(Interestingly, the late author Mario Puzo, chief architect of the
Italians-as-gangsters albatross, was at least honest about it: "The
term 'godfather' was never used by Italian criminals," he said. "It's
a term that I made up, I wanted to create a romantic myth, like the
cowboy.")</LD>
<TE>   One need look no further than the Italian American community to
see the effects of being "blessed" by Hollywood. According to a 2001
research study conducted by our Institute, there have been more than
1,000 films since 1928 that feature Italian or Italian American
characters. Of those films, roughly 40% of them portray our community
as criminals, with another 29% painting us as boors, buffoons, bigots
and bimbos.</TE>
<TE>   What is most disturbing, however, is the total disconnect between
fantasy and reality. According to F.B.I. statistics, as cited in a
1999 USA Today article, Italian criminals constitute less than .0078%
of the Italian American population of 15 million (1,500 of them, down
from the 5,000 or so of 50 years ago, which is still a pittance). In
movies, of course the resident bad guy always has a vowel at the end
of his name, along with the iconographic accouterment: gold chain,
slick hair and crooked mouth.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the "killer" (pardon the pun): Out of approximately 500
movies featuring Italians as gangsters, only 12% of those films are
based on real people. The remaining 88% feature fictional Italian
stereotypes. It's enough to make Luigi Pirandello's head swim.</TE>
<TE>   "Has any group in this country, from the very beginning, had a
worse press than the Italians?" asked famed journalist Harry Golden.
"Their gangsters and bootleggers (no more and less than other groups)
have been splattered across the front pages of newspapers for
decades. The Italian American has become a stereotype of the
gangster. This is not only unfair, but untrue."</TE>
<TE>   Golden asked that question back in 1958, way before the stereotype
mushroomed in film ("The Godfather") and television ("The Sopranos").</TE>
<TE>   And he would have been appalled at how his own
profession--journalism--continues to aid and abet Hollywood
stereotyping: i.e., the recent VIP treatment given to the late,
not-so-great John Gotti, a local thug whose obituary made the front
pages of every major national newspaper in America. (In public
relations circles, this is called "good bounce.")</TE>
<TE>   If I were Irish, I'd feel some trepidation about Hollywood's
sudden interest in my "culture." Far from giving Irish Americans a
sense of pride, these gangster films (if they become
self-perpetuating) will severely limit the community's palette.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point from "The Road to Perdition": Stanley Tucci, a
gifted actor, is reduced to playing a typical Italian thug (Frank
Nitti). In a truly tolerant Hollywood, Tucci would have a starring
role in a 1930s melodrama called, "Pecora for the People," based on
the life of Ferdinand Pecora, the tenacious Sicilian American
attorney who prosecuted the robber barons and con men of Wall Street.
Given the current Enron and WorldCom scandals, what subject could be
more apropos?</TE>
<TE>   Sorry. Not right now. Hollywood is still digesting its pasta--only
now it comes with a side dish of corned beef and cabbage.</TE>

<HD>Quick, Somebody, Turn the Light Out</HD>
<DH>'Halloween: Resurrection' revives killer Michael Myers but
is thin on some key elements: good scares and humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN CRUST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not easy being a middle-aged serial killer in the movies. The
bones begin to creak, the muscles ache, and someone's always trying
to reinvent your genre. The "Friday the 13th" folks blasted poor
Jason, hockey mask and all, into outer space for "Jason X," and now,
in "Halloween: Resurrection," Michael Myers is turned loose in
cyberspace.</LD>
<LD>   The eighth entry in the franchise (although "Halloween III: Season
of the Witch" had only its title in common with the other films)
marks the return of Rick Rosenthal, who directed "Halloween II," and
was written by Larry Brand and Sean Hood. The movie starts off
chillingly enough with John Carpenter's theme music from the original
1978 "Halloween" playing over the opening credits. Unfortunately,
that's the peak of fright for the film. It's like a roller coaster
that starts you off with a nice, slow, anticipation-building climb to
the top, only to drop you off on the kiddie coaster in Toontown.</LD>
<LD>   Things immediately bog down with a 15-minute prologue, which
includes a rehash of 1998's "Halloween: H20" that provides a more
than thorough explanation for Michael's reappearance after his
supposed decapitation. Think of it as a dummies' guide to slasher
movies.</LD>
<TE>   Once Michael's return is established and he has rendezvoused with
favorite prey Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is ensconced in a
mental hospital after their last encounter, we move onto the actual
setup for "Halloween: Resurrection." Six bright-eyed, attractive
college students are recruited by entrepreneur Freddie Harris (Busta
Rhymes) for a contest in which they spend Halloween night in Myers'
childhood home. Freddie, along with his sexy assistant Nora (Tyra
Banks), has dreamt up something called "Dangertainment," which
through the use of hidden cameras and lipstick cams worn by the
contestants, cybercasts the whole thing over the Internet. The
concept allows the film to take some meek swipes at
unscripted-television shows like "Survivor" and "Big Brother," but
they're mostly lame, since that genre burst into self-parody
virtually on inception.</TE>
<TE>   It takes far too long to get them locked in the house for the
night, but once they are, the six contestants are to look for clues
as to what made Michael into such a monster. Played by Bianca
Kajlich, Luke Kirby, Daisy McCrackin, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Katee
Sackhoff and Sean Patrick Thomas, the sextet does the usual horror
movie things: open doors they shouldn't, run upstairs, enter rooms
from which there is only one escape (generally the one he is
blocking) and engage in sexual foreplay and illegal drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with a passing familiarity with the sex-and-drugs rules of
horror films won't have any trouble figuring out who will survive a
game, which makes getting voted off the island look very appealing.
As the movie's ads promise, evil does find its way home, and it's not
long before the contest is a bloodbath.</TE>
<TE>   The film also attempts to break up the gore and interject humor
into the proceedings by taking various self-referential stabs at
itself, but after a combined total of five "Scream" and "Scary Movie"
entries, this is well-trod territory. It's not the worst film in the
series--"Halloween III" will never be unseated--but there's not
nearly enough scares, or humor, to make "Halloween: Resurrection"
worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong violence, language, some sexuality and
brief drug use. Times guidelines: The camera doesn't linger on the
gore, and the nudity is fleeting.</TE>

<LD>Phil Donahue makes his comeback to daily TV tonight on MSNBC, but
it's only one of many changes at the cable news network. Another
talk-oriented addition at 4 p.m. Pacific time, preceding Donahue's
show, features Jerry Nachman, who is also MSNBC's new editor in chief
and a self-proclaimed "exhibitionist."</LD>
<LD>   Nachman says he wants to be the "Everyman guy who got a TV show"
and hopes viewers will say, "He asked the question I would ask if I
were in his job." His boss, MSNBC President Erik Sorenson, says
Nachman "looks at the world as an outsider."</LD>
<LD>   But in many ways, Nachman is the insider's insider--a former
editor of the New York Post, news director at two New York TV
stations and executive producer of ABC's "Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher." He says he won't call guests he's known for "25 or 30
years by their last names. That would be disingenuous."</LD>
<TE>   The topics on his show, he says, will probably center on "cops,
crime, courts, racial politics, the media, media criticism and
popular culture issues," promising above all to be
"counterintuitive."</TE>

<HD>With Eye on No. 5 Spot, WB and UPN Duke It Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trading statistics and swipes, executives for the WB Network and UPN
took turns over the weekend explaining how they each deserve to be
regarded as a strong fifth network against the Big Four broadcast
networks.</LD>
<LD>   In separate presentations before a group of national television
writers gathered in Pasadena, executives for the rival networks told
how respective ratings growth in key demographic groups,
profitability, hit shows and increasing credibility in the creative
community have positioned them to be judged alongside ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox.</LD>
<LD>   Both networks, backed by major entertainment companies seeking new
ways to distribute their products, launched in January 1995, with the
intent of becoming broadcast television's "fifth network."</LD>
<TE>   "We're seeking support and respect to be called a Big Five
network," said Jamie Kellner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., which operates the WB, which is partly owned by Tribune Inc.,
the parent company of the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   Added Jordan Levin, the network's entertainment president, "It's
insulting to still call us a 'weblet.' At some point, you want to be
treated with the respect others have given you." He added that
development deals with major talent and several WB series now in
syndication have made the network "a major player."</TE>
<TE>   But executives for UPN, which was taken over by Viacom-owned CBS
earlier this year, called the WB's position ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinary that they want to be included in the top 5,
when they're really No. 6," CBS President Leslie Moonves said Sunday,
adding that the WB's ratings statistics apply only to last May.</TE>
<TE>   Said Moonves: "We're the fastest-growing network in 18-34, 18-45
[age groups] and total viewers. They may beat us in [ratings among]
12-year-old girls, but judging from their new shows, that's no longer
their target."</TE>
<TE>   Moonves reiterated UPN's goal to become the entertainment
destination for 18- to 34-year-old adults. With the transition of
ownership and management underway, he called the progress of UPN "an
evolution, not a revolution."</TE>
<TE>   In other news, Levin said that while the WB still had interest in
producing unscripted shows, he preferred to place more priority on
scripted comedies and dramas. He also criticized reality shows such
as "American Idol," saying they often show "a side of human behavior
that is not admirable."</TE>
<TE>   On "American Idol," which has become a summer hit on Fox, several
aspiring singers compete for stardom and a recording contract in
front of three judges, including British record executive Simon
Cowell, who has drawn controversy for his no-holds-barred insults.</TE>

<HD>Fresh at 40, Lively Chieftains Play the Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good old Paddy Moloney. Count on him and the Chieftains to come up
with an exhilarating new Celtic entertainment, no matter how many
times one has seen the veteran Irish band.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the first of two shows at the Hollywood Bowl, the
veteran ensemble and their leader--celebrating a 40th
anniversary--combined with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (conducted by
Randall Craig Fleischer), the Los Angeles Scots Pipe Band, a troupe
of talented step dancers and guest artists Patty Griffin and Mark
Isham to offer a nonstop array of high-spirited music, movement and
color.</LD>
<LD>   What makes the Chieftains so special, however, is not solely their
ability to find new ways to entertain. It is their capacity to do so,
in every imaginable setting, without losing touch with their
traditional roots.</LD>
<TE>   An opening segment of jigs and reels--led by Moloney's piping and
the always superb flute work of Martin Fay and fiddle playing of Sean
Keane--was an immediate reminder of the deep-seated sources of the
group's creative energies.</TE>
<TE>   Another tradition-related high point was a touching pennywhistle
solo by Moloney of the old lament "Taimse mo Codhladh" (I Am Asleep,
Do Not Wake Me)--a number he performed in September at Manhattan's
ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   Ancient themes also drifted in and out of the band's performance
with the Philharmonic of excerpts from the score for the PBS
television special "Long Journey Home" intermingling the sprightly
jig "The Night Larry Was Stretched" with a tenderly lyrical rendering
of the American ballad, "Shenandoah."</TE>
<TE>   Further illustrating the versatility of the Chieftains and Celtic
music, the program included "Planxty Mozart," Moloney's whimsical
combining of segments from the Rondo of the Mozart Horn Concerto No.
2 with the Irish jig "The Piper's Chair." The evening wrapped with an
everyone-join-in finale featuring the Chieftains, the Philharmonic,
the Scots Pipe Band, dancers and singers.</TE>
<TE>   Adding the final topping to a marvelous Bowl program, the
fireworks--which were delivered to the accompaniment of the
Philharmonic's performance of Leroy Anderson's "The Girl I Left
Behind Me" (from his "Irish Suite").</TE>
<TE>   It provided an especially appealing panorama filled with subtle
combinations of fire, flame, light and sound.</TE>

<HD>'Strut!' Keeps the Jive Alive</HD>
<DH>Swinging revue of American music and dance from the '30s
and '40s is a timeless, but loud treat in Fullerton</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The durability of Fran Charnas' 1975 perennially staged musical
nostalgia-fest, "The All Night Strut!," a revue of American standards
mostly from the 1930s and '40s, attests to the cross-generational
resonance in such sentimental classics as "GI Jive," "In the Mood,"
"As Time Goes By" and "I'll Be Seeing You."</LD>
<LD>   This tribute to the swing and sway, jump and jive, sass and
romance of the past, from "Chattanooga Choo-Choo" to "Lullaby of
Broadway," is raising the rafters at the Plummer Auditorium in
Fullerton. That's not always a good thing. When singers Lance
Roberts, Victoria G. Platt, Amy Prothro and Geoffrey Washburn cut
loose too close to the old-time standing microphones, harmonies and
melodies blur in an ear-smacking assault.</LD>
<LD>   A certain formulaic emotional buildup in several numbers makes
this occur too often for comfort. Prothro is particularly prone to
overdo the decibels. A sweet-voiced soprano in more subtle stylings,
her most exuberant offerings might cut glass.</LD>
<TE>   The intermittent vocal blasts also detract from the standout
efforts of the terrific onstage veteran jazz musicians:
pianist-conductor Lloyd Cooper, Ron Barrows on trumpet, Duane
Benjamin on trombone, Bobby Haynes on bass, percussionist Richard
Martinez and woodwind player John Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   The rewards are plentiful, however, when cast, sound system and
vocal and instrumental dynamics are in accord.</TE>
<TE>   Songs are spiced up with comic and sexy interplay between the
couples, who also swing dance and boogie up a storm throughout, and
each singer has a center-stage moment--Washburn's sensitive "Comin'
In On a Wing and a Prayer" and Platt's sultry "Operator" are notable
highlights.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a veteran of many "Strut" tours, directs and is the vocal
anchor, adding necessary depth and emotion with his big, warm
baritone. His unexpectedly stirring rendition of the 1932 "Brother,
Can You Spare a Dime" is memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting designer Michael Eugene Fairman provides mood-enhancing
backgrounds of luminous color, night skies and city lights; the
pinstriped suits, short skirts and peplum blouses, WWII-era military
garb and white-and-black tie evening wear and satiny, slinky gowns
are provided by Strut'n Partners, Los Angeles CA.</TE>

<HD>Hill Continues Her Lofty Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lauryn Hill began her concert Saturday at the Grove of Anaheim
without explaining why she was 90 minutes late getting started, you
braced yourself for the worst. After her severely unfocused "MTV
Unplugged No. 2.0" live album this spring, the last thing she needed
was another public meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   In retrospect, "Unplugged" could hardly have been a worse word in
the album title. After the eccentric nature of Hill's performance on
album, "Unplugged" was too easy a target for jokes. "Unhinged" might
have been the only title more unfortunate.</LD>
<LD>   On the album, Hill devoted a quarter of the 100-plus minutes to
rambling commentaries between songs, outlining a spiritual awakening
that led her to sever ties not only with her earlier hip-hop/rap
music but also her old ways of thinking. She also became so overcome
during one number that she broke into tears.</LD>
<TE>   Turning her back on the material from "The Miseducation of Lauryn
Hill," which won five Grammys, including album of the year in 1999,
she focused on the new songs that documented her feelings about the
evils of the legal system, show business, social apathy and moral
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   She, too, left aside the ambitious musical arrangements that were
showcased on the album and her accompanying tour. On "Unplugged," she
assumed more a folk-singer role, accompanying herself on acoustic
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   While some critics called Hill's dramatic redirection as
courageous, most decried its lack of artistic discipline. The public,
too, has been cool to the two-disc set. After entering the charts at
No. 2 on May 15, it has fallen faster than the Dow--to No. 96 last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, there was an understandable sense of drama
in the room when Hill walked on stage alone Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The first good sign as she sat in a chair with her acoustic guitar
was that she went straight into the music--no repeat of the emotional
back-story that clogged up the album. Indeed, the only extended
remarks of the evening were near the end when she reaffirmed her
spiritual beliefs and thanked the audience for its support. It took
less than a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Where that self-editing was a healthy sign of renewed discipline,
Hill now needs to apply that same judgment to the music of
"Unplugged," which varies greatly in quality.</TE>
<TE>   You could feel Hill's passion for these songs in her every breath.
Joined by a percussionist on a few numbers, she sang throughout the
90-minute set with such a convincing blend of fierce declaration and
loving testimony that made every word seem essential. In truth, the
songs are sometimes vague (particularly "Mr. Intentional," which
opened Saturday's show), and even the most focused ones are
frustratingly uneven.</TE>
<TE>   There are passages in "I Find It Hard to Say," "Just Like Water"
and "I Gotta Find Peace of Mind" that revive all the promise and
craft of Hill's "Miseducation" work, but even those songs sometimes
mix inspired images and rhymes with conventional, even cliched ones.</TE>
<TE>   In even the weakest moments, however, there was indeed a sense of
courage in Hill's approach. Few artists would have the strength to
move away so boldly from an approach that had brought her such
commercial success and acclaim. Where "Unplugged" was as messy as a
car wreck creatively, Hill, who was scheduled to play the Hollywood
Bowl on Sunday, seems to be back in control behind the wheel, even if
she's still weaving a bit between lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The flaws in her new songs may be simply because she feels her
message is more important than her art. If she eventually realizes
that the only way she can effectively spread her message is through
the exercise of artistic discipline, Hill may still have quite a
future in the pop world. Before Saturday, some felt that future was
very much in doubt.</TE>

<LD>In Montana, a federal courthouse is bombed by domestic terrorists,
and an undercover producer for round-the-clock news network I-24
tapes the epic blast. When his Chicago bosses receive the dramatic
footage, they air it 11 times in 96 minutes. Eleven times!</LD>
<LD>   "Breaking News"--a smart and entertaining new weekly drama on
cable's Bravo--is that acute in capturing the rhythms of journalism
practiced by TV these days.</LD>
<LD>   Days when news channels, along with talk radio, speed the flow of
information across a 24-hour fast track, often sending it and
themselves careening wildly out of control. Days when pouring it on
again and again is industry mantra.</LD>
<TE>   Think Incident in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Think handcuffed Donovan Jackson getting roughed up by Officer
Jeremy Morse. Think footage of that on networks and local stations,
aired impulsively every time this story is mentioned. Which is
plenty, with much more coming now that demagogues, in and out of
media, have the story in their teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Think glut, pictures shown so often that rather than inflame the
public--a likely initial impact--desensitization and apathy may
eventually set in.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing it 11 times a day should about do it. Oh, Inglewood again.</TE>
<TE>   This coverage does not surface in a vacuum. TV blasted America
repeatedly with pictures of LAPD officers savagely beating Rodney
King. Oh, him again. And pelted America ad nauseam with home movies
of rouged-up cowgirl JonBenet Ramsey. Oh, her again. On and on it has
gone.</TE>
<TE>   So you're thinking: Oh, a series about TV news again. What's the
point? They never come close to getting it right.</TE>
<TE>   This one does, while offering, as a stunning bonus, high drama,
adventure, humor and quality acting in stories about a fictional
24-hour news network that apes many of the strengths and foibles of
its real-life counterparts as it faces one ethical crossroads after
another.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producers Gardner Stern and Ken Olin (now also a
co-executive producer of ABC's "Alias") are keen observers. Take
Wednesday's outstanding premiere (directed by Olin), when I-24 lucks
into blockbuster exclusive coverage of the nation's vice president
getting trapped in a Colorado avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   I-24 staffers converge on the story. From an airport, where he and
his family are about to depart for a Hawaii vacation, rushes
executive news director Richard Sloan (Olin). From a bed, where they
are having hot sex, speed reporter Jamie Templeton (Rowena King) and
field producer Julian Kerbis (Paul Adelstein). From his kitchen,
after feeding his son breakfast, comes reporter Mel Thomas (Jeffrey
D. Sams).</TE>
<TE>   Inside the studio, I-24's human pistons are pumping adrenaline.
"It's our Gulf War," says seasoned, sober lead anchor Bill Dunne (Tim
Matheson, seen as the vice president on "The West Wing"). Dunne is so
old-school that he quotes Edward R. Murrow and wears three-pointed
white handkerchiefs with his dark suits. But he's a pro who
understands ratings and remembers CNN's prominence during the Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   When the avalanche story turns carnal and tawdry, and a woman
offers I-24 a steamy video, thoughtful news president Peter Kozyck
(Clancy Brown) wants to hold back for the moment. "If we don't go
with it," argues hyper senior executive producer Rachel Glass (Lisa
Ann Walter), "she'll be at NBC in 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Or 10. "Breaking News" can't be faulted for being a millimeter off
here and there. It was filmed a couple of years ago for TNT, which
curiously turned thumbs down without airing any of these 13 episodes.
Talk about a weird programming decision. I watched them all in two
days, and still couldn't get enough.</TE>
<TE>   It helps to suspend a bit of disbelief. Although I-24 competes
with the biggies, its corporate shape is unclear and staff small
enough (although somehow always present when big stories break) to
fit into a single news van. Just as NBC's "Law &amp; Order" makes its
quartet of detectives and prosecutors a metaphor for a department,
the I-24 journalists we meet are much less a CNN or Fox News Channel
army than a platoon.</TE>
<TE>   They also include reporter/co-anchor Janet LeClaire (Myndy Crist),
producer Quentin Druzinski (Vincent Gale) and field producer Ethan
Barnes (Scott Bairstow), son of I-24 CEO Jack Barnes (James Handy).
The tornado that blows in midway through the series is Dunne's
bipolar wife, Alison (Patricia Wettig), a former ABC News hotshot
hired to host an interview show.</TE>
<TE>   From uplinks to downlinks, "Breaking News" talks the lingo glibly
and seamlessly. If it gets a few details wrong, it frames the big
picture just about perfectly, becoming TV's first entertainment
series to examine the process of news gathering and tiptoe with
journalists through the perilous minefields of corporate synergy.</TE>
<TE>   After getting orders from Barnes, for example, Kozyck reluctantly
assigns a story on "Touch and Tell," a sexy "reality" series aired by
the parent company's station group. At another point, Barnes tries to
kill an expose of a sweatshop owned by the parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Drama here evolves largely from news stories. They range from a
submarine catastrophe to Dunne interviewing a Muslim terrorist in
Paris. Some of them raise ethical questions that confront, and
confound, journalists today.</TE>
<TE>   There are also staff tensions: Templeton and LeClaire are bitter
rivals. Glass guards her turf ferociously, bristling when Kozyck
intrudes.</TE>
<TE>   And even though his ratings as a solo "are in the toilet," as
Barnes puts it, Dunne resents sharing an anchor desk with the
relatively green LeClaire. He reminds Kozyck that he was "No. 2 at
CBS, heir apparent" before joining I-24.</TE>
<TE>   This is no Camelot for LeClaire either. When focus groups fault
her performance, a news consultant suggests having her "walk around
the newsroom like they do at MSNBC." Glass wonders what happens
should the "wandering minstrel" routine fail. "Dump her," the
consultant replies.</TE>
<TE>   Only one figure here approaches caricature. But if you think
short-lived consumer reporter Lloyd Fuchs (played hilariously by John
Ritter) really is too far over the top for credibility, you haven't
been watching all-news channels or some local stations lately.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, these are measured characters who defy TV news

<LD>In Warner Bros.' campy horror thriller "Eight Legged Freaks," opening
Friday, a chemical spill causes hundreds of little spiders to mutate
to the size of SUVs and wreak havoc on residents of a rural mining
town.</LD>
<LD>   New Zealand-born director Ellory Elkayem said the film was
inspired by the classic giant-insect features of the 1950s like
"Tarantula" and "Earth vs. the Spider."</LD>
<LD>   "I think we all sort of realized that if you are going to bring
back this genre, it's not going to work if we try and play it too
straight," Elkayem said. "You see old movies like 'Tarantula' and see
a giant spider walking down a freeway and you can't help but chuckle
to yourself. I think we take it a little further and say, 'Let's have
a whole lot of species of spider, not just one. Do a 'Jurassic Park'
of spiders."</LD>
<TE>   The arachnid film stars David Arquette, Kari Wuhrer, Scott Terra,
Doug E. Doug and Scarlett Johansson, but the real stars are the
computer-generated spiders that include orb weavers who wrap their
prey in cocoons, jumping spiders that can leap 50 times their body
length and trap-door spiders that come up out of the ground and
snatch their prey.</TE>
<TE>   How "Eight Legged Freaks" got its title is a story in itself.</TE>
<TE>   The film was initially going to be called "Arach Attack," Elkayem
said, "but the studio wasn't really comfortable with 'Arach Attack'
because it sounded a little like 'Iraq Attack,' so we had to change
it."</TE>
<TE>   Then, someone recalled a scene where Arquette, holding a shotgun
in one hand and a cell phone in the other, is scrambling up a radio
tower as the spiders are climbing after him. He looks down and yells,
"Get back you eight-legged freaks!"</TE>
<TE>   The line was ad-libbed by Arquette, the director said. A line that
wasn't in the script ended up as the title of the movie.</TE>

<HD>Competition May Greet 'Busted Stuff'</HD>

<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the pop music industry, it's beginning to look a lot like
Christmas in July. On the heels of recent powerhouse releases from
Eminem and Nelly, this week will see another hotly anticipated album:
the Dave Matthews Band's "Busted Stuff."</LD>
<LD>   The album hits stores Tuesday, and retailers are estimating it
will sell at least half a million copies during its first week. That
would be shy of the 733,000 first-week sales of the group's previous
album, "Everyday," but no one's saying they'll be disappointed if
"Busted Stuff" doesn't equal that mark.</LD>
<LD>   "I can confidently say we have no expectations it will exceed what
'Everyday' did," says Bruce Flohr, RCA vice president of artists,
repertoire and artist development, who signed the band in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Two reasons, says Flohr: "Everyday" came out in March last year,
the first major release following the traditionally slow post-holiday
sales season. "Busted Stuff" arrives in midsummer as one of many
big-name releases and thus faces much stronger competition. There's
also a less intense promotional blitz accompanying "Busted Stuff"
because "the band has intentionally focused more on the music and the
quality of this record, as opposed to all the TV, videos and radio
support" it did for "Everyday," Flohr says.</TE>
<TE>   Flohr says heavy security around the new album, which includes two
new songs and nine rerecorded from the band's never-released but
widely bootlegged "Lillywhite Sessions," has kept it out of the hands
of the downloaders, unlike some other major releases.</TE>
<TE>   To spur sales, RCA is including a bonus disc with "Busted Stuff"
with the first 2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   "That formula worked very well on the Eminem album," says
Wherehouse rock buyer Bob Bell, "and we expect very strong sales out
of the box on this."</TE>

<LD>Top players from the worlds of Hollywood and politics will say
goodbye today to Lew R. Wasserman, who transformed Universal Studios
into an international conglomerate, at a memorial service
distinguished by two things the late mogul valued highly in life:
power and secrecy.</LD>
<LD>   Although about 3,000 to 4,000 people are expected to attend the
gathering at Universal Amphitheatre this afternoon, including some of
the biggest names in entertainment, the event is taking place under a
news blackout, with no working reporters or cameras allowed. The
studio will be closed at 2 p.m. so employees can attend.</LD>
<LD>   Scheduled to speak are former President Bill Clinton; Vivendi
Universal Entertainment Chairman and Chief Executive Barry Diller;
former MCA President Sidney Sheinberg, who ran the company with
Wasserman; Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of
America; DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg; and actress
Suzanne Pleshette, a longtime family friend.</LD>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg is scheduled to present a short film he made that
features an interview with the notoriously private Wasserman. The
film previously was shown at a company retreat about a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice President Al Gore also is expected to attend, as is
former First Lady Nancy Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's widow, Edie, helped plan the memorial during the six
weeks since her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing touches, including whether Reagan would address the
gathering, still were being worked out Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Wasserman wanted a very low-key memorial, but now you can't
even get a ticket to the event," said one close friend of the family.</TE>
<TE>   Guests will have to pass a security check before entering the
amphitheater for the memorial service, which is expected to run about
two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman, a onetime theater usher and talent agent who became the
most powerful mogul in post-World War II Hollywood, died June 3 at
his Beverly Hills home at the age of 89.</TE>

<LD>For 250 years, Spanish galleons (called El Nao de China), sailed
between Asia and Spain laden with riches and evangelizing priests. In
a program that seemed nearly as long, two local dance troupes, Danza
Floricanto/USA and Kayamanan Ng Lahi Philippine Folk Arts ensemble,
premiered their joint effort, "From Acapulco to Manila: An Untold
Pacific Rim Story" at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Ambitious but ill-conceived, the story exploring the link between
Mexican and Filipino cultures probably remained untold for a reason:
With a triple narrative (English, Spanish and Tagalog), sometimes
drowning out the music, about 40 dance numbers in three acts dragged
on as if the companies were in competition instead of collaboration.
The project, dreamed up by Floricanto's Gema Sandoval and Kayamanan's
Joel Jacinto (aided by co-directors Barbara Ele and Avecita Jacinto),
never meshed. Indeed, moving back and forth between groups, a
schizophrenic quality pervaded the night, as Kayamanan outshone
Floricanto at nearly every turn--with more extravagant costumes, more
varied choreography and an overall precision that made Sandoval's
noble efforts pale by comparison.</LD>
<TE>   Which isn't to say the evening was a total wash for Floricanto:
Their Aztec take, accompanied by Christie Rios' solo drumming, teemed
with energy, as did "La Iguana," where florid footwork led to
uninhibited break dancing. The groups joined forces--albeit
briefly--in "Lapay Bantigue," with lovely fluttering arms miming
seagulls. Birds also inspired "Torayan" as Kayamanan members
gracefully leaped and hopped on one foot.</TE>
<TE>   The third act's "The Spanish Legacy" found the troupes doing their
own versions of quadrilles, polkas, waltzes and mazurkas in ball
gowns and tuxedos. "Jota Paragua," a kind of Filipino flamenco, wowed
with five Kayamanan men spinning and stomping. The finale, "La
Paloma," featured both groups joining hands and singing this
traditional favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Kayamanan's live accompaniment--a rondalla string ensemble and
kulintang percussion group--also boosted their performances, infusing
them with an energy that Floricanto's taped music could not match.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, though, Floricanto did make sporadic use of the
rondalla, adding a trio of robust singers for good measure.</TE>

<HD>'MIB II' Almost Outgunned by Tom Hanks</HD>
<DH>Sequel gasps to stay on top as 'Road to Perdition' and
'Reign of Fire' gather crowds old and young</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although it remained the No. 1 movie, "Men in Black II" got knocked
down a peg in its second weekend as a quartet of new films sapped
business from the powerhouse sequel, led by Tom Hanks in the period
drama "Road to Perdition" and the dragon-slayer film "Reign of Fire"
with Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, "MIB II" dropped by slightly more than half,
following the pattern of concept-driven event movies (especially
sequels) that open huge and take steep second weekend declines. The
Will Smith/Tommy Lee Jones follow-up to the blockbuster 1997 original
lost 52% of its clientele, falling to a still-good estimate of $25
million in 3,611 theaters on more than 6,000 screens. The two-week
total is now $133 million, with tickets selling at about the same
clip as the original.</LD>
<LD>   At $12,305 per theater, "Road to Perdition" was far and away the
best performer in the top 10 with an expected $22.1 million in only
1,797 theaters. The gangland opus divided critics, but thanks to
Hanks, whose star drawing power continues unabated, DreamWorks' risk
in introducing downbeat (albeit dripping with prestige) material
during the summer, paid off handsomely. On a per-theater basis,
"Perdition" was pretty close to the first weekend of "Saving Private
Ryan," which starred Hanks and opened in July 1998, said company
distribution chief Jim Tharp.</LD>
<TE>   The first weekend audience for "Perdition" was composed mainly of
adults, and exit polls showed "substantially above average"
satisfaction, said Tharp, which should provide the film a base on
which to build over the coming weeks as DreamWorks expands the number
of theaters by about 200 a week and works toward recouping "Road's"
reported $80-million-plus budget. But can anyone remember the last
Tom Hanks movie that grossed less than $100 million?</TE>
<TE>   (Discounting 1996's "That Thing You Do," which Hanks directed and
in which he had a supporting role, it was his 1993 Oscar-winning
"Philadelphia," which took in about $77 million domestically).</TE>
<TE>   Young males were seduced by fire-breathing dragons in "Reign of
Fire," which was largely review-proof in its first weekend in 2,629
theaters, consuming an estimated $16 million to end up in third
place. Like fourth-place finisher "Halloween: Resurrection," which
got off to a decent start of $12.3 million in 1,954 theaters, the
second weekend will be the true indicator of longevity since monster
and horror movies draw a disproportionate number of youngsters, which
gets the films off to a flying start but can also lead to accelerated
attrition, as their fickle audience moves on to newer movies.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend's fourth general release, "The Crocodile Hunter:
Collision Course," didn't quite make it into the top five, with an
estimated $10 million in 2,525 theaters, but given the subject matter
and relatively low cost, performed well enough to help stem the tide
of red ink flowing out of MGM, the studio that produced the film.</TE>
<TE>   The new blood was vital to the past weekend's estimated $130
million total for the top 12 movies. According to Exhibitor
Relations, this year's leaders ran almost 20% ahead of last year and
almost even with last weekend's generous haul. The year to date is
approaching $5 billion, and Friday brings the Harrison Ford submarine
drama "K-19" and the family film "Stuart Little 2," as well as the
tongue-in-cheek giant spider thriller "Eight Legged Freaks."</TE>
<TE>   Holding in fifth place is Adam Sandler as "Mr. Deeds," which added
approximately $11 million in its third weekend in 3,239 theaters.
With $94 million in the till, "Deeds" should reach $100 million right
behind 10th place "The Bourne Identity." The Matt Damon suspense film
grossed about $5.8 million in weekend No. 5 in 2,199 theaters and is
at $99 million.</TE>
<TE>   Given all the bumps in the road "Bourne" hit--release date
postponements, re-shoots--the fact that it will surpass $100 million
makes it one of the more unexpected hits of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The two major kiddie movies in the top 10, "Lilo &amp; Stitch," and
"Like Mike," held up well after the holiday weekend, ending up neck
and neck at about $7.6 million apiece. The former has now grossed
$118 million, while "Mike" has taken in almost $33 million after only
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In ninth place, "Minority Report" was somewhat affected by new
arrivals, declining by about 41% to $7.4 million in 2,419 theaters
and $110 million in four weeks. Although it's a certified hit for
Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, "Minority" doesn't appear likely to
achieve blockbuster status (considering its $100 million plus price
tag), although overseas business likely will exceed the U.S. take.</TE>
<TE>   Still hovering in the top 12 on only 501 screens, the honeymoon is
far from over for the specialized release "My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"
which after 13 weeks in release grossed an additional $2.2 million
(off by a minuscule 10%) and is now at $27 million.</TE>

still enough for it to nab No. 1.</CP>

<LD>Good intentions don't always lead to good results. That's the message
behind a recent decision by the Los Angeles Unified School District
to build a $12.9-million elementary school between Vermont and New
Hampshire avenues at First Street, at the northern edge of Koreatown.</LD>
<LD>   Belmont Elementary School No. 6, is part of the first phase of a
plan to build 80 schools over the next four years in an effort to
ease overcrowding in the district. Ultimately, Los Angeles Unified
anticipates a need for 112,000 new seats over the next decade. The
school will accommodate 1,200 year-round students in grades K-5, many
of whom are currently being bused to schools as far away as the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by the Chicago-based Perkins &amp; Will, the school aspires
to be a building of some civic stature. Its clean lines and elegant
proportions raise it above the often mundane standards of current
school design.</LD>
<TE>   But the plan has a glaring deficiency: its site. In order to build
it, the school district plans to demolish a significant architectural
landmark, the 1936 KEHE Radio building, designed by Stiles O.
Clements. That decision, which was approved by the school board in
February and is under review by the school district, underscores the
difficulty faced by a district that has struggled to make
conscientious design a part of its mandate. What it reveals is a
planning process that may not be capable of producing the kind of
creative solutions that are so critical to a city's cultural health.</TE>
<TE>   As architecture, the importance of the KEHE Radio building is hard
to dispute. In the 1920s, while a partner at Morgan, Walls &amp;
Clements, Clements designed some of the city's most celebrated
landmarks, including the 1926 El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, and
the 1931 Pellissier Building, which houses the Wiltern Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Car Culture Sentiments</TE>
<TE>   Clements succeeded in inventing an architectural language that was
deeply attuned to Los Angeles' emerging car culture. By the time he
set out on his own, in the early 1930s, he was beginning to strip his
designs of unnecessary ornament, creating a cool, streamlined
aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   The KEHE building is an example of such work. Long and low, the
building's blank concrete facade is pierced by a series of inset
windows. A two-story tower marks the building's entrance, its soaring
lines acting as a counterpoint to the building's horizontal thrust.
The idea was to reflect the unbroken vistas of L.A.'s boulevards
while catching the eye of passing motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Clements went on to complete a number of similarly evocative
designs, but few survive. The 1938 Coulter Dry Goods Co. building, a
massive concrete structure anchored by a glass block entry tower on
Wilshire Boulevard, was demolished in the 1970s. A 1941 studio-office
building for dance instructor Arthur Murray, with a billboard-like
tower that became a Wilshire Boulevard landmark, was torn down a few
years later.</TE>
<TE>   According to L.A. Unified officials, the decision to demolish the
KEHE building was due to a variety of constraints at the site. The
district initially planned to demolish the entire city block to make
room for the school. But after discussions with community advocates,
it agreed to preserve several existing apartment buildings on the
block's northwest corner in order to minimize the number of local
tenants that had to be displaced. As a result, the size of the lot
was reduced from an original 3.9 acres to 3.1.</TE>
<TE>   The new school is essentially designed in the shape of a U that
opens toward the north, framing a large internal courtyard. A low,
L-shaped classroom building will extend the length of First Street
and part of New Hampshire, and a library and multi-purpose room will
face Vermont. The KEHE building, which extends north from the site of
the multi-purpose room, will be demolished to make room for a playing
field and basketball courts.</TE>
<TE>   In purely architectural terms, the design is competent, if
somewhat dull. By breaking the school down into discrete structures,
the architects have given the complex a human scale. Clad in stucco
and corrugated metal, these structures frame a number of
interconnected, outdoor rooms. A kindergarten playground extends
along one side of the main courtyard, set slightly below grade to
give it a more intimate feel. A smaller, contemplative garden
separates the library from the classroom building.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with opposition from preservationists, meanwhile, school
district officials have been working on a compromise plan that would
preserve a portion of the KEHE building's facade without altering the
school's basic design. In this version, the facade, supported on a
heavy steel frame, would act as a barrier between the basketball
courts and Vermont, shielding them from street noise.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion of saving only a segment of the KEHE building's
facade represents a perverse attitude toward preservation. It treats
architecture as a superficial endeavor, and would transform an
important monument--one that could again function as a part of the
city's living fabric--into an empty memory of the past. One could
make a convincing argument, in fact, that saving part of the facade
does more harm than good, in that it reinforces the cynical position
that architecture does nothing more than provide pretty packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatives Overlooked</TE>
<TE>   The real problem is that other alternatives were never fully
explored. The decision to demolish the KEHE building was made by L.A.
Unified planners before Perkins &amp; Will was hired, which means that
little effort was given to developing the kind of creative solution
that could have saved the building without sacrificing the needs of
students.</TE>
<TE>   Such a solution is not as improbable as school officials might
think. A 1999 design for the International Elementary School in Long
Beach, for example, faced similar constraints. The school
accommodates 774 students on a 2.4-acre site. By comparison, Belmont
No. 6 will house about 915 students on 3.1 acres.</TE>
<TE>   But the Long Beach facility, designed by the Santa Monica-based
Morphosis, is a more radical departure from the conventional urban
school. A large courtyard is carved out of the building's core. From
there, a grand stair leads up to a stunning rooftop playground.
Protected by enormous, canted steel screens, the playground offers
sweeping views of the surrounding cityscape.</TE>
<TE>   To attain that level of invention, the school district would have
to go back to the drawing board. That would cost significant money
and time, and given the politics of school construction and the dire
need for more classrooms, it is probably beyond the realm of
possibility. But at the very least, L.A. Unified should learn a
valuable lesson from what was ultimately a muddled process.</TE>
<TE>   The agency should have begun by acknowledging that Clements'
landmark was an irreplaceable part of the city's legacy. It could
then have commissioned a range of architectural talents to come up
with competing proposals for the development of the entire block,
plans that took into account a complex mix of school, housing and
preservation issues. It might have come up with a solution that
reflected a deeper respect for the past while offering a more
valuable model for the future.</TE>

<HD>Rollicking 'Love, Janis' Does More Than Push Those Boomer

<LD>SAN DIEGO--Early in "Love, Janis," now at San Diego Repertory
Theatre, Janis Joplin explains why she decided to flee her hometown
of Port Arthur, Texas: "I knew I wanted more than bowling alleys and
drive-ins."</LD>
<LD>   What she found in the San Francisco of the 1960s was a youthful
world being transformed by a musical and cultural revolution, a world
that gave her rebellious, artistic, insecure, to-hell-with-you,
Southern Comfort-fueled personality room to breathe and to chase the
acceptance she craved.</LD>
<LD>   And before her death at age 27 in 1970 of a heroin/morphine
overdose, the plain-faced girl with the stringy hair and hard-driving
voice had become, as she tells us, "a Hells Angels pinup" and "the
Barbra Streisand of the hippies."</LD>
<TE>   "Love, Janis," takes us along for the whole bumpy, exhilarating
ride from naive hick to tormented superstar. And what a ride it was!</TE>
<TE>   Joplin's mannerisms and her mix of sweetness and vulgarity were
captured to near perfection at Friday's performance by Kacee
Clanton-Iniquez as the singing Janis and Aimee McCormick as the
talking Janis.</TE>
<TE>   Assembled largely from Joplin's letters to her family and from her
numerous interviews--Joplin's sister Laura was co-creator along with
playwright-director Randal Myler--"Love, Janis" is part tribute, part
cautionary tale, part show-business profile.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the music sustained her when happiness off the stage
proved impossible. "If it hadn't been for the music, I probably would
have done myself in," she tells an unseen interviewer, adding with
her own sarcastic laugh, "How's that for deep?"</TE>
<TE>   For Joplin fans, "Love, Janis" is a must, a rockin' good time
despite the bummer ending. For '60s nostalgics, it's a good bet.
Whether the under-35 set can be engaged is another matter. The period
costumes might be seen as clownish and off-putting. And the urgency
and tumult of the era may fail to register against the gangsta-rap
music and scandal-du-jour celebrity culture of today. A pity but
true.</TE>
<TE>   Clanton-Iniquez and Andra Mitrovich play the singing Janis
(belting out 19 songs) on alternative nights. The program says that
the demands of the role make it too difficult for one performer.</TE>
<TE>   If playing Janis two hours a night is that taxing, imagine what
the strain of being Janis 24 hours a day must have been like. That's
what "Love, Janis" is all about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Love, Janis" plays at San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Stage
at Horton Plaza through Aug. 18. Tuesday 7 p.m., Wednesday-Saturday 8
p.m., Sunday 2 p.m., 7 p.m. Tickets: $31-$45. Box office: (619)

<LD>I have a confession: I am male and have been inveterately so since
conception more than 34 years ago. So when it comes to Lifetime,
whose slogan is "Television for Women," I might not be the ideal
gender to judge its original movie, "Crossing the Line," premiering
tonight at 9.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the two-hour film is about sports. It's about competition,
overzealous parents and violence. These are all things I understand.
It also has a worthy message: Fathers and mothers should let their
kids enjoy the spirit of play rather than pressuring them to win at
all costs.</LD>
<LD>   So why must the film distract from this by making every man a
raging lunatic? Perhaps it's because that is what we've come to
expect from Lifetime: Men behaving badly. Woman, thy name is
rationality.</LD>
<TE>   The voice of reason tonight is Laura Mosbach, who arrives in the
small town of Hankston, Mich., to serve as assistant coach on the
high school's Lady Warriors basketball team. Laura (Terry Farrell) is
trying to make a fresh start as a divorced mom with a 10-year-old
son, after a playing career cut short by injury.</TE>
<TE>   It's not long before she runs into Eric (Adrian Pasdar), a
divorced dad whose daughter is a promising hoopster. Eric is such a
hunk that Laura can, at least in part, overlook his
testosterone-laden pushing of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   No such luck for the far older and less attractive Coach Holliday
(Lawrence Dane). She butts heads with this Bob Knight-marish guy,
until he conveniently has a slo-mo heart attack, thrusting her as
interim head coach into a viper pit of bloodthirsty parents. The
worst of them are fathers, save for one mother, and you get the sense
she's involved mainly because of her highlight-reel-assembling
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Is this fair? It wasn't long ago that the "hockey dad" trial made
news but as a rink rat myself, I would argue that there are as many
"figure-skating moms" as there are "hockey dads."</TE>
<TE>   "Crossing the Line" is an entertaining but average cautionary tale
that deserves a foul for creating gender stereotypes where there
needn't have been.</TE>

<HD>Making 'Corsaire' Their Own</HD>
<DH>Revolving ABT principals put a personal, often flamboyant,
stamp on the ballet's roles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the 1830s to this past weekend at the Music Center, changing "Le
Corsaire" has been a cottage industry in the ballet world.</LD>
<LD>   Choreographer Marius Petipa inherited one version and did three
major revisions of his own in the 19th century while nearly every new
American Ballet Theatre principal at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on
Friday and Saturday followed his example--not only interpreting the
ballet differently, but adding favorite steps as well. Sometimes
interacting with previously reviewed artists, they helped make the
ballet something like a personal, shrink-to-fit vehicle, enriching a
feeble production with their diverse skills and personalities.</LD>
<LD>   The ABT ballerinas mostly ventured bravura embellishments:
startling "broken-legged" fouette versus dizzying single/double
combinations, for instance. The danseurs, however, went much further.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday night, Ethan Stiefel became the only Ali of the
engagement to attempt the rarely seen--and risky--hopping pirouettes
that used to belong exclusively to Mikhail Baryshnikov. His coiled
intensity here formed a spectacular contrast to his devil-may-care,
comically anti-Romantic performance on Friday in the role of Conrad,
and the edge of wildness he brought to that character's virtuoso
passages.</TE>
<TE>   Stiefel's double play may have been the big news of the ABT
weekend, but for blazing sensuality, no Ali outclassed Jose Manuel
Carreno in a Friday performance crowned by sumptuous multiple turns.
The Friday "Corsaire" also boasted Herman Cornejo as Birbanto,
inclined to bend in half during air turns (as if to touch his toes in
flight) and no slouch with a cap pistol either.</TE>
<TE>   Although he could not compete with the other Conrads in sheer
virtuosity, Maxim Belotserkovsky brought princely classical line and
high Romantic fervor to the role on Saturday afternoon: the most
heroic approach to this Byronic pirate during the whole engagement.</TE>
<TE>   The three Lankendems sold steps as aggressively as slaves. In his
debut as the venal bazaar owner, Marcelo Gomes (Saturday night)
danced the assigned choreography successfully, adding nothing of his
own. Gennadi Saveliev (Friday), however, pushed himself too far,
adding a brilliant series of flips but also looking off center in a
turning sequence--and even falling. Sean Stewart (Saturday afternoon)
also added flips but avoided accidents and never looked out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   As Medora, the reliably forceful and spirited Paloma Herrera left
no step unpolished on Friday, and, for once, being a rather tough
cookie for a ballerina helped explain how her character survived so
many calamities unscathed. A more conventionally dewy and vulnerable
interpretation arrived on Saturday with the long-limbed Michele
Wiles: a Medora especially radiant in the last-act "Jardin Anime"
sequence in which Herrera had seemed strangely saccharine.</TE>
<TE>   "Corsaire" trivia collectors should note that Herrera and Wiles
looked considerably barer as Medora than Nina Ananiashvili (Saturday
night), who originated the role in the ABT staging and reportedly
wears her own costumes through much of the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, Xiomara Reyes efficiently swept through the role
of Gulnare, doing nothing wrong but making no real effect for all her
expertise. However, Maria Riccetto had enough flair on Saturday
afternoon to highlight her speed, lightness and elegant line in her
major showpiece opportunities and even in such minor moments as the
mini-duet with the eunuch at the beginning of Act 3.</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Brown and Carlos Molina alternated in the character role of
the Pasha--Brown seeming more grotesquely lecherous, Molina more
comically befuddled. Ormsby Wilkins and David LaMarche shared the
weekend conducting duties.</TE>

<HD>Cultural Fine-Tuning of 'Pacific Overtures'</HD>
<DH>Amon Miyamoto brings pared-down staging and heightened
sophistication to the Sondheim musical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Contrived by a master of the double negative, Stephen
Sondheim's saucy satires of what we aren't often end up celebrating
what we are. So, there's a certain Sondheimian logic that "Pacific
Overtures," his 1976 show about the Westernization of Japan from
Commodore Perry's invasion in 1853 to the present, became Sondheim's
brazen, backhanded celebration of the American bicentennial. If the
ugly American begets even uglier Japanese, then maybe we don't look
so bad after all.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the convoluted cultural layers of "Pacific Overtures"
bewildered Broadway the first time out, with Harold Prince's
mock-Kabuki production, an all-Asian cast (including the American
roles), men impersonating women (as in traditional Japanese theater)
and the allusions in the score to classical Japanese court music. But
all of that is surface, artifice.</LD>
<LD>   The harsh, unsupported wooden flute sound of the shakuhachi
immediately gives way to pungent, honeyed harmonies and wickedly
clever wordplay--a sweet and sour mix more American sucker punch than
aromatic Asian blend. Sondheim's snappy timing, even when conveying
an exchange of haiku poems, has a kind of New York street rhythm.</LD>
<TE>   Or at least it did. The Lincoln Center Festival, which this year
is heavily weighted toward Asian and Middle Eastern work, imported a
Japanese "Pacific Overtures" for five performances that ended
Saturday. Two years ago, a popular Tokyo choreographer and stage
director, Amon Miyamoto, created this production not only with John
Weidman's book and Sondheim's lyrics translated into Japanese, but
giving the show an outright Japanese sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   In a program note, Miyamoto explains that it was more the gaudy
Prince production than "Pacific Overtures" itself that proved
problematic to the Japanese people. His solution was to strip the
work to bare bones, turning to the cultivated, ancient tradition of
Noh theater. There is a simple, graceful wood set, framed by wooden
beams (on which English translations are projected). A long runway
that extends from the stage deep into the orchestra seats of Avery
Fisher Hall is used for the American invaders. An ensemble of seven
aggressively amplified musicians sits atop the set.</TE>
<TE>   Perverse as ever, Sondheim has said he loves this production,
calling it a combination of Peter Brook and Jerome Robbins.
Miyamoto's concept is often theatrically brilliant, his cast highly
accomplished and the production far more sophisticated than the
coarse special effects typical of today's Broadway musical.</TE>
<TE>   But in making "Pacific Overtures" palatable for the Japanese,
Miyamoto makes it newly disconcerting for the American.</TE>
<TE>   Little seems to be what it is. Words no longer fit the music.
Characters sing of unsullied nature in secluded, pre-Perry Japan, but
Sondheim's score is given the glitzy arrangements heavy on winds,
electronic keyboard and percussion that make it sound like
all-purpose international pop. That effect is further enhanced by
amplification that often makes it difficult to tell who is singing.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Commodore Perry's party are portrayed as Edo-period
demons, in scary masks with huge noses. Yet the transforming
Westernization that Perry brought ultimately takes on an outright
celebratory air. The ending number, "Next," showing a Japan of
unstoppable progress, is a masterpiece of fluid choreography
(Miyamoto's Robbins moment), the dance accumulating energy as it
progresses from historic times through Hiroshima to the modern
(Miyamoto updates the drama with references to Pokemon and Sept. 11).
As a spectacular introduction to that finale, Takeharu Kunimoto, the
reciter, does a show-stopping routine in which he transforms a
traditional three-stringed shamisen into a banjo.</TE>
<TE>   Miyamoto creates many more moments of theatrical astonishment.
Each member of the cast has several roles and moves with willowy
grace, again a striking contrast to superficial Broadway's
steroid-injected high-energy. The slapstick, for which Miyamoto has a
weakness, reveals a cultivated polish.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, such stylized theater is not particularly effective at
realizing Sondheim's gift for specificity, to say nothing for his
rapid-fire double-entendres. The hilarious sendup of national musical
styles in "Please Hello," where the Americans are followed by the
Dutch, Russians and French in forcing access to Japan, falls flat.
Nor does Miyamoto seem altogether bemused by the more cutting
caricatures of the Japanese. Geishas frolic nervously ( "Welcome to
Kanagawa"); the poisoning of the ineffectual shogun (by his mother,
no less), lacks wit ("Chrysanthemum Tea").</TE>
<TE>   But Miyamoto's real revenge is simply the high quality of his
work.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than bemoaning Japan's becoming more materialistic than the
American example, he lionizes the Japanese ability to better us at
our own game. As Western tourists quickly find out, the Japanese
versions of American operations are always better.</TE>
<TE>   Order a Starbucks' cappuccino in Tokyo and it won't be that milky,
burnt beverage you invariably get in New York (and often elsewhere);
instead, it is as attentively, as perfectly made as tea for a tea
ceremony. Likewise, Japan's "Pacific Overtures" is so attentive that
you cannot help but be impressed, whatever it is trying to say.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood YMCA Responds to Protests</HD>
<DH>Facility will reopen its steam and sauna rooms for a 90-day
trial period and with more staff.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After heated protests from members over a decision in late May to
close saunas and steam rooms at Los Angeles-area YMCAs, the Hollywood
Wilshire YMCA said it will reopen its facilities this week.</LD>
<LD>   The decision does not affect the seven other YMCAs that closed
their saunas and steam rooms in May, on orders from the YMCA of
Metropolitan Los Angeles. The organization, which runs Los
Angeles-area Ys, had cited health and safety concerns in the wake of
a recent fire that caused an estimated $1 million in damage at the
Westchester YMCA.</LD>
<LD>   Since the closures, hundreds of members have expressed their
outrage in petitions, phone calls and letters that have been publicly
posted at some Ys. YMCA officials have said that at least 100 people
have canceled their memberships. Recently, a few dozen members of the
Hollywood YMCA staged a protest outside the facility.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 35-member board that manages the Hollywood YMCA
voted unanimously to reopen its saunas and steam rooms, said the
branch's executive director, Mark Dengler. Dengler then called
Metropolitan YMCA President Larry Rosen to say he was supporting his
board's decision. Rosen agreed, but asked that several conditions be
met, Dengler said.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Friday, the facilities will open for a 90-day trial
period. Members who use the rooms will be limited to 10 minutes in
the heat; required to take five-minute breaks between using the rooms
and exercise; and urged to drink water before going in. Dengler said
he will hire four employees to monitor the facilities when they are
open. "They will go in and check the rooms at least every 15
minutes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at other YMCA branches will be watching the Hollywood Y
to see what happens, Dengler said. "We're going to be under a
microscope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In three years, the Hollywood Y has had just two health-related
incidents in the heated rooms: both elderly men, who felt woozy after
the heat and quickly recovered, according to Dengler.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Keitha Scott, chairwoman of the Hollywood Y's board of
managers, was one of those who challenged Rosen's contention in May
that sauna and steam rooms provided no proven health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent in late June to Hollywood Y members, Scott said
she did her own review of the science. "My search of the medical
literature has largely confirmed the beneficial effects of judicious
use of saunas and steam rooms," she wrote. "It is their misuse and
abuse that we must address."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I think bacteria, I think teeny, tiny individual blobs living in
splendid isolation. These days, however, microbiologists know that
those diminutive cells often choose to hang out in stuck-together
clumps.</LD>
<LD>   And when they do, beware. Just as kids (to say nothing of adults)
are influenced by mob dynamics and act out in different, silly or
downright dangerous ways, bacteria in crowds change their stripes
too.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of bacteria, the changes they make are anything but
dumb. For instance, when disease-causing microbes form these
layers--known as biofilms--they become much tougher.</LD>
<TE>   Antibiotics that fight the free-swimming bugs just fine lose their
clout as much as a thousandfold when the blighters clump together.</TE>
<TE>   That's why bacterial biofilms--in the lungs of people with cystic
fibrosis, in tough urinary tract infections, or sticking to the walls
of catheters--are so hard to wipe out.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being a random clumping down, forming a biofilm is a
calm, crisply orchestrated business. Say an E. coli cell is swimming
along inside a bladder, flipping its flagella this way and that way.
All of a sudden, the bug reaches a nice, solid surface (say, the
bladder wall). It sticks to the surface, turns all kinds of genes on
and off, forms a colony. The colony covers itself with a thick,
gooey, sugary slime, with lots of E. coli hidden deeply within.
Presto! A drug-resistant biofilm is formed.</TE>
<TE>   Should this be getting too grim, here are some other, less
life-threatening biofilms: slime that forms in a week-old vase of
flowers; bugs that obligingly chomp up sewage at waste treatment
plants; ones in lakes that feed fish, and thus ultimately provide
food for noble beasts like the American eagle; and the sticky plaque
covering our teeth.</TE>
<TE>   And we can revel in the fact that things could be even worse for
our teeth and other parts of our body if we didn't have ways to keep
biofilm formation in check.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking within our sweat, tears and nasal mucus is a chemical,
lactoferrin, newly discovered to have biofilm-busting powers.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists in Iowa City, Iowa, and Evanston, Ill., discovered this
and recently wrote about it in the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   They were studying a microbe called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which
infests the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Lactoferrin, they
found, stops this bug from forming biofilms by depriving it of iron.</TE>
<TE>   Pseudomonas swims in a kind of purposeful way; the scientists call
such swimmers "ramblers." Ramblers, as their name suggests, keep
movin' on.</TE>
<TE>   When they reach a surface, the ramblers normally change their
swimming pattern. They become squatters--they hang around, clump up
and form a biofilm.</TE>
<TE>   But in the scientists' test tube studies, adding lactoferrin--and
thus depriving the microbe of iron--abruptly altered matters.
Squatters became scarce. Ramblers were the norm. Biofilms just didn't
form.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists hope that understanding all these nuances--the genes
turned on and off, the steps involved in making biofilm bugs more
tough, mean and virulent--could eventually lead to new drugs that can
better fight troublesome infections.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if you want to learn more about biofilms--and get a
giggle as well--visit the silly but informative Web site,
instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/Courses/biomi290/Horror/Openingpage.html.
Here, two cartoon pudgy bacteria, a la Ebert and Roeper, review
movies with biofilm themes. Click on different images in such
bacterial cinematic classics as "One Flew Over the Petri Dish" to
learn where biofilms lurk in nature and which ones help us, harm us
or stay solidly neutral, like the Swiss.</TE>

<HD>Lung Cancer Survivors Cite a Better Quality of Life</HD>

<LD>A diagnosis of cancer can evoke a person's worst fears, but survivors
of the disease often say their illness had a positive impact on their
lives. And those who battle lung cancer, one of the most deadly
malignancies, are no different. Although only about 15% of people
with lung cancer live at least five years after diagnosis, the first
study of survivors found that about half believe their cancer
contributed to a good quality of life.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the persistent physical problems--fatigue, shortness of
breath, aches and pains, and changes in appearance--71% of lung
cancer survivors described themselves as being very hopeful, and 50%
said their illness had made a positive change in their life.</LD>
<LD>   Among the group that reported a poorer quality of life, the most
important factor was their emotional state. For those, depression was
a bigger issue than their physical limitations. Lung cancer usually
requires removal of all or part of a lung, which can cause a loss of
up to 30% of lung function. That loss can seriously interfere with
daily life. Still, the researchers found those who were cancer-free
five years after initial diagnosis had a quality of life as high or
higher than survivors of other cancers.</LD>

<TE>   Change for the Better  ... and Worse</TE>
<TE>   Common wisdom says people don't change but a new study says those
with personality disorders do--but not always for the better. Some
neurotic symptoms get better as people age, but in two out of three
personality disorders, symptoms get worse. Although psychotherapists
are taught that personality disorders are persistent, this is the
first study to test this belief and document how the same group of
people changed more than a decade after their initial diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people who took a personality test and were treated for
depression, anxiety or panic disorders in British psychiatric clinics
were tested again 12 years later at the Imperial College School of
Medicine in London. Of those, 175 were further evaluated in
interviews. Their personalities were categorized as flamboyant
(histrionic, antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personalities),
fearful and anxious (dependent, obsessive-compulsive and avoidant
personalities), and odd and eccentric (paranoid and schizoid
personalities).</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of those with borderline personalities, who
tend to be quite impulsive, flamboyant types seemed to mellow with
age. Characteristics of the other types became more pronounced over
time. Flamboyant types tend to be less isolated than the other two
types, which may partly explain the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers suggest another round of testing in another 12 or
13 years to see if the personality disorders persist into old age.</TE>

<TE>   Training Bladder Can Prevent Need for Surgery</TE>
<TE>   There are at least a dozen treatments for helping women with poor
bladder control, but a new study shows that simple bladder training
works for many and allows them to avoid surgery, medication and more
complicated types of behavioral therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the behavioral methods, such as biofeedback and electrical
stimulation, have required lots of time and effort. Such methods
often work, reducing the number of incontinent episodes by 50% to
80%.</TE>
<TE>   But a study of less intense therapies, involving patients at
Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, found that treatment
need not be so complicated. In this study, women came to six weekly
group sessions, where they learned a simple technique for gradually
increasing the intervals between their usual voiding times. They also
learned how the bladder works and were given instructions on pelvic
exercises. At completion of the study, they had, on average, 50%
fewer incontinent episodes compared to women who didn't receive the
training.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this study will encourage primary-care practitioners to
ask women about incontinence, knowing that with very little time
spent on patient education and little intervention they can help
women improve," says Dr. Leslee L. Subak, assistant professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at UC San Francisco.</TE>

<TE>   Proof of Chromium's Efficacy Proves Elusive</TE>
<TE>   The mineral supplement chromium is advertised as a dietary aid
that is supposed to help burn fat, build muscle, increase the level
of "good" cholesterol and keep blood sugar in check.</TE>
<TE>   But a new analysis of 15 randomized clinical trials involving more
than 600 people shows that the jury is still out as to whether
chromium supplements are even safe, let alone if they affect blood
sugar.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers report they found no relationship between chromium
and glucose or between chromium and insulin levels in 435 people who
were healthy or had impaired glucose tolerance but not diabetes.
Studies of people who already have the disease are sparse.</TE>
<TE>   Chromium is found naturally in grains and cereals, but it's
thought that much of it is lost in processing so most people don't
consume the recommended 50 to 200 micrograms a day. Some experts
speculate that the deficiency might be linked to diabetes, since
chromium is involved in maintaining a normal level of glucose in the
blood.</TE>
<TE>   If chromium were a new drug under study by the Food and Drug
Administration (mineral supplements sold in the U.S. are not subject
to the same rigorous testing as pharmaceuticals), the researchers say
they would recommend a clinical study that would test various doses
to determine not only what works, but what is safe.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Originally grown in the warm, semiarid climate of the Mediterranean,
figs found their way to the New World through Spanish missionaries,
who by the mid-1700s had started planting them in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   Today almost all commercially grown figs in the United States grow
in California, where the summers are long and dry. The most common
varieties of fresh figs are Black Mission (with black or purple skins
and pink flesh), Kadota (greenish-yellow skins and purple flesh), and
Calimyrna (large greenish-yellow fruit). Each of the fresh varieties
is available during a different period from June through September.</LD>
<LD>   Because fresh figs last only about a week after harvest, almost
90% of the world's fig crop is sold as dried fruit.</LD>
<TE>   The nutritional value of dried figs is quite impressive. They have
the highest fiber and mineral content of all the usual fruits, nuts
or vegetables, and contain more calcium. In fact, by weight, they
actually have more calcium than skim milk.</TE>
<TE>   Figs are 80% higher in potassium than bananas and are extremely
easy to digest. They also have more iron than most other fruits and
are extremely high in magnesium. All of this for about 20 to 40
calories per fig. No wonder they are often called nature's most
nearly perfect fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Look for figs that are richly colored, plump and unbruised. The
aroma should be mild; if the fruit smells sour, it has started to
spoil. It should be soft, but not mushy.</TE>
<TE>   Dried figs are a great stand-alone snack but add flavor and

<DH>Dentistry: Patients with cavities have more choices, with
varying durability and aesthetic appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cavity treatment used to be simple. A dentist drilled away the
decayed part of the tooth and packed the resulting hole with
silver-colored mercury amalgam. It wasn't pretty, but it did the
job--at least until the amalgam started to crack or come out.</LD>
<LD>   But as dental science has become more technologically
sophisticated, so too have the options for replacing the enamel,
dentin and pulp ravaged by bacteria and plaque. Decayed areas of
teeth can now be restored with mixtures of plastics, glass, ceramic
and quartz, each with varying degrees of aesthetic appeal and
durability.</LD>
<LD>   The variety has been driven, in large part, by cosmetic concerns.
Given the choice between a molar full of grayish metal or a synthetic
compound tinted to resemble tooth enamel, patients generally opt for
the latter.</LD>
<TE>   "Very few people today want anything placed in their mouth that
doesn't match," said Rella Christiansen of Clinical Research
Associates, a Provo, Utah-based nonprofit organization that evaluates
dental materials and techniques.</TE>
<TE>   But, with adults today keeping their teeth longer than in
generations past, dentists have also been searching for cavity
fillers that can last for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, vocal consumer advocates have been fighting to rid
dentists' offices of mercury amalgam, which has been used since the
1850s. Mercury has already been taken out of childhood vaccines
because of potential damage to developing brains, and health
authorities often warn about the danger of eating
mercury-contaminated fish.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Brown, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who as founder of
Consumers for Dental Choice has led the anti-mercury charge, is now
working to garner support for a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Diane
Watson (D-Calif.) that would abolish mercury amalgam nationwide. Said
Brown: "There is no science in support of mercury fillings."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of U.S. dentists, following American Dental Assn.
guidance, counter that no one has proved that mercury amalgam
fillings diminish health, although a small number of people develop
allergic reactions to the substance. Although they acknowledge that
mercury can be released from fillings when you chew and can be
detected in breath vapor and in the bloodstream, they point to
reassurances from the ADA and a handful of federal agencies that
mercury released by fillings falls well within safe levels.</TE>
<TE>   Some dentists are playing it safe just the same. Figures from the
American Dental Assn. show mercury amalgam fillings losing ground to
higher-tech materials. In 1990, amalgam accounted for 99.5 million
new fillings, including 23 million fillings placed in the mouths of
U.S. youngsters ages 2 to 17. By 1999, amalgams accounted for just
under 71 million new fillings, including 21.5 million fillings for
children.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, more dentists have stopped using mercury,
according to surveys of dental preferences. Last December, Clinical
Research Associates found that 27% of randomly sampled subscribers to
its newsletter weren't using mercury amalgam, up from 3% in 1985 and
9% in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Dental insurance, however, hasn't caught up with all the
developments. Many plans, including Medi-Cal, will pay only for the
standard amalgam (except where a front tooth is involved). Consumers
who want something else must make up the difference, often 30% or
more above the cost of mercury.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving toward better access because everybody is paying
attention" to how the newer materials are working, said Dr. Van P.
Thompson, who heads the dental materials department at New York
University College of Dentistry.</TE>
<TE>   Since last year, Californians sitting in the dentist's chair who
need fillings, crowns, bridges or other restorations have been handed
a fact sheet that acknowledges controversy about the safety of
mercury amalgams and details the pros and cons of alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Cromer of Marina del Rey, who in February was told that her
6-year-old daughter, Caitlin, needed a handful of fillings, said she
carefully reviewed all the listed options with her child's dentist.
Although she considered using amalgam, she eventually decided on
composites. "I did have less doubts about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say dental consumers may be trading one set of health
concerns for others as more is known about the long-term effects of
newer filling materials, not to mention the cements sometimes needed
to make them stick. For example, composite fillings can leach a
substance called bisphenol-A, a material found in plastic food can
linings that appears to mimic the female hormone estrogen, although
the California fact sheet says concerns about it aren't supported by
research studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everything in life, there's a pro and a con," said Dr. Mark
Goldenberg, a Beverly Hills dentist who helped draft the California
dental fact sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Here are your options when getting a tooth filled:</TE>
<TE>   Mercury amalgam. This mixture of liquid mercury, powdered silver,
tin and copper has long been dentistry's workhorse for its ease of
use, durability and low cost. Over time, it can expand and contract
with changes in temperature, leading to cracks in the filling and
tooth that may require repair or replacement. While some people
experience initial sensitivity to heat and cold, that generally goes
away. In the last decade, many dentists have been using special
adhesives to improve the way the filling fits and seals the area.</TE>
<TE>   Composite resins. These combinations of resin (liquid plastic)
fortified with powdered glass, quartz, silica or ceramic, mimic the
look of tooth enamel. The powdered material provides strength and
helps reduce the shrinkage that occurs when it hardens. Historically,
composites have required more skillful handling than amalgam and can
take 10 to 15 minutes longer than amalgams to put in place, said New
York University's Thompson. He said that composites seem to be
wearing as well as amalgam, although not all dentists agree.
Composites, which must be bonded to the tooth, are either
self-hardening or require exposure to 10 to 20 seconds of light to
start the hardening process. They require less drilling than
amalgams, preserve more of the tooth and can be done in a single
appointment. Even with only slight shrinkage, fluid can leak in,
however, fostering bacterial decay and creating some sensitivity to
heat and cold that might require replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Glass ionomers. Used mostly for cavities below the gum line, these
chemical compounds are made by mixing ground-up glass with
polyacrylic acid. The glass and acid react chemically to form a gel,
which eventually hardens. The reaction also produces fluoride that's
slowly released over time and can fight cavities by inhibiting
bacteria. Tricky to handle, glass ionomers require quick, deft
placement. Because the material naturally sticks to the tooth and
doesn't irritate tooth pulp, there's little tooth sensitivity.
Because glass ionomers are brittle, can fracture and are susceptible
to surface wear, they're not recommended for biting surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Resin-modified glass ionomers. These ionomers, to which resin has
been added, are tougher, more translucent, more natural-looking and
easier for dentists to use than glass ionomers. As with glass
ionomers, these slowly release fluoride. But the addition of resin
reduces the natural adhesive qualities, so some dentists use cement
with them. After sculpting the material, the dentist exposes it to a
special light and it quickly hardens. Because the material isn't as
wear-resistant as amalgam and composites, it isn't good for permanent
teeth. Many pediatric dentists use it to fill kids' baby teeth,
however. More resistant to dissolving than glass ionomers, these
ionomers are a top choice in areas of the mouth where it's hard to
control the amount of moisture, like at the tooth roots. They create
little tooth sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   Gold. Gold fillings, which must be cast in a laboratory, are
durable and expensive, requiring at least two visits to the dentist's
office. Today's gold fillings are cemented in place with an adhesive.
Because gold is a good conductor of heat and cold, gold fillings can
irritate sensitive teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Porcelain. Also known as inlays or onlays, these fillings are made
in the laboratory by firing glass particles that then melt together.
They offer very natural color that can match the tooth, but they tend
to break more easily than composite resins and glass ionomers. They
are expensive, taking at least two appointments, and are cemented
into the tooth. They don't create sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   The durability of all these materials depends on the dentist's
handling, knowledge and talent, as well as the patient's eating
habits and care. Habitual chewing on especially hard foods, or eating
very acidic foods like lemons, may degrade the fillings.</TE>
<TE>   CAD-CAM: This type of filling, with a shorthand name that refers
to the technique that produces it--computer-assisted
design/computer-assisted machining--is used by perhaps 10% of U.S.
dentists, according to Christiansen of Clinical Research Associates.
It removes much of the potential for human error in fitting a
filling. Once the dentist removes decay and prepares the tooth, a
computer measures the area to be filled, then designs and
custom-sculpts the filling from a cylinder of a special ceramic
mixture. These fillings can be done in one or two dental visits and
offer durability somewhere between amalgam and porcelain.</TE>
<TE>   Even as computers, such as those used with CAD-CAMS, move
dentistry into an era of more precision, researchers are trying to
create composites that shrink less than current ones, as well as
better ways to harden composites and resin-modified glass ionomers.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, the answer could be to use materials more like
those nature gave us. USC researchers have found the genes
responsible for the production of dental enamel, and other scientists
there and overseas are trying to develop materials that mimic the
body's own tooth tissues, while also working to regenerate enamel.</TE>
<TE>   These approaches, which combine stem cell biology, discoveries
about the human genome and biotechnology, would eliminate the
toxicity and potential side effects of current compounds, said Dr.
Hal Slavkin, dean of the USC School of Dentistry.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, other researchers are trying to develop a
vaccine that would prevent tooth decay altogether.</TE>

<HD>The Fit Get Fitter at 'Boot Camp'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fitness class gathered on the playground of a Sierra Madre
elementary school, an eclectic group of men and women whose ages
ranged from teens to mid-50s. Mingling among them were three men and
a woman wearing camouflage pants and black T-shirts with the words
"Boot Camp" emblazoned on them.</LD>
<LD>   I had heard about similar throwbacks to the past for more than a
year--physical fitness programs spun off from the purgatory that
comes with the first weeks of military basic training. The idea is to
provide a bit of atmospherics (as in the pants) reminiscent of the
military while giving a strenuous workout using very little in the
way of fancy equipment. It's a concept that is catching on
nationwide, with varying degrees of realism. With some trepidation, I
decided to give it a try.</LD>
<TE>   I'd seen ads for this particular boot camp at a Sierra Madre
fitness center, complete with a picture of four macho-looking
instructors staring menacingly into the camera. As it turned out, the
woman in the picture, Sandy Lewis-Duvall, is the owner of the center,
Sierra Fitness, that runs the boot camp. And contrary to the tough
look of the advertisements, the idea, said Lewis-Duvall, is simply to
return to the basics of physical fitness--with a military feel to
it--and to be outdoors at the same time. The stereotype of snarling
drill instructor is out, she said. Too many of her boot camp clients
had already gone through the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to motivate, not humiliate," she told me before the
workout began.</TE>
<TE>   The sessions run by Sierra Fitness last for an hour, four days a
week. The most intense of the offerings last for eight weeks, but for
$15 you can try a single session. Lewis-Duvall is quick to point out,
however, that boot camp training is not for everyone--that a modicum
of physical fitness is necessary at the entry level. She also said
there are other boot camps in the area where the fitness requirements
are much more rigorous, requiring a high degree of fitness just to
begin the program.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this day in boot camp was no walk in the park. Our group of
about 25 loosened up by jogging a couple of laps around the field.
Then head trainer Kurt Vasquez, a former Marine, took the lead in the
cadenced calisthenics, and I knew right away it would be a long hour
of working out. My heart rate monitor almost immediately began to
beep, signaling that I was already over my optimum zone that has a
high end of 140 beats per minute. We did jumping jacks. We did
crunches and push-ups. In all, we did seven sets of exercises, which
would have been plenty for your average workout. But that was only
the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Next came more drills on the other side of the field, where two
lines of plastic cones were set up. The idea was to move from one
side of the field to the other, with instructors barking commands.
The routine included even more push-ups and crunches, combined with
races back and forth. My legs were leaden, and most everyone was
seriously sweating, even those who had been in the course for a
number of weeks. Just when it seemed too difficult to continue,
Vasquez called for a water break. The session was at the halfway
point.</TE>
<TE>   By now, my shirt was dripping as we were led to a blacktopped
section of the school playground. There, we were divided into three
groups. At the first station, we tossed modern-day medicine balls
made of rubber against a wall. The first few were easy. Then the
weight of the balls began to take their toll. At the second station,
we did 40 step-ups on benches that lined the chain-link fence.
Finally, we did various exercises using either 10- or 15-pound bars.
Still, there was more to come in the form of races up and down the
field.</TE>
<TE>   That over, the group formed a circle, where Lewis-Duvall led some
cooling-off exercises. I looked at my heart-rate monitor and saw that
I had burned 1,020 calories. And it felt like it. Looking around,
some in the camp looked ready to do more; others looked spent.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis-Duvall said the ones who looked the fittest had been doing
the boot camp sessions for some time; others were just beginning. She
said participants are initially tested for flexibility, strength,
agility and endurance to make sure they are qualified for a boot
camp. If not, they are advised to work out in the gym for three or
four weeks as a way of building up.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of this particular boot camp depends on how many classes
are attended each week. The most expensive is $288--four days a week
for eight weeks. Lewis-Duvall said that her boot camp had been going
on for the last year and a half and that 50 people would begin a new
program today.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had every age and size with us," she said. And in terms of
results, she said "it's truly amazing where people end up."</TE>
<TE>   Me, I ended up limping around with stiff muscles for a couple of
days.</TE>

<HD>Menopause Relief Minus Hormones</HD>
<DH>Women: Pros and cons of natural remedies get renewed
attention, after a report on risks of traditional therapy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More women than ever may now look for other ways to ease menopausal
symptoms after last week's news that long-term hormone therapy
increases slightly the risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most likely options, experts say, will be natural
therapies.</LD>
<LD>   Already, more than 30% of women say they use herbs and other
supplements, according to the North American Menopause Society. And
doctors say an estimated half of all menopausal women refuse hormone
therapy when their doctors suggest it.</LD>
<TE>   "Anything that raises the risk of breast cancer is going to be of
concern to women," said Dr. Mary Hardy, medical director of the
Cedars-Sinai Integrative Medicine Program.</TE>
<TE>   Experts last week cautioned the estimated 6 million women taking
estrogen and progesterone to discuss their regimen with their
personal physicians before making changes. But Hardy predicts that
some women will be quick to drop hormones and turn to natural
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The women who stop taking hormones and develop [menopause]
symptoms are going to say, 'So what do I do now?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of women experience at least some discomfort during
menopause--the time during which the body's natural production of
estrogen ceases--and an estimated 5% to 15% have severe symptoms that
can include hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue,
irritability, urinary tract infections, incontinence, mood swings,
thinning hair and skin, vaginal dryness and low libido.</TE>
<TE>   Natural remedies may alleviate some of those discomforts without
the attendant risks linked to hormones, experts say. But before
rushing to the health food store, women should be aware that natural
remedies also have a downside. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * There is scant scientific evidence on the risks and benefits of
most natural remedies.</TE>
<TE>   * Studies on herbal supplements typically have examined only
short-term use.</TE>
<TE>   * Natural cures--including exercise, stress-reduction techniques
and dietary supplements--tend to work best for mild to moderate
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   * Any benefits gained will usually be apparent only after several
months of use.</TE>
<TE>   * Because dietary supplements are largely unregulated by the
federal government, there is no guarantee that the products contain
the ingredients listed or are free of adulterations.</TE>
<TE>   * Some herbs may interact with medications to cause serious side
effects. Some herbs, such as dong quai, may also be toxic.</TE>
<TE>   "As dire as the [hormone study] data may sound, at least we have
data, whereas there are no substantive data regarding any
alternatives," said Dr. Maida Taylor, associate clinical professor at
UC San Francisco and a senior clinical research physician for Eli
Lilly &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
warned doctors that, when it comes to easing menopausal symptoms,
there is little evidence supporting the use of the majority of
products, including such popular remedies as dong quai, evening
primrose, wild yam and Mexican yam, valerian root and chasteberry.</TE>
<TE>   The report cautioned that natural does not mean safe or effective.
For example, both dong quai and valerian have been linked to serious
side effects, said Taylor, who wrote the report.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the most helpful natural supplements for
menopause appear to be black cohosh, isoflavones (estrogen-like plant
compounds called phytoestrogens) and St. John's wort.</TE>
<TE>   Black cohosh, which is the active ingredient in the menopause
remedy RemiFemin, has been shown to ease hot flashes and night
sweats. Isoflavones found in soy and some grains may alleviate hot
flashes and could provide some protection against osteoporosis and
heart disease. St. John's wort has shown some impact in easing mild
depression.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, red clover may reduce hot flashes and night sweats.
Calcium is considered useful for protection against osteoporosis, and
the amino acid SAM-e may help with depression.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors say natural remedies address at least some common
symptoms of menopause. Dr. Neil Hirschenbein, who runs a practice
specializing in conventional and alternative medicine in San Diego,
said herbs can be as effective as and safer than synthetic hormones.</TE>
<TE>   He often prescribes herbs such as black cohosh, and encourages
women to alter their diets to add more soy and flaxseed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things people can do in terms of what they eat and
don't eat," he said. "There are also benefits from exercise in
treating menopausal symptoms. There are a lot of natural things
people can do."</TE>
<TE>   But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists report
cautions that even these products may be of little value for
long-term use. It recommends using black cohosh for six months or
fewer, and notes that long-term use of isoflavone supplements may be
harmful to women with a history of estrogen-dependent cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Because experts say hormone therapy remains safe for short-term
use (three years or fewer), women may want to stick with hormones for
that time period, said Taylor. She predicts some women will drop
hormones but will not find relief in natural products.</TE>
<TE>   "If a woman is having a dreadful time with hot flashes, we know
there is a medication [estrogen] that is relatively safe, though in
the long term it would not be advisable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of dietary supplements is also a concern for women
relying on them for menopausal relief. For example, one study by
ConsumerLab, an independent supplement testing company, found that
five of 18 isoflavone products had less isoflavone content than
stated on the label.</TE>
<TE>   Women should consult with their doctors to find the best natural
products, Hirschenbein said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the women I see have come to me having done herbs on
their own and failed that," he said. "The problem with herbal
preparations, in general, is there is a lot of difference between the
companies that put out good products and the companies that don't."</TE>
<TE>   But even the best natural therapies require patience, Hardy notes.
Exercise, for example, may help reduce hot flashes, but only as part
of a dedicated regimen. Herbs, too, may work subtly.</TE>
<TE>   "The big problem is that women may think that herbal medicines
will act like drugs," Hardy said. "With estrogen, you take it and in
two weeks you'll feel better. With black cohosh, peak response times
are two or three months. It's a whole different mind-set."</TE>
<TE>   Herbs are also unlikely to satisfy women with severe menopausal
symptoms, she said. And while exercise, healthy eating and stress
reduction could be helpful, the benefits won't be obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these benefits are on the margin, but they give women a
sense of empowerment," Hardy said.</TE>
<TE>   And on the plus side, she added, the waning enthusiasm for
hormones could ignite new research on natural remedies. The National
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine already has begun
studies on black cohosh, Chinese herbal preparations, flaxseed
supplements and phytoestrogens.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hardy: "Now that we've had this [negative hormone study],
perhaps we'll be forced to go back and look at some of these natural
things systematically."</TE>

<HD>Future of Laser Dental Surgery Still Is Being Examined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lasers have displaced the dental drill and the scalpel in the offices
of a small but growing group of dentists who credit them with making
cavity treatment virtually painless and reducing bleeding during gum
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Various instruments, each using a slightly different type of
light, can cut gums, soft tissues, even enamel, as well as detect
tiny cavities, and whiten or desensitize teeth. Yet they remain
outside the profession's mainstream, and dental schools do not
currently train students how to use them. "I'm looking at it as a
potential technology yet to be thoroughly tested and yet to be
inserted in formal dental education," said Dr. Hal Slavkin, dean of
the USC School of Dentistry, who said lasers and standard treatments
need further comparison in scientific studies.</LD>
<LD>   Dental applications of lasers have been studied since lasers first
were developed in the 1960s, said Dr. Joel M. White, president of the
Academy of Laser Dentistry. While generally slower but more precise
than many conventional instruments, they haven't completely replaced
conventional high-speed drills or other cutting tools in dental
offices. However, hard-tissue lasers minimize the pain of treating
small cavities while helping to preserve more of the healthy
surrounding tooth. (Cases of serious decay still require numbing.)
Lasers are more sensitive than the eye in picking up tiny pit and
fissure cavities.</LD>
<TE>   In gum surgery, where the laser not only cuts but can staunch
bleeding by promoting coagulation, "the folks who use it say healing
is better, healing is faster," but that hasn't been definitively
demonstrated in scientific studies, said Slavkin, director of the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research from 1995 to
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Because lasers produce energy and heat as they vaporize decayed or
diseased tissues, they potentially can damage the tooth or other
tissues, especially if they're used at too high a power for too long,
White said. Patients should make sure any dentist who uses lasers is
properly trained and experienced.</TE>
<TE>   Slavkin, who tried a laser instrument this spring at an Academy of
Laser Dentistry meeting in La Jolla, said, "There is a significant
amount of experience you need in order to control what you're cutting
and what you're not cutting. This is not something to just pick up
and do. Everybody has a learning curve."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, dentists and dental hygienists can be trained by the
laser manufacturers, through courses at some universities and through
programs sponsored by the academy. They must pass a standard
proficiency exam, which includes a written examination as well as a
simulated procedure on animal teeth and jaws, said White, a professor
in the Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences at
UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Laser dentistry isn't yet a recognized specialty of the American
Dental Assn., like orthodontics or periodontics. The Academy of Laser
Dentistry, which promotes lasers in addition to training and
certifying dentists to use them, estimates that about 5% of U.S.
dentists incorporate lasers into their practices. White said that
some dentists use them for still-unapproved purposes and have made
claims that haven't yet been borne out by data, such as the claim
that they promote bone regeneration.</TE>
<TE>   White said dental fees generally are no higher for procedures
using lasers, compared with conventional equipment, and that
insurance does pay for their use. But the equipment is expensive.
Lasers that cut into enamel typically run about $40,000, while those
that work on the gums cost about $10,000, said Dr. Donald J. Coluzzi,
a Redwood City dentist.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Each year about 2.4 million Americans come down with infections
caused by campylobacter, a bug transmitted through undercooked
chicken or other foods contaminated with juices from raw poultry.</LD>
<LD>   To treat the illness, doctors typically prescribe antibiotics
called fluoroquinolones. These drugs are usually effective in
knocking out the infection in a day or two, but if people are not
treated, the illness can persist for up to three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   A decade ago, about one in 100 people with campylobacter illness
experienced antibiotic resistance; that is, the drugs didn't work
against the bug. By 1999, remarkably, antibiotics failed to work in
one of six people, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The
FDA says that 80% of all chickens are now contaminated with
campylobacter, and one in four of those chickens carries a
drug-resistant form of the bacterium. How did this happen so fast?</LD>
<TE>   In 1995 the FDA allowed poultry growers to use fluoroquinolones to
prevent respiratory infections in chickens. The rationale went like
this: If one chicken catches pneumonia, it quickly spreads to the
rest of the flock. So if low doses of the drug were added to the
birds' drinking water, it would prevent the rest of the flock from
getting sick.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, scientists from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention argued that feeding fluoroquinolones to
livestock would eventually make the drugs useless in treating
campylobacter infections in humans.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Satcher, then head of the CDC and later surgeon general,
told the FDA that "the widespread use of fluoroquinolones in animals,
even when limited to therapeutic use, will hasten the emergence of
resistance, especially in bacteria transmitted by food."</TE>
<TE>   The poultry industry argued that the antibiotics were used
sparingly, on fewer than 1.5% of growers' flocks--still about 90
million chickens. The FDA agreed with the industry. Before long,
however, the danger that Satcher warned about began to surface.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the Minnesota Department of Health, published in the
New England Journal of Medicine in 1999, found that 88% of the
chickens purchased at grocery stores and other retail outlets were
contaminated; 20% of them carried drug-resistant organisms. They also
found that drug-resistant infections increased significantly in
humans, from 0.8% in 1996 to 3% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, antibiotic use in chickens and growing U.S.
consumption of poultry are not the only factors contributing to
antibiotic resistance in humans.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors who prescribe antibiotics for patients with viral
infections such as colds, for which antibiotics are ineffective, are
part of the problem as well. So are parents who ask for antibiotics
for their kids' ear infections when, in some cases, the drugs are not
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how chickens contribute to the problem: Like all animals,
chickens carry many kinds of bacteria in their gut. Low doses of
fluoroquinolones kill not only bacteria that cause pneumonia in
chickens, but also some of the other germs, including campylobacter.
Not all the campylobacter bugs are killed, however. Those that remain
mutate and rapidly become resistant to the antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   During processing, when the birds are eviscerated and
de-feathered, campylobacter can contaminate the birds' skin. Chickens
are also chilled in a communal water bath where cross-contamination
occurs.</TE>
<TE>   When chicken is prepared for sale, juices accumulate in the
package. If those juices drip on the cutting board in your kitchen or
on uncooked foods such as fruits and vegetables, you can get sick
from eating them.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, something can be done before this problem gets worse.
After a scientific link was found between drug resistance in humans
and fluoroquinolones fed to chickens, the FDA in 2000 withdrew
approval of two drugs used to treat sick chickens: sarafloxacin
(SaraFlox), made by Abbott Laboratories, and enrofloxacin (Baytril),
made by Bayer.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe that fluoroquinolones are safe to use in
poultry," says Dr. Linda Tollefson, deputy director of the FDA's
center for veterinary medicine. "Chickens treated with
fluoroquinolones are not safe to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Abbott agreed to remove sarafloxacin from the market, but Bayer is
challenging the FDA action.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't find the link between the use of Baytril and poultry,"
says Bayer spokesman Bob Walker. "We strongly believe in the product.
Instead of being a detriment, it's a benefit to safe food."</TE>
<TE>   Walker also contends that no other drug works on chickens with
respiratory illness. But the FDA says there are other antibiotics
that can be used.</TE>
<TE>   The fight against fluoroquinolones has found some unexpected
support from industry. The Wendy's restaurant chain, which uses 200
million pounds of poultry a year, doesn't buy birds that have been
treated with fluoroquinolones. Neither does McDonald's. And Foster
Farms, the largest poultry producer on the West Coast, says it does
not use fluoroquinolones to treat its flocks.</TE>
<TE>   Foster says that if a few chickens get sick, they are removed from
the flock. If many birds become ill, the flock may be treated with
other animal antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   The resistance to campylobacter infections is "a harbinger of
worse things to come," says Dr. Kirk Smith, an epidemiologist with
the Minnesota Department of Public Health. "Now it's campylobacter;
salmonella is probably next. It's a nastier pathogen."</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, health officials have reported cases of antibiotic
resistance in patients with salmonella infections. Children with
immature immune systems and older adults whose immune systems are
weakened by illness are especially susceptible to salmonella
poisoning and can die from the infection.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA is expected to rule on Bayer's challenge in the next year.
The outcome will have ramifications for both the public and the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The decision could lead to a broad review of the use of
antibiotics in all food animals, including those used to promote
growth.</TE>
<TE>   What can consumers do in the meantime? They could avoid eating
chickens treated with fluoroquinolones. But that's easier said than
done. Most chickens sold in supermarkets don't come with labels
declaring whether they've been treated with the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Chicken dinners in restaurants don't carry warning labels either.
When big food concerns, such as Wendy's, decide to buy
antibiotic-free chickens, they don't always make public
announcements.</TE>
<TE>   If you're lucky, you might be able to find a local grower who
doesn't feed antibiotics to his chickens.</TE>
<TE>   At my local farmers market, a chicken grower posts a big sign
every Saturday proclaiming his chickens as drug-free. It's not
unusual to see long lines form by his stall.</TE>
<TE>   If you're worried about antibiotics in your poultry--and there is
good reason for concern until such time as the government completely
bans their use--it's a good idea to heed the experts' advice. Wash
any surface that comes in contact with chicken juices, and avoid
poultry that looks the slightest bit undercooked.</TE>

<HD>Do Abdominal Crunches Instead of Full Sit-Ups</HD>

<AU>STEPHANIE OAKES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I've had three abdominal surgeries and cannot do even one
sit-up. How do I strengthen my abs so that I can do sit-ups?</LD>
<LD>   SHELBY GREENFIELD</LD>
<LD>   Plano, Texas</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Full sit-ups are not the type of abdominal exercise I'd
recommend. They can injure your back and aren't truly effective,
because you use muscles other than the abdominals to do most of the
work. Instead, try doing crunches. They're similar to sit-ups but you
bring only your head, shoulders and upper back off the floor--and
they specifically target your abdominal muscles.</TE>
<TE>   To do a crunch, lie on your back on a mat with knees bent, feet
hip-width apart and flat on the floor. Rest your hands behind your
head. Tighten your stomach and lift your shoulder blades off the
floor. Exhale as you lift up and hold for a count of two. Slowly
lower down to the floor while inhaling. Do not pull your head up with
your hands; leave your fingers resting lightly on your head. Repeat
for a set of 20.</TE>
<TE>   When doing crunches, try to maintain a pelvic tilt so that your
abdominal muscles work harder. Also, be conscious of your abdominal
muscles throughout the day. Tighten your abs (but don't hold your
breath) when sitting and standing so you maintain good posture.
Slouching and bad posture can stretch and weaken your abs.</TE>

<LD>   Background: Teenwire is sponsored by Planned Parenthood, the
nationwide organization that has been advising adults and teenagers
on reproductive issues for nearly a century. Aimed mostly at
high-school students, the site provides discussions of body image,
abstinence, birth control and many other aspects of sexuality.</LD>
<TE>   What works: Teenwire does not flinch, no matter the question or
topic. On a page titled "Yikes!" it answers inquiries such as, "I'm
pregnant, now what?" and "Do I have a sexually transmitted
infection?" The site also discusses homosexuality, as well as
abortion and parental notification laws by state. There are chat
rooms; there are surveys asking about sexual encounters. Teenagers
can learn a whole lot here, and do so without having to ask adults
embarrassing questions. In all, it's the kind of site many reviews
advise parents to screen first.</TE>

<HD>Study Links Bacteria to Strokes</HD>

<LD>A type of bacteria previously linked to ulcers may also be a key
factor in some strokes, according to a study that lends support to
the theory that infections and inflammation play a role in heart
attacks and strokes.</LD>
<LD>   Previous studies looking for a connection between Helicobacter
pylori, the cause of most stomach ulcers, and stroke were
inconclusive. But a new study scheduled to appear in the July 30
issue of Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Assn. suggests
that particularly virulent strains of H. pylori can invade and damage
arteries and potentially lead to a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers led by Dr. Antonio Pietroiusti, an internist at the
Tor Vergata University in Rome, found that H. pylori strains that
produce potent poisons, called cytotoxins, were more prevalent in the
blood of patients who suffered strokes caused by narrowing of
arteries in the neck and brain. These cytotoxins are thought to
attack plaque-lined artery walls, causing inflammation and swelling,
creating an environment for a stroke.</LD>
<TE>   Every year, 750,000 Americans suffer a stroke and 160,000 die,
making strokes the third-leading cause of death in this country. They
occur either when a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel and cuts
off blood flow to the brain, killing cells, or when a blood vessel
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers examined strains of H. pylori in the blood of 138
patients who suffered strokes in plaque-lined vessels leading to the
brain, and 61 patients whose strokes were caused by clots that formed
in the heart and traveled to the brain. They compared both those
groups to 151 healthy volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Although members of all three groups showed equivalent amounts of
H. pylori in general, the significant finding was that 42.8% of
people with large-vessel strokes had strains of the
cytotoxin-producing bacteria, compared with 19.7% of those whose
strokes had cardiac origins, and 17.9% of healthy volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the study was a so-called case control study, it only was
able to find an association between the bacteria and strokes; it
could not prove H. pylori caused the strokes. But researchers found
other evidence of the link between some H. pylori and strokes. Levels
of C-reactive protein, which measure inflammation, were higher in
both stroke groups than in healthy volunteers. They were
significantly higher in patients with the cytotoxin-releasing H.
pylori, suggesting the bacteria cause the inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   The study is important because it's more evidence showing the
association of infection, atherosclerosis and stroke, said Dr.
Ravinder Singh, a Beverly Hills neurologist who specializes in
stroke. "It probably is not going to change the way we manage
patients. But hopefully it will lead to other prospective studies ...
that would look at whether this is a cause of atherosclerosis and if
it is, how can we prevent it?"</TE>

<HD>Virtual Techniques Improving Dental Reality</HD>
<DH>At USC, the schools of dentistry, medicine and engineering
have devised a way to create 3-D images of patients' heads and necks.
It widens options for treatment and helps surgeons predict results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With two upper teeth conspicuously missing, 13-year-old Oscar Ruiz
Jr.'s smile looked like that of a much younger child.</LD>
<LD>   His parents couldn't figure out why the canine teeth hadn't come
in, and although Oscar wasn't in pain, dentist after dentist said the
adult teeth needed to descend since they were damaging the adjacent
ones.</LD>
<LD>   But they all refused to take his complex case, and the Ruiz family
came to USC's dental school simply hoping to find someone who would
agree to treat him.</LD>
<TE>   There, Oscar became an early beneficiary of a computer program
that creates animated 3-D images of patients' heads and necks,
accurate down to the person's jaw movements and tooth decay.</TE>
<TE>   The Virtual Craniofacial Patient Laboratory, one of a handful in
the country so advanced, helped surgeons plot the recent surgery to
expose the teeth with fewer and more accurate incisions than working
from X-rays. Computer-based planning also helped the Ruiz family
understand where Oscar's teeth were and how doctors would attach
spring-equipped braces that will drag them into place over the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the other dentists' explanations made sense," said Oscar
Ruiz Sr., 34, of Norwalk. "All we could see was gum when we looked in
his mouth, and we couldn't understand why."</TE>
<TE>   The laboratory, developed a couple of years ago, is a partnership
between USC's dentistry and medical schools and the engineering
schools at USC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A virtual patient profile enables surgeons to explore different
treatments and more accurately predict results, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time doctors' explanations consist of a lot of verbal
descriptions and hand-waving," said Dr. James Mah, head of the USC
laboratory. "With this program, we can take what's going on inside
our heads and show it to patients."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent postoperative checkup, Oscar slumped in a chair
and alternately toyed with his braces and with a Discman holding a
Korn CD, uninterested in the 3-D image of his teeth gliding across a
monitor.</TE>
<TE>   But as research associate Reyes Enciso used a mouse to erase
Oscar's lower teeth and focus on the glowing green canines hovering
above the rest, his father's mouth dropped open as his eyes followed
the floating teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing," he said, his voice trailing off as he watched.</TE>
<TE>   Most dentists and craniofacial surgeons rely on photographs,
X-rays and stone models to develop treatments. The best images that
those tools can create resemble yellow clouds with fuzzy red edges
instead of an exact jawline.</TE>
<TE>   But with virtual patient technology, a very accurate likeness is
created with four tools: a normal computer using a jaw motion
tracker, a 3-D dental camera that takes pictures inside the mouth, a
CT scanner to create X-ray-type photos and images of a plaster model
to capture the shape of the external flesh.</TE>
<TE>   At USC, the new technology has helped surgeons implant an
artificial ear into a freckled toddler born with only a bud on the
right side of his head and realign the mouth of a man whose teeth had
haphazardly contorted to fit his crooked jaw.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't an infinite number of surgeons who can do this kind
of work," Mah said. "Now instead of mentally reconstructing the past
when they try to explain how to do these procedures, they can send
someone a CD-ROM with the surgery on it in 3-D."</TE>
<TE>   Starting this fall, the program will be used to make braces for
those in areas around California with no orthodontists.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting technicians equipped with the necessary tools will send
images of the patients' mouths to USC.</TE>
<TE>   There a machine resembling a knee-high R2D2 swallows lengths of
straight wire and spits out braces, shaped more accurately than an
orthodontist can by hand. Brackets and glue are added at the dental
school before the braces are shipped to patients' dentists.</TE>
<TE>   Such computer programs are a sort of flight simulator for medical
and dental students, said researchers at the National Biocomputation
Center, a joint project between Stanford and NASA where doctors have
been developing similar technology for the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than training on the patients who walk through the door
today, they can train on every patient who has ever walked through
the door," said the center's technical director, Kevin Montgomery.
"And all these benefits come without risk to real patients."</TE>
<TE>   An American Dental Assn. official said virtual patient technology
is an efficient supplement to classroom materials.</TE>
<TE>   "Human material is expensive, and once you've dissected it, it's
gone," said Dr. Laura Neumann, associate executive director of
education.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, the addition of virtual touch to the technology
will allow USC medical and dental students to put on gloves and feel
the texture and resistance of slicing through skin and bone on
various types of surgeries before performing them on actual patients.</TE>
<TE>   "I think patients always prefer someone who's proficient at
something rather than one who's just seen some pictures or poked
around on a couple of people," Neumann said. "Virtual teaching
creates more confident dentists."</TE>
<TE>   Oscar's father said the computer procedure's $350 price tag was
well worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "It not only helped the doctors, but it helped me be sure this was
the right thing to do for my son," Ruiz said. "That peace of mind is
pretty valuable."</TE>

<HD>A Letdown for Vision Researchers</HD>
<DH>A study shows that vitamin E alone does not prevent macular
degeneration, but a combination therapy may still show promise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lowering some recently raised expectations, a new study has found
that megadoses of vitamin E don't prevent macular degeneration, the
leading cause of blindness in Americans older than 55.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the 6 million Americans with the disease, for which there
is no cure, were encouraged last year when a National Eye Institute
study showed that high doses of antioxidants, including vitamins E
and C, beta carotene and the mineral zinc, can slow progression of
the disorder in people with vision impairment by about 25%.</LD>
<LD>   But new Australian research indicates that vitamin E alone does
not prevent "either the incidence or progression of macular
degeneration," said Hugh P. Taylor, a study coauthor and a professor
at the University of Melbourne.</LD>
<TE>   In the study, published earlier this month in the British Medical
Journal, 1,193 healthy volunteers between 55 and 80 were followed for
four years. Half received daily supplements of 55 milligrams of
vitamin E; the remainder were given a placebo, or dummy pill. At the
end of the study there was no difference between the two groups, a
result that researchers called "disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Still, NEI researchers aren't ready to write off vitamin E as a
disease fighter. They point out that the Australian research involved
only healthy subjects, only 1% to 2% of whom will go on to develop
macular degeneration. Consequently, the sample size probably wasn't
large enough to show preventive effects, according to Dr. Emily Y.
Chew of the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 NEI study, in contrast, involved 3,640 patients who
already had moderate to severe macular degeneration, and several
supplements were used. "The jury is still out on vitamin E alone,"
says Chew, who was that study's coauthor. "But the combination, which
is proven to be beneficial for people with the disease, may be what's
important."</TE>

<HD>Fortified Waters: Consider Them All Wet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days bottled water isn't just simple H2O. Store shelves and
vending machines are filling with so-called fitness waters, which may
come packed with vitamins, minerals and herbal extracts. Others
contain soluble fiber, fruit essence, caffeine or, thanks to modern
science, an extra dose of oxygen.</LD>
<LD>   What effect does all this have on our efforts to drink a healthy
amount of water--usually five to eight glasses a day? Not an ounce.</LD>
<LD>   "I know of no research that shows potential value of fitness
waters over regular water," says Douglas Casa, director of athletic
training education at the University of Connecticut's Human
Performance Laboratory in Storrs.</LD>
<TE>   And fitness waters can take a big gulp out of your budget. A
16-ounce bottle of Aquesse, for example, provides about 5 grams of
soluble fiber--roughly what you'd get in two servings of oatmeal. But
at $1.85, it costs at least three times more per serving.</TE>
<TE>   Better to get most of your daily fluids the old-fashioned way: by
drinking plain water, experts say. And don't forget water-rich foods:
Soups (hot or cold), veggies and fruit (especially watermelon,
grapes, oranges, plums and grapefruit) also count and can help
replace fluids lost during the sweltering days of summer. Water-rich
foods are also valuable because they provide fiber as well as
vitamins and minerals. Pennsylvania State University researcher
Barbara Rolls and her colleagues have shown that these foods help
quench thirst and make you feel full--a winning combination.</TE>
<TE>   How much fluid is enough? That's a question that vexes consumers
and scientists. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences has
convened an expert panel to review water recommendations. The group
expects to report in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Lest you get parched waiting for their conclusions, the current
advice is to take in 2 to 2.5 liters a day, says Michael Sawka, chief
of thermal and mountain medicine at the Army Research Institute of
Environmental Medicine in Natick, Mass. That works out to eight to 12
cups.</TE>
<TE>   Before you feel like you're drowning, know that you already get
about half that liquid in the foods that you eat, particularly if you
consume a healthy, well-balanced diet.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee, tea, milk, juice and soda also count toward the total, but
plain old H2O is the fluid of choice for the remaining five to eight
glasses. "Water is as good as anything else for most situations,"
says Sawka.</TE>
<TE>   One exception to the water rule: If you exercise for at least an
hour in hot weather, a sports drink may be a good idea, Sawka says.
These beverages help improve recovery and can help reestablish your
body fluids faster than water alone, he says.</TE>
<TE>   If you do reach for a sports drink, pick one with about 110
milligrams of sodium and a touch of potassium per serving, Sawka
says. And try to avoid drinks with added oxygen, carbonation,
fructose or other sweeteners. The reason? The oxygen and carbonation
can make you feel bloated, which may mean you don't drink as much as
you need. And the sweetener? As Sawka says: "It can give you a lot of
gastrointestinal distress."</TE>

<HD>The Ideal Weight Isn't Just About Numbers</HD>
<DH>Getting as thin as possible shouldn't be the goal. Rather,
it's finding the range that lets your body perform at its best--and
that may mean gaining muscle poundage.</DH>

<LD>Most elite athletes develop a clear notion about their ideal weight
for performance--and the rest of us mere mortals and recreational
athletes can learn from such body awareness.</LD>
<LD>   "Athletes know what weight makes them feel strongest," said Kris
Clark, director of sports nutrition at Penn State University in State
College, Pa. "When I work with people who are not competitive
athletes, I like to ask, 'During your adult life, after college and
high school, what was your weight when you felt like you were
exercising your best or performing at your best in a job?' The answer
is a good starting point for achieving your own 'playing weight.' "</LD>
<LD>   Clark said people too often equate their best weight with school
days. That might not be realistic given the demands of adult life,
whether it is doing a job or raising children or both. "I recommend
setting realistic goals," Clark said. "Not letting your clothes feel
tight is an effective and practical goal."</LD>
<TE>   From Barbara Day's perspective, most people simply want to "get as
thin as possible." "It's all about what's pretty or skinny," said
Day, who is a sports nutritionist and dietitian for Kentucky's
University of Louisville athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of an exact weight, Day is more inclined to suggest a
range that allows you to feel most healthy. Becoming aware of what
weight range allows you to feel strong throughout the day or avoid
too many colds is a good strategy for anyone, she said. "One formula
to determine an ideal or healthy weight is 100 pounds for first 5
feet of height, then add 5 pounds for each inch," Day said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the number can be misleading because it doesn't account for a
small, medium or large frame." Body-mass index, or BMI, has become a
popular measure among researchers and public health officials. Day
called it "just another number," while Clark said it can be useful
for many people, especially if they are not highly active. The
formula calculates a ratio of weight to height that is designed to
estimate body fat.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely enough, BMI might be least valuable for athletes. Proof
comes in the singular argument that Michael Jordan at his best
playing weight would be considered borderline overweight in the BMI
tables. Clark said an entire demographic group, African American
women, might be susceptible to BMI scores that are misdirected.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at a female African American athlete and think, 'She is
120, maybe 130 pounds,' " Clark said. "Then it turns out her weight
is 150, even 160. The bone mass of active African American women just
tends to be much more dense [than that of other ethnic groups]."
Admit it or not, many people aim for a certain weight because someone
else influences them. Spouses or other family members might top the
list. For athletes, a coach can be the persuader.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked with one athlete whose coach wanted him to drop 20
pounds," Day recalled. "The coach thought this player would be
quicker at the lower weight. But the problem was, this athlete was
already at 5% body fat. He didn't have weight to lose unless it was
going to be muscle."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some coaches and athletes themselves can be
stubborn about gaining weight. The myth that muscles make you less
quick still has a certain amount of staying power. It comes down to
gaining the right sort of weight--lean muscle mass rather than fat.
Reaching an ideal playing weight follows suit.</TE>
<TE>   "I see soccer players who would gain quickness with more muscle
rather than lose it," Clark said. "Plus, they can prevent injuries
and build stamina. Muscles help carry the body and support the frame.
The player has more power and stamina for his game." Performance has
many facets beyond the playing fields and sports courts, Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   All of us benefit from gaining muscle and shedding excess body
fat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose just 5 pounds of body fat, you will have more blood,
oxygen, vitamins and other nutrients for the rest of your body," Day
said. "You will feel the difference throughout your day."</TE>

<HD>To Keep Pounds Off, Lose Slowly</HD>

<LD>If you are planning to reach your own "playing weight," both the
American College of Sports Medicine and the American Dietetic Assn.
recommend losing no more than 2 pounds per week. Dropping pounds at a
faster rate typically means you are losing water weight and breaking
down muscle mass; neither outcome will boost your energy levels.
Besides, pounds you lose too fast will be hard to keep off.</LD>
<LD>   To lose 1 pound each week, subtract 500 calories a day by
consuming less and being more active. The best food targets are
saturated fats (mostly in animal fats and processed foods) and trans
fats (often called partially hydrogenated fats/oils on the label).
For activity, use a combination of aerobic exercise (walking,
running, cycling) and resistance training (weights, bands, isometric
exercises--push-ups, crunches and other moves that use your own body
weight for resistance).</LD>
<LD>   "Trying to do it all either through food or exercise is not the
answer," said Barbara Day, a Louisville, Ky.-based sports
nutritionist. "Making both changes will have the greatest impact." If
you intend to lose weight to play a specific sport, Day said, there
are accepted ranges of body-fat percentage according to sport (and
sometimes by position). Women's ranges tend to be a bit higher than
men's.</LD>
<TE>   Some examples: Ideal weight for softball players is 12% to 18%
body fat for women and 8% to 14% for men. Female golfers should aim
for 12% to 20%, while men tend to play best at 10% to 16%. Women on a
weightlifting program will be hitting optimal body-fat range at 10%
to 18%, while men do the same at 5% to 12%. Remember, those are ideal
weight ranges. For starters, losing a pound or two of undesired
weight a week will make a dramatic difference in whatever game you
choose.</TE>

<HD>Citizens Find a Hole in Official Argument</HD>

<LD>Every so often community activists are called upon to clarify for
otherwise confused bureaucrats the realities of a situation that is
causing problems. In one case, for instance, the Army Corps of
Engineers learned from activists that a large hole in the ground with
water in it is quite probably a lake.</LD>
<LD>   This realization seems to have not only brought a victory to the
activists and the community of Lake View Terrace, but has also taught
a lesson of humility to the aforementioned corps. I'll explain.</LD>
<LD>   In the Hansen Dam recreation area at the eastern end of the San
Fernando Valley there are two bodies of water, one of about 35 acres,
the other a much smaller pond. They exist at the confluence of the
Little and Big Tujunga washes and over the years have developed a
unique ecosystem.</LD>
<TE>   A larger lake existed in the beginning, but at some point filled
with silt. It was subsequently deemed a "borrow pit" by the Army
Engineers, which meant that soil was dug from it to be used
elsewhere. But dredging created a 60-foot-deep hole. And the hole
eventually filled with water again.</TE>
<TE>   And what seemed to be a lake was born. Anyhow, it sure looked like
a lake.</TE>
<TE>   It was a large, shining body of water surrounded by a variety of
trees and vegetation with two "willow islands" in the middle. The
lake attracted all kinds of birds and fish, and was amazingly serene
and beautiful just a honk away from the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day, a local resident taking his morning stroll spotted
chunks of concrete and steel reinforcing bars in the west end of the
lake. A high, shrill alarm sounded in his heart.</TE>
<TE>   The resident was Dennis Kroeplin, a retired wildlife officer.
Walking farther, he saw that earth fill had been dumped into the
smaller pond ... fill that consisted of not just dirt, but shopping
carts, bicycle parts and old tires.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, Kroeplin got together with others in Lake View Terrace
who helped to ignite the community. Locals jammed a meeting with
representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers, who didn't have a
chance. They were prey in the eyes of eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Kroeplin and others came equipped with facts, figures and
statements from a half-dozen federal and local environmental
agencies. They read sections of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Wildlife Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act to
prove that the corps was violating its own mandates.</TE>
<TE>   But when they demanded that the junk be removed from their lake, a
spokesman for the corps replied, "It's not a lake. It's a hole in the
ground." A hole in the ground with water in it. The very reference
stirred the crowd to an even greater pitch of indignation.</TE>
<TE>   The steel and concrete debris was from a project to repair a
nearby "swimming lake." The corps spent $15 million creating that
concrete edifice, but it sprung a leak and had to be fixed for an
additional $3 million. The junk from that job was dumped into the
natural lake because, the corps explained, it would cost too much
money to take it elsewhere. Sludge from the Whittier Narrows,
complete with shopping carts, etc., was dumped into the smaller pond.</TE>
<TE>   Letters, phone calls and e-mails went out to Rep. Howard Berman
(D-Mission Hills), L.A. City Council President Alex Padilla, in whose
district the lake exists, and Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, who
represents an adjacent district. Hand bills were circulated.</TE>
<TE>   The corps, under siege, explained somewhat feebly that its intent
was to create a shallow wetlands where the lake exists. It was made
clear that what the locals wanted was what they had, minus the junk
dumped into both holes in the ground with water in them.</TE>
<TE>   With pressure from Berman, Padilla and Greuel, resistance from the
corps faded. The dumping was stopped and corps ecologist Carvel Bass
admitted that the organization had failed to involve the community in
its wetland plans and had similarly failed to even get a dumping
permit.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, a former engineer, says the Army Corps manifested a
typical engineer's mentality. "To them," he said, "it was just a hole
with water." Corps spokesman Fred-Otto Egeler verified that by
identifying the two bodies of water as borrow pits, adding, "They
have nothing to do with lakes or ponds!" But, he added later, the
debris-dumping into whatever they are has ended.</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding the corps' inability to grasp the situation,
Padilla is trying to get the city involved in removing the stuff from
both lakes.</TE>
<TE>   I spent a morning walking with Kroeplin and activist Debra Baumann
around what ought to be called Lake Defiance for what it represents,
the people taking on a bureaucracy with the passion of guerrilla
fighters. It was idyllic. A crow cawed in the distance and a great
blue heron skimmed the surface from island to island. Swallows soared
above us. A horse and rider clopped by, trotting along a pathway
circling through willow, pepper and eucalyptus trees.</TE>
<TE>   Only fools would not see this as an environmental jewel worth
saving.</TE>
<TE>   The Army Corps of Engineers blundered into a citizen's army fully
equipped to take it on. "Dennis Kroeplin was Paul Revere," Baumann
said as we walked around the lake. "We were the Minutemen."</TE>
<TE>   A gleaming white egret ruffled its feathers on a sandbar. The
sound whispered into the quiet morning.</TE>

<LD>The female protagonists in "Lilo &amp; Stitch," Disney's new animated
movie about a lonely little Hawaiian orphan being raised by her older
sister, are such a relief. A relief from the amplified female
physiques of bodacious cartoon babes the likes of Pocahontas, Ariel
("The Little Mermaid") and Esmeralda ("The Hunchback of Notre Dame")
to name a few. Lilo, the little girl, and her 19-year-old sister,
Nani, are rendered with sturdy, softly rounded bodies, thick thighs
and, in Nani's case, ample hips, physiques that resemble real bodies
of real girls. Refreshingly, Lilo looks like a child, not a
diminutive woman.</LD>
<LD>   It was no accident. "Chubbing things up" was the expression the
film creators used when directing animators to stay true to the
original drawings of the film's writer and co-director Chris Sanders,
according to the studio.</LD>
<LD>   "It created a lot of excitement in the studio because there's
almost a female shorthand that you get used to sometimes in the
animated world," Sanders told the Chicago Tribune. "And [our
characters] defied all that." Parents and feminists alike have long
complained about the unrelenting parade of ridiculously
perfect-bodied female characters in children's animated films,
arguing that such images of the female form and the implied messages
(i.e. beauty takes all) are unhealthy, narrow models for little girls
and adolescents.</LD>
<TE>   But what effect, if any, does seeing chubbier female characters
have upon the developing body image of a little girl or tween sitting
in the theater?</TE>
<TE>   "The research on the media's impact on women and girls'
relationship to their bodies shows that it is profound," said Melanie
Katzman, clinical assistant professor in psychiatry at Cornell
Medical Center in New York City. "It shapes visual expectations about
how one expects others as well as oneself to look. Any alteration in
those images is going to have an impact. But any degree of impact is
going to be in direct relation to the character's similarity to the
viewer." There may be several degrees of separation between
characters in an animated movie and a young viewer, Katzman said. The
first is that the characters are animated instead of human. Second,
the female protagonist may be of a different ethnicity. And last, the
characters may inhabit a fantastical environment.</TE>
<TE>   "The female characters in 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' are a step in the right
direction but it is not enough on its own," Katzman said. "There
would be a bigger impact by fattening up the women characters on
'Friends.' There really has to be a cumulative effect." In an
experiment at an eating disorders conference two years ago, Katzman
said, clinicians experienced a simulated cumulative effect when they
were deluged with beautifully rendered images of obese bodies, then
shown a fashion model. The fashion model looked ill in comparison,
Katzman said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the operating principle at work with many young girls and
women who compare their bodies to the dominant cultural ideal of the
impossibly perfect female form. When their bodies don't match, they
try to conform.</TE>
<TE>   Katzman conducted a study of 93 Chinese college sophomore women
who came to Los Angeles from Hong Kong. After living in Los Angeles
awhile, the women began exhibiting more disturbed eating behaviors
(i.e. starving themselves, weighing themselves often, using laxatives
to lose weight and comparing their bodies) than their Hong Kong
counterparts, according to the study, published in 1999 in the
Journal of Eating Disorders.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the available ways for these women to fit in and
assimilate was to join in conversation about body weight and to
compare their bodies to others," said Katzman, author of "Eating
Disorders and Cultures in Transition" ( Rutledge, London, 2001).
"When in your own culture, you reference or identify with your own
[culture's ideal body image] but when you are in another, you
reference the other." Girls and teenagers are particularly vulnerable
to cultural definitions of physical attractiveness partly because
they haven't developed a solid sense of self yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls, tweens and teenagers often look at the media for what is
good and what is attractive and most of these animated characters in
movies are like a rendition of Barbie," said Anne Kearney-Cooke, a
clinical psychologist at the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute who
specializes in body image and eating disorders. "Girls compare
themselves, feel bad, develop eating disorders and exercise trying to
conform. It can be freeing for girls to see lots of images and
different ethnic groups." Aside from the fact that the characters
Lilo and Nani possess sturdier bodies that are more instrumental and
less ornamental, Lilo looks and dresses like a little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that not only is it not a perfect female form but
that it is childlike," said historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg, Stephen
H. Weiss Presidential Fellow and professor of Feminist, Gender, &amp;
Sexuality Studies at Cornell University. "So the little girl watching
doesn't feel that she has to be precociously mature and has to look
like a grown-up woman. That way the image doesn't contribute to more
of that premature insane anxiety adolescent girls now have about
their bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Brumberg knows the subject well. She is the author of the 1989
book "The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls," which
examined adolescent girls' diary excerpts and media images from 1830
to the 1990s. She found that girls at the turn of the 19th century
measured their self-worth on good deeds and internal character
whereas girls at the end of the 20th century were concerned with the
"shape and appearance of their body as a primary expression of their
individual identity." By age 13, 53% of girls are dissatisfied with
their bodies, Brumberg writes, and many have begun a pattern of
dieting as early as 8 or 9.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to aim for as much variety [of images of girls] as
possible for the health of all girls, especially that generation of
girls who cut their teeth on Britney Spears," said Brumberg. "It
would be lovely if [the entertainment industry] could make that
transition to more variety with human actors. Girls certainly need
some kind of alternative vision, otherwise it is one blond-haired,
midriff-bearing woman after another."</TE>

<LD>THE WHORE'S CHILD</LD>
<LD>   And Other Stories</LD>
<LD>   by Richard Russo</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   272 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1986 with "Mohawk," set in upstate New York, Richard
Russo has made a name for himself writing big novels about small
places. His most recent, "Empire Falls," about a dying mill town in
Maine, won him the Pulitzer Prize earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Neither a satirist--like Sinclair Lewis--nor an idealizer--like
Thornton Wilder--Russo plumbs the depths and shallows of small-town
existence, exploring the circumscribed, sometimes bleak lives of his
characters with sharp insight, wry wit and unsentimental compassion.</TE>
<TE>   These same gifts are evident in his short fiction as well. In
moving from his customary large canvas, thick with characters, plots
and subplots, to the more constricted form of the short story, Russo
certainly lands on his feet.</TE>
<TE>   The seven stories in his first collection, "The Whore's Child and
Other Stories," are likely to please his fans and win him new
readers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stories are perhaps a little too neat, a problem that
plagues the genre in general. Others incline toward the thin and
flat--another hazard of this mode. But each of these stories
succeeds--in one way or another--in capturing and holding our
attention, and several do more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Who is the eponymous "whore's child" of the title story? She is,
of all things, Sister Ursula, an elderly Belgian nun who pretty much
crashes the advanced creative-writing course that the narrator
teaches.</TE>
<TE>   The narrator tries to discourage her, telling her that her lack of
experience as a writer will put her at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the
other students.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a storytelling class, Sister," he adds. "We're all liars
here.... In this class, we actually prefer a well-told lie."</TE>
<TE>   "Never you mind," replies Sister Ursula. "My whole life has been a
lie."</TE>
<TE>   The long story that Sister Ursula proceeds to produce in several
installments strikes the teacher and most of the class as unadorned
nonfiction.</TE>
<TE>   "In the convent," it begins, "I was known as the whore's child."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Nice opening,' " the narrator tells us he penciled in the
margin, "as if to imply that her choice had been a purely artistic
one. It wasn't, of course."</TE>
<TE>   This nun's story simply reflects the facts of her life: She was
placed in a convent as a little girl and her mother was a prostitute.
She proceeds to recount the prejudice, injustice, mistreatment and
mean-spiritedness she encountered as a child in the convent.</TE>
<TE>   " 'It's a victim story,' one student recognize[s]. 'The character
is being acted on by outside forces, but she has no choices, which
means there can be no consequences to anything she does. If she
doesn't participate in her own destiny, where's the story?' " demands
the student, who also admits to liking it nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Whore's Child," Russo poses--and plays with--what seems to
be an increasingly relevant question about the relative merits of two
literary modes.</TE>
<TE>   Which exerts the stronger appeal: the art of the fiction writer or
the true story of an actual life?</TE>
<TE>   Russo takes a trenchant, child's-eye look at the dysfunctional
1970s family in two memorable stories. In "Joy Ride," a 12-year-old
boy is dragged across the country by his mother, who has impulsively
decided to leave her perfectly nice, if dull, husband to seek freedom
and excitement on the open road. The trip exposes facets of her
character that her son is never able to forget--or forgive.</TE>
<TE>   Marital discord is also central to "The Mysteries of Linwood
Hart," whose young hero is one of Russo's most fetching fictional
creations:</TE>
<TE>   "It felt, sometimes, as if the world must've been patiently
waiting for him to get born so that real things could start
happening--kind of like the difference between the drills at school
and an actual fire. He knew that things could and did happen even if
he wasn't there, but he still had the impression that the truly
important events tended to occur only when he was there to witness
them.... Surely life played that fair, at least.</TE>
<TE>   "The world was there for him to learn from and learn about.
Otherwise, what was the point?"</TE>
<TE>   But the world, Linwood learns, is not quite as considerate and
child-centered a place as he had assumed.</TE>
<TE>   The narrator of "Poison" (one of Russo's weaker efforts) is a
middle-aged writer: professionally successful, happily married,
reasonably content. A visit from his old friend Gene, a writer with
the same working-class background, stirs up memories of the past,
anxiety about the future and guilt over the failure to live up to
ideals.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to see beyond the limitations of one's own personal
viewpoint is a recurrent theme for Russo.</TE>
<TE>   In "Monhegan Light," a widower gets a fresh, if too late,
perspective on the woman he married from a portrait painted by her
lover.</TE>
<TE>   In "Buoyancy," a middle-aged academic worried about his wife, who
is recovering from a mental breakdown, suddenly finds himself the one
who is feeling disoriented.</TE>
<TE>   Having recently undergone treatment for cancer, the 52-year-old
narrator of "The Farther You Go" is understandably annoyed at being
urged by his wife to intervene in their daughter's troubled marriage.
But in doing so, he gains new insights into his daughter, his
son-in-law and his own marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Like Richard Ford, Russo is a writer who prefers to focus on the
ordinary and the commonplace rather than the bizarre and the
outlandish. His style and approach are similarly understated, calling
attention not to themselves, but to the world they depict so
effectively and affectingly.</TE>

<HD>A Chapter on Patience</HD>
<DH>Take One! bookshop, which targets the film industry's
up-and-comers, is packed with literature on film and theater, but not
customers--yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about the fear factor. Ingesting insects and swimming with
sharks are nothing compared to what life must be like for Tim Morell,
a real-life risk-taker with no lifeline to guarantee survival like
they have on those hyped-up game shows.</LD>
<LD>   It is 2 p.m. on a holiday weekend and Morell stands in his new,
2,000-square-foot independent bookstore, which is devoted solely to
books on film and theater arts. He surveys the newly refurbished
space, the untrammeled carpet, the shelves lined with actor's
editions of the world's great plays, and the empty aisles where he'd
hoped throngs of aspiring actors, writers and directors would be
buying and browsing.</LD>
<LD>   The second-floor bookshop has been open for two months. A
sign--"Take One! Film &amp; Theater Books"--proclaims its existence to
everyone on this bustling strip of Santa Monica Boulevard across from
the Royal Theater and a few blocks west of the 405. On this sultry
day, a trendy restaurant below the shop is half full of lazily
lunching patrons. But, aside from Morell and his one under-taxed
employee, Take One! is utterly empty.</LD>
<TE>   Its proprietor appears unfazed. If there is a knot in his stomach
or a throb in his head as he scans the emptiness, he does not admit
it. "It's early yet. Everybody's business is slow on a day like
this," he says calmly, like an old warrior who has weathered such
battles before. He has--except in those days, he was an employee who
would collect a paycheck no matter what. Now, he owns the place. It
is his savings, and those of friends who've become investors, that
are at stake if the place doesn't thrive. Still, Morell admits few
negative thoughts. "We are a destination bookshop. Once word gets out
that we're here, we'll be in great shape. Of course, this is not for
the faint of heart--there's quite an element of risk," he admits. But
he can already tell, he says, from the customers he's had so far that
he'll be a success. He may be right. There are few shops around that
are truly competitive with his: Samuel French, the venerable store at
Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue (with a branch in the Valley),
and Larry Edmunds, in Hollywood, which focuses more on new and used
film books and memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it's a high-stakes niche market fraught with secrecy.
Or, at least, that's how bookstore employees make it seem when asked
their names. An employee at one of those shops, who didn't want his
name used, says Morell will "probably do great. For years, people
have asked me to recommend a place on the Westside, but there was
none. Now he's put one there." A worker at another competitor, who
also requested anonymity, says, "I wish him luck. Business is so bad
at our place that we're barely able to stay afloat."</TE>
<TE>   Location was everything for Morell, who lives near Griffith Park.
He says the Westside teems with young actors, directors and writers
who aim to be boffo in show biz sometime soon. For them, the little
$6 "actor's editions" of the world's great plays; the $14.95 tapes on
how to achieve a Southern, Irish or Arabic accent, and the industry
insiders' journals are all cause enough to make the trip.
General-interest bookstores carry none of these things, Morell says.
He envisions his shop as a kind of hangout where the industry's
up-and-coming will congregate, where they will hear free lectures by
authors and others in the industry at the rear of the store--a space
he's dedicated as a small auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Morell held events like "Creative Producing From A to Z:
An Indie Producer's Handbook," "Secrets of Screenplay Structure and
How Not to Write a Screenplay," and "Writing the Killer Treatment,
Selling Your Story Without a Script."</TE>
<TE>   Morell doesn't aim to reach those already at the top of the
Hollywood ladder. "The people who shop from us are the people who
want to be well known; they're the stars of the future. I don't
expect to see a lot of big-name stars in here--those guys go to
places like Book Soup."</TE>
<TE>   What's interesting about Morell is not only that he went into such
a highly specialized field at such an unpredictable economic time,
but that he specifically targets those whose passion for his wares
exceeds their ability to spend much money on them--beginning writers,
actors, film editors, etc. You might wonder whether Morell, 47, cares
about earning money.</TE>
<TE>   Of course he does. "Los Angeles is the largest book-buying market
in the nation. The Westside had a need to be filled--and I had the
expertise to fill it. The two things I know most about are books and
film."</TE>
<TE>   He's worked in both fields for most of his adult life, he says.
Starting with a first job at B. Dalton in Hollywood in 1978, when
that was the place where many stars shopped, he progressed to Crown
Books, then Book Soup to Samuel French, where he worked for 10 years
and was a buyer. During those years, he also wrote screenplays that
generated interest, he says, but never quite made it. He was working
at Samuel French when he turned 40, realized he didn't want to write
any more, and decided his true fulfillment would come from opening
his own shop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a satisfying profession--one of the few where people really
get value for their money, get the information they need, the stories
they love, get a way to look at their lives differently." It's been a
pleasure so far, he says, even if droves of customers haven't yet
discovered him, even if he hasn't yet completely stocked his shelves,
even if the ink hasn't yet turned black. "It'll all happen soon," he
says. "I was advised by lots of people to wait until the economy got
better before I tried to open a place. But, somehow, I just couldn't
wait."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On July 27, Frederick Levy (vice president of development and
production at Marty Katz Productions and author of "Hollywood 101:
How to Succeed in Hollywood Without Connections") will speak and sign

<LD>A 'Scorpion' in Long Beach</LD>
<LD>   Did you know there's a 299 1/2-foot- long scorpion in Long Beach?
This "Scorpion" doesn't live in the desert, nor will it attack if
harmed. It is the nickname for a Russian Foxtrot-Class submarine
docked alongside the Queen Mary in Long Beach. The 2,500-ton
submarine once belonged to the Soviet Navy and is now open daily for
tours.</LD>
<LD>   The Scorpion has many compartments you can explore, including a
forward torpedo room; officers' quarters; sonar room; control room,
which houses an operable periscope; the "top secret" room, where
classified material was maintained during the sub's voyages; the
diesel engine room, which houses the massive engines that power the
sub; the electric motor room, which controls the electric motors and
contains the only freshwater shower; and the aft torpedo room, which
houses four torpedoes and served as the compartment where most of the
seamen ate and slept. There were 27 bunks for the sub's 56 seamen who
slept in shifts. In addition to the seamen, the sub's full crew
included 12 officers and 10 midshipmen.</LD>
<TE>   More can be learned about the Russian submarine and its history by
visiting the Queen Mary and the Scorpion attraction in Long Beach.
(Children must be at least 42 inches tall to enter the sub.) For more
information, visit www.queenmary.com or call (562) 435-3511.</TE>

<LD>Aspiring replacements for Ann Landers now number 1.5 billion,
according to a survey of newspaper editors who are currently trapped
under truckloads of resumes and sample columns.</LD>
<LD>   The stampede of applicants includes the Rev. Pat Robertson, Mayor
James Hahn, rocker Ozzy Osbourne and the late Ted Williams. Here are
some sample columns:</LD>
<LD>   James Hahn</LD>
<TE>   Dear Jimbo: I know the video looks bad. Some people think that
when I handcuffed 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, lifted him off the
ground and slammed him onto the trunk of a car, I was trying to hurt
him. In truth, I once studied chiropractic medicine and was simply
trying to adjust the boy's spine, which was badly out of alignment.
Unfortunately, my actions have been misinterpreted and my job with
the Inglewood Police Department is in jeopardy. Any openings in your
police department?</TE>
<TE>   --INFAMOUS IN INGLEWOOD</TE>
<TE>   Dear Infamous: I'm afraid we have a surplus of chiropractic cops,
but I think you show considerable promise as a pro wrestler or future
governor of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Jimbo: For the past 152 years, I've been married to one of
the West Coast's most powerful players. Unfortunately, he's shallow,
vain, never pays attention to me and it's almost impossible to get
him to do chores around the house, such as fixing potholes. Should I
secede from this union?</TE>
<TE>   --VALLEY GIRL</TE>
<TE>   Dear V.G.: I sense a lot of hostility on your part. I think you
should see a counselor.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams</TE>
<TE>   Dear Teddy: My stepbrother and I are totally estranged. Truth be
told, he doesn't get along with anyone in the family. I'd like to
heal the rift, but I don't know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   --SPLENDID SISTER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Sister: These situations take time to heal. Lots of time.
Perhaps even centuries. If you get to your deathbed and things still
aren't resolved, you might consider having yourself frozen. After a
few centuries on ice, you and your brother will have better odds for
reconciling.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom President Bernard Ebbers</TE>
<TE>   Dear WorldCom: I might have to move soon from a large,
well-appointed mansion to a one-room studio apartment in a "gated
community." Do you have any decorating tips?</TE>
<TE>   --MARTHA S.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Martha: On the advice of my attorney, I decline to answer
this question.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ovitz</TE>
<TE>   Dear Mike: I think my boss is the devil. Seriously. I even have a
photo of him with horns and a pitchfork. Do you think that's why he
wouldn't promote my latest album, "Insufferable"?</TE>
<TE>   --JACKO</TE>
<TE>   Dear Jacko: Clearly you are the victim of a gay mafia. No, wait. I
apologize for that remark. What I meant to say is you're the victim
of a gray mafia--people who are jealous of your youth and vitality.
Either that or your album is just really lame.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Robertson</TE>
<TE>   Dear Rev.: Last week, my husband and I were invited to dinner by
"Mary and Steve." Everything was fine until Mary served a bowl of
after-dinner mints before dessert. When I hinted it was proper
etiquette to bring out the mints after the entire dinner, dessert
included, Mary went ballistic. She said if I were right, then the
candies would be called "after-dessert mints." Can you settle the
dispute?</TE>
<TE>   --MINT-CONDITION</TE>
<TE>   INQUIRER</TE>
<TE>   Dear Mint: I think you're avoiding the real issue here, and that
is your relationship with Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us that Jesus
is the way, the truth and the life. He is the answer to all our
questions, the solution to all our problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Rev.: Several years ago, you published a letter from a mother
whose 12-year-old daughter demanded the right to pierce her ears, dye
her hair, wear makeup and start smoking. I am now facing a similar
problem with my 6-year-old son. Could you please reprint your answer?</TE>
<TE>   --MOROSE MOM</TE>
<TE>   Dear Morose: It took me awhile to track down that column, but here
is the reply you asked about:</TE>
<TE>   I think you're avoiding the real issue here, and that is your
relationship with Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us that Jesus is the
way, the truth and the life. He is the answer to all our questions,
the solution to all our problems.</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy Osbourne</TE>
<TE>   Dear Ozzy: Dude, I got, like, totally wasted last night, and I
started hitting on this chick. At least, I think it was a chick. But
when I woke up the next day, I was in bed with a guy, a girl and a
department store mannequin. I'm completely confused.</TE>
<TE>   --PAT BOONE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Pat: You should $%#@-ing %!&amp;# #$@* and $%#@@ #%@$. Also, &amp;#@%
%$#@ #%$@-ing @$#&amp; $&amp;!* Immanuel Kant's critique of pure reason $!&amp;*%

<HD>The Pain of Going Public</HD>
<DH>Media* Parents of slain reporter Daniel Pearl are finding
it difficult to grieve in private while seeking publicity for a new
foundation and a book of his writings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now the world will turn to them again, the parents of slain Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Today, in Pakistan, a verdict
is expected in the trial of four Islamic militants accused of
kidnapping and killing Pearl earlier this year. Prosecutors have
asked for the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Since their son disappeared in Karachi on Jan. 23, Judea and Ruth
Pearl have tried to avoid the media, and have been declining requests
to go before the cameras following the judge's ruling. Instead, the
family is likely to issue a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The Pearls understand and appreciate the interest in their son,
the Journal's South Asia bureau chief. But after leading private
lives, they are uneasy under the probing lights of the media. In
February, after another news development, reporters who tried to
approach the family in the San Fernando Valley found that their
two-story, New Orleans French Quarter-style house had sheets of white
paper taped over the windows and glass doors.</LD>
<TE>   The Pearls reject the assumption that they must allow the media
access to their dark moments. These days, while launching ambitious
plans for the Daniel Pearl Foundation, the couple are trying to find
their footing in a culture that expects to hear intimate details from
grieving parents who have been in the news.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep our privacy," said Ruth Pearl, 66, a retired
computer consultant. "We don't want our pictures in the paper. We
want to deal with our grief in private. We don't want to be talking
about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the past few weeks, though, the two agreed to their first
interviews--with Larry King, Oprah Winfrey and a handful of
others--to promote an anthology of their son's writings and a
foundation in his name. Now the couple said they will pull back,
shutter their hearts once more.</TE>
<TE>   The Pearls are poised and articulate, and have volumes to say
about their son and the nonprofit foundation, which will promote
peace through music and journalism, and is supported by honorary
board members such as Bill Clinton and Elie Wiesel.</TE>
<TE>   But they have been caught off guard by some recent media
questions, such as the one asking for comment on the case of missing
Salt Lake City teenager Elizabeth Smart, said Judea Pearl, 65, a
professor emeritus of computer science at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   And they are uncomfortable with questions such as "You know the
feeling of a child gone ... [Mrs. Pearl], what was it like for you?"
("Larry King Live"). Or, "How does it make you feel now that
videotapes of his ... murder are circulating on the Internet, and
people are pulling it up and trying to see it?" ("The Oprah Winfrey
Show"). (On the graphic videotape distributed by Pearl's captors, the
38-year-old journalist, under duress, says that he and his parents
are Jewish; the footage also shows that he was decapitated.)</TE>
<TE>   After appearing live on King's show and on the "Today" show in
late June, Judea, who heads UCLA's Cognitive Systems Laboratory,
decided that he would not do more TV interviews in the foreseeable
future.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth later appeared on Winfrey's show with Helene Cooper, editor
of "At Home in the World," a collection of Daniel Pearl's articles
from the Wall Street Journal (Wall Street Journal Books/Free Press).</TE>
<TE>   One of the Pearls' two daughters, 32-year-old Michelle Pearl, said
she also hopes to find ways to talk about the foundation without
having to answer questions about her brother's death. "The thing is,
when you go on a [TV] appearance, everyone wants to ask, 'How did you
feel during the kidnapping? How did you hear he was dead?' "</TE>
<TE>   Added Ruth: " 'How do you feel about the video [of your son's
death]?' And all these questions that are personal and painful. We
would like to work on Danny's legacy and look forward."</TE>
<TE>   A few days before his abduction, Pearl had called Michelle. His
wife, Mariane Pearl, was pregnant with their first child, and he
wanted his little sister to be the first person to know that the baby
would be a boy. On a recent afternoon, the Pearls showed off pictures
of their grandson, Adam, who was born May 28. They plan to visit soon
with Adam and his mother, who live in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   In their cozy living room, the Pearls brightened when they talked
about their family. Happy reminders of their son's life are
everywhere--his wedding pictures, his beloved music LPs, his new
book. They laughed when Michelle, who was visiting for the weekend
from the Bay Area, told stories about her brother; the three deferred
to and teased one another.</TE>
<TE>   Judea and Ruth always knew exactly where to reach their son,
throughout his extensive travels. He called and e-mailed often, to
tell his mother about a new kind of bread he had made or the free
violin lessons he gave to kids in an underprivileged neighborhood. On
visits home, he and his father would play around on the guitar,
violin and piano, maybe improvising some marimba-style Vivaldi.</TE>
<TE>   His last visit was in June 2001, when he joined his parents for a
trip to Catalina Island. He had planned to join his parents and two
sisters Jan. 18 in San Francisco but canceled because of work.</TE>
<TE>   In May, on the outskirts of Karachi, police recovered remains of a
body believed to be Pearl's; DNA tests are pending. Profits from "At
Home in the World" will go to the foundation and a trust that was
established for his widow and son.</TE>
<TE>   At Ruth's suggestion, the book includes two funny first-person
pieces from her son's first job with the North Adams Transcript
newspaper in Massachusetts. The other stories, all of which were
selected by Cooper, are pieces that he wrote in the U.S. and abroad
for the Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl found one of the stories when he was sent to Iran in the
summer of 1997 to cover elections, Cooper wrote in one of several
essays that are woven throughout the book. He returned with a
front-page story about how the making of the world's largest carpet
was underway, with "a third of an acre of beige, brown and blue
swirls and flowers" and no potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The dateline was Ben, Iran. The first paragraph: "This is a small
town in search of a really big floor."</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Pearl said she hopes the book's readers will get to "know
Danny. They heard about him. The grim situation he was in. And now
they hear him talking.... His personality comes through. His
integrity, his sensitivity, his humor and pain. In one of [the
stories], you could see the pain--the [1999] article in Kosovo, where
he was seeking to find some ray of hope that there was some
friendship holding between the Serbs and Albanians."</TE>
<TE>   "At Home in the World" has been "very well received by booksellers
and the media," said a spokeswoman for the Wall Street Journal
Books/Free Press. The publisher has ordered 70,000 copies, a
substantial printing.</TE>
<TE>   Now that word is out, "the book sells itself," Judea Pearl
suggested, and the family can focus on other projects. The
foundation, www.danielpearlfoundation.org, "hopes to bring light to
the world the way Danny did through his stories and music" and "to
address the root causes of this tragedy, in the spirit, style, and
principles that shaped Danny's work and character."</TE>
<TE>   On June 18, in Washington, D.C., the foundation held its first
fund-raiser, a party that drew guests including the Clintons. "I
didn't know what a social event was," Judea said with a chuckle,
"until I met [Bill] Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   The support has been "very touching," Ruth said, her voice
cracking. "It's amazing how people knew Danny without meeting him."
Thousands of strangers wrote the family letters; Ruth is trying to
write back to every one. "We owe it to the world to keep that image
alive and to be contributing to the world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle and her 40-year-old sister, Tamara Pearl, who is a
homeopath in Canada, cut back their work schedules to devote more
time to the foundation. Public relations professionals and others who
have donated their time have contributed to the planning.</TE>
<TE>   Ideas include gathering international music artists to record a
song that Pearl co-wrote for a friend whose baby was overdue: "Come
out, come out, the world is not such a bad place," he wrote. Michelle
rattled off several other projects the foundation might pursue,
locally and in other parts of the world, including an East-West
journalism conference that could be held in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Judea has another idea on how to reach Pakistanis, those who turn
to the radio, instead of TV or newspapers. "The idea is to get some
of Danny's stories translated to Urdu [the language of southern
Pakistan] and be broadcast and read on the radio," he said. "To tell
people that American journalists are not to be feared, that there's
some virtue and humanity in them even when they are Jewish, and even
when their parents are Israeli."</TE>
<TE>   His voice was gentle, with no trace of anger or malice.</TE>

<HD>In Safe Hands</HD>
<DH>If it's locked, Dave Richardson can crack it open--legally,
of course. He's a professional with the right combination of skill
and scruples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood version of an ace safecracker is usually a lithe and
dapper fellow, a man whose exquisite ear and delicate fingertips can
coax the combination from any vault, who, armed with only a hairpin
or a stripped twist tie, can defuse an alarm system and pick a lock
in seconds. He works silently in the dark, invisible except when his
smile gleams irresistibly. A young Alec Guinness, say, or Cary Grant.
Maybe George Clooney.</LD>
<LD>   Resting his 6-foot-4 frame on a tiny metal cafe chair outside a
Beverly Hills Starbucks, Dave Richardson occupies a good portion of
the sidewalk, just as his truck--fire-engine red and custom built to
hold him and all his equipment--takes up a fair amount of the curb a
block away. There are so many things attached to his belt--a Palm,
his cell phone case, several sets of keys--that he jingles slightly
when he walks.</LD>
<LD>   This man would be hard to overlook, even in the dark.</LD>
<TE>   As he talks into a cell phone, the long sleeves of his flannel
shirt pull up a bit at the wrists revealing the beginnings of
old-time tattoos--skulls and flames and large-breasted women--that
cover his arms. He is 43, his silvering hair is slicked back and
there are rings on his fingers--Harley-Davidson and the Brotherhood
of Freemasonry.</TE>
<TE>   Between sips of coffee, he's patiently, and then not so patiently,
telling a customer how to open a safe Richardson recently broke into
and then repaired, complete with a new combination. "Four times
around, yes, completely around, then twice left. OK. If you follow
the directions as I wrote them down you will be able to open the
safe. Otherwise, I'll have to come out there again."</TE>
<TE>   He folds up his phone, puts it on the table and adds softly: "And
you don't want me to come out there again."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson is a safe and vault specialist. He cracks 400 to 600
safes a year, and he's been doing it for more than 20 years. Bank
vaults and gun safes, jeweler safes, floor safes and ATM machines,
safes in homes and military installations, in darkened offices while
FBI agents keep watch.</TE>
<TE>   He opens these safes and vaults because the owners have lost the
combination or the safe has malfunctioned, because law enforcement
officials have a search warrant, because a safe has been damaged. Or
because someone has bought an old safe or found a safe hidden in
their new home.</TE>
<TE>   This last group makes up the smallest percentage of his business
but affords him the most enjoyment. "People call me in the middle of
the night saying, 'You've got to come out here, we're pulling up the
carpet and we've found this safe.' " Richardson takes a drag on a
Pall Mall, then leans back and claims a few more inches of sidewalk.
"I say, 'Is it an emergency?' and, oh, yes, it always is and so I
tell them well, it's $250 for a normal call and half again for an
emergency and then, 'Oh, well, tomorrow or the next day would be
fine.' "</TE>
<TE>   He also tells them that the chance of them finding anything in
their newly discovered safe is little to none. "Been doing it for 20
years and I've never found anything but dead air. It's not like
people are going to drive away and forget the diamond tiara. People
think, well, maybe an old guy died and his family didn't know he had
a safe. Let me tell you, the family always knows there's a safe and
they usually know exactly what's in it."</TE>
<TE>   One Malibu couple discovered a secret room in their new house in
which stood nothing but a shiny and very expensive South African
safe. "They figured it was a drug dealer or something and they were
arguing about who got what while I'm pulling out my drill. There was
nothing in it. I mean if you're a drug dealer with a safe like that,
even if you're busted, you're going to have friends who will empty
the safe."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, who lives in Canyon Country, has never met a safe he
couldn't crack and he is often called in by locksmiths, law
enforcement officials and other safe and vault technicians when
they've done their best and the darn thing still won't open.</TE>
<TE>   According to Skip Eckert, president of the Safe and Vault
Technicians Assn., there are half a dozen top safecrackers in the
country and Richardson is one of them. "He's one of our elite
members," Eckert says. "It takes about 10 years working steady to get
as good as he is. You can't fake it in this job, you either get it
open or you don't. Dave has never walked away from a safe."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's friends, mostly other safecrackers, call him Beast
because he's a big man and because he will get into the safe no
matter what it takes. Yes, he can manipulate a combination lock--coax
the combination out by feeling the clicks through his fingers,
calibrating the distances and making a mental image of the lock's
interior--but he says he rarely does this. "Sure, it looks fancy when
you do it," he says, "but most of the time it takes too long. And
why? I can drill into most safes so that you'll never know I was
there in half the time."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let him fool you," says Eckert, who holds the Guinness Book
record for lock manipulation--3 minutes, 57 seconds. "He makes out
he's too big and tough to manipulate, but he's one of the best."</TE>
<TE>   The longest it's taken him to crack a safe was a 15 1/2-hour job
on a bank vault, others can take less than five minutes. He is a
licensed specialist and bonded through the association, which means
his fingerprints are on file and he's been vetted by the police. He
says he does not look at the contents of the safes he opens--after
all these years, nothing would surprise him and he doesn't ever want
to have to testify in a court case.</TE>
<TE>   Hands-Off Policy</TE>
<TE>   "Can you get that, man," he says nudging a videocassette that has
dropped out of a gun safe. The young man next to him picks it up and
grins at the triple X marked along its spine. "I never touch any of
the stuff," Richardson says, preparing to repair the lock he has just
broken open.</TE>
<TE>   He is standing near a loading dock at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu
where he was sent by a local locksmith. The ranch owner had bought
the contents of a storage shed, which included this safe. After
surveying the situation, Richardson opens the back of his truck, the
interior of which looks like a small workshop or a surveillance
center. There are cabinets and drawers and satchels and briefcases
and boxes, all of which contain the tools of his trade. Drills with
bits that will go through drill-proof plates; scores of different
picks, many homemade, scopes of all lengths and sophistication, many
of them, essentially, medical equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "This right here is basically what they use when they do a
colonoscopy," he says, patting one case. "Same technology, better
view." He uses these scopes to see into the guts of a safe, to figure
out how many locks there are and how to undo them.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are some industry catalogs that offer the basics,
most of a safecracker's tools are handmade, either by the individual
specialist or one of his colleagues. The tools are always changing,
just as the safes are always changing.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson keeps several metal file boxes full of pictures of
safes he has opened. Some have notes on the back, most do not. "You
do have to be careful," he says. "You don't want to have a 'drill
here' sign lying around. But even if someone found these, they
probably would have no idea how to begin."</TE>
<TE>   At the ranch, Richardson begins by loading a dolly with two cases
and a satchel--a bit bulkier than the Batman-like utility belts movie
safecrackers inevitably wear. The safe is an American Security
Products gun safe, about 6 feet high, with no special markings.
Richardson removes the face of the lock and makes a mark on the metal
beneath it. He drills into the mark, first with a regular bit, and
then with the drill-proof bit. The hole is about the size of a
woman's little finger and into it he threads one of his shorter
scopes. Now he can see the innards of the lock. Within a minute or
two of this, less than 10 since he approached the safe, he has swung
the door open.</TE>
<TE>   "There it is," he says, and the videotapes fall to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In about 20 minutes, he takes the lock out of the door, repairs
the hole--he is a bonded welder too--puts the lock back in and resets
the combination. He chooses the new number by rolling a set of
10-sided blue dice on the floor. He writes the numbers on a slip of
paper and hands them to the young man. "Don't lose that," Richardson
tells him, "because I don't keep copies and I forget the combos as
soon as I write them down."</TE>
<TE>   He works with many local locksmiths--that was how he got into the
safecracking business. "I had low SATs," he says when asked why he
became a safecracker. Out of high school, he did a stint as a repo
man, then got work with a locksmith in downtown L.A. After a while,
he decided to learn more about safes. "I met a man who worked--well,
I'm not sure what agency he worked for but he basically broke into
safes overseas for the government--and he taught me a lot about the
high-security stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The community of top safecrackers is understandably guarded. To
get a name in the field, you have to prove staying power and then,
says Richardson, you have to pull a stunt, something that hasn't been
done. His was a bank vault that, for reasons that were legal but he'd
rather not disclose, had to be opened with no trace of a break in. He
did it and one of his colleagues wrote it up for a trade magazine.
After that, he was a made man.</TE>
<TE>   It's a small world, safecracking. There are several organizations,
but the Safe and Vault Technicians Assn., with 1,800 members
worldwide, is the largest. There's a magazine and an annual
conference, at which there are lock-picking and manipulation contests
as well as workshops. While it would seem a natural staging ground
for a member of a heist team, both Richardson and Eckert say that the
nature of the work precludes a thief from cribbing. "You have to have
a very high level of basic knowledge and time in the field to even
know what we're talking about," says Eckert.</TE>
<TE>   Head of His Class</TE>
<TE>   Richardson is very aware that his career is only as good as his
reputation--everything has to be above board. "I have people call me
saying, 'I've got this safe and I, uh, lost the combination, can I
bring it out to you?' And I say, 'Sure, if you have a federal warrant
or proof of ownership.' That's usually as far as it goes. No job's
worth extradition papers," he adds, flipping open his cell phone,
which rings about every five minutes. "This is Dave."</TE>
<TE>   One of the many calls he receives on the day he opens the safe at
the ranch is from a Michigan locksmith named Mike England. Richardson
occasionally teaches classes at the annual association conferences
and he also will do one-on-one training with members who come
well-recommended. It isn't cheap--$350 a day--but England, who
trained with Richardson for a week a few months ago felt he benefited
so much that when his wife asked what he wanted for his birthday he
said "another week with Dave."</TE>
<TE>   "It changed my life," England says over the phone. "I've been a
locksmith for 10 years and safes scared me. Everyone said if you're
serious about learning to open safes, you have to call him. He's the
man."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing about the job that still bugs Richardson is the
shock some people express at what he charges. "They're asking me to
fix a $1,500 safe or get them access to their precious belongings and
they don't think they should have to pay a few hundred dollars. I
say, 'Fine, call someone else.' " He lights up another cigarette--he
is going to quit in just two days, he says. "Of course, chances are,
that someone else will just screw the job up and eventually they'll
be calling me back."</TE>

<LD>"Mom, can I take care of Nadia's pet mouse, Cherry Eyes, while she
and her parents go away for a week?" Annette and her friend Nadia
looked eager.</LD>
<LD>   Annette's mother's eyes became huge.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll bring his food, Mrs. Sherman; he's really tame," Nadia said.</LD>
<TE>   "But Annette, a mouse!"</TE>

<TE>   Mother smiled with embarrassment. "I did say that but ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Cherry Eyes isn't dirty, Mrs. Sherman. He is a domestic mouse and
hasn't been outside to catch any germs. I change his litter and wash
his cage every week."</TE>

cats are. If the mouse got out of his cage ... well, you know."</TE>

<TE>   "He's so cute, Mom, a teensy tiny, little miniature animal with
all the same parts as big ones."</TE>
<TE>   Nadia reached into her jacket pocket and Mom jumped at the sight
of the mouse. He was snow white with cherry red eyes!</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. today will launch a revamped version of its high-end
data-storage machine called Shark.</LD>
<LD>   IBM, which is fighting for market share in the highly competitive
data-storage sector against the likes of EMC Corp. and Hitachi Data
Systems, said the entry-level price on the new machine remains about
$400,000.</LD>
<LD>   It begins shipping in volume on Aug. 16.</LD>
<TE>   The company said the new version of Shark is the first major
upgrade to the data-storage system, which is used for high-volume
transaction processing and to store large databases of information,
since it was introduced in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   IBM expects to gain market share against EMC with the new version
of Shark, said Linda Sanford, group executive for the Storage Systems
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford said the new version of Shark is part of an overall
refresh of its storage products and that it includes technology that
cuts down on administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford also said the company's new storage software called
Storage Tank, which has been in the works since 2000, will be
released in 2003 as planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We are definitely on track," Sanford said.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. has failed to persuade a judge to dismiss
most of a $4-billion lawsuit by NorthPoint Communications Group Inc.
that accuses the largest U.S. local-telephone company of unfairly
abandoning a takeover.</LD>
<LD>   A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge rejected Verizon's bid
to throw out claims of fraud and punitive damages totaling as much as
$3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   NorthPoint sued Verizon in November 2000 after the New York-based
phone company scrapped plans to acquire the high-speed Internet
provider for an estimated $2.15 billion.</LD>
<TE>   NorthPoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection weeks later
in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling by Judge James McBride clears the way for a California
jury to begin hearing San Francisco-based NorthPoint's lawsuit on
July 29.</TE>

<HD>The Big Picture for TV</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The networks trot out their lineups and
discuss the industry's prospects at critics' conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major changes in network television--shrinking audiences, rising
production costs, money-losing sports deals and the growing threat of
digital video recorders that allow viewers to skip commercials--are
forcing TV executives to hunt for new ways to make money.</LD>
<LD>   What those solutions might be is still up for debate. But it's too
early to write an obituary for the networks, CBS President and Chief
Executive Leslie Moonves told reporters and members of the Television
Critics Assn. on Sunday at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a changing world, but broadcast television is still the best
game in town," Moonves said.</LD>
<TE>   Although cable networks have drawn millions of viewers from
broadcast networks, the six major networks--NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox
Broadcasting, UPN and the WB--all managed to boost their advertising
rates this year. The major networks still account for more than 55%
of all television viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Millions more viewers turn to broadcast networks than the
top-rated cable networks, Moonves said, adding that evening network
news programs on CBS, NBC and ABC draw an average of 30 million
viewers a night while prime-time cable news programs pull in about 3
million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the television critics' annual summer event--in which the
networks trot out their new fall lineups, stars and producers--is
unfolding this year against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. Only
two broadcast networks--NBC and CBS--are expected to turn a profit
this year. General Electric's NBC, which finished the season in first
place in the ratings, expects more than $500 million in profit from
the network; CBS, owned by Viacom Inc., expects network profit this
year to top $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook is more gloomy for ABC and Fox Broadcasting. News
Corp., which owns Fox, was forced in February to write off $909
million in losses from its Fox broadcasts of professional football,
Major League Baseball and NASCAR racing. Fox will start the season in
September without the help of two of its longtime favorites, "The
X-Files" and "Ally McBeal." The network plans to air 10 new
prime-time programs.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co., also is rebuilding its schedule
after a humiliating season in which the previous powerhouse network
finished fourth in prime time among viewers ages 18 to 49--the
demographic most valued by advertisers. ABC is launching nine new
prime-time shows.</TE>
<TE>   The two youngest networks--the WB network and Viacom-owned
UPN--have not made any money for their parent companies. Moonves, who
took over the UPN network earlier this year, would not say when UPN
is expected to turn a profit. The WB network should make money this
year, said Jamie Kellner, chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System.
The WB network is 75% owned by AOL Time Warner, with the remainder
owned by Tribune Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this fall, the WB will experiment with "multi-plays."
The network plans to broadcast two shows twice a week, initially on
weeknights during prime time and again on Sunday evening.
Broadcasting shows more than once a week has worked for HBO, which
often airs its hit shows, such as "The Sopranos," more than once a
week, Kellner said.</TE>
<TE>   "This industry needs to be rejiggered," Kellner told the
television critics on Saturday, adding that networks are "trapped" by
a decades-old system and schedule. Pilots are shot in the spring to
show advertisers in May in New York, and the year is punctuated by
periods of frenzied competition among networks during the so-called
"sweeps" weeks in November, February, May and July.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate sweeps," Moonves said Sunday during the UPN session. "I
think sweeps are ridiculous. The whole system is an anomaly. It's
more of a station thing," since television stations rely on ratings
measured during the sweeps periods to set their advertising rates.</TE>
<TE>   Kellner also predicted that free commercial TV will become extinct
within five to 10 years because of digital recording devices such as
TiVo. Advertisers would balk at paying high network rates if millions
of viewers automatically zap the commercials. And without
advertisers, the economic underpinnings of network television would
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' Moonves was more upbeat, saying digital video recorders will
not spell "the death of television." A recent report showed that
digital recorders are in about 1% of U.S. homes, and, of those, 70%
are used to bypass commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "The penetration [of digital recorders] is so minor that it is not
affecting us one iota," Moonves said.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves acknowledged that new technologies and higher production
costs are forcing networks to explore new revenue streams, such as
product placement in shows. Moonves said that though he enjoyed one
of this summer's hit movies--"Minority Report," starring Tom
Cruise--"it was like a commercial every 30 seconds....</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want Buffy [Sarah Michelle Gellar of 'Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'] to be eating M&amp;Ms. We think that would be wrong."</TE>

<HD>Big 3 Bested in Quality Study</HD>
<DH>Autos: Japanese and German companies outpace U.S. rivals in
a survey of consumers' ownership experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S.-based auto manufacturers were badly outpaced in a quality survey
in which they should have fared better against their Japanese and
German rivals, according to an industry consultancy planning to
release its findings today.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign-based auto makers won or tied for first in 14 of 17
categories in the annual Vehicle Experience Study conducted by San
Diego-based Strategic Vision.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, Ford Motor Co. failed to score a single first place
in the survey, and its Big Three rivals General Motors Corp. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group topped or tied for first in only
four vehicle categories.</LD>
<TE>   The survey of 46,900 buyers of model year 2002 cars and trucks
examined the quality of the total ownership experience beyond the
presence or absence of reported problems, including such factors as
the dealership experience and vehicle handling and performance.</TE>
<TE>   "This study should be kinder to the domestics because it doesn't
take into account exclusively reliability, where the domestics have
never been able to match the Japanese," said Strategic Vision Vice
President Dan Gorrell. "What's interesting, though, is the paucity of
winners from Detroit, and Ford products aren't registering as winners
of any segment."</TE>
<TE>   The study, in its eighth year, surveyed owners who bought their
new cars or trucks in October or November and had their vehicles at
least three months. They were asked questions about 75 facets of
their ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the major auto makers were unavailable for
comment Sunday. Manufacturers tend to watch such surveys closely,
however, whether to identify areas of improvement in future model
years or to claim bragging rights in the hyper-competitive U.S.
market.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese companies dominated the Strategic Vision results, with
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Toyota and Lexus brands winning or tying for
first in six of the 17 vehicle categories, Honda Motor Co. taking
three and Nissan Motor Co. one.</TE>
<TE>   "Toyota is the big winner--again," Gorrell said. "They get it
right in both fewer problems and overall product experience. And they
are doing very well in trucks. Detroit, watch out."</TE>
<TE>   Among major German manufacturers, Volkswagen  won or tied for
first in three categories and BMW won two.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors and Chrysler Group each placed first in two
categories.</TE>
<TE>   GM's top finishers were the GMC Envoy, which tied for first place
among mid-size sport utility vehicles with the Toyota 4Runner, and
the Oldsmobile Aurora, which topped the field among larger cars.</TE>
<TE>   For Chrysler Group, the Chrysler PT Cruiser came out on top among
compact cars, and the Dodge Dakota won among compact pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   With respect to actual problems reported in new vehicles--which
can include imperfect paint jobs, wire connections breaking loose or
complaints about wind noise or a radio not receiving a channel
well--some of the category winners were not leaders in their
segments.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the BMW X5, which came in at No. 1 among luxury
SUVs, scored below average for problems, as did the GMC Envoy and
Oldsmobile Aurora and VW's Golf, Beetle and Passat.</TE>
<TE>   But when taken as a whole, the quality of the ownership experience
took those vehicles to the top of their categories, Gorrell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Quality defined more broadly can encompass, for some vehicles,
less-than-perfect performance," he said. "Reliability is important
because it's the starting point, but you have to deliver more. The
overall experience can overcome reported problems in a car."</TE>
<TE>   Although no South Korean models took first place in their
categories, Hyundai Motor Co. and its Kia subsidiary have rapidly
improved their scores, which Strategic Vision refers to as the total
quality index.</TE>
<TE>   The Kia Sedona minivan, for instance, scored 845 of a possible
1,000 points on the index, beating out the Chrysler Town and Country,
long a benchmark in that market segment, which scored 836.</TE>
<TE>   "Hyundai continues to make big gains, with Kia sneaking up,"
Gorrell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese and domestics are being squeezed by the Koreans,
whose buyers are reporting experiences right at the top of the pack."</TE>

<HD>Blockbuster Battle Over DVDs</HD>
<DH>The chain dominates the rental market but trails big
retailers in disc sales</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the tapes and DVDs it rents, Blockbuster Inc. always seems to be
living on borrowed time.</LD>
<LD>   Since emerging more than a decade ago as the nation's dominant
video rental chain, Blockbuster has regularly shaken off apocalyptic
predictions, whether they stemmed from antitrust suits or looming
technology that eventually could allow people to call up any movie
they want without rising from their recliners.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout, it has remained the nation's overwhelmingly dominant
video chain, reinvigorated by an internal overhaul and an explosion
in DVD rentals as well as a booming business renting video games.</LD>
<TE>   But fast-forward to Blockbuster's future and things get murkier.
Blockbuster's biggest challenge is shaping up not in courtrooms or
over fiber-optic lines but in the shopping aisles of discounters,
electronics superstores and even drugstores and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Big merchandisers such as Best Buy Co., Circuit City Group,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are
taking dead aim at Blockbuster, trying to muscle their way onto the
shelves of family home entertainment centers by selling DVDs of
"Black Hawk Down" as aggressively as they might sell a new CD by
Eminem or Pink.</TE>
<TE>   Price it low enough--say $17 for a hot, fresh title--and people
may want to spend a few more bucks to own rather than rent a
DVD-quality version of a favorite hit movie such as "Spider-Man" or
"Monsters, Inc." when it is released, especially if it includes
extras such as alternative endings and games.</TE>
<TE>   Studios say owners of DVD players are buying about 15 DVDs a year,
compared with the five videotapes a year that consumers averaged when
that format was at its peak.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the bigger issue for a Blockbuster," said Ben Feingold,
chief of Sony Pictures' Columbia TriStar Home Video unit. Feingold
said Wal-Mart has become the company's biggest account, with
Blockbuster ranking fourth or fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Although Blockbuster is by far the largest video rental chain, it
ranks ninth among DVD sellers. According to estimates from Video
Store Magazine, DVD sales totaled $905.5 million last year at leader
Wal-Mart and $746.6 million at No. 2 Best Buy, while Blockbuster's
total was $160 million.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City announced recently that it is dumping videotapes
altogether for DVDs. Best Buy has reconfigured its stores to carry a
broad selection of films. And stores have found DVDs make good "loss
leaders"--products priced dirt cheap to get people into stores, where
they presumably will buy other things.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Blockbuster and its majority owner, Viacom Inc., said
they recognize the challenge and vow to adapt, although they question
whether the general merchandise and electronics stores will remain
competitors when the current hyper-growth driven by the sale of DVD
players inevitably eases.</TE>
<TE>   "Blockbuster is principally in the movies business," Viacom
President Mel Karmazin said. "Places like Best Buy and Wal-Mart sell
DVDs when they think it generates foot traffic. If they could make
more money selling thimbles, they'd replace all the DVDs with
thimbles."</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy Product Manager Peggy Munnagle called the notion that the
company uses DVDs only to lure customers into the stores
"ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "That's only accurate for the newest of new releases," she said.
"Everything else we aim to make money on. We plan to be in the
business for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the shift is the explosion in sales of DVD players. Bob
Chapek, president of Walt Disney Co.'s Buena Vista Home Video, said
the studio projects the number of DVD players in homes will double in
four to five years, from 40 million now to about 80 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chapek said that although renting DVDs remains a healthy, vibrant
business, selling them directly to users "is bigger and bigger all
the time," especially now that films are available to buy the same
day they can be rented. During the height of the VHS video boom, many
films were available only for rent before they were offered for sale
at affordable prices.</TE>
<TE>   Because DVDs are cheap to buy from studios, Blockbuster's rental
profit is fat as well. But as the company acknowledged recently in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the competition
from mass merchandisers "has increased consumer interest in
purchasing movies on DVD and has reduced the advantage to home video
retailers" enjoyed when videocassettes were at their zenith.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster Chief Executive John Antioco said he is confident
Blockbuster can remain competitive on both fronts. The chain's 5,300
stores are expanding their selections of DVDs for purchase, while
keeping intact the company's rental program, which accounts for about
84% of its business.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to introduce numerous promotional drives
offering discount packages on rentals and sales. It is experimenting
with other programs, such as a one-time monthly subscription fee with
no late charges that many Blockbuster renters find annoying.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Wal-Mart shopper, I'm not going to stop them from
reaching over and grabbing a movie," Antioco said. "But if someone is
leaving their house for the sole purpose of getting a movie, there
should be no reason why they should go anywhere else but
Blockbuster."</TE>
<TE>   Antioco added that Blockbuster has no plans to scale back its
rental business. To make the point, he quotes a line from one of his
favorite movies, "Godfather II," spoken by gangster Hyman Roth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the business we've chosen," Antioco said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the growing competition, Blockbuster's blue-and-gold
stores are likely to be neighborhood fixtures for years. So dominant
is the company among U.S. video chains that its annual sales are
about 50% higher than the revenue of its next nine competitors
combined.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, video-on-demand technology--which would enable people
to have at their fingertips the equivalent of an electronic video
store--for years was predicted as the Achilles' heel of Blockbuster,
but it remains years away and will require billions of dollars of
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for much of the eight years Viacom has owned Blockbuster,
the company was something of an unwanted stepchild.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom bought the company for $6.4 billion in 1994 from Florida
entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga not because it was enamored with the
video business but because the huge cash flow allowed Viacom Chairman
Sumner Redstone to finance his $10-billion deal to buy Paramount
Communications, parent of Paramount Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after that, Blockbuster turned into what Redstone calls
"a horror story" that was disorganized and specialized in "managed
dissatisfaction" because customers frequently found that the movies
they wanted already were rented.</TE>
<TE>   "People would come in and were told they could take some
20-year-old picture instead," Redstone recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In came Antioco, who put in place a program in which Blockbuster
bought videos at low prices from studios so it could stock more
copies, then shared revenue with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   That deal was the core of an antitrust lawsuit against Blockbuster
and Viacom. The video company argued it competed aggressively but
fairly, and it successfully persuaded a federal judge to scrap the
lawsuit without having to put on a defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I make no apologies for anything," Redstone said.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone and Karmazin said the company has emerged from being a
drain to being a key generator of cash for Viacom. In the first
quarter, Blockbuster earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization--a key Wall Street measure of media companies--rose
a strong 9% to $175 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even though selling DVDs directly to consumers through major
stores is highly profitable for Hollywood (manufacturing costs are
less than $1 a disc), analysts say the rental business is so large
that studios have no choice but to make sure it stays healthy. A
healthy Blockbuster is in their interest, even though the company's
size enables it to throw its weight around in dealing with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Studios have a real love-hate relationship with Blockbuster,"
said Larry Gerbrandt, chief content officer at Kagan World Media, a
research firm. "The part they love is the checks they get from
Blockbuster. The part they hate is that Blockbuster has periodically
tried to use its muscle and leverage."</TE>

<HD>Coca-Cola to Treat Options as Expenses</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The firm's move is intended to boost investor
confidence in the wake of corporate scandals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As corporate accounting scandals continue to roil the stock market,
Coca-Cola Co. on Sunday said it will count employee stock options as
normal business expenses, a move executives hope will boost investor
confidence in the world's largest soft drink company.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, the use of stock options, once considered a
valuable tool to link the interests of corporate executives to those
of shareholders, has been blamed as a potential culprit in the
accounting debacles plaguing corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Critics, including President Bush, have been looking for ways to
rein in the practice of providing top corporate managers with huge
grants of stock options, which give the right to buy company shares
at a set price in the future.</LD>
<TE>   Coca-Cola's decision could put pressure on other major companies
to also adopt the practice of treating options as compensation
expenses. The Atlanta-based company will be just the third member of
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to do so, after Boeing Co. and Winn-Dixie
Stores Inc. Real estate investment trust AMB Property Corp. said last
week it would also begin expensing options.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected today to vote on a far-reaching accounting
reform bill. Democrats are likely to push for an amendment that would
have a new accounting-oversight board study whether stock options
should be expensed.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola said that beginning in the fourth quarter it will treat
employee stock options as a recurring cost on income statements. Net
income this year will be reduced by about 1 cent a share by the
change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about transparency," Coca-Cola's chief financial
officer, Gary Fayard, said in an interview. "This is a new world, and
we need to be as transparent as possible. We're stepping up to the
plate, and we hope the rest of corporate America will follow."</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Coca-Cola's largest
shareholder with an 8% stake and a member of its board, called the
company's accounting change a "classy move," and added that he would
feel "far more comfortable" if other companies followed its lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It provides numbers in terms of earnings to the shareholders that
far more accurately reflect economic reality than the prevailing
system in corporate America," Buffett told Reuters. "It tells the
truth to shareholders about what compensation really costs."</TE>
<TE>   Though stock options have become an increasingly prevalent form of
executive compensation, the vast majority of public companies only
mention the options in a footnote in earnings reports rather than
deduct them from the companies' core finances. If the nation's 500
largest publicly traded companies had counted options as expenses in
2001, their reported earnings would have dropped by 21% on average,
according to a report last week by Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing investors respect right now is companies that are
brutally honest about their financial reporting," said Nell Minow,
editor of the online publication the Corporate Library. Coca-Cola
"sees the writing on the wall. This is something all companies will
eventually have to do, and they probably figure they might as well
get credit by doing it voluntarily."</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, say Coca-Cola's decision is insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   "While I commend Coca-Cola for doing this, having a situation
where some companies expense options while others don't may actually
be worse," said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a certified
public accountant and a member of the House Financial Services
Committee. "All companies should be required to do it so their
financial results can be comparable. That way, investors can tell the
difference between Coke and Pepsi."</TE>
<TE>   Such accounting loopholes have come under greater scrutiny as
lawmakers seek ways to prevent companies from glossing over financial
blemishes.</TE>
<TE>   Though Congress last week blocked a bill sponsored by Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) to force companies to treat stock options as
expenses, lawmakers left open the possibility of revisiting the issue
in September when they plan to address corporate governance
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently commented on the
"significant distortion in reported earnings" of omitting options as
an expense.</TE>
<TE>   But other major players, including Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.), have argued against classifying options as expenses
because doing so would impede economic growth and raise the complex
issue of how to value options.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola said it would use the "fair value" method currently
recommended but not required by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. Fayard estimated that the change will initially reduce annual
earnings by 1 cent per share. Wall Street analysts on average expect
the company to earn $1.79 per share this year, not including the
options expense.</TE>
<TE>   As Coca-Cola's options mature over the years, Fayard expects the
effect to peak at 10 cents a share in 2006 and remain at that level
from there on.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola's shares fell $2.06 to $51.05 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday. The stock has risen 8% this year and is the
leading gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   Options give holders the ability to purchase stock at a
predetermined price.</TE>
<TE>   While this creates an incentive for employees to strive to
increase shareholder value, the options also dilute the value of
shares already owned by investors.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, numerous companies granted stock options to
employees instead of giving them cash bonuses or raises.</TE>
<TE>   Many grew wealthy on such options. At Enron Corp., former Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay exercised $180.3 million in options from 1998 to 2000.
Enron's former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, received $111.7
million. But rank-and-file workers also benefited in the 1990s.
Microsoft Corp.'s stock options, for example, created hundreds of
millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   But accounting for such options today would significantly drag
down the profits reported by hundreds of companies, according to the
Merrill Lynch report.</TE>
<TE>   Technology companies, which have been the most aggressive in
granting options, would be hardest hit, with a 70% decline in
earnings this year if options were expensed. Telecommunications
companies would suffer a 12% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, earnings for the top 500 public companies in the Standard
&amp; Poor's index would decline 10% this year if options were recorded
as costs, according to Merrill Lynch estimates.</TE>

<HD>Insomniac Revels in Independent Status</HD>
<DH>Games: The tiny Burbank studio is undeterred by industry's
big-budget economics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid sweeping consolidation in the video game industry, Insomniac
Games stands out as a relic of a bygone era. The founders of the tiny
Burbank studio are among the last of a disappearing generation of
small independent developers--those who started with a wacky idea, an
itch to do something about it and a couple of like-minded buddies.</LD>
<LD>   But as big publishers snap up studios left and right and small
studios seek the safety of large companies, Insomniac has turned down
three buyout offers in two years. Its three young founders revel in
the hand-to-mouth nature of their enterprise.</LD>
<LD>   "The people who work here came because we're independent," said
Insomniac's chief executive and co-founder, Ted Price, 34. "There's a
pride that comes from knowing we live or die by our decisions, that
we're always on the precipice. The feeling that we're able to choose
our own destiny is very important to people here."</LD>
<TE>   Contributing to the scarcity of small studios are big-budget
economics similar to those in the film industry, which make it harder
for new studios to crop up and replenish the ranks. Today, the notion
of three guys making a game in a garage is pure nostalgia. It can
take millions of dollars and a dozen programmers, artists and
designers to even come up with a demo--a simple prototype of the
actual game, which could end up costing $10 million or more to
develop.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a good deal of industry navel-gazing about whether
innovation will wither in today's rapidly growing--and some would say
more corporate--games industry.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the challenges this industry faces is how to make it
viable for new players to enter this market. Consumers want fresh
blood to push creativity," said Kevin Bachus, a co-founder of Capital
Entertainment Group, which is raising money to start a fund for
projects by independent developers. "But budgets are going crazy, and
the barriers to entry are higher than they've ever been."</TE>
<TE>   Price concurs. Insomniac, he said, could not have been born in
today's environment. "We couldn't have done today what we did eight
years ago," he said. "We wouldn't have survived."</TE>
<TE>   Price founded Insomniac in 1994 with $30,000 in savings and help
from Alex and Brian Hastings, two brothers from South Dakota. Alex
Hastings had just graduated from Princeton University, Price's alma
mater, and was looking for a job. Price, who had been working at his
uncle's medical services business as a controller, wanted to start
his own company. The two hooked up when their mothers, who knew each
other, made the connection.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Hastings then recruited his older brother Brian, then a
programmer for Siemens. The three had one thing in common--they liked
to play "Doom," which at the time was the most popular first-person
shooting game. So with zero experience, they decided to make a
similar game called "Disruptor."</TE>
<TE>   After spending nearly every penny they had on a demo, the three
connected with Mark Cerny, then head of Universal Interactive. Cerny
gave them a $250,000 budget and two years to deliver. The game, which
came out in 1996, wasn't a hit. But it did well enough to earn
Insomniac a contract for another game.</TE>
<TE>   This time the trio came up with "Spyro the Dragon," an
action-adventure game featuring a cute purple dragon. It was an
instant blockbuster. The Spyro series of games, which sold nearly 10
million copies worldwide, continues to bring in handsome royalties
for Insomniac. Price declined to reveal his company's revenue but
says Insomniac has been profitable every year since its inception.</TE>
<TE>   "They're one of the most respected independent studios in the
industry," said Jennifer Olsen, editor of Game Developer magazine in
San Francisco. "Part of it is their track record. Every game they've
made has done extremely well. Part of it is that they're just a bunch
of really nice guys. You don't hear the kind of smack about them that
you hear about other studios. They just seem very together."</TE>
<TE>   Back when Insomniac got its start, sleepless nights, an endless
supply of junk food and harmless pranks were the staples of the
independent game developer life.</TE>
<TE>   That much hasn't changed. Insomniac revels in its size, or lack
thereof. Birthdays are posted on a common calendar. Visitors often
are introduced to everyone in the studio--all 40 people. It's a tour
that can take an hour.</TE>
<TE>   What's new are the babies, fancy cars and mortgages that have
sprouted as the company--and the industry--blossomed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. game software market more than doubled from $3 billion in
sales in 1994, when Price entered the business, to $6.4 billion last
year. At the same time, game development budgets underwent a similar
spurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years ago, production budgets were routinely under $1
million, and development teams were maybe three to five people,"
Bachus said. "Now you regularly see teams of 30 people and budgets
that average $4 million to $7 million. The cost and complexity of
games are such that it's become very difficult for a couple of guys
to just start a company."</TE>
<TE>   As game budgets spike, so have risks. Add marketing, advertising
and distribution costs, and a single title can easily represent a
$20-million investment. With that kind of money, publishers are loath
to back development teams that are untried. Instead, they turn
to--and purchase--studios that have good track records. For studios,
a sale is a way to realize a cash windfall or a means to continue to
make games without worrying about whether their next title is a hit.
Other studios seek the financial safety net of a large company.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to be six people, all single kids who hung out together
until 4 a.m.," said Jason Rubin, president and founder of Santa
Monica-based Naughty Dog, an independent studio until 2000 when it
was purchased by Sony Corp. "Now we have 17 babies among us. There
are lives here, and I wanted to make sure everyone's taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   Though Naughty Dog, which created the "Crash Bandicoot" series of
games, had enough cash in the bank to fund four years of expenses,
Rubin said the risks were becoming too high.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a lot more at stake now," Rubin said. "And I wanted
to leverage the past against the future."</TE>
<TE>   So did Black Box Games in Vancouver, British Columbia; Rainbow
Studios in Phoenix; Bungie Studios in Redmond, Wash.; Outrage
Entertainment in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Neversoft Entertainment in
Calabasas; and a slew of other studios that recently sold themselves
to large publishers. This year alone, Activision Inc. in Santa Monica
has spent $30.9 million in cash and stock to buy three
studios--Z-Axis Ltd., Shaba Games and Gray Matter Interactive.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, those at Insomniac like their independence.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can come in and tell us what to do," said Brian Hastings,
31. "In the end, we decide."</TE>

<HD>Investors' Attention Will Be on Earnings</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: As reporting season moves into high gear, S&amp;P
500 companies are expected to show modest growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors may decide this week whether improving corporate earnings
pack enough punch to warrant higher stock prices--or at least not
lower prices.</LD>
<LD>   Second-quarter earnings will dominate the business headlines this
week, as the reporting season kicks into high gear.</LD>
<LD>   Operating earnings for the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
companies, in total, are expected to show modest year-over-year
growth in the second quarter, according to Thomson First Call and
other earnings trackers.</LD>
<TE>   That would be the first increase since the fourth quarter of
2000--testimony to the severity of the profit crunch brought on by
last year's recession, even though by many other measures it was one
of the mildest recessions in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Major companies expected to report results this week include IBM,
Intel, Apple Computer, Citigroup, Bank of America, Merck and Eli
Lilly.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market has been weighed down for the last two months by
the wave of corporate financial scandals. Major market indexes,
including the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite, last week fell to
five-year lows. The Dow industrials sank 7.4% last week, the biggest
one-week decline since the markets reopened after the September
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow closed Friday at 8,684.53 and is down 13.3% year to date.
The S&amp;P 500, at 921.39 Friday, is down 19.8% this year, and the
Nasdaq index, at 1,373.50, is down 29.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Second-quarter profit reports should at least remind investors
that the economy is growing again, analysts note.</TE>
<TE>   But after two years of relentless declines in the share prices of
many firms, investors are more sensitized to stock valuations. And by
historical yardsticks, the average blue-chip stock's
price-to-earnings ratio remains above average, despite the long bear
market.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 P/E, based on operating earnings estimates for this
year, still is about 19, according to Thomson First Call. The
historical average is about 14.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to see a lot of earnings now" to justify stock prices
at current levels, said Richard Bernstein, investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But he expects the recovery in profits to be "muted and
elongated," for a number of reasons: lack of corporate pricing power,
rising wages, weak demand in many industries and the accounting
conservatism many companies may adopt in the aftermath of the
financial scandals.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, the dollar's slump against the euro and the
yen in recent months is expected to help earnings of U.S. exporters.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "companies have cut costs dramatically, as reflected in huge
write-offs in 2001 and strong productivity growth," said Edward
Kerschner, strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. "Even some
companies with dismal sales are posting big earnings gains thanks to
cost cutting."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Thomson First Call research chief Chuck Hill warns
investors against becoming too optimistic, even if second-quarter
results are substantially better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Earnings in the third and fourth quarters likely will fall far
short of the very ambitious expectations" of analysts, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' average estimate for the year-over-year gain in
blue-chip companies' third-quarter earnings recently stood at 16.5%,
Hill said. Expectations for the fourth quarter stood at a 28.8% gain.
But those estimates have been declining rapidly in recent weeks as
analysts reconsider the economy's growth potential in the second
half, given the slowdown in the second quarter in key sectors.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Not Hot on Music Promotion System</HD>
<DH>Media: Firm's president discusses its dispute with record
companies and consolidation issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas family that runs Clear Channel Communications Inc. has
taken the music industry by storm, transforming itself into the
dominant force in radio and live entertainment through a series of
multibillion-dollar deals that pulled together 1,200 radio stations
and more than 100 concert venues.</LD>
<LD>   But just two years after the station-buying frenzy pushed Clear
Channel's stock price to nearly $100 a share, the Mays family is
taking fire from the record industry and Congress for engineering an
unprecedented consolidation and allegedly abusing its power to
extract money from music labels. Amid the controversy and a weak
stock market, company shares have plummeted about 30% since the
beginning of the year, closing Friday at $33.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The major record companies are calling for limits on independent
promoters, the middlemen paid by labels to push songs to radio
programmers. Federal law bars broadcasters from accepting money or
other compensation for airplay of specific songs without disclosing
the payment, and critics say the independent promotion system
improperly sidesteps the rules. Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) has
introduced a bill that would restrict record promotion payments and
revoke the license of any station that uses its cross-ownership of
concert-promotion companies to strong-arm artists or rivals.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview last week at the company's San Antonio
headquarters, Clear Channel's 38-year-old president, Mark Mays, son
of company founder Lowry Mays, talked about the prospects for his
company and his showdown with the major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You shocked the music business two years ago when you
bought live entertainment giant SFX for $4.4 billion. But your stock
began losing momentum when you announced the deal. Your competitors
believe SFX founder Robert Sillerman sold you a bill of goods. Do you
still think buying SFX was a good idea?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Sure. I have to laugh because Wall Street, when we made
the deal, said, "Well, this isn't a synergistic business." Here we
are two years later and we have all these people screaming, "Wait a
second. This is too much market power. You shouldn't be able to own
all of these different assets." The truth is probably right in the
middle somewhere. It works well with our existing assets. At the same
time, it's certainly not a monopolistic practice.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your family is friendly with the president, and the Justice
Department's antitrust chief used to be a lawyer for you. Do you
expect to receive special treatment from the Federal Communications
Commission or the Justice Department with George W. Bush in the White
House?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. If you look at the FCC, we talk to the FCC every single
day. They know everything we do. If you talk to the Department of
Justice, every single acquisition ... we sat down with the Justice
Department and we went through every single aspect of them. [The
Justice Department has] been in and out of this company. Do we expect
to be dealt with fairly in Washington? Sure. If we were doing
something that was illegal, then people should come investigate us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Perhaps the touchiest issue facing your company is your
relationship with independent promoters. The promoters pay you fees
that are not supposed to be tied to airplay of specific songs. Your
company says it is simply selling music research and playlist
information but not airplay.</TE>
<TE>   A: We didn't think this up ourselves. They came to us and said,
"Hey, listen. We want to buy research from you, buy all these
different things and represent you to the record companies, and we'll
pay you this amount of money." We said, "Well, sure, there's nothing
wrong with that. It has nothing to do with any of our playlists." As
a fiduciary obligation to our shareholders, we said it's a sound
business practice; we will take the money.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can these promoters get songs added to your playlists?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. The money is not to promote songs. There's always somebody
out there who is trying to push a record. It's not our job to play
what records they want us to play. It's our job to play what records
the consumers want us to play. If 10% of the songs I play, listeners
don't want to listen to, all of a sudden I lose 10 million listeners
across all of our stations. I have $3 billion in revenue in radio. If
I get a 10% slippage across that, that's a huge problem for me.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies have a whole different approach. They
couldn't care less if we had 110 million listeners or 100 million
listeners. They'd rather us have slippage and play all of their
records.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much do you receive, in total, from these promoters per
year?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've seen reports that it's between $10 million and $13 million
a year, and that's probably in the ballpark. People think that we are
going to let independent promoters influence our playlists by
payments of that magnitude? When I'm risking $3 billion by not giving
the consumers what they want? The math doesn't work. We may be hicks
from San Antonio, but we ain't that dumb.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently met in New York with top executives from the major
record companies and told them that if they wanted to cease paying
independent promoters, they should. Why would you want them to stop?</TE>
<TE>   A: We don't think it is an efficient mechanism for them to promote
their products. They're just not efficient marketers at this point.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why are you willing to deal with congressional scrutiny, a
fight with the record industry and a controversy that may be trimming
billions of dollars off your market capitalization over $13 million
in revenue? Is it because that money goes straight to your bottom
line?</TE>
<TE>   A: We've encouraged the record companies not to make these
payments. I told them, "Please, don't make the payments." Why they
continue to make the payments, I have no idea. But you know what? If
we don't take that money the way that we're taking it, it scares me
to death what they're going to pay and how they're going to try to
influence people. We want the record companies to stop trying to
influence and make payments to independent promoters. We're going to
take the money as long as they're willing to pay it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some of the executives you spoke with told you they feared that
if they ceased paying independent promoters, some of their rivals
might not and therefore could receive some small edge in obtaining
airplay for their songs, or that the promoters could retaliate by
keeping their songs off the air.</TE>
<TE>   A: I think they are a paranoid group. I said, "Grow up." It seems
to me, if they're that insecure about their own business, they have
some real business issues. They need to make some tough decisions.
Get on with it. The record labels are sitting here with a very old
business model that is going to be very difficult to reinvent. And
they're lashing out instead.</TE>
<TE>   They have come to Congress and they have said, "Please prevent us
from paying these independent promoters." How about just not signing
a check, have you thought about that? You got to go to Congress to
prevent yourselves from signing a check? I mean, we're not that inept
at being able to run our business.</TE>
<TE>   And then they scream about radio consolidation. Here's a
business--radio--where the top 10 companies account for 44% of radio
revenue. The top five companies in the record business, 85%. They
scream about consolidation. That's the pot calling the kettle black.</TE>
<TE>   Q: As part of your efforts to cross-promote using your various
assets, Clear Channel stations are creating more station-sponsored
events, such as KIIS-FM's Wango Tango in Los Angeles or Z-100's
Zootopia concert in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A: Will the number of radio shows increase? My guess is yes. The
artists love doing it because they don't have to do as long a show.
They can get in front of a big audience, [and] they get promoted on
the radio station, which is a big benefit to them. Overall, it's a
good model.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has anyone at the company threatened an artist that if they
didn't appear at a particular show of yours, they wouldn't receive
airplay or exposure?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. It would shock me if someone did. You cannot take any
compensation for threatening airplay. We're just not going to do
that. The integrity of our playlist is the golden goose. We're not
going to cook the golden goose. We don't alter our playlist based
upon who comes to those events.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think consolidation and the increasing financial
pressure in radio have made programmers shy away from taking chances
on new music?</TE>
<TE>   A: There's no question that people are focused on making sure they
give consumers what they want to hear. Are they less willing to take
a risk? I'm not sure if they're less willing, but they're going to
make dang sure they're not going to put at risk the consumers'
listening habits. If that means taking fewer risks, maybe they are. I
don't know. We just don't want people to have a reason to tune out of
a station.</TE>

<HD>Hearing Will Examine Orbitz Ticket Venture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A House subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing this week to air
competition concerns about Orbitz, the online ticket venture owned by
five major U.S. airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing, before a subcommittee of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, was being billed as "an examination of
supplier-owned online travel sites."</LD>
<LD>   It comes at a time when antitrust enforcers at the Justice
Department are scrutinizing the ticket venture and complaints that it
could thwart competition in the online travel business.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the committee said lawmakers have not yet worked
out details about who will testify.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics of Orbitz include travel agents and online rivals
such as Expedia Inc. and Sabre Holdings Corp., the owner of the
Travelocity Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the Department of Transportation issued an inconclusive
report on Orbitz, the third-most-visited travel site.</TE>
<TE>   The agency cited no anti-competitive fallout from Orbitz, but it
said the ticket venture potentially could have a negative effect on
airline competition.</TE>
<TE>   The agency balked at reaching any "definitive" conclusions because
of the Justice Department's continuing probe.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines, Continental Airlines Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and
Northwest Airlines Corp., Orbitz has been accused of having an unfair
advantage by rival online services.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agents sold $63 billion in airline tickets in 2001.
Web-based services accounted for $24 billion in ticket sales, and
their market share is growing because of discounts and convenience.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Emphasize Economy's Strengths</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush plans this week to emphasize strengths in the economy,
such as low inflation and interest rates, after U.S. stock indexes
slid last week to their lowest levels since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Bush will stress that "the economy is fundamentally sound" during
a round-table discussion today on the economy at the University of
Alabama, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. It's part of an
effort to reassure investors and financial markets, which continued
to tumble last week after Bush traveled to Wall Street and promised
to crack down on accounting lapses at U.S. companies.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's promise to improve corporate behavior won little support
from his congressional opponents.</LD>
<TE>   About half of Americans, or 51%, approve of the way Bush is
responding to accounting lapses at U.S. companies, and 32%
disapprove, according to a Newsweek poll conducted July 11 and 12.
Twenty-one percent of Americans think the economy is in good shape,
the poll said.</TE>

<HD>Germany Offers New Telekom CEO Candidate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The German government revived over the weekend its stumbling campaign
to oust Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Ron Sommer by fielding a
replacement candidate well-placed to win key trade union backing.</LD>
<LD>   A source familiar with the situation said Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's center-left government, which controls 43% of Europe's
largest telecommunications company, wants veteran Deutsche Telekom
manager Gerd Tenzer to take over the reins from Sommer.</LD>
<LD>   "Tenzer will be proposed to the supervisory board on Tuesday," the
source told Reuters.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the Finance Ministry nor Tenzer were available for
comment. A Telekom source said Sommer, under fire for a costly
expansion policy and a tumbling share price, would not step down
voluntarily, signaling a showdown at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Telekom said Sommer could be invited to Tuesday's
supervisory board meeting, which management usually does not attend.</TE>
<TE>   Long criticized by investors, Sommer lost government backing after
he became a political liability once the opposition turned the dismal
performance of widely held Telekom shares into a campaign issue for
the national election in September.</TE>

<HD>Fed Chief to Speak Before Congress Panels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street will be looking for soothing words this week from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed chief goes before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday
and the House Banking Committee on Wednesday to deliver his
semiannual economic report to Congress.</LD>
<LD>   He is expected to paint a relatively upbeat picture of the
economy, analysts say. He will almost certainly be asked about the
stock market's woes and could try to offer some encouragement to
beleaguered investors--without taking a stand on whether stocks are
overpriced or underpriced.</LD>
<TE>   Experts note that the Fed's ability to help the market is severely
constrained. The central bank's interest rate cuts last year left its
benchmark short-term rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%. Few economists
believe the Fed will cut rates further, even if the economy appears
to be slowing or even if the stock market keeps sliding in the near
term.</TE>
<TE>   To cut rates at this point could suggest the Fed is panicked about
the economy and would raise comparisons with the situation in Japan.
The Bank of Japan years ago reduced rates to near-zero levels but has
yet to see those rates generate sustained strong economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan also may be asked about the dollar's slump this year
against the euro, the yen and other currencies. Fed and Bush
administration officials have painted the dollar's decline as
overdue, given the currency's strength in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But with the dollar at a two-year low against the euro and a
nine-month low against the yen, losses are mounting for foreign
investors who hold U.S. assets, especially stocks. If the dollar's
weakness makes foreigners less willing to invest in U.S. assets, it
could eventually fuel a capital crisis in the economy, because of the
nation's heavy dependence on foreign money.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navistar International Corp. reached a settlement with the Canadian
Auto Workers union, ending a strike at an Ontario truck factory where
workers walked out a month and a half ago.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the two-year agreement weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   About 645 striking workers of CAW Local 127 will vote today,
according to a statement by Navistar, the world's fourth-largest
truck maker.</LD>
<TE>   Workers began the strike June 1 after Navistar and the CAW failed
to agree on $14 million in wage concessions and other cuts at the
Chatham, Ontario, heavy-duty-truck plant. Talks ran through the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The company said last week that the strike was having little
effect on its production, since it was on track to boost production
at a lower-cost factory in Escobedo, Mexico, to about 58 trucks a day
by the end of the month from 31 before the strike.</TE>

<HD>Study: Cuba Travel a Benefit to U.S. Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lifting the ban on Americans traveling to Cuba would boost the U.S.
economy by as much as $1.6 billion annually and create up to 23,000
jobs each year, according to a study to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The report, conducted by consulting firm Brattle Group, analyzed
the economic effect of the United States' lifting the travel
restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   The study's release coincides with a renewed effort this week by
members of the House to lift the travel ban.</LD>
<TE>   About 3 million Americans would visit Cuba each year if travel
restrictions to Cuba were eliminated, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for U.S. air travel to Cuba would rise, boosting profits of
American airlines by as much as $415 million a year, said Dorothy
Robyn, an economic consultant for Brattle Group.</TE>
<TE>   If the travel ban were lifted, more than 15,000 new jobs would be
created in the airline industry, and about 7,000 jobs would open up
in the cruise industry annually, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the Center for International Policy, a
nonprofit group that wants the U.S. to lift the travel ban and to end
the 40-year-old trade embargo with the Communist-ruled island nation.</TE>
<TE>   Some House lawmakers are expected to offer an amendment to the
Treasury Department's annual spending bill this week that would cut
funding used by the department's Office of Foreign Asset Control to
enforce the travel embargo.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and Russia Near Agreement on Poultry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States and Russia are nearing a deal on resolving a
poultry trade dispute, with negotiations possibly concluding as early
as this week, a U.S. government official with knowledge of the matter
said.</LD>
<LD>   Russia has imposed an Aug. 1 deadline for new safety certification
standards for imports of U.S. poultry. Shipments from the United
States were halted last week because Moscow and Washington had not
reached agreement on details for the safety certificates and there
was no guarantee that U.S. product could reach Russia before Aug. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The official cautioned that there have been disappointments in the
past in getting Russia to reopen its market to U.S. chicken and
turkey.</LD>
<TE>   Russia has been a large buyer of U.S. poultry, purchasing $640
million worth of mostly inexpensive dark meat in 2001. Russia banned
U.S. poultry for a month this year, citing concerns over the safety
of the U.S. meat.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. industry repeatedly has criticized Russia, saying it
simply was trying to protect its domestic poultry producers. In
recent weeks, U.S. industry officials have withheld comment at the
request of the U.S. government, according to sources.</TE>

<HD>Low-Key Retreat for Media Moguls</HD>
<DH>Deals: Accounting scandals, declining stock market put a
damper on investment banker Herb Allen's gathering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment banker Herb Allen's 20th annual retreat for media moguls
in Sun Valley, Idaho, ended Saturday with attendees noting it was one
of the most low-key events in years.</LD>
<LD>   The closed gathering took place against a backdrop of accounting
scandals, bankruptcy filings and a declining stock market. According
to one attendee, "It's hard to get too excited about anything after
watching a trillion dollars evaporate out of the market."</LD>
<LD>   Besides the usual corporate presentations, the retreat included
atypical topics for the gathering of business moguls--an
off-the-record discussion about terrorism led by CIA chief George
Tenet and one about the situation in the Middle East with remarks by
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.</LD>
<TE>   The retreat is best known as a place where corporate heavyweights
can schmooze in a relaxing atmosphere and away from the eyes of the
media.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting has been the place where many future deals first take
shape.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more interesting pairings seen at the conference was
Barry Diller, head of Vivendi Universal's entertainment properties,
and Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, which led to rumors
throughout the week that a deal may be in the making between
Vivendi's USA Interactive division and the Internet bookseller,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Sources noted it was not surprising that ousted Vivendi CEO
Jean-Marie Messier, who was scheduled to give a presentation, was a
no-show.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those in attendance said the week's highlights included a
talk by Unilever's Niall Fitzgerald and a very upbeat presentation by
Meg Whitman, CEO of EBay Inc., who noted that the Internet auctioneer
has been successful in penetrating every market but Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman noted that competitor Yahoo Inc. arrived in Japan first
and it has thwarted EBay's efforts to make inroads there. But she
said the company still hopes to find a way into the Japanese market.</TE>
<TE>   "The undercurrent of it was not lost on any of us. It's one of the
only Internet success stories," one attendee said.</TE>

<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC International, an
organization of more than 7,000 business owners, company presidents

their business experiences and help one another solve problems in a
round-table session. The following question and answer are a summary

outsourcing as a means of reducing costs in nonessential functions.</TE>
<TE>   When done well and with the right vendor, outsourcing can enable
you to reduce operating costs, free up investment dollars, add
resources currently not available to you, gain control over certain
hard-to-manage functions and concentrate on your core business.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve these outcomes, however, you must make sure the
outsourcing relationship is carefully constructed and well-managed
from the get-go.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the contract should answer the standard questions
that arise during any customer/vendor relationship: What specific
products and/or services are to be delivered? How and when will they
be delivered? What are the terms of payment? What forms of redress
will you have if the vendor fails to live up to the agreement?</TE>
<TE>   Because outsourcing relationships involve two companies working
together at a deeper than normal level, the contract also should
answer questions such as: Who in the outsourcing firm has access to
what information in your company? Who has the authority to do what?
What are the potential liabilities, and who has responsibility for
them? How will conflicts be resolved?</TE>
<TE>   The more you can work out these kinds of issues ahead of time, the
better your chances for a mutually beneficial relationship.</TE>
<TE>   When building agreement on how you will work together, don't
forget to address what happens when the relationship comes to an end.
In that respect, your contract also should cover key issues such as
how and when the relationship will terminate, who owns what assets
and how those assets will get allocated when your two firms go their
separate ways.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue commonly overlooked involves your intellectual
property.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the vendor and the function you're outsourcing, the
contract should identify who in the outsourcing firm has access to
your people, technologies and proprietary information; what
intellectual properties are likely to come out of your collaborative
relationship; and who will own the intellectual properties and have
rights and licenses to use them--both during the course of the
relationship and after it ends.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, make sure the contract includes specific targets the
vendor must meet and a system for monitoring and measuring them
throughout the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, the vendor should be willing to assume some financial
risk (usually a portion of the fees) if it does not meet the
agreed-on targets. Plus, the contract should call for regular
meetings to review the measurement process and adjust it if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that any information you provide within the
relationship belongs to you, not the outsourcing vendor. The vendor
simply works with it and recombines it for you. For that reason, you
need to manage the data and keep control at all times. One way to
accomplish this goal is to store and maintain the data on your
internal systems while giving the vendor access within the scope of
very specific functional responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, make sure you set very clear expectations for the
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   To have any chance at success, both sides must be in alignment and
agreement concerning the scope of the project.</TE>
<TE>   By managing the expectations as you move through the outsourcing
process, you dramatically increase the chances for a win-win outcome.</TE>

<HD>Playing the Internet Name Game: Who Rules the Root</HD>
<DH>Books: A Syracuse professor describes how the domain system
works, why it is important and how it has evolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICK JESDANUN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, a warning: "Ruling the Root" isn't what you'd normally
describe as beach reading. The book is dense, packed with acronyms
and technical jargon.</LD>
<LD>   Its author, Syracuse University professor Milton Mueller, admits
as much in this study of how the Internet's domain name system became
an institution--and hence the object of intense lobbying and
maneuvering by corporations and other powerful interests.</LD>
<LD>   "Admittedly, institutionalization is an ugly and seemingly
unexciting word," Mueller writes. "How much more interesting to talk
about the vast amounts of money that can be made from e-commerce or
the exciting new capabilities of information technology."</LD>
<TE>   But as Mueller points out, the domain name system is the root of
the Internet. Without it, there would be no e-commerce or Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   So although intimate knowledge of the root won't make you a hit at
a cocktail party, its importance cannot be overstated. And that is
what makes "Ruling the Root" (MIT Press; $32.95) a worthwhile read.</TE>
<TE>   The domain name system is a set of computers that translates an
Internet address such as "wire.ap.org" into a series of numbers that
identify a specific machine. That translation is key for finding Web
sites and sending e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of domain-name computers exist, but the most important
are the 13 "root" servers that list the Net's 258 domain suffixes,
such as ".com."</TE>
<TE>   Of those 13, one is the master of the masters, the "A" root. The
other 12 make copies from it. So whoever controls the "A" root
essentially controls the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   I initially thought the book was going to be about the Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, the group selected by the
Commerce Department in 1998 to assume oversight of the domain name
system, including what goes into the "A" root.</TE>
<TE>   Since its formation, ICANN has been dogged by questions of
authority and legitimacy. Critics complain that it is too secretive
and favors businesses over individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Much already has been written about this, so I wondered: What more
could be said?</TE>
<TE>   The book surprised me. Not so much for its insights on ICANN but
for its discussions of the Internet's history.</TE>
<TE>   ICANN takes up less than half the book. Mueller, who directs
Syracuse's Graduate Program in Telecommunications and Network
Management, spends the rest of the book tracing the ad-hoc decisions
and informal arrangements that led to today's controversies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it wasn't ICANN that first decided to bypass existing
government structures in setting up procedures for resolving domain
name disputes. The precursor came from Network Solutions Inc., the
company that keeps track of ".com" names.</TE>
<TE>   And that early policy, Mueller says, "routinely produced blatant
injustices."</TE>
<TE>   Even ICANN's predecessors--the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
and the late Jon Postel, who created the domain name system and
informally ran it in the beginning--faced questions of authority and
legitimacy as the Net grew in importance and usage.</TE>
<TE>   They were able to defer some of the tensions but did not eliminate
them.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller also spends a lot of time explaining how the domain name
system works and its importance. It's a good primer for people
curious about Internet mechanics, although the acronyms and jargon
may be too much for beginners.</TE>
<TE>   On ICANN, Mueller doesn't offer that much new. There's not much
that hasn't been said before on trademark rights, accountability,
international representation and other controversies facing the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem stems from the nature of publishing. Mueller
had to submit his final draft a year ago, so he couldn't discuss the
recent debates and ICANN's decision in June to reorganize.</TE>
<TE>   He was afraid to offer remedies that could have been irrelevant by
the time the book came out.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mueller does draw a few conclusions:</TE>
<TE>   * ICANN's basic functions are similar to those that government
regulators perform for broadcast--although it keeps denying that,
Mueller says.</TE>
<TE>   * As the domain name system becomes more of an institution, vested
interests are succeeding in blocking business and technical
innovation, the author believes. So much for the Internet as a
revolutionary force.</TE>
<TE>   If you care about the prospect of losing your rights to a specific
domain name to a trademark holder, this book's for you--perhaps even
on a beach.</TE>

<HD>Not Hard to Find a Reliable Computer</HD>
<DH>Survey: Desktops by Dell and laptops from Apple, HP,
Toshiba and IBM receive good comments in a PC Magazine poll. Among
ISPs, America Online fares worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing worse than a malfunctioning computer--except a bad
machine coupled with lousy technical support.</LD>
<LD>   According to a reliability survey released Thursday by PC
Magazine, this year's least-frustrated consumer owned a laptop made
by Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Toshiba Corp. or IBM
Corp.; a Sony Corp. or Handspring Inc. hand-held computer; or a
desktop made by Dell Computer Corp. or a local "white box" assembler.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the technology sector's troubles, dependability continued
to rise, as it has in most of the 15 years since PC Magazine began
the survey.</LD>
<TE>   "In general, people tend to be pretty happy," said Michael Miller,
the magazine's editor in chief. "About a quarter of all users had an
issue with a desktop, which is still pretty high. In general,
satisfaction with tech support is lower than satisfaction with
reliability."</TE>
<TE>   The poll queried 15,000 readers on questions of dependability, the
quality and frequency of repairs and technical support and their
willingness to buy again from the same company.</TE>
<TE>   Among Internet service providers, folks preferred high-speed
connections over less expensive dial-up service.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case in other surveys, the world's largest Internet
service provider, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online, fared worst,
with customers frustrated by its high price and unreliable
connections. Microsoft Corp.'s MSN dial-up service was next worst.
"AOL did really bad. MSN did just barely better. You wouldn't be
pleased if you were MSN," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Small local dial-up providers won the highest marks, followed by
AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet and EarthLink.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Internet service provider Optimum Online received the best
rating among high-speed ISPs, followed by Road Runner Broadband.</TE>
<TE>   Dell led desktop computer makers, followed closely by no-name
local vendors and Gateway Inc. Dell users reported the fewest repair
requests as well as the largest percentage--31%--of problems to be
solved over the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Desktop brands that fared worst were Compaq, EMachines Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM.</TE>
<TE>   The survey looked at digital cameras and hand-held computers for
the first time. Generally, few cameras needed any repair, with
Polaroid Corp. faring the worst. Cameras are better off being rated
by ease of use and battery life, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   Among hand-helds, users liked those running Palm Inc.'s operating
system better than machines loaded with Microsoft's more complex
Pocket PC software, including the popular Compaq iPaq.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Palm clones by Handspring and Sony were more
appreciated than Palm's own hand-helds. Users were most vexed with
the Linux-fueled Zaurus by Sharp Corp. and organizers made by Psion
and Casio Inc.</TE>
<TE>   There were some anomalies in the survey. For instance, IBM and HP
both scored well on laptops and dismally on desktops. In addition,
HP's printers received the top marks for the 11th straight year.</TE>
<TE>   "IBM, frankly, has not been paying as much attention to desktops
as to notebooks," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq, which merged with Hewlett-Packard this year, received low
marks on desktops, laptops and its hand-held. HP, however, is phasing
out its higher-rated laptop in favor of Compaq's more-recognized
brand. Consumers had little good to say about Acer Inc.'s laptops and
desktops.</TE>
<TE>   Laptop owners phoning technical support stewed longest on hold
when phoning Sony and Compaq--more than 15 minutes, on average. Once
reached, Sony tech support gave an astonishing 34% of its customers
the "runaround," often making them call more than once, the survey
found.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers that followed companies' advice to seek tech support
through a company Web site or by sending e-mail waited an average of
more than 20 hours for a reply.</TE>

<HD>Selby Gives Indians a Grand Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Selby gave the rebuilding Cleveland Indians and their fans some
much-needed excitement Sunday at Jacobs Field.</LD>
<LD>   Selby's grand slam capped Cleveland's six-run ninth inning against
Mariano Rivera as the Indians rallied from seven runs behind to stun
the New York Yankees, 10-7.</LD>
<LD>   "This one came out of nowhere," said shortstop Omar Vizquel, who
has been a part of many dramatic Cleveland comebacks. "But this is
really special because it's the New York Yankees and Mariano Rivera."</LD>
<TE>   Trailing, 7-0, after four innings, the Indians cut it to 7-4
heading into the ninth against Rivera (1-4), who blew his second save
of the series after converting 17 consecutive chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Good teams bounce back from whatever bad defeat they endure and
this is one of the worst," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "This was a
blown save plus."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Magruder's run-scoring groundout and Ellis Burks'
run-scoring double made it 7-6. Rivera then intentionally walked
Thome to load the bases with one out. He struck out pinch-hitter
Travis Fryman, bringing up Selby, who had five homers in 269 career
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "Rivera is simply the best so all I wanted to do was put my bat on
the ball," Selby said. "With him, you know what is coming and still
can't hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Selby nearly won it with a liner down the right-field line that
was foul by less than a foot. On the next pitch, Selby connected for
a drive over the right-field fence for his first homer since June 17,
2001--when he was with Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Tampa Bay 6--Ruben Sierra hit a tiebreaking home run on
the first pitch he saw in the top of the eighth inning to give the
visiting Mariners the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners gave Freddy Garcia a five-run lead after two innings
that the All-Star pitcher couldn't protect. The Devil Rays wiped out
a 6-2 deficit with four runs off Garcia in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Mark Watson (1-0) got two outs for his first career
victory. Kazuhiro Sasaki worked the ninth for his 23rd save in 27
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Oakland 3--Jay Gibbons hit two home runs and had a
career-high five RBIs at Camden Yards as the Orioles ended their
scoring drought to avert a four-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring only one run in the first three games of the series,
the Orioles got to Oakland starter Cory Lidle (2-8), who yielded six
runs in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Boston 5--Eric Hinske hit a game-winning homer in the
bottom of the ninth after connecting for a tying home run in the
seventh at Toronto as the Blue Jays beat the Red Sox for the third
straight time.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske homered off Tim Wakefield in the seventh and hit his 16th
homer on the first pitch from closer Ugueth Urbina (0-4) in the
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Behind, 5-3, in the top of the ninth, Boston's Trot Nixon tied it
with a two-run shot off closer Kelvim Escobar (5-4).</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Detroit 4--Carlos Lee had two homers among his four
hits at Detroit and the White Sox took advantage of a throwing error
to end a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Lee hit solo shots in the third and fifth innings to give the
White Sox a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-3, in the eighth, Lee hit a grounder to third baseman
Shane Halter, whose wild throw put Lee on second. Lee was given a hit
and Halter was charged with an error.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez moved Lee to third with his third hit of the game.
Jose Valentin then hit a one-out, two-run triple into the right-field
corner.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Texas 4--Torii Hunter and David Ortiz homered in the
bottom of the eighth inning as the Twins overcame two home runs by
Alex Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-3, Hunter led off the eighth with a shot to
right-center off Colby Lewis (1-2). Then Ortiz homered to center,
giving the Twins the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The rally came a half-inning after Rodriguez, who homered for the
third consecutive game, appeared to send the Rangers to their second
straight win over the Twins with his two-run shot off Mike Jackson.
The homers gave Rodriguez 31, the most in the majors.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Can't Stick It Out</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Right-hander is gone after giving up nine runs in
two innings, and Angels are routed by Kansas City, 12-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Jarrod Washburn has a pretty good fastball, but Ramon Ortiz has a
better one. Washburn relies on his fastball, but Ortiz offers an
assortment of pitches.</LD>
<LD>   But Washburn is the Angel ace, and he is the pitcher with the
10-game winning streak, because he can win on good days and bad ones.
Ortiz, the prodigy with the electric stuff, let down and frustrated
the Angels again in Sunday's 12-3 loss to the Kansas City Royals.</LD>
<LD>   Raul Ibanez hit a grand slam against Ortiz in the first inning and
a three-run homer in the second, tying a club record by driving in
seven runs.</LD>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia lectured Ortiz on the mound in the second
inning, then yanked him after the inning. Catcher Jorge Fabregas
later delivered a pointed critique of Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes an ace pitcher is that he doesn't have games like
this," Fabregas said. "In the games he struggles, like this one,
he'll pull himself through. He's not going to stand on the mound and
feel sorry for himself."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who tonight play the first of 20 consecutive games
against teams with winning records, should have flown out of Kansas
City with momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The Royal starter, Miguel Asencio, was pitching in Class A this
time last year, and their best hitter, Mike Sweeney, was scratched
because of back stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   The game was there for the taking, but instead Ortiz withered.</TE>
<TE>   He did not pitch to the corners of the strike zone. He missed the
zone completely--of his 45 pitches, 27 were balls--or he threw the
ball down the middle and got hit hard. Of the 15 batters he faced,
seven got hits and two walked.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Black, the Angel pitching coach, visited the mound four
batters into the game. Fabregas said that, at one point, he felt like
rifling the ball back at Ortiz to snap the pitcher to attention.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded in the first inning, Ortiz got two strikes
on Ibanez, followed up with three balls and then gave up the grand
slam. So, with two out in the second inning, the Angels down, 6-0,
and Ibanez up again, Scioscia marched to the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia makes the pitching changes, but he usually sends Black to
deliver messages. Scioscia delivered this one himself, loudly, with
the catcher and all the infielders gathered around, but no one else
saying a word.</TE>
<TE>   The message: It's the second inning, so our offense has plenty of
time to get us back into the game. Never mind the score, just buckle
down and get that third out now.</TE>
<TE>   The response: Ibanez hit another home run--Royals 9, Angels 0.
After Ortiz retired the next batter, he walked off the mound very
slowly, a defeated man, his confidence apparently gone.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to focus, to get aggressive and not quit," Fabregas
said. "We have a chance to come back. He can't be worrying about the
grand slam. He needs to get the hitter out and keep it at 6-0."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are willing to write off a bad start, particularly
because Ortiz (8-7) had pitched at least six innings in every other
start this season. They're not worried about the home runs--he has
given up 28, most in the majors, but he still has a winning record.</TE>
<TE>   But they are concerned about his all-too-frequent mental lapses,
especially as the schedule becomes more challenging. Last August,
after the Angels had won a series against the Yankees to move seven
games over .500, Ortiz came to Kansas City and lost, 10-4, giving up
three home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz did not comment after the game. His next start comes against
the American League West-leading Seattle Mariners. The Angels juggled
their rotation so that Ortiz would pitch the series opener against
Seattle. They hope not to regret it.</TE>

<HD>Percival Goes on Disabled List</HD>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The Angels' already weakened bullpen took a severe hit Sunday when
closer Troy Percival was put on the 15-day disabled list because of
an infection in his left foot.</LD>
<LD>   With General Manager Bill Stoneman still trying to trade for a
reliever, and with the Angels still unwilling to promote their most
dominant triple-A reliever, Francisco Rodriguez, they filled the
vacant roster spot by recalling Matt Wise from triple-A Salt Lake.</LD>
<LD>   The injury could hardly have come at a worse time. The Angels are
four games behind the Seattle Mariners and one game ahead of the
Oakland Athletics, with an 11-game stretch against the Mariners and
A's starting Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Percival is not eligible to be activated until July 27, so he will
not be available for all five games against Oakland and four of the
first six games against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The injury would not necessarily force Stoneman to accelerate his
search for bullpen help, Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if we're going to lose Percy for the second half of
the season," Scioscia said. "I don't think this puts any more
importance on it. If you're trying to strengthen your bullpen, you
have that same priority whether you have Percy or not."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said the Angels had considered promoting Rodriguez, their
20-year-old Venezuelan prodigy, but the team is concerned that he
might need more experience than 18 innings at triple A. Still, he has
an 0.49 earned-run average, has given up nine hits and three walks,
and struck out 26.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel bullpen has been ravaged by injury, with Percival,
Dennis Cook and Al Levine all put on the disabled list within the
last 17 days.</TE>
<TE>   Cook has a suspected torn labrum in his shoulder, and an
examination today should determine when--or if--he can return this
season. Levine is scheduled to make minor league rehabilitation
appearances Tuesday and Thursday and could rejoin the team this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, who ranks third in the league with 22 saves, developed
the infection while on a family boating trip during the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   An examination Sunday confirmed that the infection had reached the
Achilles' tendon and would take some time to heal--"longer than the
three days we had hoped," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Ron Roenicke blames himself for the play that
injured catcher Bengie Molina, who sat out his second consecutive
game Sunday because of a strained left hamstring. The injury occurred
Friday, Molina said, "when I got thrown out by 25 feet and tried to
get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Molina was on second base when David Eckstein singled to center
field. Carlos Beltran's throw to catcher Brent Mayne beat Molina home
by so much that Molina slowed up to avoid a collision, pulling his
hamstring in the process. Molina hopes to return tonight or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   With two out, and with high grass in Kansas City that tends to
slow the ball, Roenicke said he reacted on instinct.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sent him home, I realized I shouldn't have," Roenicke
said. "With two outs, I usually send everybody."</TE>

<HD>Avengers' Bye Goes Bye-Bye After Loss</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Avengers' quest for a first-round bye in the Arena Football
League playoffs ended Sunday evening at Conseco Fieldhouse in
Indianapolis when Nelson Garner kicked a 50-yard field goal as time
expired to give the Indiana Firebirds a 56-53 victory before 12,286.</LD>
<LD>   The Avengers (7-6) needed to win their last two games of the
regular season to have any chance of earning the No. 4 seeding in the
playoffs and a first-round bye. The loss to Indiana dropped them into
the No. 6 spot and means they must win their regular-season finale
against Buffalo at Staples Center on Saturday to guarantee themselves
a top-eight seeding and a good chance of playing host to a
first-round playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't play very well," Avenger quarterback Tony Graziani told
KMPC radio. "I think we had three fumbles and you just can't do that
in this league."</LD>
<TE>   Indiana (6-7) converted two of those fumbles into 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's Brett Bech returned one of the fumbles 27 yards for a
touchdown. On offense, he had six receptions for 132 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers tied the score, 53-53, on a one-yard sneak by
Graziani with nine seconds left in the fourth quarter. But when Remy
Hamilton missed the extra-point attempt, the game appeared to be
headed for overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana quarterback Jim Ballard threw an incompletion after the
kickoff before Garner made his career-long field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Graziani completed 25 of 38 passes for 328 yards and five
touchdowns and ran for two touchdowns and a two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hopkins had three touchdown receptions for the Avengers and
Chris Jackson had two.</TE>

<HD>Conflict Upsets Williams' Youngest Daughter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Williams' youngest daughter expressed anguish Sunday about the
legal wrangling over her father's remains.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking publicly for the first time since the baseball great's
death July 5, Claudia Williams said some media accounts have been
"terribly hurtful, and simply not true."</LD>
<LD>   "Our family's actions in the days since my father's passing have
been motivated by our abiding love and devotion for our father and
our grief and anguish at his passing," she said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "Please respect our family's privacy and the difficult decisions
we must make during this time as we do our best to honor my father's
wishes."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 30, did not indicate where she stood on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams, 33, has sent his father's body to an Arizona
lab to be frozen, a move that set off a fight with his half sister
over what to do with the remains of the last man to hit .400.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, 54, says her father wanted to be
cremated and have his ashes scattered over the Florida Keys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Rockies put catcher Bobby Estalella on the 15-day
disabled list. Estalella is hitting .205 in 38 games while sharing
playing time with Gary Bennett. Estalella, who hasn't played since
July 6, has rotator cuff problems....Nelson Barrera, Mexico's career
home run leader, died in an accident at his home in Campeche, Mexico.
He was 44. Barrera hit 455 home runs over a 26-year career in the
Mexican League.</TE>

<LD>Allen Iverson is expected to surrender to authorities Tuesday on more
than a dozen felony and misdemeanor charges, including assault,
criminal trespass and weapons offenses for allegedly forcing his way
into a West Philadelphia apartment July 3.</LD>
<LD>   But that didn't stop the Philadelphia 76er guard from throwing an
all-night party Saturday night at his $2.4-million mansion.</LD>
<LD>   Many of Iverson's neighbors in the posh suburb of Gladwyne have
had enough, mostly because their usually quiet neighborhood has been
overrun by media and curious fans.</LD>
<TE>   "The guy does an alleged home invasion, and it's now a
neighborhood invasion," resident John Powell told the Philadelphia
Inquirer before the party had even happened.</TE>
<TE>   More Iverson: Kevin McHale, vice president of basketball
operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves, was asked about the
Iverson saga on a recent Minneapolis radio talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "If Allen came to my house, he'd find out that I probably have
five more guns than he has," said McHale, an avid hunter. "And I'll
put my marksmanship up against his any day." He then added, "NRA,
baby!"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which pitcher has won the most earned-run average
titles?</TE>
<TE>   Time warped? Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel isn't surprised
that Augusta National does not have any female members:</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this archaic stance what we should expect from members who
wear bright green jackets, white patent leather shoes and listen to
Bobby Vinton records? These guys are so old their memories are in
black and white."</TE>
<TE>   Arms deal: Newsday's Jon Heyman had a solution to avoid situations
like last Tuesday's 7-7 tie in the All-Star game:</TE>
<TE>   "Strong-armed Shawn Green could have come in from right field and
the tight-shouldered [Vicente] Padilla could have gone to right. Fans
would have loved it. They would have gone home knowing players were
willing to do what it took. Instead, they left thinking they deserved
a refund for their $175 seats."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder what Dodger Manager Jim Tracy would have thought of that
plan.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth: According to the New York Post,
Strat-O-Matic, a baseball simulation game, did what Joe Torre, Bob
Brenly and Bud Selig decided not to do and finished the All-Star
game.</TE>
<TE>   Andruw Jones singled off Freddy Garcia to drive in Green from
second base with two out in the bottom of the 12th to give the
National League an 8-7 victory. Green was selected most valuable
player.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lefty Grove (nine).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Fans always complain that professional athletes are
out of touch with the common man. Now, Dallas Cowboy Coach Dave Campo
may have come up with a way to change that mentality. He's having his
players punch in on a time clock every day.</TE>
<TE>   Campo feels that with the Cowboys trying to build a playoff
contender from last season's 5-11 team, a construction-worker
mentality was a perfect idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to build something, obviously," Campo told the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram. "I want guys thinking, 'This is our job. We are
going to take our lunch pails to work. We've got a construction job
to do, so let's get it done.' "</TE>

<HD>Carpentier Starts His Own Streak</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Patrick Carpentier's engine didn't blow, his wheels stayed on, and he
didn't run out of fuel.</LD>
<LD>   He had a fairly uneventful trip around the race track for a
change. And a winning one.</LD>
<LD>   Carpentier, beset by mechanical problems last week in Toronto,
finally got some luck and his second career victory, winning the
Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland on Sunday to end Cristiano da Matta's
CART winning streak at four.</LD>
<TE>   "For once, we had everything going our way," said Carpentier, who
took the lead on Lap 49 when defending champion Dario Franchitti
broke down. "We had no problems, zero problems. My team gave me a
perfect car."</TE>
<TE>   Carpentier, who blew an engine during Saturday's practice session,
won by 17.059 seconds over Michael Andretti, and 28.295 seconds over
Paul Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Carpentier averaged 120.998 mph over the 115-lap race on the
temporary 2.106-mile Burke Lakefront Airport course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Bayliss and Colin Edwards were winners in the two races at
the World Superbike Championships at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   Bayliss leads the circuit after earning his 14th victory of the
year in the first race.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, a native Texan, had never won a World Superbike race in
the United States, but he rode his Castro Honda harder in the second
race to finally get a win on home soil.</TE>
<TE>   Bayliss, the runner-up in the second race, leads the championship
raceby 53 points over Edwards. There are four rounds to go, all in
Europe.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Earnie Shavers: Welcome to the Big Time"</LD>
<TE>   Author: Earnie Shavers, with Mike Fitzgerald and Marshall Terrill</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing, LLC.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $22.95</TE>
<TE>   As a heavyweight boxer, Earnie Shavers was regarded as a great
puncher. He won 73 of his 88 fights and had 68 knockouts. That's one
of the highest knockout percentages in the history of boxing.</TE>
<TE>   His autobiography may not knock you out, but its clarity and
honesty will stun you. This 245-page hardcover book is a refreshing
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shavers eventually entered the ministry, he doesn't use
the book as a soapbox to preach. He simply tells his story, and it is
a good one.</TE>
<TE>   Shavers was born in Alabama in 1944. He originally was Earnie
Shaver, but the name became Shavers after a newspaper misprint during
his Golden Gloves years. Shavers moved to Warren, Ohio, at a young
age. He became a boxer at 22.</TE>
<TE>   His punching power resulted in immediate success in Golden Gloves,
and he soon became a professional boxer. His first promoter was Dean
Chance, the former Angel pitcher; Don King, then a newcomer to
boxing, was his second. Shavers calls King a con man and a dirty
rotten scoundrel but also calls him a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Shavers has many stories to tell. He writes about training at Los
Angeles' Main Street Gym early in his career, about his many fights,
including those with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes, and about his
personal life, including extramarital affairs and financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   Showing uncommon humility for a boxer, Shavers readily admits the
mistakes he has made in and out of the ring. He has been married five
times and has nine children, including five daughters with his first
wife.</TE>
<TE>   He found religion in 1986, now lives in England, is engaged to be
married a sixth time and earns a good living as a public speaker. He
says he has peace of mind and is ready for the "Big Time" once again.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Ishii rises to a desperate occasion, thoroughly
controlling Arizona in 2-1 win that returns Dodgers to first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii has spent much of his first major
league season extricating himself from trouble while his teammates
provided enough run support to offset his control problems. Sunday
night, the left-hander returned the favor, getting the Dodgers out of
a jam.</LD>
<LD>   With his team in danger of getting swept in a four-game series by
National League West rival Arizona, Ishii came through with a clutch
performance, blanking the Diamondbacks on two hits for 7 2/3 innings
to lead the Dodgers to a 2-1 victory before 46,140 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger reliever Guillermo Mota retired Greg Colbrunn on an infield
fly with two on in the eighth, and closer Eric Gagne survived Matt
Williams' ninth-inning home run to record his major league-leading
33rd save as the Dodgers salvaged the final game of the series and
moved back into first place, a half-game ahead of Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   "That game was extra-huge, a must-win game, for respect and for
our confidence," Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan said. "You don't
want to get swept by your enemy and lose what you fought so hard for
in the first half. Everyone is feeling good again."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii (12-5) walked five, raising his NL-leading total to 69, but
he was in control throughout, striking out five and allowing one
runner to reach second base. Arizona's only hits off him were Junior
Spivey's leadoff single in the first and Luis Gonzalez's leadoff
single in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first game I can remember when he wasn't in trouble,"
first baseman Eric Karros said. "He's usually good for that two or
three times a game."</TE>
<TE>   This seemed like a different Ishii, though, a more focused and
well-rested Ishii, a pitcher who used the All-Star break to both
study videotape from the first half and to escape the game for a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii pitched more aggressively Sunday night and recorded several
first-pitch outs. He retired a batter in the eighth inning for the
first time this season. He was never in trouble during a step-up
performance that further enhanced a reputation that was built while
leading the Yakult Swallows to five Japan Series championships.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard when we acquired Kazuhisa as a free agent that he was
involved in a lot of big games in Japan and that he rises to the
occasion in big-game situations," Manager Jim Tracy said. "A couple
of pitches got away, but that was 7 2/3 innings of command. He was in
control of that game from the start."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was well aware of what was at stake Sunday night, and he
relished the opportunity to end the Dodgers' four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the experience of pitching in five world championships
in Japan, and I wanted to pitch with that importance in my mind
today," Ishii said through an interpreter. "I like the pressure."</TE>
<TE>   So does Gagne, and the Dodger closer felt some in the ninth. After
striking out Gonzalez with a 97-mph fastball, Williams sent a 96-mph
fastball over the wall in left to pull the Diamondbacks within 2-1.
Pinch-hitter Steve Finley grounded back to the mound, and Tony Womack
followed with a grounder to the shortstop hole.</TE>
<TE>   But Alex Cora ranged to his right to back-hand the ball and made a
strong off-balance, one-hop throw to Karros to get the speedy Womack
and end the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who held a lead for only a half-inning of the
previous three games, took a 1-0 advantage in the fourth inning when
Shawn Green singled to center off Arizona starter Miguel Batista,
Jordan walked and Karros singled off Batista's glove to load the
bases with none out.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre followed with a fly ball to shallow center, where
Quinton McCracken raced in and made a sliding catch. When McCracken
hit the ground, it allowed Green to tag up and score easily.</TE>
<TE>   The rally died when Mark Grudzielanek bounced into a 5-4-3 double
play, but the Dodgers struck again in the fifth when Dave Roberts
walked with two out, stole second and scored on Paul Lo Duca's
broken-bat bloop single to shallow right-center for a 2-0 lead--only
Lo Duca's second hit in 20 at-bats. The Dodgers held on to improve to
16-9 in one-run games, after losing two of the first three games to
Arizona by one run.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to get back into the win column, and it was important
to give them a loss," Green said. "Maybe we can send them into a
little bit of a downturn, and we'll start going up."</TE>

<HD>Tracy Says Hard-Working Gagne Still User-Friendly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eyebrows were raised Friday night when Manager Jim Tracy used closer
Eric Gagne in the ninth inning of a game the Dodgers were trailing,
3-2. More eyebrows arched Saturday when Gagne warmed up in the eighth
and ninth innings, despite the fact the Dodgers were trailing
Arizona, 7-5.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne's workload in his first full season as a reliever--more
precisely, the potential for him to be overworked--has been a
hot-button topic for Tracy, who has had to defend his use of Gagne on
several occasions, most notably in late June, when Tracy used Gagne
on four consecutive days.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not overused Eric Gagne," Tracy said. "Every time people
see him warming up, I get asked that question."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy said he wanted to use Gagne for an inning Friday because he
pitched only once last week, in the All-Star game. When the Dodgers
put two on the ninth inning Saturday, Tracy wanted Gagne warm in case
they tied the game. Gagne did not pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne gave up a homer in the ninth inning Sunday night but
recovered to record his 33rd save in the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over
the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you supposed to do? I've got to have the guy ready in
case I need him," Tracy said. "It bothers me that people suggest
that's overuse. When you're in a pennant race, you're going to use
your closer. If the thought even occurs to me that he's being
overused, I will not use him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A trade for Texas utility player Frank Catalanotto seems less
likely after Ranger left fielder Rusty Greer hurt his back again
Sunday, an injury that sparked a chain reaction that will result in
Catalanotto getting more playing time as designated hitter. Texas
General Manager John Hart said he is "less enthusiastic" about
trading Catalanotto, whom the Dodgers believe can bolster their
bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have apparently added Toronto right-hander Kelvim
Escobar to the long list of relief pitchers they are pursuing in
potential deals. The hard-throwing Escobar is 4-4 with a 4.85
earned-run average and 14 saves in 38 games for the Blue Jays. He
makes $2.3 million and is eligible for arbitration at the end of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Eric Karros experienced a little dip in production--his
average had fallen from .305 on June 26 to .290 Sunday--Tracy did not
hesitate to drop him from the cleanup spot to fifth and promote left
fielder Brian Jordan from fifth to cleanup Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And it probably won't be the last time Karros and Jordan switch
spots.</TE>
<TE>   "The hottest hand hits behind Shawn Green," Tracy said. "We're far
enough into the season to where if you're committed to playing in
October, as we are, that you have to put egos aside. It's no
disrespect to any player, it's no over analysis. It's just what's
best for the team."</TE>

<HD>Ginn Directs His Way to Senior Players Title</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stewart Ginn might finally be recognized in the United States for his
golf more than for his resemblance to Steven Spielberg.</LD>
<LD>   Ginn shot a six-under-par 66 Sunday to win the Senior Players
Championship at Dearborn, Mich., the fourth and final senior major of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   The 53-year-old Australian, who joined the Senior PGA Tour in 1999
after playing professionally all over the world, finished at 14 under
to win by one stroke for his first tour victory.</LD>
<TE>   Ginn, whose beard and flowing locks remind many of Spielberg, said
he just laughs when people say he looks like the famous movie
director.</TE>
<TE>   "If it could help me get reservations or tables or get me into
movies looking like him, that's fine," he said before rushing to
catch a flight to his home in Malaysia. "I kind of find it quite
funny."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thorpe had the best day with a 65 and closed at 13 under along
with Hubert Green and third-round leader Mike McCullough, who began
the day one stroke ahead of Green and four ahead of Ginn. Green shot
a 70, and McCullough had a 71.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew someone was going to come out of the pack," Thorpe said.
"I just felt like Hubert and Mike had already used up their big round
of the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Ginn made four consecutive birdies from Nos. 10-13 to take the
lead for good at 14 under.</TE>
<TE>   He maintained his lead with a par-saving putt at 16 after his tee
shot landed in the left rough and his second in a bunker. He birdied
17 to take a two-shot lead over Green, McCullough and Thorpe.</TE>
<TE>   "When I holed it at No. 17 and made the up-and-down at 16, I
thought, 'This is my week,' " Ginn said.</TE>
<TE>   Ginn, who was second once last year, hadn't finished better than a
tie for third this year, at the Legends of Golf in April. Since then,
he's finished as low as a tie for 69th--at the Senior PGA
Championship--and no better than a tie for 17th.</TE>
<TE>   Ginn began the tournament tied for 35th on the money list and
earned $375,000--jumping to 16th--with his first victory since the
1995 Golf Digest Japan Championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Teske pulled away from rookie Beth Bauer with four birdies
in a six-hole span to win the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic at Sylvania,
Ohio, by two strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Teske's sixth victory in as many years on the LPGA Tour and second
of the year was worth $150,000. She won the Ping tournament to start
the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three days away from his 48th birthday, Eduardo Romero took
advantage of a late collapse by Fredrik Jacobson to win the Scottish
Open at Luss in a playoff and become the third-oldest winner on the
European tour.</TE>
<TE>   Romero closed with a one-under 70, forcing the playoff by making a
10-foot par putt on the final hole.</TE>
<TE>   Then he hit a 315-yard drive down the 18th fairway and hit a
pitching wedge from eight feet for a birdie to collect his eighth
tour victory and a check for $560,000.</TE>

<HD>Pincay's Win Is One for the Books</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: He sets record with ninth Hollywood Gold Cup
victory as Sky Jack holds on by a nose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As his mounts for Sunday's card began to multiply late last week,
Laffit Pincay turned to his agent, Bob Meldahl, and said: "Not too
many, now. I've got to save my strength for the Gold Cup."</LD>
<LD>   The 55-year-old Pincay might have had seven mounts Sunday, but the
$750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup was only the fifth race of the day, and
Pincay, having ridden only two races beforehand, was at his sinewy
best through a tortuous stretch run. Whipping left-handed and urging
Sky Jack to the wire, Pincay and the 6-year-old gelding beat the
younger Momentum by a nose, in a finish so close that the winning
trainer, Doug O'Neill, wasn't too sure.</LD>
<LD>   "When I watched it live, I thought we had won," O'Neill said.
"Then when I saw the replay, I was worried."</LD>
<TE>   Pulling up Momentum past the wire, 30-year-old Garrett Gomez
looked over at Pincay and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Did you have the nod?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think I did," Pincay said.</TE>
<TE>   It takes an enormous eraser to remove Bill Shoemaker's name from
page after page of the record book, but Pincay is the rubout artist
for the deed. Sky Jack gave the ageless Pincay his ninth Gold Cup
win, one more than Shoemaker, and it came over the same Hollywood
Park strip where Pincay rode his 8,834th winner on Dec. 10, 1999,
dropping Shoemaker to second place.</TE>
<TE>   In the total-wins department, Pincay continues to put more
distance between him and his many challengers; the Gold Cup was the
9,388th win in a career that began in the U.S. in 1966, two years
before O'Neill was born.</TE>
<TE>   "Laffit is amazing," O'Neill said. "He still looks youthful to me.
He doesn't look like he could be my father."</TE>
<TE>   Pincay's first Gold Cup win came with Pleasure Seeker in 1970. He
had tied the Shoemaker record last year with help from the stewards,
who disqualified Futural for interference and elevated Aptitude to
the win spot.</TE>
<TE>   "They're more fun now," Pincay said, "because I know that I don't
have that many years left. But I'm not thinking about that, and right
now I'm having a good time."</TE>
<TE>   Momentum, trained by Craig Dollase, who ran the hard-luck Futural
in the Gold Cup last year, finished three lengths ahead of Milwaukee
Brew, the Santa Anita Handicap and Californian winner and 7-5
favorite. The rest of the order of finish was Dollar Bill, Dig For It
and Macaneo, with Out Of Mind scratched because of a bruised foot.</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack, bred and owned by Rene and Margie Lambert, who own a
farm near Temecula, completed 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 3/5, paying $5.80
as the second choice and earning $450,000. He was the 13th
gate-to-wire winner of the Gold Cup and the fifth in the last nine
years.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew usually runs from far back, but Sunday he broke not
only last, but 12 1/2 lengths behind Sky Jack. Both his trainer,
Bobby Frankel, and jockey, Kent Desormeaux, bore responsibility.
Frankel, who won last year with Aptitude, said that he gave the wrong
instructions, and Desormeaux said:</TE>
<TE>   "I think I left him with too much to do. He really kicked on at
the end. Unfortunately, the race didn't set up like I thought it
would. I thought they would go much faster early."</TE>
<TE>   With Pat Valenzuela riding Macaneo, a 30-1 shot, O'Neill had
guessed correctly that the Argentine-bred might give Sky Jack some
company up front.</TE>
<TE>   Macaneo stayed with Sky Jack for the first three-quarters of a
mile, under soft fractions of :23 2/5, :46 4/5 and 1:11 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   On the turn for home, Momentum hooked up with Sky Jack and may
have inched ahead for a stride with just over a sixteenth of a mile
left.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse won on courage," Pincay said. "When the other horse came
alongside, I thought I was in trouble. I thought we were beat, but my
horse just kept holding on. This was the toughest [Gold Cup] I've
ever won. From [2 1/2 furlongs] to the wire, I had to work real
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Momentum had finished third the day Milwaukee Brew won the
Californian.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish that old man [Pincay] would retire," Gomez said. "He's
tough, but I guess that's why he's a Hall of Famer. I got up there
head and head with him a couple of times. But I just couldn't get by
that old gray horse. We brushed a couple of times, nothing big, but
just enough to where the gray horse could feel me right there. My
horse was trying his eyeballs out."</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack, winning for the eighth time in 14 starts and the fifth
time in as many tries at Hollywood, was deemed the best horse in the
country by Pincay after a seven-length win in the Native Diver
Handicap in December 2000. But he underwent two surgeries for bone
chips on his right knee after that, and when intestinal complications
set in after the second operation, his weight dropped drastically and
he almost died.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought they were going to lose him," O'Neill said, "and
when I went out to see him, it was just like skin hanging on his
bones."</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack recovered and ran second off a 14-month layoff in
February, but then he was last in the Santa Anita Handicap. O'Neill,
admitting later that he had over-reached, thanked Pincay that day for
not beating up on a horse that lacked a chance. Sky Jack's only other
start before Sunday was a win in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap at 1 1/16
miles May 12.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a true mile-and-a-quarter horse," O'Neill said. "And you
won't confuse him with any of the super-greats. But I will."</TE>

<HD>Came Home Is Still Perfect at Hollywood Park</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a $500,000 purse and Came Home's perfect record at Hollywood
Park on the line, jockey Mike Smith wasn't shy about asking for
assistance before the Swaps Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   About to ride the 3-year-old son of Gone West for the first time,
Smith phoned Chris McCarron for some advice Saturday. Just back from
an Alaska vacation, McCarron, who retired after Came Home improved to
3-0 in Inglewood with a two-length victory in the Affirmed Handicap
on June 23, returned the call Sunday morning.</LD>
<LD>   "He gave me his scenario about how he thought the race would shape
up and what he thought he might do," Smith said. "It certainly gave
me a lot more confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Things worked out as McCarron--and the betting public--thought
they would. The 1-2 favorite in the Grade II, Came Home led virtually
from start to finish in a workmanlike performance.</TE>
<TE>   At the wire, he had 1 1/4 lengths on 7-1 third choice Like A Hero
while completing the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   It was the eighth victory in 10 starts for Came Home, who is owned
by John Toffan, Trudy McCaffery, Bill Farish and John Goodman and
trained by Paco Gonzalez. The dark bay's seventh graded stakes
victory was worth $300,000 and pushed his career earnings to
$1,235,940.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything they told me about him was right on," Smith said after
Toffan and McCaffery, who bred the winner, picked up their third
Swaps victory. The pair had won previously with Bien Bien in 1992 and
Free House in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "They said he would relax real well whether he was hooked on the
lead or on his own. Paco told me in the paddock not to be afraid to
take the lead if he breaks well enough to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to get a win and find out a little bit more about
him. He got to looking around a little bit in the stretch and I don't
know what it was. I felt that if I hit him, there was certainly more
there. He wasn't going to let anybody by."</TE>
<TE>   Another trip east could be in Came Home's future. He has one road
win on his resume, a victory in the Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga last
Sept. 1. In his other races outside California, he was seventh in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Belmont Park and sixth in the Kentucky
Derby.</TE>
<TE>   He could be headed to Saratoga again. Gonzalez mentioned the Jim
Dandy Stakes on Aug. 4 and the King's Bishop on Aug. 24 as
possibilities, along with the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park,
which also is Aug. 4. There is also a desire to try the grass at some
point and Del Mar has an extensive turf program for 3-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks after finishing a distant seventh in the Belmont
Stakes, Like A Hero more than doubled his career bankroll by
collecting $150,000 for completing the exacta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irguns Angel, a 5-1 shot, wore down Secret Liaison to win the
$200,000 A Gleam Handicap at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Ron and Susie Anson and trained by Alfredo Marquez, the
4-year-old Irgun filly won for the third time in a row.</TE>
<TE>   She completed the seven furlongs in 1:22 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Delahoussaye was the winning rider, subbing for the injured
Jose Valdivia Jr.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Milwaukee Brew had to settle for third in the Hollywood
Gold Cup, trainer Bobby Frankel did get some consolation.</TE>
<TE>   Making his stakes debut for Frankel, Chiselling, ridden by Jerry
Bailey, edged Finality by a nose to win the $150,000 Lexington Stakes
at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   He ran the 1 1/4 miles on turf in 2:00 2/5.</TE>

<HD>Harvick Wins It His Way</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JOLIET, Ill.</DL>
<LD>An aggressive move by Kevin Harvick set the stage for his first win
in a year.</LD>
<LD>   It also brought a new round of criticism for NASCAR's bad boy, but
only after a late-race gamble on gas by crew chief Gil Martin paid
off.</LD>
<LD>   Harvick was told to stay on the track while most of the other
leaders pitted, and that earned him a victory Sunday in the Tropicana
400 at Chicagoland Speedway.</LD>
<TE>   The hard-charging Harvick listened to his crew chief and barely
made it. He had to walk to victory lane after running out of gas as
he tried to do some celebratory tire-smoking doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick's big break came on the 197th of 267 laps when he went to
the bottom of the slightly banked track on the main straightaway
trying to pass Kurt Busch.</TE>
<TE>   He lost control and skidded through the paved apron area below the
white line in the first turn. On some tracks, that is considered out
of bounds. Not at Chicagoland.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick was able to regain control and pit after several drivers,
including Jimmy Spencer, spun or crashed in his wake.</TE>
<TE>   That allowed Harvick to make what turned out to be his final pit
stop with 68 laps remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick has been criticized for rough driving, spent time on
probation and was banned for one Winston Cup race earlier this year
after hitting Coy Gibbs during a Craftsman Truck Series race.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon, who finished second, called Harvick's move onto the
apron "stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spencer: "We had a car that could have been in the top 10,"
he said. "Harvick drove on the apron and it caused an accident and we
got in it and it took us out. It was uncalled for.</TE>
<TE>   "He still drives like an idiot, but what are you going to do?
NASCAR said there's no out of bounds, but if there's out of bounds at
Daytona, there should be out of bounds here."</TE>
<TE>   When told of Gordon's remark, Harvick said, "Jeff Gordon got
second. Maybe if he had been a little braver, he might have won. He
thinks it's a stupid move. I think it was cool."</TE>

<HD>It's Not an Ace, but Dent Wins Hall of Fame Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taylor Dent defeated James Blake, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, Sunday to win the
first all-American final in five years at the $400,000 Hall of Fame
Championships in Newport, R.I.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just ecstatic," Dent, 21, said. "I was happier than I
thought I'd have been. It's just a great feeling that I can't
describe in words."</LD>
<LD>   Dent broke Blake in the second and sixth games, winning the first
set in only 19 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   He thought he served a match-clinching ace at 40-30, but his
celebration was premature as the serve was ruled wide. Dent did close
it out on the next ball in play, making a lunging backhand return for
a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's ever fun to do that," he said. "I thought it
was in, and I really got lucky with the half-volley flick."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 22, said he was just as surprised by Dent's winning shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a great volley. I thought I was at least in control of
the point, but there's nothing you can do about it. He made a great
return. When I saw it go over, it hurt a little."</TE>
<TE>   Bob and Mike Bryan won the doubles title, defeating Jurgen Melzer
of Austria and Alexander Popp of Germany, 7-5, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Moya of Spain broke serve in the next to last game and
defeated Younes El Anyaoui of Morocco, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, in the final of
the Swedish Open at Bastad.</TE>
<TE>   The third-seeded Moya won his second title of the year and the
eighth ATP tournament of his career. The 26-year-old Spaniard also
won on clay at Acapulco earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Moya broke El Anyaoui's serve in the 11th game of the third set on
his second break point with a crosscourt forehand down the line.</TE>
<TE>   Moya hit nearly 75% of his first serves and closed out the match
in 2 hours 7 minutes with a love game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Corretja of Spain beat Argentina's Gaston Gaudio, 6-3, 7-6
(3), in the final of the Swiss Open at Gstaad for his first title of
the season. Corretja, playing in his first tournament since being
eliminated in the semifinal of the French Open, won the Gstaad title
for the third time. He also won in 1998 and 2000....Mariana
Diaz-Oliva of Argentina beat Russian teenager Vera Zvonareva, 6-7
(6), 6-1, 6-3, in the final of the Palermo Invitational in Sicily,
for her first WTA title. The 17-year-old Zvonareva, seeded fifth,
defeated top-seeded Paola Suarez to reach the final....Austria's
Patricia Wartusch overcame a loss in the first set to beat the Czech
Republic's Klara Koukalova, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, to win the Casablanca Open
in Morocco. The sixth-seeded Wartusch, playing in only her third
final, won her second career title.</TE>

Washington. Mia Hamm, starting her first game of the season for the

the San Jose CyberRays (6-5-4) tie the San Diego Spirit (3-8-4), 2-2,

<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   San Diego is failing to deliver on a number of promises it made to
the NFL for next year's Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The league will not get the number of usable seats it wanted,
renovations to the visiting locker room or upgrades to the press box
and audio/visual control room in time for the game on Jan. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Steeg, an NFL vice president, acknowledged in a San Diego
Union-Tribune report that it is not uncommon for host cities to fail
to live up to all of their commitments. But he said the difference
between what San Diego promised and what it's delivering is larger
than most.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has been pressing San Diego to fulfill its promises,
saying they are "critical to the NFL's commitment to have the Super
Bowl in San Diego." Most important to league officials was the
guarantee that there would be 70,000 acceptable seats.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm Stadium has slightly more than 70,500 seats, but the NFL
discounts the bottom seven rows because of obstructed views,
eliminating more than 2,000 from the total.</TE>
<TE>   Delays in construction of the San Diego Padres' downtown ballpark
kept the baseball team playing in Qualcomm longer than expected, and
workers could not get access to the stadium to add more seats, city
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The bid specifies that the host committee will spend as much as
$1.6 million to get to 70,000 acceptable seats. With that goal
unattainable, the parties have agreed that the committee will pay the
NFL the $1.6 million to offset lost ticket revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the San Diego Super Bowl XXXVII Host Committee still
has not signed a contract binding them to the promises made when the
city was bidding for the game.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the NFL, the host committee and the city say former
San Diego Mayor Susan Golding promised too much when the city bid for
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Eric Uptagrafft shot two perfect series to finish with 398 points
in the prone position and place second behind Slovenia's Raymond
Debevec in the 300-meter rifle three positions at the world shooting
championships in Lahti, Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Uptagrafft beat Debevec by six points in the prone position and by
one point in the finishing knee position. Debevec's 387 in the
standing position was the difference.</TE>

<TE>   Calvin Harrison pulled away from Jerome Young to win the 400

<TE>   Robert Fazekas of Hungary set a national record in the discus with
a throw of 235-3, the fourth-best throw ever in the event. He beat
his own record by more than six feet.</TE>

<HD>Chacon Stops Giants, Ends Slide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a performance that exceeded his expectations, Shawn Chacon
became the unlikely antidote to the Colorado Rockies' struggles.</LD>
<LD>   Chacon pitched seven innings of two-hit ball, yielding only an
unearned run, as the Rockies ended a four-game losing streak with a
5-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday at Pacific Bell
Park.</LD>
<LD>   The loss ended the Giants' five-game winning streak and left them
2 1/2 games behind the first-place Dodgers in the NL West.</LD>
<TE>   Though closer Jose Jimenez made things interesting by giving up
Ramon Martinez's two-run homer in the ninth, the game belonged to
Chacon (4-6), who earned his first victory since May 8.</TE>
<TE>   "For my first game after the All-Star break, it was better even
than I wanted it to be," said Chacon, who walked one and faced only
two batters over the minimum. "To go seven innings and give up one
run is not something I expected to do."</TE>
<TE>   With all four of his pitches working, Chacon frustrated the
Giants. It was a remarkable turnabout by Chacon, who spent most of
May on the disabled list because of a strained chest muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Shumpert homered and drove in two runs for the Rockies, who
scored only three runs in the first 28 innings of the series.
Colorado had a four-run sixth inning capped by Gary Bennett's two-run
single.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 10, Atlanta 3--Wil Cordero hit his third career grand
slam and had five runs batted in to lead the Expos before the
third-largest Olympic Stadium crowd of the season.</TE>
<TE>   With 25,109--Montreal's third crowd over 20,000 this season--in
the park for a Tim Raines bobblehead promotion, the second-place
Expos split the four-game series to draw to within 9 1/2 games of the
Braves in the NL East.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Wilkerson and Jose Vidro hit two-out singles in the third
inning and Vladimir Guerrero walked before Cordero hit an 0-2 pitch
from Damian Moss (4-4) over the left-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Florida 3--Sammy Sosa hit one of Chicago's four
homers--his 29th--to support Mark Prior as the Cubs completed a sweep
of the Marlins at Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's homer, a two-run shot in the seventh, tied him with
Houston's Lance Berkman for the National League lead. Corey
Patterson, Alex Gonzalez and Bill Mueller homered in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Prior (3-2) gave up two runs and five hits over six innings. He
struck out five and walked three to win for the first time in six
starts since June 7.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs swept a three-game series for the first time this season
and improved to 4-1 under new Manager Bruce Kimm.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Pittsburgh 3--Jose Hernandez celebrated his 33rd
birthday in style, hitting two homers and driving in four runs to
lead the Brewers, who beat the Pirates for the first time in seven
games at Miller Park this season.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being on pace to strike out 201 times and break Bobby
Bonds' single-season NL record of 189, Hernandez leads National
League shortstops with 17 homers and 46 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Philadelphia 2--Pedro Astacio yielded only four hits,
including homers by Ricky Ledee and Bobby Abreu, in seven innings and
retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced to beat the Phillies for
the second time in 12 days and enable the Mets to gain a split of the
four-game series at Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, San Diego 1--Bud Smith got his first win of the
season against the team he no-hit last September and helped himself
by driving in a run at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Smith (1-5) struggled so badly that he was scratched from a start
before the All-Star break. He had no problem against the Padres,
holding them to three hits in seven scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Houston 3--Knuckleballer Jared Fernandez pitched
seven strong innings at Houston for his first major league win as the
Reds ended their four-game losing streak and the Astros' five-game
winning streak.</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Jeff Sluman held it together this time on the final day of the
Greater Milwaukee Open.</LD>
<LD>   Sluman fired a three-under-par 68 Sunday for a four-stroke victory
over Tim Herron (66) and Steve Lowery (70) and his second Greater
Milwaukee Open title. He also won in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   His 23-under 261 total was one stroke shy of Loren Roberts'
72-hole tournament record set two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Sluman also led the field heading into the final day last year,
but his erratic play caught up to him and he faltered to a 10th-place
finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of friends and family up from Chicago to cheer me on
and after feeling last year like I disappointed them, I was certainly
glad to get it done this year," Sluman said.</TE>
<TE>   After bogeying the second hole, Sluman made four consecutive
birdies, then played it safe for his sixth PGA Tour victory and the
biggest paycheck of his career, $558,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Perry (65) took fourth, one stroke ahead of Joey Sindelar
(65), Greg Chalmers (69) and J.P. Hayes (67).</TE>

<KH>THE BRITISH OPEN/ THURSDAY-SUNDAY, MUIRFIELD COURSE, SCOTLAND</KH>
<HD>An Open Mind</HD>
<DH>Mickelson is always thinking, on and off course, but he
hasn't figured out how to win a major championship</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The watch is always there, on his wrist, because even on the golf
course, in the midst of a tournament, Phil Mickelson likes to keep
track of the time.</LD>
<LD>   The leaderboard doesn't provide quite enough information. He
monitors action on adjacent fairways. He asks marshals and television
cameramen for reports on players who came through earlier.</LD>
<LD>   His mind--always spinning, churning--kicks into high gear when he
finds himself in a tight spot, in the rough or the trees. Angles must
be calculated, obstacles accounted for, wind and terrain factored
into the equation. The game becomes interesting.</LD>
<TE>   No thoughts of laying up. No chipping out to save par.</TE>
<TE>   "I love being creative and trying to make birdies from behind
trees," he says. "When I go play, that's what makes it fun."</TE>
<TE>   Golf the Mickelson way has produced enough thrills and surprises
for 21 career victories on the PGA Tour, earning its practitioner
millions a year in purses and endorsements, ranking him second behind
Tiger Woods. It has won him a legion of fans.</TE>
<TE>   It also has produced inglorious catastrophe, a feast-or-famine
routine in which bogey follows birdie, par being the exception.
Critics have various theories on this dynamic. Some call him a
choker, others say he is reckless. A few have ventured into the
pathological, suggesting a gambler's compulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Their assertions are fueled by a simple fact: For all his success,
Mickelson is the best player never to have won a major. He is 0 for
40 in golf's biggest events. He knows the whispers will resume, as
persistent as ever, when he tees off in the British Open at Muirfield
on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The critics want him to change. He says they don't understand how
his mind works.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a sweltering July day--the hottest in northern Michigan in
decades--Mickelson has come to the town of Gaylord for the Par-3
Shootout, a made-for-television skins game, a working vacation on the
way to Scotland. The 32-year-old finds a place in the shade, a low
wall beyond the clubhouse, to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Words pour out, not especially fast but with great quantity and
sincerity, sometimes curving like a soft fade from one topic to the
next. Asked about life away from the game, he mentions a fly fishing
trip. Skiing with his wife. His pilot's license. "I do like
aerobatics," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Aerobatics? Loops and rolls? Before the question can be uttered,
Mickelson launches into another subject: quantum gravity, which
unites quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of relativity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a discussion of how the space-time continuum is
affected by gravity and how, theoretically, it's possible even though
improbable to skip into different elements of time, whether it's
going through a black hole ... "</TE>
<TE>   He pauses a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "That's improbable because of how strong the gravitational pull
is. If the Earth was to be engulfed by a black hole, it would come
out three-quarters of an inch around.... "</TE>
<TE>   His hands cup to approximate the size of a compressed planet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more probable to go forward in time given that light is bent
by gravity," he continues. "If we can travel faster than the speed of
light we might be able to intersect different intervals of time."</TE>
<TE>   The conversation leaps to ion propulsion and the escape velocity
of the moon, which leads to a discussion of overpopulation and the
prospect of colonizing other planets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking big picture," he says. "Way past my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Two thousand miles away, in Arizona, Steve Loy chuckles. In the
late 1980s, Loy coached Mickelson at Arizona State, where the
left-hander won three NCAA championships, joining Woods and Jack
Nicklaus as the only players to capture the college and U.S. Amateur
titles in the same year. Just as impressive to his coach, he earned
enough credits to graduate with a psychology degree.</TE>
<TE>   "In four years," Loy says. "Not a single summer class."</TE>
<TE>   Loy knew what to expect when Mickelson turned professional in 1992
and asked him to come aboard as his agent. Meetings to discuss travel
plans, scheduling and business interests have always been conducted
in a certain fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "When I put business in front of him, it has to be very specific
and very precise or his mind will already be going on to something
else before I can complete the mission," Loy says. "Phil always has a
lot of things going on internally. He's always thinking."</TE>
<TE>   In sports, thinking is eyed with suspicion. When does it become a
distraction?</TE>
<TE>   Much of Mickelson's attention is devoted to family. He recently
took an extended break from the tour for the birth of his second
daughter, Sophia. Lee Trevino, who played the televised event in
Michigan, sees this as significant.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe golf is not 100% with Phil," he says. "With Tiger Woods,
it's 100%. It's like a boxing match where one guy trains a little
harder and wears the other guy down."</TE>
<TE>   There is also Mickelson's alleged proclivity for gambling.</TE>
<TE>   He has appeared on sports radio to handicap football games and
talked about making preseason bets on teams he thinks will win the
Super Bowl and World Series. Wagers of $20,000 on the Baltimore
Ravens and Arizona Diamondbacks in recent years paid roughly $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   It was all fun and games until the NEC Invitational last August at
Firestone in Akron, Ohio. Sitting in the clubhouse, watching Woods
and Jim Furyk in a playoff, Mickelson had an inkling Furyk would hole
a bunker shot and asked if anyone wanted to give him 25-1 odds.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weir took the bet, Furyk made the shot and Mickelson pocketed
$500. Reporters standing nearby wrote about the wager and, suddenly,
Mickelson had an image problem.</TE>
<TE>   Now he says the issue is overblown, that he visits Las Vegas only
a few times a year, an assertion supported by a source within the
gaming industry. His preseason bets resemble office pools. Mickelson
recruits friends and relatives to take part because he likes to be on
the telephone--"Did you see that play? Can you believe it?"--while
watching games on seven screens in his house.</TE>
<TE>   Of the winnings, Mickelson says his take was only about $100,000.
Still, people talk.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows so much about sports they think, 'What the heck is this
guy doing? Is he studying the betting line?' " Loy says. "That is not
the case. Phil is just a guy who wants to know about everything."</TE>
<TE>   Which gets back to the way his mind works. Which gets back to the
golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Having coached and watched him for 17 years, Loy knows Mickelson
will never be the type to hit down the middle, to shoot for par.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't stand that kind of golf," Loy says. "He's always
striving, always needing to be challenged. For as long as I have
known him, he has always tried to beat the golf course."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other players have watched and wondered, sitting in the locker
room, asking: "What the heck did he do that for?"</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer, who made a career of being aggressive, thinks
Mickelson should exercise more judgment in choosing his shots, but
only occasionally. Like others, he admires the flip side of
Mickelson's audacity, the shots he creates, his willingness to take
risks.</TE>
<TE>   "I see him playing to win," Palmer says. "I like that style."</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, Mickelson was chasing Woods at the Bay Hill
Invitational when, rather than chipping out of trouble, he attempted
a four-iron under the trees and over the water to reach the par-five
16th green. The shot disappeared in the water, as did any chance at
victory. Afterward, he received a note.</TE>
<TE>   Don't change, Palmer wrote. Stay with it.</TE>
<TE>   Further support comes from Trevino, who figures that in triumph or
disaster, Mickelson is good for the game. "The fans know they are
going to see something," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As for the major tournament failures, Mickelson's reaction has
ranged from avoidance to anger to, more recently, grinning
acceptance. His strategy, however, remains unwavering. He told
reporters as much after a five-putt green at the Players Championship
last March and reiterated his position at the Michigan skins game.</TE>
<TE>   "When I don't try a shot that I know I can hit and things don't
work out, I don't save par or what have you, that's hard for me to
accept," he says. "If I go for it and hit a bad shot that goes in the
water or I make double, that's all right."</TE>
<TE>   His mind works that way. And maybe all the theories about his
game--the choking, the recklessness, the gambler's
self-destruction--melt away before a simpler truth about a guy who
wears a watch on the course and is always calculating the angles.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take that away, golf is too dull," he says. "My mind
wanders."</TE>

<HD>As Usual, This Dodger Victory a Team Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers refused to give in Sunday. Kazuhisa Ishii refused to
lose. Paul Lo Duca fought himself, the ball, the bat, the situation,
to get the single. Shortstop Alex Cora would not let the last ball
get past him. This team wanted first place again.</LD>
<LD>   They are back on top. By next weekend, they might be in third. Or
second. Maybe they'll be in all three places and back to first by
next Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "There is so little to separate the Dodgers, Diamondbacks and
Giants," Eric Karros says, "that all three teams will spend time in
first place and third place and in between before the season ends."</LD>
<TE>   The re-taking of first place, after a lonely night of being in
second, after a slovenly umpired, sluggishly played four-game losing
streak by the Dodgers, came because Ishii pitched with intelligence,
power and finesse.</TE>
<TE>   It came because Lo Duca, struggling with his hitting, broke his
bat but got a run-scoring two-out single in the bottom of the fifth
after Dave Roberts had coaxed a two-out walk from Diamondback starter
Miguel Batista. It scored the winning run.</TE>
<TE>   It came because Cora made a breathtaking play for the final
Arizona out in the top of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Williams had blasted a one-out home run off closer Eric Gagne
and the nerves of the Dodger nation began to jangle. The 2-0 lead had
become 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne had seemed tired before the All-Star game. His only blown
save had come against the Diamondbacks right before the break. If
this lead was squandered, the Diamondbacks would leave Dodger Stadium
with a four-game sweep and this season might take an ugly turn.</TE>
<TE>   So Tony Womack takes a hard swing, but Cora, deep in the hole,
makes the play. He whips a wicked one-hop throw to Karros for the
final out.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a huge play," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said later.</TE>
<TE>   This is the strength of the Dodgers. They may not be great in one
thing, but they are OK at everything it takes to win.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Giants are in a three-team race for
two playoff spots. The wild card almost certainly will come from the
NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona has the two starting pitchers. Everybody knows them. Curt
Schilling and Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants," Karros said, "are one of the deepest teams in
baseball. Us? We're not the strongest at any one thing, but we're
good everywhere. Except closer. We have the best closer."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers do have an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say that the depth of our starting rotation is our
strength," Tracy said. In the glow of Ishii's mature, unflinching
pitching (he got an out in the eighth inning for the first time this
season), Tracy needed to praise his five starters. In the
almost-rubble of this series, Tracy needed Ishii more than he's
needed anything this year.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also knows that his two competitors have strong points.</TE>
<TE>   "Arizona has the strength of its bench. That's one thing the
Diamondbacks have over the other two clubs," Tracy says. "They had
the strongest bench post-trade deadline last year and it's stronger
this year."</TE>
<TE>   Now that third baseman Matt Williams is healthy, the Diamondbacks
can bring Craig Counsell off the bench. Greg Colbrunn and Mark Grace
make a nice righty-lefty first base combination. Steve Finley is a
smart, seasoned veteran.</TE>
<TE>   And the Giants?</TE>
<TE>   "Barry Bonds is a pretty good strength," Tracy says. "And Jeff
Kent obviously. I think the Giants have the starting lineup that is
most difficult to pitch to. When you've got Rich Aurilia batting
second, Kent third, Bonds fourth, [Reggie] Sanders fifth, that's a
pretty formidable group of people to deal with. And you are never
unaware of Bonds. If he's six batters away, you are aware of Bonds."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, a steadying personality with a thoughtful mind, gave
the Diamondbacks an advantage in having Schilling and Johnson and in
having experience in winning.</TE>
<TE>   "They've figured out how to find a way to win it all," Jordan
said. "That's big."</TE>
<TE>   He gives the Giants an advantage because of Bonds and Kent. "Those
are two guys who can carry a club for a while. That's nice to have,"
Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   But he gives the Dodgers two important advantages. "We have great
starting pitching and we play together. Playing together goes a very
long way toward accomplishing great things."</TE>
<TE>   After watching the Diamondbacks win three games here, it is clear
that the Dodgers don't have the most talent in the division. They
aren't deep and they have expended much energy in playing so well in
the first 92 games. Shawn Green seems sleepy, almost. How long will
Gagne's strength hold? How far can the Dodgers go if Adrian Beltre
doesn't start hitting better and playing with more enthusiasm at
third base?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe farther than we think. That's Jordan's point. The Dodger
strength is the team.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's the best strength to have.</TE>

<HD>Bollini Hangs On for Playoff Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nico Bollini lost his lead in the final round of the Southern
California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship but did not lose his
composure. He felt the title slipping away on the first 10 holes
during the final round Sunday at El Caballero Country Club in
Tarzana, but, his shirt drenched with sweat in mid-90s San Fernando
Valley heat, he kept a cool head and prevailed.</LD>
<LD>   Bollini, 19, from Yorba Linda, overcame a front-nine 40, shot two
under on his last eight holes, then made a 12-foot eagle putt on the
second playoff hole to defeat defending champion John Merrick of Long
Beach and Mike Lavery of Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Bollini, the third-round leader at six under par, shot a four-over
75 Sunday for a four-day total of two-under 282.</LD>
<TE>   Merrick closed with 70 and Lavery, who started the day 10 shots
behind Bollini, had nine birdies in a 65 to force the first three-way
playoff in the history of the 103-year-old tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Bollini, a sophomore at USC, was a shot out of the lead after a
double-bogey at No. 10 but regrouped with a birdie at No. 11 to get
back on track.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to wake up," said Bollini, who held a four-shot lead after
three holes Sunday. "I needed to regroup. I knew I wasn't out of it,
so I took that as a second chance. The key was that I never lost it
emotionally. In the past I used to get hot-headed when that happens,
but I've learned how to control my emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Merrick, a junior at UCLA, birdied Nos. 11, 12 and 14 to take a
one-shot lead. Bollini, playing a group behind Merrick, tied for the
lead with a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 16. Lavery, a senior at UC
Irvine, shot a back-nine 31, including a birdie on the 18th that got
him into the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   He missed an 18-foot par putt on the first playoff hole, however,
and was knocked out.</TE>
<TE>   Merrick and Bollini then went to the par-five first for the second
playoff hole.</TE>
<TE>   Bollini hit a booming, 330-yard drive to the right side of the
fairway--his best drive of the day, he said--then faded a four-iron
to about 15 feet and made the eagle putt to win.</TE>

<HD>Three Stars Offer to Take Pay Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only a couple of weeks after scoring two goals against Germany and
leading Brazil to its fifth World Cup title, Ronaldo on Sunday found
himself offering to take a pay cut.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't his idea. The notion of accepting less money came from
Italy World Cup striker Christian Vieri, who passed it on to Ronaldo,
who in turn enlisted the aid of Uruguayan World Cup midfielder Alvaro
Recoba.</LD>
<LD>   The trio plays for Inter Milan, and these are difficult financial
times for Internazionale, as they are for all Serie A clubs in Italy.
The three players, each of whom earns more than $4 million a year in
salary (excluding endorsement income), offered to take pay cuts of 5%
to 10%.</LD>
<TE>   "We spoke to each other and decided to do something," to show
support for Inter President Massimo Moratti, Vieri was quoted as
saying on Inter's Web site. "The president has supported us in every
moment and we wanted to make a concrete gesture, a gesture as Inter
players.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how much. We won't bring accountants into it.
What is important is to take the initiative."</TE>
<TE>   Added Recoba, the highest-paid player in Serie A with a reported
annual salary of $7.9 million: "If a club can't pay [all] the
players, then we need to be honest and accept a pay cut, for the good
of everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sergio Campana, president of the Italian players union,
said players were willing to accept pay cuts if their team is
relegated to a lower division and also would accept
performance-related contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "From now on, the contracts will be flexible," he told Gazzetta
dello Sport. "One part will be fixed [and] another will be based on
performance--results, goals scored or saved, and other factors."</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand Wins Oceania Title</TE>
<TE>   A 79th-minute goal by Ryan Nelson off a free kick by the Galaxy's
Simon Elliott earned New Zealand a 1-0 victory over Australia in
Auckland, New Zealand, and the championship of the Oceania Nations
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Australia, whose soccer federation is beset by debt, was unable to
afford to bring any of its European-based players to the eight-nation
tournament and New Zealand took full advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The Kiwis will represent Oceania in next summer's FIFA
Confederations Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Australia had been expected to make a bid to play host to the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Croatia Selects Baric</TE>
<TE>   Croatia, which finished third at the France '98 World Cup but was
ousted in the first round at Korea/Japan '02, has hired Otto Baric as
its new coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Herr Otto," as the 69-year-old is called, had been coach of
Austria in its failed attempt to qualify for the World Cup. He
replaces Mirko Jozic, who quit after Croatia's failure in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay Goes With Ruiz</TE>
<TE>   Anibal "Mano" Ruiz, former coach of Paraguay's youth team, has
been appointed national team coach, replacing veteran Italian coach
Cesare Maldini, who led Paraguay to the round of 16 at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Schwan Dies at 80</TE>
<TE>   Robert Schwan, the coach who led Bayern Munich to European Cup
titles in 1974, 1975 and 1976, has died of heart failure at age 80 at
his vacation home in Reith near the Austrian ski resort of Kitzbuhel.</TE>
<TE>   Joao Pinto Banned, Fined</TE>
<TE>   The indefinite ban that FIFA handed out to Portugal World Cup
player Joao Pinto after he punched Argentine referee Angel Sanchez
for red-carding him during Portugal's 1-0 loss to South Korea has
been given more definite form.</TE>
<TE>   Pinto, 30, who plays for Sporting Lisbon, has been banned from all
soccer activity for four months and fined $33,670, FIFA announced. He
was also put on probation for one year and ordered to pay $10,100 in
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Metsu to Coach in UAE</TE>
<TE>   Frenchman Bruno Metsu, who coached Senegal to the quarterfinals in
its World Cup debut, has accepted a one-year contract to coach the
club side Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates. No financial details
were revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Iran Players Lashed</TE>
<TE>   Eight players from Iran's national team have been sentenced to be
whipped for visiting prostitutes in Tehran, according to a report by
Agence France-Presse. Prostitution has been outlawed in the country
since the 1979 Islamic revolution but flourishes regardless.</TE>
<TE>   A court official told Agence France-Presse that two players
already had been subjected to 70 and 170 lashes, respectively, and
that six others were still to be punished.</TE>
<TE>   The eight players allegedly were identified by photographs found
during a raid on a Tehran house of prostitution.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Pushes Himself to Keep Pace</HD>
<DH>Cycling: Lost time after crash a day earlier forces
American to increase speed during eighth stage as he continues
chasing Spain's Gonzalez de Galdeano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PLOUAY, France</DL>
<LD>Finally, Lance Armstrong turned on the speed as the Tour de France
neared the parts of the race where he hopes to build his fourth
consecutive championship.</LD>
<LD>   A day after losing time in a crash, Armstrong covered the last
part of Sunday's eighth stage through Brittany in exceptionally fast
time to keep pace with race leader Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano of
Spain.</LD>
<LD>   "That's probably the good news about the crash--it's that I was
really forced, for the first time in this race, to go as hard as I
could, and I think it was pretty fast," Armstrong said. "It was
confirmation that I feel good.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been feeling good in the races, but you ride along in the
group and it's not possible to really test it."</TE>
<TE>   Karsten Kroon led a Dutch sweep of the top three places Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   While remaining eighth overall, Armstrong said he was impressed by
the speeds reached by riders in this year's Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "They attack from the beginning, and they don't seem to ever
stop," he said. "The other day we did 100 kilometers in two hours--I
don't remember the last time we did that.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I think they are attacking is because the Tour has
moved all the difficult stages to the rear. They know that now is
their time--it's a guess, a hypothesis."</TE>
<TE>   Those difficult stages start Thursday, when the Tour enters the
mountains--Armstrong country in each of his three victories.</TE>
<TE>   Today there's another stage where the American has prospered--an
individual time trial. But the defending champion said he was picking
Gonzalez de Galdeano to claim the 32.2-mile stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm second fiddle," Armstrong said. "Galdeano will be good, he
can win the time trial."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez de Galdeano, who rides for Once, leads Armstrong by 34
seconds, thanks largely to a Saturday crash that caught Armstrong's
back wheel and slowed him down by 27 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "If Galdeano has a super day on Monday and wins by another 30
seconds--and he has [a lead of] over a minute--then we will have to
be aggressive" later in the Tour, Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Armstrong locked up his third consecutive Tour title by
blowing away the competition in the last individual time trial. He
said he felt at the "highest level" of his career after the victory.</TE>
<TE>   But the American says his Spanish rival is feeding off the strong
momentum gathered in the Tour's first week.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez de Galdeano "will have the yellow jersey, [and be] very
motivated. They [Once] seem to be very confident in their
declarations--so he's the favorite."</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniard said it would be "a dream" to retain the yellow
jersey after today's ninth stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try to have a good time trial--I'm against the best
racer out there," Gonzalez de Galdeano said, referring to Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong won the Tour by almost seven minutes last year, thanks
to his stunning performance in the Alps and the Pyrenees. He placed
35th in Sunday's eighth stage, a mostly flat 134.9-mile run from
Saint-Martin-de-Landelles to Plouay in western Brittany, finishing in
the main pack 1:55 behind stage-winner Kroon.</TE>
<TE>   Kroon spoiled hopes of a French victory on Bastille Day. Last
year, CSC-Tiscali rider Laurent Jalabert of France won the stage on
July 14.</TE>
<TE>   Kroon, of the Rabobank team, clocked 4:36:52. He is making his
Tour debut and it was his first stage victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm normally not very emotional, but I just can't hold back the
tears after this win," Kroon said. "I'm really moved."</TE>
<TE>   Servais Knaven and Erik Dekker finished second and third,
respectively, with the same time as Kroon.</TE>
<TE>   World road champion Oscar Freire dropped out of the Tour earlier
Sunday. Freire, who won this year's second stage, injured his
tailbone in a crash the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided it was probably better not to take the start today," he
said. Hospital tests found no broken bones.</TE>

<HD>Swail Proves Something Else</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie Swail won the women's overall title for the second consecutive
year Sunday at the Pacific Coast Triathlon at Crystal Cove State
Park, only this time she felt like a triathlete.</LD>
<LD>   Swail, captain of the U.S. women's water polo team at the 2000
Olympics and coach of the UC Irvine women's team, decided two weeks
ago it was time to get serious about triathlon and move her
distinguished water polo career onto the backburner.</LD>
<LD>   "Water polo is just a hobby," said Swail, an Irvine resident.
"Triathlon is my priority now."</LD>
<TE>   Swail completed the 800-meter swim, 12-mile bike and three-mile
run in 1 hour 4 minutes 58.9 seconds, nearly two minutes faster than
last year, when she earned her first triathlon victory in only her
third competition. Swail said her latest victory is a barometer she
will use to gauge her progress.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first race I've done two consecutive years," she
said. "I finally have a marker."</TE>
<TE>   Swail, 29, demonstrated her strength in the water, finishing the
swim fifth overall despite a slight detour at the beginning. Swail
started in the first wave and said there was some confusion as to
which direction to take around the first buoy. Swail and several
other leaders were redirected at the last moment and sent back into
the trailing group of swimmers on the opposite side of the buoy.</TE>
<TE>   Men's winner Craig Alexander of Australia left the water in third
place behind fellow Australians Marc Lees and Matt Clark, the
defending champion. Alexander, 29, remained in third through the bike
portion and into the run, where he moved into the lead after a half
mile.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander finished in 57:29.5, Lees was second in 58:27.1 and
Clark third in 59.07.3, a little more than a minute faster than his
winning time last year.</TE>

<HD>The Final Score Is Top Priority</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Cooper badly wants to entertain, saying, 'I'm looking
for 100 points' in tonight's All-Star game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Cooper knows exactly what he wants to see in the WNBA
All-Star game--a lot of scoring.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm looking for 100 points," the Western Conference All-Star
coach said Sunday. "I'm going to tell the players, 'Let's move it
up,' because I think it's great entertainment value for the league."</LD>
<LD>   Cooper, coach of the Sparks--the WNBA's best team last
season--will be trying to put on a show tonight for last season's
most supportive fans.</LD>
<TE>   The Washington Mystics, consistent losers until this season, drew
an average of 15,280 fans last season--well over the league average
of 8,416.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't expect that Washington and New York, with all the
entertainment options in those cities, would be the top spots for
supporting women's basketball," said Charlotte Coach Anne Donovan,
coach of the East All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Only New York, with an average crowd of 13,494, approaches the
Mystics in terms of fan support.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has been led by Chamique Holdsclaw, but fans of the
Mystics won't get to see Holdsclaw play tonight because she has a
sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   With Holdsclaw out of the East's lineup, the star power at
Sunday's practice sessions shifted even more dramatically to the
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The East is led by starters Tamika Catchings of Indiana, Dawn
Staley of Charlotte and Teresa Weatherspoon and Tari Phillips of New
York.</TE>
<TE>   The West has the Sparks' Lisa Leslie, Houston's Sheryl Swoopes and
Tina Thompson, Sacramento's Ticha Penicheiro and Seattle rookie Sue
Bird in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie dunked during the practice, something that has yet to occur
in a WNBA game. Bird tried, and missed, a layup with her hand over
her eyes, and 6-foot-5 forward Lauren Jackson of Seattle won $100
from Cooper for being the first to hit a half-court shot.</TE>
<TE>   Bird--who went from playing in front of diehard fans at
Connecticut to the Seattle Storm, which draws fewer than 6,000 fans
per game--said WNBA fans are different from college supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "In college, if you went to play Rutgers, the whole place would be
cheering for Rutgers," she said. "In the WNBA, people have their
favorite players, or they're just fans of the league in general."</TE>

<HD>First, Let's Fight for U.N. Arms Inspections in Iraq</HD>
<DH>Before Hussein is hit, U.S. should win wide support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN H. BAKER</AU>
<BD>Rear Adm. (Ret.) Stephen H. Baker, a senior advisor at
the Center for Defense Information, was Navy chief of staff in
Bahrain during the previous U.N. inspection effort and an operations
officer during Operation Desert Storm.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a good idea when leading a charge to occasionally stop and look
behind to see whether anyone is following. President Bush needs to do
that now in his march to the "inevitable" invasion of Iraq. He would
see some of his staff, a vaguely supportive Congress, a nervous
Defense Department and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.</LD>
<LD>   That's about it.</LD>
<LD>   The ominous rhetoric issuing from the White House and appearing in
the news media gives the certain impression that the road to military
action against Baghdad is being prepared for this winter. It's the
right road, but why make it an expressway?</LD>
<TE>   Invasion is the wrong immediate aim. What the U.S. needs by the
end of this summer is an inspection crisis, not a military crisis.</TE>
<TE>   So far, U.S. support of the demands that Saddam Hussein grant the
U.N. Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission access to
suspicious sites in Iraq is halfhearted and fatally pessimistic.
Washington instead should be pressing to get U.N. weapons inspectors
back into the country.</TE>
<TE>   The third meeting this year of an Iraqi delegation with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Hans Blix, executive chairman of the
U.N. inspection effort, ended in failure after two days of talks in
Vienna this month. The State Department said the administration was
not surprised that the talks had failed because Iraqi statements
before the meeting foreshadowed the outcome. If any statements
undermined U.N. efforts, it was the pervasive U.S. rhetoric on
invasion plans, preemptive attack policies and authorization for the
CIA to use all means at its disposal to eliminate Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration understands, after Afghanistan, the
strength of coalition forces and the power of unified world opinion.
If Bush leads support for the U.N. effort, rather than continuing
plans for a unilateral military scampaign, he might see a different
picture as he glances over his shoulder in marching to Baghdad to
demand weapons inspections, or else. Germany, Canada, France, Russia,
China, Japan, India and Britain are all represented in the inspection
effort. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and all the moderate Arab regimes
in the Persian Gulf strongly support it. All would insist that Iraqi
failure to comply with U.N. weapons inspections is unacceptable.
Hussein would face worldwide pressure to prove that he had not
secretly cached hideous chemical and biological weapons for use
against his enemies, real or perceived.</TE>
<TE>   Those in Washington who favor taking military action against
Hussein do not believe U.N. inspections can be carried out in a way
that guarantees an end to Iraq's program to develop weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear. True, the U.N. inspections in the
1990s were plagued by Iraqi concealment, deception, lies and threats,
but the inspectors learned a lot, found a lot and destroyed a lot.
Despite Iraq's intransigence, that effort destroyed more than 27,000
chemical bombs, artillery shells and rockets, including 30 Scud
missile warheads.</TE>
<TE>   The current inspection effort is improved in many important
respects. It has twice the international representation, answering
objections that the previous effort was dominated by the West.
Inspection and monitoring equipment is state-of-the-art and
supplemented by color overhead satellite images. More than 230 new
inspectors from around the world are being trained to better
understand Iraqi culture so communication problems won't interfere
with their chief mission, uncovering clandestine weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Inspections cannot offer a 100% guarantee, any more than the
Pentagon can ensure a bloodless war or zero collateral damage in a
major conflict with Iraq. Yet a resumption of inspections would at
least give the world a peek at what threat to global security Iraq
really may pose. It is an opportunity to substantiate U.S. claims
that Iraq continues to pursue efforts to produce chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, and that it could become a supplier to future
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of containing Iraq's weapons programs, if they do
exist, without the need for a U.S. military strike would be a global
crowd-pleaser. At worst, aggressive American demands that U.N.
inspectors be allowed into Iraq would help the U.S. gather a
coalition for military action against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   It should at least be tried before Bush sends U.S. guns and young
men into Baghdad all on their own.</TE>

<HD>A Burning Issue: Helping Loggers, Hurting Forests</HD>

<LD>Scores of scientists and the federal government's own national fire
plan have concluded that the removal of mature trees from forests
increases the severity of forest fires. Why then would the Bush
administration use the threat of fires to try to increase logging of
mature and old-growth trees in our national forests?</LD>
<LD>   That is clearly the administration's intention, as outlined in two
recent memos on revising the Northwest Forest Plan and the "Sierra
Nevada Framework" plan to allow logging companies increased access to
ancient forests on public lands. The move is being led by Mark Rey, a
former timber industry lobbyist and a President Bush appointee who
oversees the Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   In the Sierra Nevada, the administration intends to "modify" the
current Sierra framework plan to increase the size of trees that
could be removed, which would allow widespread logging of old-growth
trees in national forests. The administration also has indicated its
intentions to eliminate the current requirement to maintain small
stands of remnant ancient forest and to reduce the existing standards
for maintaining forest canopy cover. This would greatly undercut the
Sierra framework, which limits logging of mature trees in national
forests in the Sierra Nevada. The framework was the result of several
years of planning and public participation during the Clinton
administration.</LD>
<TE>   Bush administration officials imply that this logging is needed to
protect homes from forest fires. Yet the Forest Service's own
scientific reports show that the best way to protect rural homes from
fire is to reduce the flammability of the home itself and its
surroundings within 100 feet. Wood shingles should be replaced with
fire-resistant roofing, and brush around the home should be cleared.
These steps protect homes even from severe fires.</TE>
<TE>   As scientists point out, commercial logging actually increases
fire severity by removing large, fire- resistant trees and leaving
behind very small trees and flammable "slash debris"--branches, twigs
and needles from felled trees. The removal of mature trees also
decreases the forest canopy, creating hotter, drier conditions on the
ground. The additional sun exposure encourages the growth of
flammable brush and weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Reduction of flammable underbrush can reduce fire severity, and
environmental groups have encouraged such projects. However, the Bush
administration has grossly misused the funds that Congress
appropriated for brush reduction near homes. In Sierra Nevada
national forests last year, more than 90% of these funds were instead
earmarked for preparation of large timber sales focused on the
removal of mature and old-growth trees miles from the nearest town.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's potentially dangerous fire management
policies demonstrate the need for Congress to pass legislation to
abolish commercial logging in national forests and to redirect
logging expenditures into brush reduction and home protection.</TE>
<TE>   Until that happens, many politicians will continue to place the
economic interests of their timber industry campaign contributors
ahead of public safety and ecology.</TE>

<HD>Putting the I in Icon</HD>
<DH>With no heroes left, young folks look within.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN SCHNUR</AU>
<BD>Dan Schnur, a Sacramento political consultant, is a
visiting instructor at the Institute of Government Studies at UC
Berkeley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Tuesday, we booed our baseball heroes. We jeered and threw empty
bottles at the All-Star players because they were ordered to leave
the field before the game was decided.</LD>
<LD>   But our own public displays of disgust should no longer surprise
us, whether at a sporting event or in a voting booth. We've become
accustomed to disillusionment, not just from our steroid-enhanced
athletes but from almost every civic and cultural icon to whom we
once turned for inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   So what that now our home-run sluggers get tossed onto the trash
heap. They can take their place next to the business executives with
their document shredders, next to the priests with their lust for
children and, of course, next to the seemingly endless string of
politicians with their scandals, self-aggrandizement and
soul-destroying search for campaign dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The question for us is no longer whether to boo but whether there
is anyone or anything left to cheer. For most of us, it's almost too
depressing to answer. But, thankfully, a younger generation appears
to have begun to answer that question, finding direction and
inspiration at a place we have not looked into for a very long time:
from each other and from within.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who've been around awhile, our disdain for
politicians is nothing new. We have become so accustomed to the
disregard that most voters feel toward their political leaders that
we no longer think it unusual that we uniformly distrust those we
elect to run our government. The candidates and their advisors take
voter ennui for granted, running campaigns with the built-in
assumption that their words are much less likely to draw admiration
and inspiration than to be ignored, belittled and dismissed. So, in
November, we Californians will drag ourselves to the polls for yet
another in a continuing series of lesser-of-two-evils election
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball and other sports, religion and the stock market used to
be our refuge from the political process. But the inflated egos of
too many sports figures, the self- indulging appetites of too many
priests and the astonishingly self-enriching habits of too many
business executives have turned us into well-rounded cynics.</TE>
<TE>   When we have such little sympathy or admiration for our sports
celebrities, when we place such little faith in our religious
leaders, when we have such little trust in our business leaders, we
find it increasingly difficult to find anyone to believe in. We lose
civic confidence, and our sense of community becomes that much more
fragile.</TE>
<TE>   For too many Americans, guidance comes from professional pundits
who dominate the radio and cable television networks. When all else
fails, James Carville and Rush Limbaugh will tell us what we want to
hear. They will howl at the moon for us, casting blame back and forth
across an expanding partisan divide. The only place their sirens lead
us is in retreat, back into our own ideological warrens, where we
seek reassurance and comfort and scapegoats from anyone willing to
tell us what we want to hear.</TE>
<TE>   So where do we turn? Who can we follow when there's no one to
lead?</TE>
<TE>   For many young Americans, the formal political process has made
those questions irrelevant. They don't trust politicians and they
show up at the polls in smaller numbers than any other generation in
recent American history. But those same young people run neighborhood
watch and park cleanup programs, deliver meals to shut-ins and tutor
at-risk youth. A Pew Foundation study done during the last
presidential campaign indicates that the same young people who won't
take 15 minutes every two years to vote volunteer more than any other
generation in recent American history. In short, they are learning to
provide their own leadership. Rather than searching for a hero to
show them the way to greatness, they are taking on the role of hero
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of us, and for the politicians whom young people
ignore, it's a lesson worth learning.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law professor at
George Washington Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White House is reeling from allegations that both President Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney engaged in business practices that are
disturbingly similar to those of executives at Enron and WorldCom.
Like administrations before it, this White House now must choose
between serving the greater interests of the office of the presidency
or the narrower goals of the current officeholder. If last week was
any indication, Bush officials have chosen a dangerous path of
personal devotion over public duty, a path that has led previous
administrations to disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The recent allegations--which may prove overblown under closer
scrutiny--center on transactions by Bush and Cheney when they were
executives at Harken Energy Corp. and Halliburton Co., respectively.
Among the unproven allegations are insider trading, questionable
personal loans and fraudulent dealings. The White House staff has put
on a full-court press to refute these allegations of private
misconduct. In doing so, the administration is drifting into the
troubled waters in which the Clinton administration found itself.</LD>
<LD>   The failure to distinguish between a president's personal and
public matters creates a perilous ambiguity for public officials. As
shown in the Clinton administration, the involvement of White House
officials in private matters often converts a limited personal
scandal into a full-blown public crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The Clinton White House staff was denounced for becoming deeply
involved in the personal litigation of the Clintons. Staff members
coordinated a media and political campaign, including daily faxes
attacking critics.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton's former White House counsel, Bernie Nussbaum,
resigned under criticism that he could not distinguish between
personal and public matters of representation. Courts cited this
confusion in rulings against the White House. Claims of presidential
and attorney-client privilege were rejected because of the
intermingling of private and public functions. In fact, one of the
proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton involved the misuse
of White House staff for personal purposes. Nor was Clinton the only
president to face such criticism; Richard Nixon was accused of using
public officials and resources for improper purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's management of the current scandal seems
remarkably Clintonesque. The Bush White House immediately became
embroiled in the merits of the allegations of personal wrongdoing,
including matters currently under investigation. White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer and others defended the president's actions
as a citizen and stated that the White House was consulting with
"private accountants and private counsels" as part of its response.
The White House staff coordinated the response to the allegations,
even sending allies fax answer sheets (a la Clinton) titled "If You
Get Asked About Harken."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer has also used his public office to declare that the
Cheney allegations, which have yet to be adjudicated, are "without
merit," and other staffers have been briefing media in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   It is during personal scandals that public officials must decide
whether they are working for the presidency or the president. Whether
to decline to assist an embattled and much-loved president may be the
most difficult test of principle for any public official.</TE>
<TE>   Yielding to the natural desire to protect a president in a
personal crisis can deepen a scandal and cut a staff adrift in a sea
of conflicts and compromises. It is also wrong in a system based on
laws and not men. These officials work for the public, and there is
much public business to be done.</TE>
<TE>   The fault for this blurring of public and personal duties must be
laid at the feet of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales. It is his
responsibility to maintain the bright line between official and
personal concerns. When there is a divergence between the interests
of the presidency and those of the individual president, the White
House counsel must protect the presidency. It is his unpleasant duty
to go to the president and vice president and ask that they retain
personal counsel and not use public employees for this work.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, it is Fleischer's difficult duty to decline to make
official comment on the merits of pending investigations or lawsuits
involving alleged personal misconduct. He does not have to become a
mute. Rather, he can refer to the president or vice president's
denial of any wrongdoing and refer questions to private counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Fleischer who warned Americans after Sept. 11
that "people have to watch what they say and watch what they do." It
is sound advice for the White House staff in the coming weeks.</TE>

<LD>Nations, like people, get defensive when outsiders point out their
faults. For years, Westerners have criticized Arab countries' lack of
political freedom and their discrimination against women, usually
drawing the reply that it's part of the Arab culture or tradition or
none of the West's business. Now a team of Arab intellectuals has
looked at the 22 nations and 280 million people represented in the
Arab League and concluded that political repression, mistreatment of
women and poor education are crippling the region.</LD>
<LD>   The first assessment of its kind, the Arab Human Development
Report is blunt and balanced. Sponsored by the United Nations and a
year in the making, it notes the good--fewer people living on an
income of less than $1 a day than in other developing regions. And
the bad--growth in per capita income over the last 20 years that was
the lowest in the world except for sub-Saharan Africa.</LD>
<LD>   In 1960, Arabs on average produced more per person than people in
"Asian tiger" countries such as South Korea and Malaysia. Now they're
half as productive as South Koreans. Intellectual capital is scarce
as well. "The whole Arab world translates about 300 books annually,"
the report notes, "one-fifth of the number that Greece translates."</LD>
<TE>   The computer revolution has largely left the region behind. An
Arab "brain drain" is one reason, but another is language. Most
material on the Web is in English, a language that few in the region
speak.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also decry a "freedom deficit," ranking Arab countries
the world's lowest in civil liberties and representative government.
The Arab-Israeli conflict is a cause and excuse for the region's
retarded political development, the authors say. But they devote
little space to the pro forma denunciations of Israel so common in
the region--which is fortunate, since Israel, even with all its
faults, could serve as a democratic model for Arabs now ruled by
hereditary monarchies or other authoritarian regimes.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to the treatment of women.</TE>
<TE>   The enrollment of Arab girls in primary and secondary schools has
doubled in 30 years, but too many still go without education. And
those who do complete high school often find no chance to use what
they've learned, since fewer women have jobs or serve in parliaments
in these nations than anywhere else on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly," the authors write, "the Arab world is largely depriving
itself of the creativity and productivity of half its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing problems is the prerequisite to solving them. The West
should encourage the Arab world to look squarely at this benchmark
report's sobering message and assist any moves toward democracy it
spurs. Those Arabs inclined to react defensively to the authors' hard
facts might first consider this: About half the Arab teenagers polled
for the report say they want to emigrate.</TE>

<HD>Congress' Crack at Reform</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As President Bush continues to dither about cracking down on
corporate fraud, Congress is stepping into the breach with a flurry
of proposed reforms.</LD>
<LD>   Even traditional opponents of business regulation like House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) are backing changes, but reform
forces will have to beware that promising legislation such as the
Senate accounting reform bill being debated today doesn't end up
watered down. The nation can't afford it.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer confidence is plummeting almost as fast as the stock
market, and the administration has just revised the budget deficit
upward to $165 billion. As a result, legislators staring at fall
elections are running scared.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate Finance Committee has approved allowing workers to sell
company stock granted as a 401(k) match after three years. The Senate
has approved a securities fraud statute that would punish executives
with up to 10 years in prison for defrauding investors. These
statutes have been incorporated into a bill proposed by Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.). The main provisions of the legislation would create
a truly independent auditing board and prevent auditors from working
for companies whose finances they are supposed to scrutinize.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk on Capitol Hill in favor of reform, the fact
remains that House Republicans, and the Bush administration, are
balking at the Sarbanes bill, which could be weakened in House-Senate
conference meetings. Many House Republicans back a much weaker bill
by Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   The White House has seemed impotent in its response to this issue
of high public anxiety, perhaps because the president and vice
president are themselves so steeped in the culture of corporate
boards and highflying deals. If reformers move quickly, the
administration will have to come along.</TE>

<KH>STANDING UP TO STREET GANGS</KH>

produce almost 500 convictions and a cumulative 6,000 years of prison
time.</DH>

<LD>Kathryn Dawson never opened the door of her Compton home to
strangers. But the retired schoolteacher and widowed mother of six
had known Joe Patrick Gaines since he was 8, before he joined a gang
and was put on probation for carrying a gun. When Gaines, then 17
years old, came calling in July 2001, Dawson welcomed this longtime
family friend. She probably would have freely given him the $20 he
stole after shooting her, execution-style.</LD>
<LD>   Compton Superior Court Judge Jack W. Morgan last week sentenced
Gaines to life in prison without parole. County sheriff's deputies
and prosecutors deserve credit not just for delivering justice--the
only solace in so bitter a case--but for doing so against the odds
that come with gang crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Gangbangers in Los Angeles have killed, on average, one person a
day so far this year, accounting for more than half the city's 341
homicides. Police officials estimate that arrests are made in only
about 30% of gang- related cases. When the law of the street is "You
snitch, you die," cops get scant cooperation. Witnesses who do talk
often change their stories by the time they get to court.</LD>
<TE>   Consider a Times story that ran the same day as one on Gaines'
sentencing. A witness was stabbed seven times the day before he was
to testify against a gang member. The witness survived, and his
testimony helped win a murder conviction. But when it comes to
intimidation, perception is everything. If gang members injure or
kill a witness in even one case, it has a chilling effect on others.</TE>
<TE>   For years, police and prosecutors responded as best they could;
one LAPD division even bought its own moving van to help witnesses
relocate. In 1998 the California Legislature established a witness
protection program to help local departments. Though not as elaborate
as the federal witness protection program--known for spiriting away
ex-mobsters to new lives with new identities--the state program picks
up the tab for a motel stay or moving expenses and a few months'
rent.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the program allocated just over $2 million to relocate
more than 1,000 witnesses and family members, an average of $2,000 a
person. About three-quarters of the cases requiring protection
involved gangs. In its first three years, the program helped produce
almost 500 convictions and a cumulative 6,000 years of prison time.
These cases could not have gone to trial without witnesses,
prosecutors say, and the witnesses involved would not have agreed to
testify without protection.</TE>
<TE>   When a young man murders a kind and supportive elder, it's easy to
lose hope in mentoring, job training and other programs meant to
steer vulnerable kids away from the gang life and the violence it so
often triggers. But children who live in gang-ridden neighborhoods
need societal lifelines. Residents of such neighborhoods need police
and prosecutors to keep them safe from the brutes who commit
unimaginable atrocities and tempt others to do likewise. Tools like
the witness protection program help get the job done.</TE>

<HD>Bleak AIDS Conference Reports Deliver a Global Reality
Check</HD>
<DH>Disease: The meeting closes with daunting projections on
the epidemic's spread and the efficacy and cost of new treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Frustration was palpable in the hallways and meeting rooms here as
the 14th International AIDS Conference drew to a close amid protests
against drug companies and Western governments, dire forecasts about
the epidemic's toll and limited prospects for new treatments.</LD>
<LD>   Activists decried what they see as greedy pharmaceutical
manufacturers and miserly governments, particularly those of the
United States and the European Union. Conferees listened to bleak
projections of 25 million AIDS orphans by 2010, another 45 million
people infected with HIV in the same period, and in some nations,
average life expectancies dropping below 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in the six days of the meeting, 50,000 people died of
AIDS around the world and another 84,000 were infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.</LD>
<TE>   Scientifically, researchers heard little of promise. Pre-approval
clinical trials of a new class of drugs called fusion inhibitors
suggest that they will be a valuable addition to the AIDS arsenal,
but the first such drug, called T-20, will probably cost at least
$12,000 per year per patient. Other potential new classes of drugs
are still five to six years away.</TE>
<TE>   The first major trial of an AIDS vaccine is nearing an end and an
even larger trial sponsored by the U.S. and Thailand is scheduled to
begin, but few experts believe that either vaccine will halt the
spread of the disease. Meanwhile, a Harvard researcher reported on a
patient who had developed apparent immunity to one strain of HIV,
only to become infected by a second--a finding that suggests that any
vaccine may provide only limited protection.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, it's like the morning after the Northridge
earthquake--the worst is yet to come," said Lee Klosinski of AIDS
Project Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, which concluded Friday, was "a reality check" on how
the world is progressing in the battle against AIDS, said Dr. Seth F.
Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and
the world is not passing the test. Developments in Barcelona, he
said, were "a splash of cold water."</TE>
<TE>   Former President Clinton echoed that sentiment, calling AIDS "an
epidemic that will not turn, the worst thing since the bubonic plague
killed a quarter of Europe in the 14th century."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton noted the mood of the more than 15,000 conferees, the most
ever, and said: "All these numbers are overwhelming, and there have
been no medical breakthroughs, and I know a lot of you are worn down.
And if you are HIV-positive, you might be feeling a little
frightened."</TE>
<TE>   But the situation is not hopeless, he added. "I would like to say
that there is a greater level of understanding and support in the
political leadership of the world ... than I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   That understanding led to the creation last year of the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The fund's head,
Richard Feachem, hopes to have 3 million people in the developing
world receiving HIV drugs by 2005--compared with only about 230,000
now--but reaching that goal will require a minimum of $10 billion per
year. Government donations for the first year are still less than $3
billion, however.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has received by far the most criticism for its effort.
America has contributed $500 million, but it is not clear whether
that sum is for one year or several.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson was
booed loudly when he attempted to make a speech here Tuesday. That
address, which no one was able to hear, noted that the United States
had donated nearly a quarter of the money received by the fund so
far, more than any other nation.</TE>
<TE>   But Mogha Smith, chairman of the British charity Oxfam, said that
the $118 million donated by the Netherlands and the $58 million from
Sweden are a much more significant contribution when viewed as a
percentage of those countries' gross national products. On that
basis, those commitments are five times that of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   An AIDS activist from South Africa, Zackie Achmat, made his own
plea for help. Appearing by videotape because he is too sick to
travel, Achmat said, "Just because we are poor, just because we are
black, just because we live in environments and continents that are
far from you, does not mean that our lives should be valued any
less."</TE>

<LD>Winding up a three-day meeting on how to depose President Saddam
Hussein, a group of former Iraqi military officers said they would
support war crimes tribunals for the leader and his top aides if he
were removed from power.</LD>
<LD>   The 65 defectors from Hussein's forces issued a statement in
London affirming their commitment to any effort to topple him and
promised that the army would be subordinate to civilian authority in
a democratic, post-Hussein Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The statement said the group would charge the main figures in
Hussein's regime "with full responsibility for the crimes committed
by the authority during the years they have been in power."</LD>

neo-Nazi and skinhead movements. He admitted to the assassination
attempt during an interrogation and was placed in a psychiatric jail
ward because of apparent mental problems, authorities said. Police
did not identify him, but media reports gave his name as Maxime
Brunerie.</LD>
<TE>   The incident took place about 9:55 a.m. as Chirac's open military
jeep passed the Arc de Triomphe and approached the Champs-Elysees,
the French capital's showcase boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The faint crack of the .22-caliber rifle was audible in the
circular plaza, which was lined with tanks, soldiers and uniformed
and plainclothes police for the parade celebrating France's national
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear how close the bullet came to the president.
Chirac, the general with whom he was riding and soldiers standing at
attention for presidential review did not visibly react to the shot,
which was fired about 100 yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Television footage showed riot police pinning a man with
close-cropped hair to the cement and then rushing him into a police
van. Plainclothes police carried away the guitar case he allegedly
used to conceal the rifle, which authorities said was purchased last
week and was loaded with five bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac made no comment about the incident. But the president's
wife, Bernadette, later told reporters that there was no doubt that
the gunman wanted to kill the president.</TE>
<TE>   An Interior Ministry official described the incident as the act of
an apparently deranged extremist who tried to take his own life as he
was being captured.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an assassination attempt," said Patrick Devedjian of the
Interior Ministry. "He fired a first shot.... Then he was overcome
and tried to turn the weapon against himself."</TE>
<TE>   Spectators were the first to grab the gunman after he produced the
rifle from the guitar case and took aim, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching the parade from behind the metal barriers,"
50-year-old Mohamed Chelali, a French Canadian tourist accompanied by
his wife and three children, said in a television interview. "Mr.
Chirac was passing by in his vehicle when I felt a movement in the
crowd on my right. Then I saw, about two or three meters [yards] from
me, a man aiming in the direction of the president. Someone next to
me hit the shooter's hand, and I grabbed a part of the weapon."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect was already known to police as a member of the Groupe
Union Defense, a neo-Nazi, skinhead-style organization known for its
aggressiveness, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Devedjian described him as being a hard-core extremist "further to
the right" than Jean-Marie Le Pen, the combative leader of the
far-right National Front party who lost a bitter election to Chirac
in May.</TE>
<TE>   There were no immediate signs that the incident was related to
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen condemned the assassination attempt, which came at a time
when the French are worried about rising crime and "U.S.-style"
violence.</TE>
<TE>   One of Chirac's campaign pledges was to curb violent crimes, such
as a brazen robbery that took place last month on the Champs-Elysees,
one of the busiest and best-policed streets in France, just a few
blocks from the scene of the assassination attempt.</TE>
<TE>   During the robbery, masked bandits carrying AK-47 assault rifles
robbed a currency exchange on a Saturday afternoon and took a U.S.
tourist hostage as they escaped in a car, pushing her out of the
vehicle unhurt minutes later.</TE>

<HD>Israel Bombs Militant's Home</HD>
<DH>Gaza Strip: Amid chaos, Hamas gunmen kill an alleged
Palestinian collaborator, judge says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>An Israeli F-16 warplane attacked the home of a senior Palestinian
militant on Sunday but he escaped without injury seconds before
missiles slammed into the building in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian
witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   At least 10 people were wounded in the attack on a home that an
Israeli army spokesman said was owned by Yusef Abdel Wahab, a leader
of the Islamic group Hamas in southern Gaza.</LD>
<LD>   The spokesman said the building was used to make bombs for attacks
on Israeli troops in Gaza, as well as for Hamas meetings.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said Wahab bolted from the house near the town of Khan
Yunis immediately after hearing the sound of aircraft. The house was
destroyed, and four nearby buildings were damaged.</TE>
<TE>   In the pandemonium that ensued, a Palestinian man on trial for
allegedly collaborating with Israel to kill five Palestinians in
southern Gaza last month was shot and killed by militants, a judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   Court proceedings for Abdel Hai Sababi, 48, had gone into recess
and Sababi was in a detention room when the Israeli aircraft fired
the missiles near the court, said Brig. Gen. Abdel Aziz Wadi,
chairman of the court.</TE>
<TE>   During the chaos, some members of Hamas broke into the detention
room and fatally shot Sababi, Wadi said.</TE>
<TE>   The airstrike followed Palestinian mortar attacks Saturday night
and Sunday morning against the nearby Jewish settlement of Kfar
Darom. No one was injured at the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Later Sunday, Israeli tanks moved into a Palestinian town in
northern Gaza, Beit Lahiya, and shot dead Nidal Amudi, 17, as he
walked through a farm, Palestinian security forces and officials at
Shifa Hospital said.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials denied that tanks had moved into the area but said
soldiers had returned fire after mortar shells were fired at a Jewish
settlement in the area.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, meanwhile, a 24-year-old Palestinian, Gazi abu
Obieh, was killed in the Balata refugee camp near Nablus. The army
said troops fired after Obieh threw a gasoline bomb in their
direction and then rushed their jeep wielding a knife.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Cabinet Pulls Back From Controversial Bill</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Ministers set aside legislation to limit Arabs'
right to buy land a week after endorsing it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Backtracking on an emotional issue, the Israeli Cabinet on Sunday set
aside a bill it had endorsed just last week that would allow Arab
citizens of Israel to be barred from buying homes or land in many
Jewish communities.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal sparked a firestorm of criticism after Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's government voted to back it during a closed session a
week ago. Critics accused Sharon and his allies of railroading the
measure through the Cabinet while most ministers from the center-left
Labor Party were absent. Others blasted the bill as state-sponsored
racism that would legalize the existence of "Jews-only" towns.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently in response to the fusillade of criticism, the Cabinet
revisited the issue Sunday, with Labor members present, and voted, 22
to 2, to send the bill to committee--an action that analysts said in
effect kills its chances of becoming law.</LD>
<TE>   The U-turn spares Sharon a bitter public confrontation with his
foreign minister, Shimon Peres, a senior Labor figure who threatened
to quit the government if necessary to fight its "racist decision" to
endorse the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for Sharon, said Sunday's vote
reflected the Israeli leader's view that the bill needed further
examination to determine whether it was the right way for Israel to
go about maintaining its sometimes-contradictory status as both a
Jewish and a democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be improper at this stage to send it" to the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, Gissin said, particularly because the proposal
"has implications on the very delicate fabric of relations between
Jews and Arabs and among Jews themselves."</TE>
<TE>   But he signaled that the sticking point for Sharon lies more in
procedure than aim.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't in any way discard the idea that Jewish settlement in
Israel is a critical component in the realization of the Zionist
vision," Gissin declared. "That's what we came back [to Israel] for."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed law would have granted Jewish Israelis the right to
shut out the country's 1 million Arab citizens--who make up about 20%
of the population--from purchasing homes or living on state-owned
property.</TE>
<TE>   This translates into most of Israel, since the state controls the
vast majority of land, most of which has been allocated for Jewish
use through the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial bill was introduced by one of Israel's
ultranationalist parties to undercut a landmark Supreme Court
decision two years ago that declared all citizens, Arab or Jew,
equally entitled to live where they want within Israel's borders.
(The decision did not apply to the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
territories captured by Israel in 1967.)</TE>
<TE>   The highly charged debate that followed the court ruling exposed
the conflicting feelings many here have over whether Israel can be
both a Jewish and democratic state at the same time, or whether one
takes precedence over the other.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill contend that such a measure is necessary to
preserve the nation's very raison d'etre and its security.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents say it goes against the values of fairness and
nondiscrimination that Israel, a nation founded in large part by
survivors of Nazi hatred, ought to embody.</TE>
<TE>   "They understood that such a racist law won't stand in front of
the high court," Zehava Galon, a Knesset member from the left-leaning
Meretz Party, said after Sunday's vote. "I said that if the law is
going to pass, I'm going to appeal to the high court.... Otherwise,
we're going to have apartheid in Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics warned that international opinion of Israel, already
low in some quarters because of its military reoccupation of the West
Bank, would drop further if the bill went through.</TE>
<TE>   "It is liable to turn Israel into an internally fractured,
troubled state--one that is isolated internationally due to the
revulsion of the developed world," the Haaretz newspaper said in an
editorial.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, this tiny nation is already fractured and segregated
along ethnic and religious lines, mainly between Arabs and Jews,
though there are other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs, through tradition and solidarity, live in their own
villages, even though they say their communities suffer from
substandard public services and official neglect. Jews have their own
enclaves, many of whose residents are unwilling to cross over even
one block into Arab neighborhoods for fear of attack.</TE>
<TE>   To many conservatives, this is as it should be, through both
choice and legal sanction. They charged that Sharon's retreat on
Sunday showed political cowardice.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has simply caved in," Yitzhak Levy, one of the two
ministers to vote in favor of the "Jews-only" bill, told Israeli
radio. Levy is a member of the National Religious Party, which
drafted the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Levy complained that Sharon, who belongs to the Likud Party,
refused to let him find another way for the bill to reach the Knesset
floor. "This wasn't a democratic way to run the Cabinet meeting, to
say the very least," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Cabinet's reversal saved Sharon from an embarrassing
public feud with Peres, relations between the two men remain testy.
They were at odds again over the weekend when the government canceled
meetings the foreign minister was expected to hold Saturday with
senior officials of President Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister's office said that Peres--himself a former
prime minister--was overstepping his bounds by agreeing to discuss
security questions as well as issues of humanitarian relief for the
Palestinians living in the West Bank. For many there, everyday tasks
such as grocery shopping or going to the mosque have become difficult
under army-imposed curfews.</TE>
<TE>   Gissin, Sharon's spokesman, said Peres did not have the necessary
approval from a high-level steering committee to discuss anything
beyond humanitarian issues.</TE>
<TE>   To end the dispute, Sharon and Peres had lunch together Sunday and
appeared to patch up their differences, at least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   Peres is expected to meet with Palestinian Authority officials
this week--a meeting to be supervised by Sharon's office.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN SALVADOR ATENCO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>State officials freed at least some prisoners Sunday night in hopes
of winning freedom for hostages held by farmers protesting
construction of a new Mexico City airport.</LD>
<LD>   Local television showed people who had been arrested after a clash
with police on Thursday leaving a prison Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Secretary Santiago Creel also appealed for negotiations
to end the four-day standoff, offering aid to the villagers.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not going to have bloodshed," Creel told a late-night news
conference at President Vicente Fox's residence.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters had given a skeptical response to government proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Release of all 12 prisoners "is no longer good enough. What we
want now is a package. If it doesn't come complete, it's not worth
anything," protest leader David Pajaro told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, the protesters increased demands to include a
meeting with Fox, more federal farm aid and the withdrawal of police
and soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Creel urged the protesters to negotiate and dangled offers of
money, housing and jobs if the airport project is accepted.</TE>
<TE>   The government plans to expropriate 13,300 acres from San Salvador
Atenco, paying as little as 70 cents per 1.2 square yards.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with rusty machetes and three stolen gas tankers that they
have threatened to blow up, the protesters are holding at least 15
hostages in a town they have controlled since late Thursday.</TE>

<LD>It may end up as a mere footnote in the annals of military history,
but Morocco's decision to send 11 armed men, a few tents and a flag
out to a speck of land just off its coast is being called the first
invasion of West European territory since World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Spain is so angry, in fact, that it has sent gunboats to the
region.</LD>
<LD>   The tiny island in dispute is really just a big rock with some
lizards, bugs and wild parsley. Spain says it owns the rock, which it
calls Isla del Perejil, or Parsley Island. Morocco says no, it owns
the rock, which it calls Leila.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, no one really cared much who owned the rock,
because no one lives there. Then, on Thursday, a small band of
Moroccan civil guard police ferried its way out to the islet, set up
camp and raised the Moroccan flag.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco says it has set up an observation post to help ward off
illegal immigrants and aid in the war on terrorism. But Spain--and
apparently, much of Europe--believes it has invaded sovereign
territory.</TE>
<TE>   "In a secret operation carried out by sea, Moroccan soldiers took
the Spanish-owned Isla del Perejil late on Thursday, hoisted their
country's red and green flag from its highest point, set up camp and
waited for the Spaniards to try to take the land back," said an
article in London's Guardian newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there is a new clash between the West and the Arab
world.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League has lined up behind Morocco. "The position of the
League is to support Morocco in its dispute with Spain over this
island," the group's secretary-general, Amr Moussa, said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union is backing Spain. "This clearly is a
regrettable incident," European Commission spokesman Gunnar Wiegand
said at a news briefing last week. "It constitutes a violation of
Spanish territory."</TE>
<TE>   Spain and Morocco have had strained relations since Spain's days
as a colonial power, when it controlled the North African country's
northern coast. Spain continues to possess two small enclaves along
that coast, Ceuta and Melilla, as well as a scattering of offshore
islets--all of which Morocco claims as its own. Isla del Perejil--or
Leila--is about four miles from Ceuta.</TE>
<TE>   But the animosity has taken on even broader significance in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, as moderate leaders in the
West and the Arab world have tried to neutralize extremists who have
declared that there is a clash of civilizations, a fundamental battle
between the Islamic world and the Judeo-Christian West.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Morocco has had close ties with the U.S. and has
helped in the fight against terrorism. But the tense atmosphere--and
the memory of Argentina's decision to seize the Falkland Islands in
1982, sparking war with Britain--has raised concerns that this could
become a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, both sides were calling for calm, although neither was
willing to give in.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there is an exaggeration on the Spanish side,"
Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohammed Benaissa said in a telephone
interview. "The whole island is only as big as a football stadium. It
has never been inhabited. We are not the ones making a big issue."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the daily newspaper El Mundo, Spanish Foreign
Minister Ana Palacio said Spain did what it had to do when it
dispatched four gunships to the vicinity of Ceuta and Melilla.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we'll see what happens," Palacio was quoted as saying. "There
is a language here of symbols that we all understand," she said,
adding that the incident could be "resolved reasonably."</TE>
<TE>   Palacio also reminded the Moroccan government that 250,000 of its
citizens live in Spain and that the two countries have maintained a
friendship and cooperation treaty since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In both countries, public opinion appears to be in support of
holding firm.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, El Mundo said: "The king of Morocco has chosen the path
of confrontation with one of the great European democracies, and this
should have a serious cost for him."</TE>
<TE>   In Morocco, the press is squarely behind the decision to retake
what is widely viewed there as Moroccan territory.</TE>
<TE>   "The island is [220 yards] off the coast of Morocco's mainland,"
said Dris Issawi, managing editor of Al Sabah newspaper in Rabat, the
capital. "The whole thing is about [30 acres] big. Moroccans used to
go there with their sheep because there was good food on the island
for sheep."</TE>
<TE>   The incursion--to use the Europeans' term--came as Morocco began
several days of celebrations for King Mohammed VI's wedding. Absent
from the festivities were Spanish officials, who, given the strains
between the two nations, had decided even before the invasion not to
attend the celebrations.</TE>

<HD>Leader in Murder of Reporter Gets Death Sentence in
Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three others receive life terms, but state may
appeal in effort to execute them as well.</DH>

<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An anti-terrorism court today sentenced to death the mastermind in
the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Syed Ali Ashraf Shah found Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a Briton
of Pakistani descent, and three accomplices guilty of the Wall Street
Journal reporter's abduction and murder, prosecutor Raja Qureshi told
reporters this morning.</LD>
<LD>   He handed down life sentences to Salman Saquib, Fahad Naseem, and
Sheikh Mohammed Adeel, who was accused of sending pictures of Pearl
in captivity in two e-mails to news organizations, including the Los
Angeles Times.</LD>
<TE>   The judge heard a total of 23 prosecution witnesses. He also fined
the three men other than Sheikh just over $8,300 each, and ordered
all four to pay an additional $33,000 in total after the conviction
on charges that included murder, conspiracy to kidnap, demanding
ransom and destroying evidence. The fine money is expected to go to
Pearl's widow, Mariane, and their infant son, Adam.</TE>
<TE>   All four men pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their lawyers
have already said they would appeal a guilty verdict, first to the
provincial High Court, and then to Pakistan's Supreme Court if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really harsh verdict, and we intend to appeal," said
Mohsin Imam, one of the defense lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants sat impassively while the verdicts were read.</TE>
<TE>   It could be many months before Sheikh and his accomplices have
exhausted all appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said he may launch his own appeal to have Saquib,
Naseem, and Adeel executed along with Sheikh. Executions are usually
carried out by hanging.</TE>
<TE>   "I will await for government instructions [on] whether the state
will appeal the life sentences against the three or not," Qureshi
said. "Whatever the state's instructions are, I will act upon them."</TE>
<TE>   The closed trial in a special anti-terrorism court began April 22
at Karachi's central jail, but it was moved to the city of Hyderabad,
about 100 miles away, after there was a threat to blow up the
facility.</TE>
<TE>   About 600 Pakistani police and commandos guarded the Hyderabad
jail where the verdict was delivered this morning. In an effort to
prevent a violent backlash, Pakistani authorities had rounded up 30
suspected extremists Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was supposed to last seven days, but it ended up
dragging on for three months. Two judges were replaced in the course
of the trial: The first was removed because he had been present at a
session in which Sheikh admitted to involvement in Pearl's
kidnapping; Sheikh later recanted, and his lawyers argued that
allowing him to hear the case would be prejudicial against the
defense. The second judge to hear the case was replaced after
prosecutors complained that he had failed to stop the accused from
making threatening gestures in court.</TE>
<TE>   Court cases in Pakistan are tried with a single judge, without a
jury, and can be appealed to a higher court as well as the Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was arrested in February. The U.S. had asked that he be
extradited, but Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf turned down the
request, insisting that the trial and punishment should be carried
out in Pakistan to send a message that extremists won't be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal,
disappeared Jan. 23 while working on a story about alleged "shoe
bomber" Richard C. Reid, the Briton accused of trying to set off
explosives in his sneakers during a December flight from Paris to
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   He was last seen at Karachi's Village Garden restaurant, where he
went to meet a source from a Muslim extremist group. Taxi driver
Nasir Abbas testified that he saw Pearl and Sheikh get into a car at
that restaurant the night Pearl went missing. A Pakistani journalist
who was working with Pearl also identified Sheikh in court as a man
Pearl met that night.</TE>
<TE>   Following the kidnapping, a previously unknown group calling
itself the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani
Sovereignty e-mailed photographs of Pearl in handcuffs, with a pistol
at his head, to American news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   An investigator from the FBI testified that he traced the e-mails
to a laptop used by one of Sheikh's accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Pearl vanished, U.S. diplomats received a grisly,
three-minute videotape of his slaying and decapitation. Sheikh's
lawyers insisted during the trial that the videotape was a fake.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us time and a photograph of [prosecutor] Raja Qureshi and we
could produce the same sort of film, with Qureshi being slaughtered,"
defense lawyer Rai Bashir said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police found what they believe to be Pearl's remains in
May after arresting members of the banned Islamic extremist group
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The group is one of several suspected of
involvement in a suicide bomb attack at the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in India say Sheikh's ties to militant groups date to at
least the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Indian police arrested Sheikh and charged him with
kidnapping California tourist Bela J. Nuss and three British
backpackers. Nuss was rescued after 11 days. While in prison, Sheikh
confessed to the kidnappings in a 56-page prison diary, which is
still part of his file in an Indian court. The handwritten pages also
describe how Sheikh, a private school graduate who once attended the
London School of Economics, became an Islamic militant.</TE>
<TE>   He went to Croatia on a mission to deliver supplies to refugees in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1993. He tried to join Muslim
fighters crossing from the Croatian city of Split into Bosnia, but
they recommended that he get training in Afghanistan first, Sheikh
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He traveled to the Pakistani city of Lahore and signed up with the
Harkat Moujahedeen. The group is headed by Fazlur Rehman Khalil, who
co-signed Osama bin Laden's 1998 fatwa, or religious edict, calling
on Muslims to attack Americans. Police have named a splinter group of
Harkat Moujahedeen as the chief suspect behind the bombing of the
Karachi Sheraton, as well as an attack on the U.S. Consulate in
Karachi this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh said he went through military training in Afghanistan in
1993 and did so well that he returned the following year to help
train other militants.</TE>
<TE>   He was then sent on a mission to kidnap Western tourists in India
in a scheme aimed at freeing Maulana Masood Azhar, who was jailed on
terrorism charges as leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammed. Instead of
springing Azhar from prison, Sheikh ended up behind bars himself.</TE>
<TE>   But India's government was forced to release the two men along
with a third alleged terrorist to win the safe release of passengers
on an Indian Airlines flight hijacked in December 1999.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Raid on Village Prompts Afghans to Demand Changes in
War Strategies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KAKARAK, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>As the night turned to gray dawn, U.S. forces entered this remote
village, proceeding at first as they would in enemy territory,
searching house to house, restraining weeping relatives, speaking in
brusque tones.</LD>
<LD>   But then, according to villagers, they focused on the bodies. What
they saw were hardly armed Taliban fighters. There were women, their
bodies torn to pieces, young girls in party dresses, toddlers and
infants. The soldiers realized that something had gone terribly
wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 48 dead, all but three were women and children, according
to a report compiled by Afghan government officials who visited the
area.</LD>
<TE>   In an episode that may prove a turning point in America's
involvement in Afghanistan, Pentagon officials have acknowledged
civilian casualties, although they have neither confirmed nor denied
the figures. However, now they are coming under pressure to change
the way they are prosecuting the war.</TE>
<TE>   "When the soldiers saw the women and children, they were sad and
they told the translator, 'We made a mistake,' " said villager Sahib
Jan, who, like many of the victims, was attending an engagement party
at the time of the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Kakarak and four nearby villages in central Afghanistan were the
targets of a heavily investigated and disputed bombing raid by U.S.
forces on the night of June 30 and predawn hours of July 1. Although
no one disagrees that a tragedy was the result, there are conflicting
accounts over the circumstances of the attack: Villagers say they
were firing into the air to celebrate an impending marriage; U.S.
officials say there was sustained antiaircraft fire aimed at planes
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the soldiers' early acknowledgment of error on the
ground appears to have been repeated by U.S. officials in private
conversations with Afghans up to the highest levels of government,
including a telephone call from President Bush to Afghan President
Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials, including members of the military, have quietly
promised to build schools, roads and hospitals and to drill wells in
the district where the bombing took place, said Minister of Borders
and Tribal Affairs Aref Noorzai, who led the Afghans in a joint
delegation with Americans to investigate the raid.</TE>
<TE>   What hangs in the balance is whether the Pentagon will agree to
make the long-term changes in its military approach demanded by
Afghan officials.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the military has been reluctant to restrict its operations
here in Oruzgan province, presumably because many people, including
Afghans, believe that senior Taliban members--among them Mullah
Mohammed Omar, the spiritual leader of the ousted hard-line Islamic
regime--might be finding shelter here. Omar was raised less than a
mile from Kakarak.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan government officials, however, say that change is
mandatory. And the kind of change they're talking about would
constitute a major departure from U.S. military engagements in the
post-Vietnam era.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans and many U.S. military experts contend that the enemy
pockets that need to be rooted out require surgical strikes by ground
troops. Aerial bombing, even if it is based on intelligence developed
on the ground, is too risky in most situations, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to keep aerial bombardments to a minimum and rely more
on infantry and ground forces--especially since now they are fighting
against small groups of people," said Tayyeb Jawad, chief of staff
for Karzai and until recently a lawyer in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials say American forces are already limiting
airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to retain the ability to use the proper type of
forces for the operational situation," Marine Lt. Col. David Lapan, a
Defense Department spokesman, said in Washington. "In this [July 1]
operation we had ground troops. The air was there for support."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials believe that in the Kakarak incident, as in
several previous bombing raids that killed civilians, the U.S. relied
on intelligence from Afghan informers who were settling personal
scores.</TE>
<TE>   Several ministers, including Foreign Minister Abdullah, say they
want the U.S. to consult closely both with local leaders installed by
the new government and with the Afghan Defense Ministry before
undertaking any bombing raids. But it wouldn't be easy for the U.S.
forces to conduct such consultations and retain the element of
surprise they need to make the raids successful.</TE>
<TE>   In a signal of the depth of the problems already caused by the
July 1 raid, Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai said Friday that he and
the governors of five other ethnic Pushtun provinces in central
Afghanistan, including Oruzgan, would require U.S. forces to seek
their permission before launching military operations in their
region.</TE>
<TE>   He also announced the creation of two militias independent of the
central government, one of which would work with the U.S. military.
Such a development, if it comes to fruition, would be disastrous for
U.S. efforts to foster a strong central government.</TE>
<TE>   The crucial issue is the stability of the nascent government,
according to diplomats and Afghan officials. They warn that if the
U.S. continues to make bombing errors, it will lose support in the
regions where it is most actively pursuing Taliban and Al Qaeda
remnants--and that will play into the hands of destabilizing elements
in Afghan society.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is dependent on the Americans.... But at the local
level it's more complicated. There are long-standing tribal
affiliations that are quite strong, and they can stir up
anti-colonial feelings," said a U.N. official in Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that there isn't a chance for some other
elements in Afghanistan to drive a wedge between Americans and the
Afghan people by taking advantage of such incidents," said Jawad,
Karzai's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   Others see the situation as even more serious. "They have to
change what they are doing. Otherwise, they will look like the
Russians," said a seasoned Western diplomat, noting that the last
experience Afghans had with a foreign power, occupation by Soviet
troops, left them profoundly suspicious of outsiders' intentions and
convinced that the country would do better without them.</TE>
<TE>   The seriousness with which U.S. officials are viewing the Kakarak
incident appears prompted in part by what the soldiers saw when they
entered the village and by the investigative team's interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Several days after the raid, the violence of the attack was still
visible. A huge vat of rice, food for the guests at the engagement
party, lay overturned on the ground, flies swarming around it. Shards
of shrapnel, some quite heavy, littered the area.</TE>
<TE>   In the house where the women had been celebrating--men and women
in rural Afghanistan observe such occasions in separate homes--a hole
that looked as if it had been made by a mortar gaped in the roof. In
the room below, a teakettle lay twisted and burned.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond the compound's walls, a piece of flesh hung from the
branch of a fig tree.</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight on June 30, the scorching summer air had finally
cooled and a group of women, children in their arms, climbed the
narrow stairs to the earth-and-straw roof to enjoy the breeze and
celebrate the man's engagement.</TE>
<TE>   Full from eating rice, they talked and listened to the music of a
traditional drum played by men in the neighboring courtyard and to
the familiar crack of Kalashnikovs being fired in honor of the
groom's coming wedding. They hardly noticed the sound of U.S.
airplanes overhead. Such sweeps are routine here in central
Afghanistan, where it is well known that U.S. troops are still
hunting remnants of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, an AC-130 gunship swept close by, firing what
villagers describe as bombs that exploded at roof level, spraying
lethal shrapnel. Large bullets may have been fired as well. Pentagon
officials have said that the casualties were probably caused by the
gunship's weaponry rather than high-altitude bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "The women were jumping from the roof," said villager Jan, 25, who
was attending the engagement festivities in the neighboring house.</TE>
<TE>   Two sisters and their seven children were killed where they sat,
witnesses said. Another group of women and children--14 children in
all--scrambled down the stairs that led to the courtyard and were
killed as they ran. Some of the bodies were blown into the
neighboring gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "The knees and the other halves of the bodies were 40 meters
apart," said Jan Mohammed, Oruzgan's provincial governor, who on
Karzai's instruction drove through the night to reach the village.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, an articulate and courtly Pushtun, has veered between
sharp criticism--warning of a "jihad against Americans" if they are
not more careful--and more politic comments. But his willingness to
voice his anger at all suggests that the Americans are losing
credibility in a part of Afghanistan where no one disputes that the
U.S. forces need to be operating.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the anger is the fact that this was the second major
mistake in Oruzgan this year: A U.S. raid in January left 21 Afghans
loyal to Karzai dead.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military, for security reasons, has not explained fully
what precipitated the massive attack on Kakarak.</TE>
<TE>   But Army Col. Roger King, the spokesman at Bagram air base north
of Kabul, said several coordinated operations by U.S. forces were
underway the night of the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Army Maj. Gary Tallman, a U.S. spokesman for the Afghan-American
investigating team visiting the region, said the attack came after
antiaircraft artillery was fired from inside the walled compound
where the villagers said the engagement party was being held.</TE>
<TE>   Similar fire reportedly came from nearby villages that lie along
the same river valley as Kakarak. U.S. forces also attacked those
villages and, in one, Siasang, six people died.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan villagers say they were shooting into the air, as is
traditional for celebrations such as engagement parties.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman acknowledged that investigators found no wreckage of an
antiaircraft gun when they visited the compound but said the site had
been identified by U.S. troops on the ground and verified by global
positioning satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials are clearly gratified by the seriousness of the
U.S. investigation, by officials' personal expression of distress and
by the offer of reconstruction aid to the impoverished region.</TE>
<TE>   "Building wells and schools and a power plant, a water plant, that
is very important," Minister Noorzai said.</TE>
<TE>   If it all comes to pass, perhaps growth will come out of grief.
But for the groom, Abdul Malik, 17, who lost his parents in the raid,
the days ahead are dark.</TE>
<TE>   His old life is gone. And it is unlikely that his fiancee will
marry him now that he has no parents, villagers said.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Bankrupt Bankers</HD>
<DH>A timid bureaucracy in a once-admired industry has driven
bad debt to historic levels, another symptom of the nation's aversion
to change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Mizuho Holdings Inc., the world's largest bank, was launched with
great fanfare from the merger of three smaller financial institutions
April 1. Branches were cleaned up, stationery ordered and the Fuji,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Industrial Bank of Japan logos replaced by new
blue-and-red Mizuho signs.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere along the way, however, the new management forgot about
the customers.</LD>
<LD>   What became known as the April Fools' Day fiasco began when
Japanese clients sidled up to Mizuho ATMs and 7,000 of the spiffed-up
machines crashed. By the time matters were sorted out weeks later,
30,000 customers had been double-billed for utility charges and 2.5
million transactions had gone awry.</LD>
<TE>   The subsequent investigation, parliamentary hearings and media
scrutiny only reinforced what most already knew: A banking industry
once feared and admired around the world has lost its way in the
midst of bickering, internal problems and insular thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's poor bank management--with a huge assist from government
regulators--has driven the country's bad debt to historic levels,
worsening its decade-long deflationary slide and adding to its
economic misery. Japan has repeatedly denied the size and scope of
its bad-debt mess--officially pegged at $227 billion for major city
and trust banks. Outsiders say the real number could be several times
worse.</TE>
<TE>   Even this late in the game, most experts say, decisive action
could turn the banking industry around within several painful years.</TE>
<TE>   "But our fear is how much else is going on that we don't know
about," said James Fiorillo, bank analyst with ING Barings. "There's
a lack of accountability throughout the system, which is ultimately
more the fault of regulators and politicians than bankers."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Japanese banking, forget all the mantras about
the customer being king, said Hamao Yokota, who was pressured to
leave his job at a regional bank several years ago after he published
his expose "Diary of an Outlaw Banker." The real kings in Japan
traditionally are the bureaucrats, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Branch managers face their butts toward the customers and their
noses toward headquarters, which in turn faces the ministry," Yokota
said. "People in the branches have been treated like stupid cows,
with anyone who questions the official line transferred to a
toilet-cleaning company or other subsidiary."</TE>
<TE>   The highly regulated nature of the industry has left it wrapped up
in its own little world, responding to its own logic and staffed by
senior managers without courage, vision or a sense of crisis, said
Norboru Yanai, a management consultant and former board member of
Long-Term Credit Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Managers have never really had to manage, since everything
traditionally depended on Finance Ministry approval," he said. "It
sounds unbelievable, but they still don't know how serious a
situation they're in."</TE>
<TE>   Because of a seniority system that is only starting to unravel,
promotions go to those skilled at mediating among internal factions
and who don't rock the boat, insiders say. Speaking out or
aggressively pushing ideas can derail a career.</TE>
<TE>   After writing about his bank, Yokota was given a backbreaking job
delivering hundreds of 42-pound bags of coins each day to racetracks.
He soon got the point and quit.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of independent election committees means that bank
presidents tend to choose successors like themselves. This, coupled
with an emphasis on loyalty, means that many of the same people who
fueled the bad-debt problems a decade ago as mid-level managers now
are running the banks.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes very difficult for them to tackle the problem because
basically they don't want to admit their mistakes," Yanai said.
"They're hoping some divine wind will come along and blow the whole
problem away, allowing them to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's near-zero interest rates further discourage disclosure by
making the short-term cost of delay appear relatively small. For
politicians, bureaucrats and bank executives in Japan's shame-based
culture, there is little upside to acknowledging or admitting
mistakes because someone would then have to take responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Bank managers already know they're bankrupt, but they don't want
to commit [career] suicide," said Michiyasu Hirao, director and head
of global economic studies at Mitsui Global Strategy Studies
Institute. "A bad quality about the Japanese is they tend to postpone
problems."</TE>
<TE>   When problems do come out, they frequently spark a hunt for
scapegoats, a practice that discourages anyone from admitting past
mistakes. In 1998 and 1999 top executives at bankrupt Yamaichi
Securities and Long-Term Credit Bank weren't merely fired. Several
also were arrested on criminal charges and jailed for practices
generally sanctioned or even required by the bureaucrats. Bankers say
this sent a powerful message: Hide your problems at almost any cost
rather than come clean.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the examples of corporate scandal in the United States
have prompted efforts for more transparency here. On the contrary,
banks are effectively encouraged to mask their bad-loan problems in
creative ways.</TE>
<TE>   Until Japan's accounting rules were overhauled recently, banks and
companies hid bad debts in subsidiaries or held investments on the
books at inflated prices.</TE>
<TE>   Others have sought to dilute problems and escape blame by, for
instance, arm-twisting a sister company into building a skyscraper on
a piece of land bought at the height of the speculative frenzy,
hoping the sum total yanks them back above water. More often than
not, however, this amounts to doubling down on an initial bad bet.</TE>
<TE>   The recent wave of big bank mergers, including Mizuho's, offer
another approach. The industry maintains that these unions spur
economies of scale and competitiveness. Yanai, like others, contends
that "mergers don't create any stronger banks; they just foster
escapism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been two years since the wave of mergers was announced, and
we still haven't seen any new direction," Yanai said.</TE>
<TE>   As more details seep out about bank practices during Japan's
speculative bubble period, a different picture emerges of the
nation's financiers, once so respected and feared.</TE>
<TE>   Most bank branch officers knew midway through the 1986-91 period
of excess that the party was unsustainable as real estate prices
softened noticeably, Yokota said. This only intensified the pressure
from headquarters and ultimately the Finance Ministry to accelerate
questionable lending.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who fell behind or bucked the system was exiled or worse.
Yokota said he and colleagues were sprayed in the face with bug spray
and forced to drink vegetable oil when they didn't make their
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   At many banks, those with American MBAs immediately fell under
suspicion, given fears they might try to change bank tradition.</TE>
<TE>   And often bad loans didn't slip through the side door--they strode
proudly through the front gate.</TE>
<TE>   Go Egami, the pen name of a senior banker and author of the expose
"Merciless Banks," said a powerful regulator of his brand-name bank
introduced a member of the yakuza, Japan's organized crime syndicate,
who promptly asked for a large, unsecured loan.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing was ever written down or even said outright. But the bank
felt it had to help the regulator's friend or face problems the next
time it wanted to open a branch or introduce a financial product.
Years later when things soured, the bank was the one left holding the
worthless bag.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how collusive relationships start," Egami said. "This is
the nature of this country."</TE>
<TE>   The banking industry is struggling these days to change its
corporate culture, and a new supervisory agency has taken bank
regulatory authority away from the Finance Ministry. Some top
managers have been offered stock options in a bid to create more
performance incentives. And some banks have started to add outside
directors and introduced merit-based pay systems.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, however, the changes are slow and affect only a few
people with limited influence.</TE>
<TE>   "They're moving in the right direction," bank analyst Fiorillo
said. "As always with Japan, though, it's a matter of scope and
scale."</TE>
<TE>   Hisako Ueno in The Times' Tokyo bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia for $60 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc. has agreed to buy rival Pharmacia Corp. for $60 billion
in stock in a deal that would create the world's largest
pharmaceutical company, according to newspaper reports.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is expected to be announced today, the Wall Street
Journal and New York Times reported. The combined company, with about
$48 billion in revenue, would be the leading pharmaceutical concern
in every major market worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Pfizer nor Pharmacia was available for comment late
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   New York-based Pfizer is already one of the world's biggest drug
makers, with products including Viagra, Lipitor and Zoloft. Peapack,
N.J.-based Pharmacia's major prescription drug is Celebrex, the
blockbuster arthritis medication.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry has been shaken recently on a number
of fronts, from stiff competition from generic drug manufacturers and
sharp stock price drops to concerns about accounting procedures,
lawsuits over high drug prices and increased regulatory pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "The merger certainly bespeaks to a need within the industry to
consolidate," said Berkeley-based health care expert Peter Boland
late Sunday. "It takes so much now to bring a new drug to development
and then to the market that these companies will look to join
forces."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, Pharmacia would proceed with its
previously announced plans to spin off its remaining 84% ownership of
Monsanto Co. to its current shareholders. After the spinoff,
Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer stock for
each share of Pharmacia, valuing Pharmacia stock at $45.08 per share,
representing a 36% premium over Pharmacia's Friday closing price.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the transaction told the Journal they expect
minimal antitrust problems because the companies have few overlapping
products and because Pfizer's global share of total pharmaceutical
sales--currently 8%--would rise only to about 11% if the deal is
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer, whose stock soared in the late 1990s with the success of
the anti-impotence drug Viagra, is no stranger to mega-mergers.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, it completed a $115-billion acquisition of
Warner-Lambert, gaining control of the cholesterol-lowering drug
Lipitor in the process.</TE>

<LD>Re "Racial Animus in Case Denied," July 12: The arrest of Mitchell
Crooks shows what happens when people come forward to show police
brutality. The timing of his arrest smacks of what one would expect
in a police state. I suspect that if he had not videotaped a police
officer slamming a handcuffed minor against a car and later punching
that same minor, Crooks would still be walking the streets.</LD>
<LD>   What kind of example does this put forward? If you dare come
forward and show an abuse of force by law enforcement, look out for a
witch hunt.</LD>

<TE>   Re Inglewood Mayor Roosevelt Dorn's premature comments regarding
Officer Jeremy Morse's conduct: The videotape depicting the incident
is disturbing, but it does not tell the whole story. Did Donovan
Jackson deserve that type of treatment? Probably not. Are there
mitigating events that perhaps shape or justify the officer's
behavior? Maybe. Jackson's father, Coby Chavis, was driving around in
a vehicle with expired license tags. Conversely, if Morse's behavior
is found to be in violation of policy and civil rights, throw the
book at him. Dorn should know better than to be spouting off before
all of the facts are in.</TE>

<TE>   I'm stunned to read and see that once again police officers are
using their authority to abuse the citizens they vow to protect.
Steve Lopez's July 10 column, "Police Culture of Silence Meets the
Roar of an Angry Crowd," rightly points out that this incident would
never have been known if not for the videotape. Morse appears to have
a history of abuse, and with most abusers, history is a good
indication of future repetition. I hope that those with the power to
act do so in order to protect the public.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Valladares</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lopez states that "most cops don't go around beating people up.
The problem is you can't find any cops who'll report the ones who
do." I am a 14-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department with patrol time at four different stations that patrol 13
separate contract cities. Lopez needs to pull his head out of his
collection of old Joseph Wambaugh novels and smell the riot he's
instigating.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California cops are not only quick to make sure witnessed
force is appropriately reported today, more and more often you see
officers stepping in to thwart inappropriate force as it is being
administered. Watch the tape closely and you will see one of the
officers doing just that. Cops today find it more important to keep
their jobs so they can provide for themselves and their families than
risk losing it all for someone who crosses the line. This county has
come a long way since the riots of '92. Don't throw it all away with
"code of silence" allegations.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Disney Pioneer Ward Kimball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward Kimball's passing was a loss for the world of animation, and
even more so for those who knew him (obituary, July 9). I grew up
watching many of the cartoons Ward had animated, and I was fortunate
to have him as a friend and mentor when I began collecting toy trains
in the '70s and '80s. Ward's collection of 19th and 20th century
trains, both real and toy, was legendary. It was Ward who convinced
Walt Disney to make the Disneyland train in Anaheim full-scale rather
than miniature.</LD>
<LD>   And it was Ward who thrilled (and sometimes agitated) neighbors
with his annual "steam ups," in which he chugged his 1881-era Emma
Nevada back and forth on a short stretch of narrow-gauge track; there
wasn't enough room on his property to turn the full-sized locomotive
around. One of my most unforgettable moments was when Ward asked me
to be the engineer in charge of running his toy train layout during
one of these steam-fests.</LD>
<LD>   Ward was more than generous. Once, while I was flying with him to
a toy train show in Ohio, he calmed a frightened 5-year-old by

<LD>Re "Deficits Threaten Doctors' Training," July 10: Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center added 10 years to my mother's life. After her local
gynecologist told my mother that her case was too difficult for him,
a gynecology and oncology expert at Harbor-UCLA performed a
successful hysterectomy for cancer.</LD>
<LD>   We cannot afford to lose the expertise that develops when a
medical center like Harbor-UCLA is affiliated with a medical school
like UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   [County health chief] Dr. Thomas Garthwaite says that "the view of
all health care being tied to a facility that's next-door to a
university is awfully myopic." Evidently it does not hurt to be tied
to an outstanding medical school, which attracts outstanding
physicians. It saved my mother's life.</LD>

(Commentary, July 10). It hit just the right note. To quote Franklin
Roosevelt's famous words when the economy was in free fall, "The only
thing we have to fear is fear itself." Indeed, our worst enemy is not
terror and terrorists, but the fear of terror.</LD>

<LD>It appears that President Bush enriched himself to the tune of
$850,000 as a result of possible insider trading of energy stocks in
a firm that he served as a member of the board and that Vice
President Dick Cheney is being investigated and sued for financial
irregularities of the energy firm he headed (July 11). This is not
exactly a confidence-building state of affairs for ordinary people
who invest in the businesses of the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Many years ago, when I considered entering the securities
business, I was taught that the very essence of our stock market was
the trust that the public placed in the sanctity of financial
reporting and fair auditing and the faith one could expect from the
professionals who ran the businesses of our country. What I see today
is corruption from our highest elected officials and their cronies,
who contribute heavily to ensure their ability to cheat. As I near
retirement I have also seen the deterioration of investments paid for
with my hard-earned money.</LD>
<LD>   It is essential that the securities and financial-market laws on
the books be strenuously enforced and that additional, tough
legislation be enacted to fill the gaps--not the soft-pedal job that
the president suggested. That will be the only way we can restore
confidence to the bruised securities market.</LD>

<TE>   What relief to read the latest alarm bell being rung by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft about the possibility of Al Qaeda sleeper cells being
active in the U.S. (July 12). Just when I start to think about the
foundering economy, the rampant misdeeds of our corporations and
their leadership, the explosion in deficit spending and the
ineffectiveness of our political leadership in dealing with these
issues, Ashcroft moved swiftly to refocus my attention where it
belongs, anywhere but on the president and his domestic policies.</TE>

<TE>   Putting loss of life aside, I would suggest that the corporate
malfeasance from Enron, WorldCom and other companies is as
destructive to the well-being of our national democracy and national
ethos as anything that occurred Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   These CEOs and CFOs, all of whose neighbors and friends would
likely describe them as good and even "Christian" human beings, have
displayed an appalling lack of integrity and ethics in pursuit of the
almighty dollar.</TE>
<TE>   It speaks volumes of our national values that the primary question
that will be asked of them is whether illegal acts were committed.
That question should, indeed, be asked, but simply because something
may be "legally done" does not make it the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   As a nation, we no longer seem to think about what is right or
just; we think only about what is legal. To the degree that we
continue to do only that (and to the degree that we continue to link
democracy and extreme capitalism, i.e., "the maximization of profit
at any cost"), the country is in serious trouble.</TE>

<LD>Re "Risks of Hormone Therapy Stop Study," July 10: I was diagnosed
with breast cancer. I had been on hormone replacement therapy for 10
years, a double dose. I did not know at that time what the "standard"
dose was, nor was I given any warning of possible side effects. When
I asked my doctor if the HRT could have caused the cancer, he laughed
at me.</LD>
<LD>   I hope this article will save women's lives. My suggestion is to
have at least second and third opinions on this issue. My lump was
discovered by an annual mammogram and was very small. With some
doctors now questioning the value of an annual mammogram, I would
like to suggest that women educate themselves and ask lots of
questions.</LD>

<TE>   Re your July 11 editorial: Far from taking female hormones to
retain the "nubile" look, my wife has been constantly instructed by
her doctors to take hormone replacement therapy to lessen the
possibility of future heart attacks and strokes. It now appears that
her doctors were as ignorant of the true effects as you are in
pontificating on the reasons why most women took these hormones.</TE>

<LD>Re "Infant's Body Found in Trash," July 10: How sad that a newborn
baby can be discarded even though a California "safe haven" law
exists. How many young girls are unaware that this law gives them an
alternative to abandoning (killing) their baby?</LD>
<LD>   I suggest that billboards promoting this law be posted in and near
schools, shopping malls, movie theaters, bus stops, fast-food outlets
and other areas. Get their attention; put these ads where the
vulnerable girls can see them. In addition, this law should be taught
to children beginning in the seventh grade at every school. When so
many people would love to adopt a healthy newborn baby, how pathetic
that our society has this law but does not publicize it more.</LD>

<HD>B. Brazdzionis, 95; Lithuanian Poet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernardas Brazdzionis, a Lithuanian American poet who gave voice to
hundreds of thousands of emigres during decades of Soviet occupation
of his native country, has died. He was 95.</LD>
<LD>   Brazdzionis died at his Los Angeles home Thursday after a long
illness, said a granddaughter, Roberta Trotman.</LD>
<LD>   Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus issued a statement in tribute
to Brazdzionis, who emigrated to the West as Soviet troops occupied
the Baltic Sea coastal nation in 1944 and whose poetry often focused
on the plight of his homeland under communist rule.</LD>
<TE>   "We have lost a prominent man whose life and creations fatally
coincided with the tragic events of the Lithuanian nation and the
years of longing for freedom," Adamkus said.</TE>
<TE>   While Brazdzionis already was an established poet during
Lithuania's first period of independence in 1918-1940, his stature
increased in exile.</TE>
<TE>   "He reacted to exile with fiercely patriotic verse in which the
outrage against the injustice to his nation and defiance of tyranny
raised to a highly emotional, almost hysterical pitch," said literary
critic Rimvydas Silbajoris.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1907 in the northeastern village of Stebeikeliai,
Brazdzionis settled permanently in the United States in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote or edited about 50 books, including children's books and
poetry collections. He also edited several periodicals about
Lithuanian literature.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his granddaughter Trotman, Brazdzionis is survived
by his wife, Aldona; a son, Algis; a sister, Maryte Dagys; seven
other grandchildren; 19 great-grandchildren; and one
great-great-granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday at St. Casimir's
Catholic Church in Los Angeles. He will be buried in Kaunas,
Lithuania.</TE>

<HD>How to Swim With the Sharks? Get a Head Start</HD>
<DH>Charity: San Clemente relay's 60-mile route crosses fishing
contest that uses blood and guts as bait. Swim's been moved up, but
must finish on time.</DH>

<LD>When Craig Taylor and his five teammates set up this week's relay
swim from San Clemente Island to the Orange County coast, they knew
the grueling 60-mile course might include swift currents, nasty
weather and choppy surf.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't know it included water filled with bloody shark bait.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the charity swim for the City of Hope cancer center
were surprised to learn their ocean relay coincided with the third
annual Mako Shark Tournament, which will be launched out of the Dana
Point Harbor.</LD>
<TE>   Shark fishermen are expected to chum the water with gallons of
bloody fish guts near the final leg of the relay swim, which ends at
the San Clemente Pier. "That's something we didn't even think of,"
said Taylor, 48, who helped organize the fund-raiser for the cancer
center's pediatric division. "We checked on a lot of different
things, but a mako shark tournament didn't cross our minds. None of
us are fishermen, so we weren't even thinking that way."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, relay swimmer Jim Fitzpatrick heard about the
shark-fishing tournament. He found out the chumming festivities are
to begin Saturday morning at 6 and conclude Sunday afternoon, about
the time the swimming relay was expected to finish at the pier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Danger Researched</TE>
<TE>   The swimmers, all with years of experience in deep water, had
researched the shark danger through the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in La Jolla. They were told blue and mako sharks might
be in the area, but that they usually weren't aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   But then they learned the water off San Clemente was being chummed
and that they could become breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy basically said all bets are off when you start putting
fish guts and blood in the water," Taylor said. "That stuff filters
down and brings the sharks in, and they can get irritated."</TE>
<TE>   The group decided to move the swim up to Friday morning and take
its chances.</TE>
<TE>   Now, swimmers will board boats for San Clemente Island on Friday
about 2 a.m. The relay is expected to begin at 7 a.m., and swimmers
should pass shark-infested waters off the coast a few hours before
the fishermen begin chumming Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, if we could make it past that point by then, we'd
be in and finishing at San Clemente Pier about 8:30 or 9 a.m. [on
Saturday]," Taylor said. "If we're not past the area by then, maybe
we can we skirt them and go around. If the current is going south to
north, maybe we'll go to the south. This could be quite conceivably
be the biggest single issue that keeps us from doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Swimmer Scott Zornig, 42, knows about swimming with sharks. Three
years ago in a Maui channel relay he got out of the water just as a
15-foot tiger shark closed in. His team and 15 others pulled out of
the race.</TE>
<TE>   The six members of this week's relay team will swim one-hour legs.
A support crew will stand by. At least two teammates will act as
observers on the support boat, looking for sharks and other dangers.
At least one kayaker will paddle alongside, acting as the swimmers'
guide.</TE>
<TE>   If Taylor and his group complete the swim, they will be the first
known to do so. It's a long trip from San Clemente Island and the
water is treacherous. In addition, shipping lanes must be crossed.</TE>
<TE>   So far, organizers have raised about $60,000 for the cancer
center.</TE>

<HD>R. Kommerstad, 75; Advised Investors</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert M. Kommerstad, founder of the Pasadena-based investment firm
Provident Investment Counsel Inc. and a philanthropist who gave
substantially to help college and high school students study finance,
has died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health for the last six months, Kommerstad died
Thursday of heart failure at his home in the San Gabriel Valley
community of Bradbury.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime leader of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America,
Kommerstad was himself a self-made man.</LD>
<TE>   He grew up in Minneapolis, the son of the owner of a dairy
delivery business. His mother worked as a cook. When Kommerstad was
10, his father died of colon cancer. His older brother quit high
school to help his mother support the family.</TE>
<TE>   But Kommerstad stayed in school, earning varsity letters in
football, basketball and baseball at South High in Minneapolis. He
became the first member of his family to go to college, earning an
undergraduate degree at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Air Force, Kommerstad earned his law degree
at the University of Minnesota. He moved to California in 1955 to
find his fortune.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Kommerstad and a partner opened Provident Investment
Counsel. His income that year was $12,000. The company showed steady
growth over the next three decades, and by the early 1990s
Provident's clients had $4.5 billion invested with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Kommerstad's role in Big Brothers started three decades ago. He
volunteered his time and eventually mentored three boys. He also
served on the board of directors of Big Brothers of Greater Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, he served as chairman of the national board of Big
Brothers/Big Sisters of America. Associates said his disciplined
management style helped tighten the organization's business practices
and focus. In his first three years as chairman, the group grew from
serving 138,000 children to 221,000 across the country.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the board of trustees at the University of Minnesota
law school, Kommerstad created its Center for Business Law and
Entrepreneurship by donating $1 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Provident donated $250,000 each to business
classes at USC and UCLA so students could learn how to manage
portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, when Kommerstad returned to South High in Minneapolis for
its 100th anniversary, he talked to school officials about setting up
a similar program there. Within months, Kommerstad and school
officials had established guidelines for the program, which he funded
with a personal donation of $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his role at Provident, Kommerstad was a founder and
served on the board of directors of Mellon First Business Bank in Los
Angeles and was on several other corporate boards.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Lila; and a daughter,
Carol of Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in Kommerstad's
name be made to Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial reception will be held Aug. 17 at the Annandale Country
Club in Pasadena.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Bear Gifts to GOP Colleagues</HD>

<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>There are no red roses, mood lights or romantic melodies, but make no
mistake: There is a sweet seduction taking place these days in the
state Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to pass a budget without having to strike a deal with GOP
leaders, Democratic suitors are coyly pursuing individual Republican
lawmakers with whispered suggestions of pork projects and other
political trinkets.</LD>
<LD>   "It isn't a glass of red wine or a steak dinner," said Assemblyman
Tom Harman (R-Huntington Beach). "They offer you big bucks for your
district."</LD>
<TE>   The hope is that, for a relatively low political price, four
Assembly Republicans will break party ranks and help Democrats
approve the new spending package that passed in the Senate on June
29.</TE>
<TE>   A similar strategy worked last year when Democrats ended a
three-week budget stalemate by sidestepping Republican leadership and
showering a few GOP legislators with such district goodies as tax
breaks for farmers and cash for rural sheriffs.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, however, that approach hasn't worked. A
stalemate over a $99-billion spending plan enters its third week
today, with Assembly Democratic leaders appearing to be two GOP votes
short of the four they need if all 50 Democrats, some of whom have
their own issues with the plan, decide to support it.</TE>
<TE>   It's not for lack of trying.</TE>
<TE>   Harman said Democrats have hinted at helping a cause dear to his
heart: preserving Orange County's Bolsa Chica mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't directly say we could help you there if you're
interested, but it was implied," Harman said. "They talked to me in
general terms. They said we could probably work something out if
you're interested, and I told them I wasn't interested."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) said he was approached on
the Assembly floor recently by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), who asked Richman if he was still interested in a
constitutional amendment he had introduced earlier with Assemblyman
Joe Canciamilla (D-Pittsburg). It would earmark a fixed percentage of
the state's general fund every year for infrastructure projects such
as roads and schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asked if I was interested in talking about it in the
context of the budget," Richman said. "I said I was very interested,
but that discussion needed to occur through [Assembly Republican
Leader] Dave Cox. I made it clear I was not going to be peeled off
from the Republican caucus."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to approaching individual GOP lawmakers--or maybe as a
concession that they aren't making enough progress--Democratic
leaders in the Assembly initiated talks last week with the Republican
leadership, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Our obligation is to pass a budget," Steinberg said. "The various
strategies are not mutually exclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans want deeper spending cuts to avoid $4 billion in new
taxes and other new revenue, a wish that, if granted, would cause
Democrats, many of whom want more taxes, to back away from the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot solve this problem responsibly by attempting to cut $4
billion more from the budget," Steinberg said. "When push comes to
shove, what you really are talking about is funding for public
education and police and fire protection--services that the public
expects to be top state priorities."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Gov. Gray Davis has made clear his intention to peel
off the minimum number of Republican legislators rather than
negotiating with their leaders, whom Davis has described as bent on
holding up the budget. A letter signed last week by 28 of the 30
Assembly Republicans challenging Davis to abandon his political
strategy of picking off votes failed to sway him.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is interested in getting a budget passed, which
requires a minimum of four Republican votes," Davis spokeswoman
Hilary McLean said. "He certainly would like more, however. If the
Assembly Republican caucus would like to get organized and engaged in
the budget process, we would welcome them to the debate."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Leader Cox of Fair Oaks suggested that Davis had
miscalculated and that the governor's public claims that he would
peel off four GOP legislators have given members of his caucus a
cause to rally around.</TE>
<TE>   "You ever been on a farm?" Cox asked. "Once you allow a dog to get
into the henhouse and suck the eggs, you can't cure a dog from
sucking eggs. So when in fact you do that once, you believe that's
the model for doing it again. That's what's transpired here."</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons that this year is more difficult than last for
Democrats. The $4 billion in new taxes and other revenue, for
example, is a substantial increase that runs counter to the most
elementary Republican fiscal principles and would be difficult for
any GOP legislator to defend politically.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans find cause for alarm in the fact that the state's
nonpartisan legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, projects that the
state will face multibillion-dollar budget gaps over the next five
fiscal years.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Republicans who gave in to the Democrats' overtures
last year paid a steep political price. They received a battering
from fellow GOP lawmakers and local newspapers who called them
sellouts--or worse. None got hit harder than Sacramento-area
Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sacramento Bee political cartoon, he was portrayed as a cheap
hooker in fishnet stockings on a street corner being hit on by
then-Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, who was pictured behind the
wheel of a large sedan asking Pescetti what his price was.</TE>
<TE>   Pescetti says unequivocally that he will not cast a vote for the
budget again this year and cited the tax hikes that pay for the plan
as the reason why.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one conversation with someone from the governor's office
and I said I was a no vote," Pescetti said. "We have a $24-billion
deficit. To turn around and raise taxes and not deal with the
spending issue is a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Pescetti, the GOP assemblymen who voted for the budget
last year were Mike Briggs of Fresno, Dick Dickerson of Redding and
David Kelley of Idyllwild. Dickerson lost a state Senate primary last
spring in which his budget vote became an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley and Dickerson have said they are undecided this year, but
neither joined their caucus in voting against the budget or in
signing last week's letter to Davis. Consequently, many believe they
will ultimately support the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Like Pescetti, Briggs has said he will not vote for the budget as
proposed, leaving Democrats to search further for at least two
Republican votes.</TE>
<TE>   They may need more, given that some Democrats are unhappy with the
spending package, saying higher taxes, rather than tighter spending,
are needed to eliminate the threat of ongoing budget gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Briggs chuckled when asked to confirm a rumor that he had been
offered a state trade office post in Japan in exchange for his budget
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never vote for anything personal for me like a job or a
better parking spot," Briggs said. "I'm very pure when it comes to
acting for my district."</TE>
<TE>   Briggs had a change of heart during last year's budget battle
after Democrats agreed to a list of district priorities that he had
previously laid out for Davis. They included tax breaks for farmers
and an agreement to let voters decide whether to dedicate the state
gasoline sales tax to transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats clearly went to extraordinary lengths to win his
support.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the more comical moments of last year's budget
stalemate, Assemblyman Herb Wesson, the Culver City Democrat who is
now Assembly speaker, was among a group of past and present
legislators who used a speedboat to chase down Briggs, who was
floating along the Sacramento River in his houseboat.</TE>
<TE>   The clandestine operation scared Briggs, who compared it with a
scene from a James Bond movie, and Democrats failed to get his vote
that day. But he later supported the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I had what I considered the best budget in history for
my district," Briggs said.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is probably one of the worst. All it offers is tax
increases which would be greater than the tax cuts I got last year
for my district."</TE>
<TE>   Briggs said he met with the governor about a month ago and rattled
off a fresh list of district priorities that include no tax hikes,
deeper spending cuts and a balanced budget this year and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are really the things my constituents are standing up and
screaming about," Briggs said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Democrats haven't bitten.</TE>

<HD>Rookie Speaker Takes Full Control of Assembly With Tough
Politicking on Global Warming Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Herb Wesson of Culver City was sworn in as Assembly speaker Feb. 6.
But the Democrat didn't really become speaker until July 1, when he
sweet-talked and strong-armed a landmark global warming bill through
his house.</LD>
<LD>   On that day, the former top aide to L.A. County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke "used every tool in the speaker's toolbox," says one
insider, and showed he can handle the job. The bill passed with no
votes to spare.</LD>
<LD>   Then Wesson abruptly fired the chairman of the Joint Legislative
Audit Committee, which had embarrassed the Davis administration by
investigating its signing of a no-bid, $95-million, overpriced
software contract with Oracle Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The committee chairman, Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), next
was planning to investigate the troubled Veterans Affairs Department.
Florez contends that intent and the aggressive Oracle probe are why
he was canned.</TE>
<TE>   It's an irresistible story. But the sacking actually was much less
about Florez's running of the investigations than about his running
out on the speaker during partisan floor jockeying over the global
warming bill.</TE>
<TE>   "He should have been in his chair doing his job," Wesson insists.
"When Republicans are playing games and we're playing games, that's
when you need to be a team player.... I hate to sound like this is a
penal colony, but we were on a lock-down. I was unaware anybody had
left."</TE>
<TE>   Florez sneaked out of the Capitol and caught a charter plane home
to watch his 11-year-old son play in a baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   All this is inside baseball--intriguing hardball. In Florez's
case, bean-ball.</TE>
<TE>   It's the game that used to be played by speakers before term
limits transformed them into timid, two-year lame ducks. Speakers
these days reward colleagues to keep them happy but don't punish
strays to keep others in line. They dish out carrots, shelve the
sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, 50, was picking up a reputation for being too nice, not
only to colleagues but to special interests that shovel out campaign
checks.</TE>
<TE>   His Assembly seatmate, Democrat Fran Pavley of Agoura Hills,
offered an opportunity to recast the image. She was pushing a bill to
place California at the national forefront of fighting global
warming. Her measure, after Gov. Gray Davis signs it, will direct the
state Air Resources Board to set carbon dioxide standards for motor
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over greenhouse gasses gave the rookie speaker a chance
to do something historic, earn the plaudits of national Democrats and
stand up to special interests--namely auto manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a high, hanging curveball," says a Wesson strategist. A
home run ball.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), a staunch
supporter of the bill, struck a deal that delivered one key Assembly
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Burton agreed to allow Senate passage of a measure toughening Bay
Area auto smog controls. Drifting Bay Area smog pollutes the Central
Valley. The smog bill's author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza
(D-Merced), then agreed to vote for the global warming measure.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists secured the vote of Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
(D-Panorama City) by offering him a "fresh start." They opposed him
in his last L.A. City Council race, but he plans to run again.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson coordinated brokering.</TE>
<TE>   He picked up the vote of Assemblywoman Sally Havice (D-Cerritos).
She's termed out in November, Wesson notes, and "I might be able to
assist her in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The speaker persuaded Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) to
cast a "courtesy vote" for Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles),
who was home because of the recent death of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In all his cajoling, Wesson says, "I helped provide that little
extra they needed to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear how Florez might have voted. Pavley believed he
planned to vote for the bill. So did Burton. But Florez denies it,
saying he'd have voted for the measure only if the Bay Area smog bill
had been taken up with it.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson says he wasn't counting on Florez's vote for the bill but
was counting on him to help foil Republican procedural jockeying.
Like speakers of old, Wesson felt he could not allow insolence to go
unpunished, especially from such an unpopular maverick.</TE>
<TE>   "Herb gave me the death penalty for a speeding ticket," Florez
says.</TE>
<TE>   Florez, 39, is headed for the Senate in November and has statewide
ambitions. This is the view of his veteran consultant, Richie Ross,
who also helped ramrod the bill:</TE>
<TE>   "Herb did Florez a huge favor. I've never seen a guy get better
publicity. Herb had to prove his speakership and he did. Both are

<HD>Last Roundup at Irvine Ranch Ends 2 Centuries of Tradition</HD>
<DH>Development: The land, first grazed when Spanish monks
claimed it, will yield to a six-lane thoroughfare and hundreds of
ritzy homes.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The outraged bellow of a lone cow is the first clue, followed by the
faint cries of cowboys.</LD>
<LD>   Half a dozen men and women pop up on horseback over a far ridge.
Moving daintily on their high-stepping horses, they gather the cattle
into one molten brown mass flowing up over the ridge and down.</LD>
<LD>   The setting isn't Wyoming or Montana. It's the last cattle roundup
on Orange County's storied Irvine Ranch. It is a deliberately
unremarked-upon event by the Irvine Co., the land's developer--no
press releases, no television news cameras, not even many cattle left
after so many years.</LD>
<TE>   There have been cattle here for almost 200 years, since Spanish
monks claimed a knobby ridge sticking up between the Santa Ana
Mountains and the Pacific Ocean and christened it Lomas de Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the old ways have lingered along Loma Ridge off
Santiago Canyon Road, out beyond the miles of shopping malls and
tract homes.</TE>
<TE>   Each November, the best beef cattle money can buy have been
shipped from Idaho to winter here at the back edge of the county, on
the rain-fed grass and sagebrush-clad hills. Now, they're being moved
out--for good.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. owner Donald Bren is proceeding with final build-out
plans for the ranch and getting out of the cattle business. His
livestock will be auctioned, fattened for a year and end up on
American picnic tables by next Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   The cattle aren't the only ones going.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't need us any more," said Mike Bias, 44, a cowboy who
has grazed as many as 950 pairs of cattle on the ranch. Like many a
superstitious cowboy who has seen too many young animals die, Bias
doesn't count the calves individually until they are sold. They are
"paired" with their mothers until then.</TE>
<TE>   When Bias started working on the ranch in 1993, the herd was
mostly on the bluffs above Pacific Coast Highway. Development has
gradually pushed ranching operations inland.</TE>
<TE>   Each fall, when Bias and his family return from Idaho, where they
care for Bren's cattle through the summer months, they try to figure
out what else is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back one year, and to see what they'd done to Mare
Pasture, it made you sick to your stomach," said his wife, Shawn
Bias, 37. "It's where they put in that golf course, what do they call
it now? Shady Canyon."</TE>
<TE>   Here along Orange County's back edge, a world apart has remained,
at right angles to the busy suburban streets and highways. The old
dirt two-laners follow the land's curves, and their names reflect a
genuine past.</TE>
<TE>   "When you shut that gate behind you, the whole world goes away,"
said Mike Bias, looking at the turnoff to his family's lane from
Santiago Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it is their turn to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. declined to comment on the end of cattle ranching
operations and plans for the area.</TE>
<TE>   But county planning records and company maps show the
teacup-shaped canyon where the Biases live half the year--a farmyard
filled with towering live oaks, rambling roses and sweet
honeysuckle--becoming a six-lane extension of Jeffrey Road out of
Irvine, dotted with hundreds of multimillion-dollar homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day when I ride out now, I think 'last chances,' " said
Shawn Bias: "Last chance to see this hillside. Last chance to see
this mama bird and her little baby in that nest."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband earned $22,000 gross this year as a top-ranked cowboy.
They live rent-free in the old farmhouse, which, if the legend is
true, was moved up from the dry bed of nearby Irvine Lake during the
Depression. She supplements their income by breeding palomino horses.</TE>
<TE>   With development not set to begin for at least a year, Mike Bias
had asked the company in April if he could lease the house and a
small pasture.</TE>
<TE>   His wife could continue to raise her horses, and their two girls
would be able to finish out the school year.</TE>
<TE>   "They just couldn't see clear to doing it," said Bias, adding that
the company's director of agricultural operations told him:</TE>
<TE>   " 'They're afraid people will like what you're doing, then oppose
'em when it comes time to develop.' "</TE>
<TE>   They were told they could stay two weeks after the last cattle
were loaded onto trucks, then the power would be cut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The day of reckoning arrives. On a misty morning in late May, the
Bias' border collies have scrambled onto their kennel rooftops,
barking and whining furiously, fearful of being left behind. The
farmyard is full of dust from horses' hoofs, and the chatter of half
a dozen ranch hands saddling up for the last roundup.</TE>
<TE>   A short reprieve has come, in a phone call from the boss the night
before. They can stay on the ranch for up to 90 days while they look
for other work. The ranch foreman and president also wrote Mike a
reference, calling him "an outstanding horseman and cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, though, all that matters is the ride.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is a familiar one after so many years: They'll drive the
cattle up over Loma Ridge from a skinny valley called Shoe String
Trap, let the cattle spend a final day in the open, then herd them
down to Bee Flat.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the calves at first frolic along the hillside, then start
running after their mothers and bawling once they realize they won't
be allowed to stop and suckle.</TE>
<TE>   Civilization is just four miles down the road now, at Jamboree
Road and Chapman Avenue, where a decade ago a corner shopping center
and the pink rooftops of Santiago Hills Phase 1 displaced the cattle
and row crops.</TE>
<TE>   The encroachment has come with a silver lining. The Biases have
free help from weekend cowhands eager to assist on a real ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd charge you thousands of dollars to do this on a dude
ranch," Shawn Bias jokes to Cindy Cousine, a United Airlines flight
attendant from Tustin who learned about the Biases at the stable
where she and her husband board their horses. The couples have become
close friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a blessing from day one to be on a working ranch in my
own backyard," Cousine said. "I'm a part of history. People are not
even going to realize this was ever here. This is the end."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, as cowboys and cattle thrash through giant live
oak and sycamore stands toward Bee Flat, one cow makes a run for it,
heading back out who knows where--just not into that iron corral.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bias and his horse whirl and run, a blur following the animal
through the trees. Hat flying, his lariat snaking out from his right
side like a rattler uncoiling, he reins in 1,100 pounds of sharp hoof
and stubborn fur. The cow wearily turns and trots the half-mile back
toward the corral. Bias is drenched in sweat, taciturn, his clear
blue eyes blazing.</TE>
<TE>   He and the hands sort out calves and mothers, getting a head start
on the next day's work as red-tailed hawks and vultures wheel
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   As the cowboys head in, a lone bellow echoes from one cow pen like
a half-strangled bugler playing Taps.</TE>
<TE>   Starting at 6 the next morning, in the tight confines of the
corral, the timeless singsong of tongue and whip cajoles and stings
the cattle into a narrow wooden chute, then up an ancient, creaking
ramp into a tractor-trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "Heh heh heh, shhhh, babies, babies, babies," croons Bias under
his breath as he hurries half a dozen nervous calves tumbling over
each other up the ramp.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our favorite haul; it's just a good place to come to,"
says one truck driver as he pushes the animals in with a long,
battery-charged prod. "Good people."</TE>
<TE>   A state inspector is on hand, checking brands for any neighbors'
cattle that might have gotten mixed in. It's a formality; there
haven't been any neighbors' cattle here for years.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 a.m., the work is almost done. The last cows are always the
toughest. They're the biggest and the smartest, and they've been
through this before, so they have kicked all the others out of the
holding pen ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   As one last, angry behemoth whirls in the tight chute, Bias and
his horse, Robin, face off against her, working her around and up the
ramp.</TE>
<TE>   After the herd is loaded, the men stand in a small circle,
reluctant to go just yet. They kick at the powdery dirt, then glance
east toward the Santa Ana Mountains. After the driest winter on
record, thick storm clouds gather.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the drivers clamber into their cabs. As they turn into
morning traffic on Santiago Canyon Road, a cold rain descends.</TE>
<TE>   "We-ell," says Bias as he shuts the last gate behind him. "It's
done. Job done."</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn the next day, he and Shawn head for Idaho and Oregon
in search of work. After several weeks and several tries, they get
lucky in a tiny Oregon town. By the Fourth of July, the old farmhouse
sits empty, the gates to the lane padlocked tight.</TE>
<TE>   The back hills of the Irvine Ranch are silent now, save for the
echoes heard by those who know.</TE>

<LD>Three years after sex scandals and mismanagement prompted broad
reform at California's only coed juvenile prison, a new state
investigation has found "serious problems" at the Ventura Youth
Correctional Facility and recommended it either be limited to only
female inmates or possibly closed.</LD>
<LD>   The highly critical audit by Inspector General Steve White cites a
host of administrative problems at the Camarillo youth prison, many
related to the need to separate male and female prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   But it fails to address fresh allegations by a prison volunteer
that male employees sexually exploit young female wards--a claim
still under review by White's office.</LD>
<TE>   The new report focuses on essential services that fall through the
cracks at the Ventura facility because employees and facilities must
be shared by young men and women who are separated by a $1-million,
16-foot-tall fence and cannot come into contact with one other.
Numerous pregnancies of female wards over two decades prompted the
costly segregation.</TE>
<TE>   "This separation of males and females, which is the result of
several incidents between wards of both genders, has created
duplication of services and a stain on resources," White said in a
54-page report to California Youth Authority Director Jerry Harper.</TE>
<TE>   "The institution's problems encompass the full spectrum of the
facility's operation," White said, "including ward treatment
services, medical services, mental health services, education,
fund-raising, internal investigations and institution security."</TE>
<TE>   The audit found that the Ventura facility is weeks late in
evaluating the mental health of female prisoners, many of whom have
emotional problems; that some prison practices jeopardize the health
of wards and babies born to them; and that the prison fails to
provide counseling sessions to inmates as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   The report, released last week to Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth
Jackson, prompted the Santa Barbara Democrat to call for a joint
hearing in August before the Senate Public Safety Committee and the
Legislative Women's Caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very troubled by these findings," said Jackson, vice chair of
the women's caucus. "And when you put it in the context that they've
had four superintendents in five years in Ventura, there are some
real problems there."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also called for a complete investigation into allegations
by Sheryl Fisher, a former volunteer at the youth prison. The Somis
resident--a mentor, literacy tutor and chaplain's aide to wards for 3
1/2 years--has complained to the inspector general, Jackson and other
state lawmakers about what she sees as a pattern of sexual misconduct
by employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it cleaned up," Fisher said in an interview Friday. She
said she resigned as a volunteer in frustration in February partly
because her complaints prompted little change.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't stop the hanky-panky between the adult males and the
females," she said. "The females are manipulative, but that doesn't
mean the males should go along. It's against the law, and the law is
being broken there."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said two former inmates told her they had sex with
employees while imprisoned. She said she's aware of several guards
and counselors who wards say trade favors for sex.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to stop such conduct, Fisher said, is to remove male
guards from oversight of the female wards--a change state officials
say is opposed by the prison peace officers union and may not be
effective anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Harper, the youth authority director, said Friday he welcomed the
inspector general's recommendations--and a legislative hearing--as
ways to improve not only the Ventura facility but the entire youth
authority system of 11 prisons and four camps.</TE>
<TE>   Once a nationwide model, the system has drawn fire from the
Legislature, the inspector general and youth law advocates in recent
years for subjecting wards to excessive force and for failing to
offer mental health and rehabilitation programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're making improvements, but we've got a long way to go
in some areas," said Harper, a former Los Angeles County assistant
sheriff hired 25 months ago to reform the system. "We've focused on
the girls, the young ladies, in Ventura. We can't solve all of the
problems in a year or two, but we're making progress."</TE>
<TE>   Harper confirmed that the inspector general is conducting a
separate inquiry into sexual misconduct by Ventura County employees.</TE>

<DH>Camarillo: State audit recommends the youth prison be

<LD>Three years after sex scandals and mismanagement prompted broad
reform at California's only coed juvenile prison, a new state
investigation has found "serious problems" at the Ventura Youth
Correctional Facility and recommended it either be limited to only
female inmates or possibly closed.</LD>
<LD>   The highly critical audit by Inspector General Steve White cites a
host of administrative problems at the Camarillo youth prison, many
related to the need to separate male and female prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   But it fails to address fresh allegations by a prison volunteer
that male employees sexually exploit young female wards--a claim
still under review by White's office.</LD>
<TE>   The new report focuses on essential services that fall through the
cracks at the Ventura facility because employees and facilities must
be shared by young men and women who are separated by a $1-million,
16-foot-tall fence and cannot come into contact with one other.
Numerous pregnancies of female wards over two decades prompted the
costly segregation.</TE>
<TE>   "This separation of males and females, which is the result of
several incidents between wards of both genders, has created
duplication of services and a strain on resources," White said in a
54-page report to California Youth Authority Director Jerry Harper.</TE>
<TE>   "The institution's problems encompass the full spectrum of the
facility's operation," White said, "including ward treatment
services, medical services, mental health services, education,
fund-raising, internal investigations and institution security."</TE>
<TE>   The audit found that the Ventura facility is weeks late in

guards from oversight of the female wards--a change state officials
say is opposed by the prison peace officers union and may not be

<TE>   Harper, the youth authority director, said Friday he welcomed the
inspector general's recommendations--and a legislative hearing--as
ways to improve not only the Ventura facility but the entire youth
authority system of 11 prisons and four camps.</TE>
<TE>   Once a nationwide model, the system has drawn fire from the
Legislature, the inspector general and youth law advocates in recent
years for subjecting wards to excessive force and failing to offer
mental health and rehabilitation programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're making improvements, but we've got a long way to go
in some areas," said Harper, a former Los Angeles County assistant
sheriff hired 25 months ago to reform the system. "We've focused on
the girls, the young ladies, in Ventura. We can't solve all of the
problems in a year or two, but we're making progress."</TE>
<TE>   Harper confirmed that the inspector general is conducting a
separate inquiry into sexual misconduct by Ventura County employees.</TE>
<TE>   So far, one guard has resigned under threat of firing for writing
improper letters to a ward. Another employee left under pressure
about a year ago, he said. One or two other employees are still under
investigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are problems that occur in institutions throughout the
country," Harper said. "That's the nature of the business. It's human
nature, and to say we're going to set up a system where we're going
to guarantee there won't be relations between staff and [inmates] is
ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   The point is, he said, that the youth authority is doing what it
can to prevent such situations from happening again and punishing
those involved when they do.</TE>
<TE>   Harper said he will meet with Ventura County facility Supt.
Eugenia Ortega this week to discuss the inspector general's findings.
Ortega has run the prison since November, and the audit is seen as a
baseline study by which she can be judged in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to sit down on the 19th and go over that paragraph by
paragraph and say, 'What are your plans on this and this?' item by
item," Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   From there, problems will be corrected at the prison level, and
larger issues such as the future of the Ventura facility prison will
be addressed by lawmakers and the governor.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's recommendation to make the Ventura County
facility a prison only for young females, or to close it altogether,
was already under consideration, Harper said. That's because a
statewide drop in juvenile inmates from 7,600 two years ago to 5,850
today has created a need to close one to three of the youth
authority's prisons. A decision on closures will probably be made by
Nov. 1, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without commenting on the 580-ward Camarillo facility's future,
Harper said it is operating far better than it was three years ago,
when scandal led to removal of the prison's top three administrators.</TE>
<TE>   That 2 1/2-year investigation ended in 1999, after 15 employees
were fired or forced to resign for having improper relations with
inmates, including five who had sex with prisoners. Sixteen other
employees were either reprimanded, counseled or reassigned for a
variety of lesser offenses, including failure to report suspicious
behavior between adult employees and young wards.</TE>
<TE>   In a scathing analysis, the inspector general's office reported
then that the Ventura facility had "a systemic problem" of lax
management that allowed sexual misconduct by employees and inmates to
continue. It noted "a climate of fear among employees" and a system
slow to react to chronic problems.</TE>
<TE>   The new inspector general's report highlights some of the same
problems--a flawed system of internal investigations and a casual
handling of inmate complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general found "significant deficiencies" in
preliminary internal investigations, including failure to properly
screen the investigators themselves or to keep files confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to state law, one investigator retained his position, the
audit found, despite a litany of serious offenses, including use of
racial preference in hiring ward workers, failure to report staff
misconduct and over-familiarity with wards.</TE>
<TE>   Some inquiries were so badly botched in their early stages that
employees were either not punished for provable misconduct or placed
in positions for which they were not qualified.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a peace officer facing serious charges retired only
after the inspector general discovered his case languishing without
action and forwarded it to the youth authority's central internal
affairs unit in Sacramento, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general also found that grievances filed by inmates,
particularly the females, were frequently lost or misplaced by
employees.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of all grievances were subsequently withdrawn, and the
vast majority were pulled back by employees, not by the wards
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The data suggests that facility staff are losing a large number
of grievances from female wards," the audit said.</TE>

<HD>Half Dome Chock-Full of Weekend Hikers</HD>
<DH>Parks: Visitors crowd scenic trail in Yosemite as
long-needed repairs restrict weekday access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>They came in high-tech hiking gear and flimsy sneakers, donning
bikini tops and religious garb. They celebrated birthdays and
commemorated deaths.</LD>
<LD>   Sweating, smiling, and at times cursing and crying, they braved
dehydration, afternoon thunderstorms and throbbing knees to haul
themselves up steel cables that traverse Half Dome's sloping
northeast face, following a route first forged in 1919 by an
awe-struck Scotsman.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of hikers young and old made the grueling 16.4-mile
round-trip pilgrimage Saturday to Half Dome's majestic cap, in a
prelude to a summer of exceptionally crowded weekends at the park's
best-known granite icon.</LD>
<TE>   The Half Dome corridor is Yosemite National Park's most crowded
under normal circumstances. But long-needed trail repairs that began
July 8 and continue through Sept. 19 are restricting weekday access
to the dome for the first time in decades--and possibly in the park's
history. And that means even bigger weekend throngs on the dizzying
cable thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday marked the first weekend day since the partial closure
took effect. Logjams on the cable ladder had some hikers panicking
and others turning back in frustration. But to the majority of the
white-knuckled hikers who inched like ants up the treacherous granite
wall, it was a small price to pay for breathtaking park panoramas and
a sense of personal accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the typical California traffic jam, but it sure is worth
it," joked Bentley LaBaron, 25, of Oakdale, who made his third ascent
up Half Dome on Saturday, this time carrying his 5-month-old
daughter, Elizabeth, on his chest to the base of the cables.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-hour midday stretch alone, as thunderclouds massed to the
east, hundreds of hikers trudged up the final half-mile of crumbling
hand-placed granite stairs to pluck gloves from a pile at the base of
the cables and attempt the summit.</TE>
<TE>   A few embarked from reserved campsites in Little Yosemite Valley
about four miles below. But the vast majority hiked the full 8.2
miles--and more than 4,800 feet--from the valley floor to stand
exhilarated on Half Dome's tilted peak 8,836 feet above sea level.</TE>
<TE>   Park spokeswoman Deb Schweizer estimated that about 2,000 people
embark on the hike on a typical summer weekend, although far fewer
make it to the top.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors have rearranged their weekday plans to hike the dome
Friday through Sunday, when the trail restrictions are lifted,
Schweizer said.</TE>
<TE>   The well-groomed John Muir Trail winds from the valley floor
through stands of Douglas fir and gold cup oak to Vernal Falls and
its 320-foot vertical plunge. There, hikers can detour through the
mist trail, soaked by a fine spray, past the top of the falls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parade of Hikers</TE>
<TE>   The Muir trail picks up again past spectacular Nevada Falls, where
the rush of water creates its own wind, then levels out through broad
Little Yosemite Valley--scattered with lodgepole and Jeffrey
pine--before winding up to reach the base of the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's steady parade of humanity included boys with green
hair, vacationing families with cranky children in tow and an
occasional crazed athlete who ran nearly naked up the steep terrain.
Hiking in their midst was an Old German Baptist Brethren church
group--young women dressed in gauze bonnets, tennis shoes and long
pastel dresses--in California to attend a church camp outside
Modesto. The women, whose beliefs are similar to the Amish, turned
heads as they gripped the cables to inch their way up the rock in
antiquated religious attire.</TE>
<TE>   "I would die if I had to wear all those clothes," said an
exhausted Charlene Martinez, 20, of Garden Grove, who made the climb
in a bikini top with two girlfriends. "I can barely walk as it is,
let alone have a dress to trip over."</TE>
<TE>   For decades now, conquering Half Dome's face has become a ritual
of personal achievement and a backdrop to commemorate life's turning
points. While only hard-core rock climbers can climb the flattened
face tourists see from the Valley floor, the cable route has made the
journey passable to just about anyone with stamina and guts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1865 the United States Geological Survey characterized the dome
as "perfectly inaccessible ... being probably the only one of all the
prominent points about Yosemite which has never been, and never will
be, trodden by human foot."</TE>
<TE>   Just a decade later, Scottish carpenter George Anderson made the
first recorded ascent, pounding bolts into the granite and connecting
them with ropes to create the first ladder. Steel cables were
installed in 1919 by the Sierra Club and replaced, first in 1934,
then in 1984, by thicker cables, said park historian Jim Snyder.
Wooden 2x4s are fastened to the rock under the cables, serving as a
resting place for weary climbers' feet.</TE>
<TE>   As hairy as the cable climb can seem, no climbing deaths have
occurred here, although one drunken climber took a tumble in the
1980s, Snyder said. Far more dangerous are the lightning storms that
often sweep the valley on summer afternoons. Several climbers were
killed by lightning on the dome in 1985, and signs warn hikers to
stay off the peak if darkened clouds are approaching.</TE>
<TE>   The rock face below the cables has been worn smooth by the boots
and shoes of hundreds of hikers over the years. Anniversaries and
birthdays have been celebrated from Half Dome's sweeping perch, and a
determined few have chosen this as a suicide launch.</TE>
<TE>   Don Hill, 35, made the trip from Atlanta to celebrate a friend's
50th birthday Saturday. But the friend turned back just a few miles
into the hike, complaining of dizziness. The others soldiered on, but
the group planned to celebrate the birthday Saturday night, safely
ensconced in the Curry Village bar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homage to Brother</TE>
<TE>   For Ken Mijares, the trek up the mineral-streaked monolith's
sloping face is a homage to his brother, Mark, who died of leukemia
at age 32 four years ago. Saturday marked the fourth annual trip to
commemorate that loss, and family friend Kyle Bunch, 21, tossed one
of Mark's wrestling medals off Half Dome's lip to honor his memory.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother always wanted to come up here but never got a chance
to do it," said Mijares, a Modesto butcher who knew of the weekday
restrictions and planned the trip accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   The repairs are being made to the half-mile stretch of steep
granite steps just below where the cables begin. Some of the stairs
are crumbling and unsafe, and hikers who tramp around them damage the
stonecrop--tiny flowers that grow from the granite's cracks. Trail
maintenance all along the Half Dome corridor is constant, Schweizer
said, although it typically does not require shutting the trail. In
this case, however, park officials do not want hikers attempting to
scramble around the granite stairs, which will be reconstructed using
dry stone masonry techniques. That is the only stretch of trail that
is being closed.</TE>
<TE>   Trail crews will work throughout the summer, Mondays through
Thursdays from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. That limits passage on those days
to visitors camped below or day-hikers prepared to travel in
darkness--although park officials are discouraging such efforts,
Schweizer said.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing we don't want to do is have a series of
search-and-rescues," she said. "The Half Dome corridor is probably
the area where most of our search-and-rescues occur. It attracts a
lot of people who don't know what they're getting into."</TE>
<TE>   Schweizer said she did not know whether the trail had ever been
closed to summer hikers, and Snyder said he believes it remained open
during the last repair to the stairs, in 1982. Park officials deemed
this year's closure crucial to the trail's safe repair, but arranged
to keep it open Fridays through Sundays to continue to accommodate
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The first week of trail closure has gone smoothly, said Ranger
Jack Hoeflich, who headed up the trail Saturday with an extra horse
to rescue an injured hiker at Nevada Falls, a little less than
halfway up the trail.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Saturday's bumper-to-bumper throngs on the cables were a
bit too much for some hikers to handle. The crowds, and the
occasional panic attack, left climbers standing immobilized, holding
themselves up with shaking arms on the steep rock grade.</TE>
<TE>   Krista Stangel, a 25-year-old San Francisco Web developer, met up
with six girlfriends from college for a reunion on the dome. But they
turned around halfway up the cables.</TE>
<TE>   "There was someone who stopped and freaked out ahead of us and sat
down," said Stangel, whose friends got nervous hanging on the cables
while dark clouds rolled in. "It's kind of anticlimactic."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Jones, a 43-year-old ranch hand from Napa Valley, also took
a pass on the climb after assessing the mass of sweating strangers
lined up along the cables.</TE>
<TE>   Since up-and-down traffic moves along the same two-cable path,
those hoping for a quicker descent found themselves hanging with one
hand on the outside edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm paranoid. That's why I'm not going up. I keep thinking
somebody's going to push me," Jones said as he gazed up at the cables
and chewed his lip. "I'm a real hiking-and-biking guy, but I don't
mess with cliffs too much. I get wigged out."</TE>
<TE>   But plenty of others said the ascent is an initiation of sorts,
and well worth it, crowds and all.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that makes you feel very small, and nature feels
very overwhelming," said 32-year-old Ryan Bottano, a tattooed and
shirtless air-conditioning technician from Costa Mesa. "You see its
power."</TE>

<HD>Inglewood Police Accused of Abuse in Other Cases</HD>
<DH>Police: Despite lawsuits and cash settlements, no complaint
has been referred for prosecution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT and SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before the videotaped images of an Inglewood police officer
manhandling a 16-year-old boy became national news last week, a
string of bruised and battered suspects had complained of receiving
similar treatment--or worse--at the hands of abusive Inglewood
officers, according to documents and interviews.</LD>
<LD>   The Times has identified more than a dozen complaints of excessive
force against Inglewood officers in recent years, which include
allegations of police breaking noses, knocking out teeth and
otherwise mistreating arrestees. Many of the alleged victims said
they were assaulted after committing "contempt of cop" offenses such
as verbally challenging an officer or not immediately doing what they
were told.</LD>
<LD>   The Inglewood Police Department has not referred any of the cases
to the district attorney's office; as a result, none of the officers
involved has been charged with crimes.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Inglewood Police Chief Ronald C. Banks
declined to discuss any of the cases identified by The Times, which
are detailed in court records and police documents. Banks said the
fact that a complaint or lawsuit had been filed did not mean that the
allegations were true or even that the cases warranted review by
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Among the cases involving allegations of excessive force by
Inglewood police:</TE>
<TE>   * A 59-year-old Compton high school teacher said in a lawsuit that
he suffered a torn rotator cuff and two herniated discs after he was
allegedly handcuffed, thrown to the ground and kneed in the back by
an Inglewood officer in August 2000. The man said he was trying to
help a disoriented neighbor who was causing a disturbance when a
police officer who had been called to the scene told him to "stay out
of police business."</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested for interfering with an officer, but the charges
were later dropped.</TE>
<TE>   * A 45-year-old security guard said an officer punched her in the
mouth in February 2000, splitting her lip and loosening a tooth. The
officer admitted punching the woman, according to court files, but
said he did so because she was advancing on him in a threatening
manner. The woman was charged with assaulting a police officer, but
the charges against her were dropped. She has since filed a civil
rights lawsuit against the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   * In July 1999, another schoolteacher said he suffered abrasions
on his cheek, shoulder and knee after he was handcuffed and thrown
face first onto a sidewalk outside a neighborhood bar where he had
been playing pool. The man was arrested for being drunk in public,
according to documents. But the man's attorney said the charges were
dropped when a test failed to detect any alcohol in his system. The
city paid the man $17,500 to settle a lawsuit against the Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   * An alleged gang member said that on Feb. 1, 1997, a police
officer punched him in the face and broke his nose. One of the
officer's partners was subsequently fired for destroying photographs
he took of the bloody-faced gang member minutes after the alleged
attack. Inglewood internal affairs investigators, who looked at the
case after the young man filed a complaint with the department, said
the evidence suggested that the photos were destroyed to protect the
officer who allegedly struck the young man. Neither officer was
prosecuted, and the one who allegedly struck the young man remains on
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the people who alleged excessive force said police
officials treated them rudely and ignored their complaints when they
tried to come forward with their allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Shores, a Northwest Airlines employee who alleges he was
roughed up, handcuffed and thrown to the ground by police after a
traffic stop, was rebuffed at the station when he tried to level a
complaint the next day, according to his attorney, Tom Beck.</TE>
<TE>   Shores was accompanied by a friend who was a county probation
officer, but the desk officers ignored him as well, Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jorge Gonzalez, who represents three alleged victims of
excessive force on New Year's Eve, contends a watch commander told
his clients "either you can file a complaint against the officers or
you can go home tonight without any charges."</TE>
<TE>   They decided to leave. One of the officers they accused of using
excessive force was Jeremy Morse, the officer who is seen on the
videotape slamming the teenager, Donovan Jackson, onto the trunk of a
police car.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police officials did not respond to requests from The
Times to provide annual tallies of the number of excessive force
complaints lodged against their officers and a breakdown for how
those cases were adjudicated. Although court records show that some
officers involved in the cases reviewed by The Times were disciplined
by the Police Department--in one case, an officer was fired--Banks
would not say how others were handled. Nor did the city's attorney
respond to a request for information regarding the amount of money
the city has paid out to settle lawsuits that alleged excessive force
by police.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Roosevelt Dorn, who has publicly called for the firing and
prosecution of Morse, said he did not know about many of the
complaints against Inglewood officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of three or four complaints, and they were resolved to the
point that the individuals who complained were satisfied," said Dorn,
who was elected in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, district attorney's officials have
reviewed more than 1,000 potential criminal cases against police
officers in Los Angeles County, including more than 440 cases
alleging excessive force. Most of those cases were from the Los
Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, by far the region's largest police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's officials said they have not received a single
excessive force referral from the Inglewood Police Department in at
least five years.</TE>
<TE>   "If the district attorney has no record of it, then I would take
their word for it," said Banks, who left his job as an assistant
chief with the LAPD to take the helm of the Inglewood Police
Department in 1998. "Since I have been here, I don't think we've had
an excessive force case that has risen to the level of misconduct ...
or that required reporting to the D.A."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, many of the smaller police forces in the county submit
very few excessive force cases for review. According to district
attorney's records, police departments in Pasadena, Santa Monica,
Beverly Hills, Burbank, Downey, Hawthorne, Huntington Park and West
Covina each referred one case of excessive force by an officer over
the last five years. Other small cities reported no cases at all.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley,
declined to comment on the Inglewood Police Department's lack of
referrals to the office. Another D.A.'s official, however, said he
was troubled by the dearth of cases presented by that department, and
others, for review.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a concern when we don't get information from a
department," said the district attorney's official, who asked not to
be identified because of the ongoing investigation of the incident in
Inglewood. "I can't help but think that there are things occurring
out there--misconduct--that are not being presented to us."</TE>
<TE>   Merrick Bobb, who monitors the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department for the county board of supervisors, said the U.S.
Department of Justice recommends that police agencies refer to
prosecutors all cases in which, "at first blush," it appears a crime
may have been committed.</TE>
<TE>   "This practice is probably not followed by the majority of police
departments in the country," said Bobb, who is also director of the
Los Angeles-based Police Assessment Resource Center, a national
center on police oversight and reform.</TE>
<TE>   Bobb added that when charges get dismissed against suspects who
have alleged being mistreated, such as in some of the Inglewood
cases, that too is cause for concern. It's an "indication that
something may be wrong ... and should serve as a signal that there
may be systemic problems in that city."</TE>
<TE>   Like many others who felt their complaints against the Inglewood
department were ignored or mishandled, William F. Arbuckle III, the
Compton schoolteacher who said he was roughed up after trying to help
a neighbor, sued the police, in a case that is pending.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did to me just wasn't right," said Arbuckle, who added
that he will need surgery to fix his shoulder injury. "All I wanted
was his badge number because he was so rude. For that he threw me to
the ground."</TE>
<TE>   That officer has had other legal and disciplinary problems,
including an off-duty incident in which he forced three teenagers at
gunpoint to lie on the ground because he incorrectly believed they
were stalking the sister of his then-girlfriend, court records show.
He allegedly shouted obscenities at the youths and kicked them,
according to the records. The officer was suspended for 13 days in
connection with that incident, and the city settled a lawsuit with
the teenagers for $37,000.</TE>
<TE>   The officer still works for the Inglewood Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Fellows, the alleged gang member who contends his nose was
broken by an anti-gang officer, never sued over his injuries because
he thought he would never be believed, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "They kicked the hell out of my son," said Jolene Clark. "They
wanted to make an example of him in front of his friends."</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned," she added, "the Inglewood Police
Department is a group of bullies. Don't mess with them."</TE>

<LD>A mother was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment Sunday after
her 3-year-old daughter was found in a parked car in Stevenson Ranch,
where temperatures reached 100 degrees, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Anna Oryan, 30, is being held at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department's Santa Clarita station in lieu of $50,000 bail, said
Deputy Juan Espinoza.</LD>
<LD>   About 4 p.m., a passerby at a Wal-Mart parking lot in the 25400
block of The Old Road noticed the girl, who authorities believe had
been sitting alone for 20 minutes. A store employee rescued the girl
through an unlocked door and brought her into the store, Espinoza
said.</LD>
<TE>   Paramedics took the girl to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital
in Valencia, where she was released to her father with no serious
injuries, Espinoza said.</TE>

<HD>Harvest Crusade Draws 99,000 for 3-Day Event</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monica Hernandez's 15-year-old son died in January, and she had a
specific reason for coming from Riverside for the final night of the
Harvest Crusade at Anaheim's Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm here to find out what happens when you go to the other side,"
she said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 10 people Hernandez had come with was Wayne Thomas. The
back of his T-shirt read "C.O.P.S. Christians Obediently Preaching
Salvation."</LD>
<TE>   Why did he come? "It's one of the largest gatherings of Christians
we know of," said the 37-year-old owner of an investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Hernandez were among the estimated 32,000 people who
filled the stadium Sunday night where the main tenants are
Angels--the baseball variety. There were youth groups, churches and
families--even 45 men from a Christian drug and alcohol
rehabilitation ranch in Perris, who came to the crusade's 13th annual
gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Total attendance for the three-day event was estimated at 99,000,
organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to worship the Lord," said pony-tailed Tony Udell, 39,
of the U-Turn for Christ rehab program.</TE>
<TE>   The star of each night's program was Greg Laurie, Harvest
Crusade's evangelist and founder, and senior pastor of Harvest
Christian Fellowship in Riverside, which calls itself the
eighth-largest church in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie's crusades offer Christian pop music in a nonchurch
environment, hoping to pull in people who might not consider going to
religious services.</TE>
<TE>   Once they're there, Laurie delivers informal sermons laced with
quotes from celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   But the heart of the three-day crusade are the 4,500 volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   They staff the booths where Harvest T-shirts, sweatshirts and
Laurie's books and pamphlets are sold.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,100 of them--as young as 12--go through a three-day
training course so they can help those who come down to the playing
field to accept Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Around 10% make the profession of faith, said Kevin Lough, the
follow-up team supervisor and a heavy-equipment mechanic for the
Riverside County Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The Harvest Crusade has become a well-honed operation.</TE>
<TE>   Once someone declares for Christ, he or she is given a version of
the New Testament that includes commentary and explanations. Children
12 or younger are given the "New Believer's Growth Book," written by
Laurie.</TE>
<TE>   Next they fill out a follow-up card that is sent to a sorting room
near first base.</TE>
<TE>   The card is routed to a volunteer from the church nearest the
person's home.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, a letter from the church is sent to converts
inviting them to attend services.</TE>
<TE>   Harvest Crusade holds from two to six similar events each year as
far afield as Australia.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the crusade will spend three days in Winston- Salem,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Once local churches request a crusade, it can take as long as five
years to take place, said Mike Brazeal, the crusade's events
coordinator.</TE>

<HD>San Fernando Gets an Old Identity</HD>
<DH>Preservation: Historic homes provide the foundation for a
new sense of pride for the Valley's first city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to architectural beauty, the city of San Fernando is
not normally thought of in the same league as Pasadena or the West
Adams district. But with historic preservation of homes and
buildings, city officials and residents say that can change.</LD>
<LD>   A recently completed six-month survey found that 228 properties in
the 2.4-square-mile city may be eligible for historic landmark
designation. Based on information from the California Office of
Historic Preservation, a property is given historical designation if
it is an outstanding example of an architectural style, is associated
with a person or group who had a profound influence on state history
or is the most significant historical property of its type in the
region, among other things. The survey, city officials said, is the
first step in making San Fernando a model community for preservation
in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "San Fernando is paving the way for working-class communities, to
restore them," Mayor Cindy Montanez said. After all, she said, San
Fernando was the Valley's first city and ought to lead the way.</LD>
<TE>   Conducted from January through June, the survey considered all
structures--both residential and commercial--built 50 or more years
ago, said Paul Deibel, the community development director. Once a
property is designated a historic landmark, there are tax incentives
for property owners but also restrictions on what changes can be made
to the structure.</TE>
<TE>   According to the survey, conducted by Pomona-based Cultural
Resource Management, 215 properties singled out for possible landmark
designation are residential. The others are commercial and industrial
buildings, churches and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some traditional architectural styles popular in the area include
Craftsman, Tudor and Folk.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of historical [properties] in the community that
currently are unknown and unprotected," Deibel said. "Many individual
property owners have taken steps to protect their own property, but
many others do not know" about the historical significance of their
homes, he said. City officials will now meet with residents to
promote preservation efforts and craft a preservation ordinance,
Deibel said, adding that he expects an ordinance to be in place
within a year. "One of the visions that the city has is to preserve
the historic character of the city," Deibel said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Veres, San Fernando's historical commissioner, is working
toward that goal citywide and in his own Harps Street home. Veres'
1926 Craftsman bungalow, built with river rock, was identified in the
survey as a potential historical landmark.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is working to restore every room of the
1,100-square-foot house, which does not yet have a functioning
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Veres bought the home two years ago for $126,000. Now, with
$25,000 worth of renovations and based on recent sales of similarly
restored properties, he estimates its worth to be more than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people who practice preservation tend to be from
communities that do fairly well economically," Veres said. Even
though San Fernando is a working-class community, a citywide
preservation effort would improve its economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Veres said recently he's seen his neighbors, some with no training
or experience, excitedly working on preserving their homes too.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is a special place that people can feel connected
to," Veres said. Preservation "tells you something about the history
and the direction of where the town has been and perhaps where it can
go."</TE>

<HD>National Activists Decry Inglewood Incident</HD>
<DH>Police: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorney Johnnie Cochran
are among those joining local voices protesting police beating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A number of prominent speakers used the pulpits of area churches
Sunday to spread their message that legislation is needed to toughen
penalties against the kind of police brutality that they said
occurred in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when Johnnie Cochran's law firm was hired to represent an
Inglewood teenager beaten by police, the Rev. Al Sharpton and others
urged Washington lawmakers to pass reforms such as civilian oversight
panels for any police agency that receives federal funds.</LD>
<LD>   "I am happy to be here and to be a noisemaker," Sharpton said at a
news conference at Los Angeles International Airport. "It's noise
that got us out of the back of the bus.... But so far, the White
House has been silent. And if they continue to be silent, we will
continue to see these issues."</LD>
<TE>   Sharpton, a civil rights activist from New York, and others,
including Cochran's co-counsel, Sanford Rubenstein of New York, said
it's time to hear from the White House on the issue of police
brutality, calling on President Bush to treat the issue with the same
seriousness that he has embraced in fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can fight terrorism across the world, then let's fight
terrorism here at home, committed by men and women in uniform,"
Sharpton said.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran confirmed Sunday in a telephone interview that he had been
hired to represent 16-year-old Donovan Jackson, who was captured on
videotape as his handcuffed and limp body was slammed onto a police
car and he was punched in the face by Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy
J. Morse.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, retained by Jackson's mother, Felicia Chavis, said he had
already reviewed the videotape several times and reached a few
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "I am struck that the kid seems totally helpless at that moment,"
Cochran said. "I know people talk about what happened before. But at
the moment of the tape, when this young man is helpless and in
custody, he is picked up and slammed up on that car.... Pure and
simple, that is a crime and the officer appears to be out of
control."</TE>
<TE>   Talibah Shakir, Jackson's cousin, said at the LAX news conference
that the boy had already been knocked unconscious by the time he was
hurled onto the police car and that he did not realize what had
happened to him until he saw the tape later on television.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she said, he's at home, afraid to leave his house for fear of
being arrested. She compared his situation with that of Mitchell
Crooks, the man who videotaped Jackson's encounter with police and
was later taken into custody on outstanding warrants from Placer
County. To help deal with his fears, Jackson has been seeing a
therapist since the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just frightened they will kidnap him like they kidnapped
Mitchell Crooks," said Shakir, who described her cousin as a
mild-mannered boy who shied away from speaking in public because of a
speech impediment. She also fervently denied police reports that
Jackson had grabbed Morse's genital area, prompting the officer to
punch the boy in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "If Donovan touched his genitals, it was an involuntary reflex
because he was unconscious when he was slammed into that car," Shakir
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Harrison, Crooks' attorney, attended the Power of Love
Christian Fellowship Church service in Los Angeles on Sunday where
Sharpton delivered the sermon.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison said his client had been mistreated while behind bars in
Placer County, suffering cuts and bruises and a shoulder injury that
required a visit to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks, Harrison said, was touched by the fund-raising efforts for
his defense fund by people such as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los
Angeles), who hopes to raise $10,000 to help with his legal bills.
Sharpton added to the fund Sunday with a $1,000 donation. Crooks is
scheduled for a hearing Tuesday on a burglary and a 5-year-old
hit-and-run accident.</TE>
<TE>   "He appreciates all the love and support he's getting, knowing no
one is letting him hang out to dry," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpton was trying to arrange a visit with Crooks late Sunday or
this morning. Sharpton said he considered it an outrage that Crooks
would be jailed after bringing attention to the police beating.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime someone can body-slam your children and the only one in
jail is the one who turned in the crime, that's trouble. There's
something wrong with that picture," Sharpton said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpton stirred up emotions in the small Los Angeles church,
eliciting shouts of support from the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   The same scene was echoed at the First African Methodist Episcopal
Church in the West Adams district, where State Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City) told a packed gathering that "we dropped the
ball" on police brutality after the Rodney King beating, and said he
would form an Assembly committee to examine police reform.</TE>
<TE>   "This incident is a wake-up call to us all," Wesson said to more
than 500 congregants, who shouted occasional words of encouragement
toward the pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the job of law enforcement to protect, to serve and to
partner with us," he said, adding, "I am going to make sure they do
that."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said the committee would invite "progressive" police
commissioners and other law enforcement officials, as well as outside
experts, "to hunker down in a room, so that no more will we have to
turn on the television and see a child beaten."</TE>
<TE>   Sharpton and Rubenstein also discussed legislative reforms, such
as civilian review panels.</TE>
<TE>   Rubenstein said it was important for civilians to be allowed to
file federal court cases, instead of the way it's done now, where
only federal prosecutors are empowered to bring such cases before a
judge.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important first action officials must take, the
activists said, is to fire Morse.</TE>

<HD>Joaquin Balaguer, 95; Dominican President Served Seven
Terms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joaquin Balaguer, the diminutive poet, president and patriarch who
towered over the Dominican Republic through nearly a half-century of
turmoil, U.S. occupation and enduring poverty, died Sunday. He was
95.</LD>
<LD>   A father figure and kingmaker to the end for his Caribbean nation
of 8 million, Balaguer died from heart failure after days on a
respirator in a Santo Domingo hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "The doctors tried to save him until 4:30 [a.m.], when he died
fighting," Rafael Bello Andino, Balaguer's closest aide, told
reporters.</LD>
<TE>   It was an apt epitaph for the seven-term president, who was last
seen in public a year ago. His final presidential term ended early in
1996 under a cloud of election fraud. But the blind and frail
Balaguer continued to manipulate Dominican politics as counselor,
peacemaker and benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his array of infirmities, Balaguer again ran in the most
recent presidential election two years ago, his grandfatherly face
and ever-present black fedora plastering the streets on posters under
the slogans: "President through two centuries" and "No one needs
while Balaguer breathes."</TE>
<TE>   He and his Social Christian Reform Party came in third in that
election--only the second time in his long political career that he
lost.</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer was one of Latin America's last great "caudillos," the
strongmen rulers who blended paternal beneficence with an
authoritarian omnipresence to build a rock-solid power base, largely
with the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer was born Sept. 1, 1906, in the northern Dominican town of
Navarette. His father was a merchant who had emigrated from Puerto
Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer wrote his first book at 14, a collection of poetry called
"Pagan Psalms." He graduated from law school in Santo Domingo and
earned his doctorate of laws at the Sorbonne in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the '30s, Balaguer served in several Cabinet and
diplomatic posts through three decades under the country's brutal
dictator Rafael Leonides Trujillo, who installed Balaguer as vice
president and then as president during the final years before
Trujillo's assassination in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer fled to exile in New York City after Trujillo's death,
which unleashed a bloody, years-long battle between loyalist
Dominican generals and leftists inspired by Fidel Castro's Cuba. He
returned only after President Johnson sent some 20,000 U.S. Marines
to the island nation to put down a leftist mutiny within the army in
April 1965.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, in U.S.-controlled elections, Balaguer was
elected president--at a time when 60% of the nation was unemployed,
two-thirds of its population was illiterate and its streets and towns
were in ruin.</TE>
<TE>   Author Mario Vargas Llosa, in his recent fact-based but fictional
account of Trujillo's life, "The Feast of the Goat," describes
Balaguer as a man who "transformed himself from a puppet president
into a nonentity into an authentic head of state."</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer did so through massive public works projects and frequent
trips to the impoverished countryside. He doled out dolls for girls,
bikes for boys and jobs for entire villages and towns. He
micro-managed the economy, getting nightly briefings on the exact
balance in the government's accounts. And, to the end, he was a
faithful U.S. ally.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the police and army brutally purged the ranks of
the nation's political left. Balaguer called the oppressors
"uncontrollable elements." Leftist leaders described Balaguer's first
reign as "Trujilloismo without Trujillo" and "a democracy of the
gallows."</TE>
<TE>   But over the next three decades, Balaguer's loyalists returned him
to power five more times. Through the years, his politics and
policies mellowed with his ascending age and declining health.</TE>
<TE>   During the May 16, 1986, elections that made the already frail
Balaguer Latin America's oldest sitting president at the time, an
aide had to guide his hand to the ballot box.</TE>
<TE>   Balaguer's last victory came in 1994, when, already blinded by
glaucoma and crippled by phlebitis, he began a final term that
ultimately was halved to two years to appease opposition leaders who
had alleged election fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Still, so ubiquitous and powerful was Balaguer while in office
that his most strident opponent, the long-exiled leftist leader Juan
Bosch, declared after Balaguer defeated him in 1990, "We don't have a
democracy here, we have a Balaguerocracy."</TE>
<TE>   Even after he left office, Balaguer often cast a deciding vote
through his party, a crucial coalition partner in
opposition-controlled parliaments. Until Balaguer left for the
hospital this month with a bleeding ulcer, Dominican President
Hipolito Mejia was often seen at Balaguer's house for private
consultations.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Balaguer's private life belied his public
image of power. A lifelong bachelor, he surrounded himself mostly
with his seven sisters, one of whom survives him. He never moved from
his austere, two-story home in a middle-class Santo Domingo
neighborhood. He often said he loved his solitude.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "The Doctor" by his followers, Balaguer spent his spare
time writing dozens of books of poetry and prose. He would enmesh
himself in debates with diplomats over minor 15th century Spanish
playwrights. And his lifestyle was so spartan that the Wall Street
Journal once concluded Balaguer had "created a cult of personality
from his lack of personality."</TE>
<TE>   Even in death, the cult endured for some. Hundreds of his
loyalists crowded his home on Avenida Maximo Gomez, where his body
lay Sunday, chanting, "Balaguer lives!"</TE>
<TE>   President Mejia declared that the nation will officially mourn
Balaguer for three days; the funeral is scheduled for Wednesday for
the man Mejia declared to be "one of the most distinguished political
leaders in all of Dominican history ... the keeper of our democracy."</TE>

<HD>Jogger Apparently Killed by a Train</HD>
<DH>Death: Man's body is found along the tracks near San Juan
Capistrano-Laguna Niguel border. An investigation continues.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A male jogger was struck and killed by a train Sunday along the
tracks near the border of San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Niguel,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A conductor of a northbound Amtrak train saw the body about five
feet from the tracks, half a mile north of Junipero Serra Road, and
alerted authorities at 12:30 p.m. The victim has been identified as
Michael Warde Remley, 37, of Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Larry Abbott of the Orange County Sheriff's Department said
investigators found no evidence to suggest that the northbound Amtrak
was the train that hit the man.</LD>
<TE>   Police believe Remley was a jogger because of his clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "The body does appear to have been hit by a train," Abbott said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the facts are not clear enough to indicate that this was
accidental or intentional. It's a puzzle right now." The Sheriff's
Department stopped Amtrak and Santa Fe freight trains in the area for
about four hours to investigate.</TE>

the Costa Mesa dog park. Providing a little entertainment at the
event are Benny Wong and KD, his disk-catching border collie.
Proceeds from the event were earmarked for maintenance and upkeep of
the nearly 2-acre off-leash park in the southeast corner of TeWinkle
Park at Arlington Drive and Newport Boulevard.</CP>

<HD>Benny Peled, 74; Led Israeli Air Force in Mideast War, 1976
Hostage Rescue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benny Peled, who commanded the Israeli air force during the 1973
Mideast war and the dramatic rescue of Israeli hostages at Entebbe,
Uganda, in 1976, has died of emphysema. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Peled, a retired major general, died Saturday and was buried
Sunday at the Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery in Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   Highly respected as a fighter pilot and as head of the air force,
Peled also had a reputation as a controversial figure who often
quarreled with Israel's political leadership.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of the outstanding pilots and commanders of the air
force," Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told a Cabinet meeting Sunday.
"He died as he had lived, being honest with himself and those around
him."</TE>
<TE>   Peled was born in Tel Aviv in 1928 and began his military service
as an airplane mechanic. He completed his pilot's training in 1949
and flew the first jet fighter that the air force acquired, a World
War II-vintage Gloster Meteor.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1956 war against Egypt, when he was flying a French
Mystere, he was shot down by ground fire near Sharm e-Sheikh in the
Sinai desert. Pursued by Egyptian troops, he was rescued by an
Israeli light aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, five months after Peled was appointed air force
commander, Egypt and Syria launched their surprise attack on the Suez
Canal and in the Golan Heights. In this war, the Israeli air force
suffered its most serious losses, especially from the Soviet
anti-aircraft missiles that the Egyptians had massed along the front.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Peled introduced a number of important operational
changes, including establishment of the air force's own intelligence
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Peled helped oversee the air force and army
commandos who carried out the rescue of Jewish and Israeli passengers
from a hijacked Air France plane. They were being held at Entebbe,
Uganda, by Palestinian and German hijackers and Ugandan soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the air force in 1977, he served for a decade as
president of Elbit, a defense electronics firm.</TE>
<TE>   Peled is survived by a daughter and two sons, both of whom are
fighter pilots, and eight grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Now hear this!</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles' Local 347 of the SEIU, the Service Employees
International Union, may have a hit on its hands. The union opposes
secession, and that's no song and dance--it's an entire CD that's now
making the rounds on the CD players of politicos.</LD>
<LD>   "L.A. Together: Music to Stay Together By" is a compilation of 14
cuts, with standards like "Let's Stay Together," by Al Green;
"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," covered by Gloria Estefan; and the grand
old "Stay," by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. It's also got
"Don't Say Goodbye," by the Mexican crossover phenom Paulina Rubio.</LD>
<TE>   It's an album full of promise--as in, L.A. promises to get cops to
the scene faster in the Valley if you don't secede, as conveyed in
the tune "I Love You More Today Than Yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   From a critic's standpoint, the pure-white CD cover is reminiscent
of the Beatles' "White Album," but the compilation could also have
used the grace note of a Lennon-McCartney song--something like "Come
Together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon's Got  the Japanese Vote</TE>
<TE>   On one of those rare, clear July mornings that belie Mark Twain's
remark that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San
Francisco, the Simon-for-governor campaign was setting up shop.</TE>
<TE>   A news conference was being readied on Treasure Island, with the
city skyline in the background and, as an aide to the GOP
gubernatorial candidate put the lectern in place, angling it so that
the vista would be visible behind Simon, two buses full of Japanese
tourists pulled up.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of them piled out to pose before the bridge-and-city
backdrop. Some of them spotted the lectern and rushed toward it,
taking turns mugging for the camera with the sign that read ''Bill
Simon for Governor,'' and giving their own performances, delivering
mock-pompous speeches in Japanese as their friends filmed their
antics.</TE>
<TE>   The flustered aide shooed them away with an "OK, that's enough,"
but not before they had proved a truism of American politics: It all
comes down to props and photo ops.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Did You Hear the One About the Lawmaker?</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell is the Irvine Republican who has
proposed cutting health-care services to avoid raising taxes, which
is something you have to know to understand this e-jest making the
rounds in the state Capitol:</TE>
<TE>   A young man was born with a damaged heart, and at age 20 he needed
a transplant to survive. The heart specialist told him he was one
lucky fellow: three hearts were available for transplant. One was
from an 18-year-old Olympic athlete killed in a skiing accident, one
was from a 17-year-old girl, and one had belonged to 46-year-old John
Campbell. Which would it be?</TE>
<TE>   Without hesitation, the patient chose Campbell's heart. The doctor
was dumbfounded: Why would he choose that, when younger hearts were
available?</TE>
<TE>   "Because," the patient replied, "his heart has never been used!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Going Gets Tough, He Changes Subject</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's one-man foot-in-mouth epidemic, county Supervisor
John Flynn, is trying the old change-the-subject trick to extricate
his extremity this time.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn had been riffing about one Irma Lopez--a big local
fund-raiser and wife of the Oxnard mayor--because she had filed a
police report saying that, at the Democratic Party's annual barbecue,
Flynn had shouted, "I'm gonna get you!"</TE>
<TE>   Flynn defended himself, saying Lopez was just cooking up a bogus
police report to embarrass him, and moreover, he added, she "won't be
happy until she sees a sea of brown faces in every political office
in west Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   This is not a statement to go unremarked upon, and it hasn't; the
local chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens
condemned Flynn, and a letter declared that LULAC "will not allow
elected representatives to denigrate the leadership of our community
without consequence."</TE>
<TE>   The letter was written by LULAC's chapter president, whose name is
Denis O'Leary, and there Flynn saw an opening to shift the ground
under the controversy by dragging in an even older and bigger
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Because this isn't about Irish versus Mexican, Flynn told a
reporter--after all, his district is two-thirds Latino and he's been
elected seven times. It's about Protestant versus Catholic! "O'Leary?
That's an Orangeman's name. I think he enjoyed signing that letter."</TE>
<TE>   Orangemen are militant Protestants in Northern Ireland, but Flynn
called it wrong: "I'm not too up on Irish legend and history,"
O'Leary says, "but my grandfather was a Catholic and his parents were
too. I'm a green."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He'll Apologize for the Hawaiian Shirt, No More</TE>
<TE>   No shoes, no shirt, no speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The Libertarian candidate for governor, Gary Copeland, wasn't
dressed up enough, so he got dressed down for wandering around the
supposedly anything-goes Libertarians' annual convention in "shorts,
sandals and a Hawaiian shirt, randomly shouting stupid comments
during other people's speeches."</TE>
<TE>   So said Libertarian leader David Nolan in a message to convention
delegates. "Tell everyone you can that he is an 'accidental'
candidate who got the nomination through a fluke.... In 30 years,
I've never taken this position before"--of renouncing a
candidate--"but Gary is in a class by himself, literally."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Copeland, who runs a medical information Web site in
Orange County, declared himself to be "very sad" at Nolan's
denunciation.</TE>
<TE>   He did it, Copeland opined, because on the ballot, Copeland
proclaims himself as a "Libertarian Druid Existentialist."</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize for an error in judgment, as one's faith is personal
not public," he said, and offered to step down from the campaign if
the party's members wish him to.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never apologize for being a Druid."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Throwing Bouquets at the Tax Fighters</TE>
<TE>   Say it with flowers: A political action committee called Taxpayers
at Conservative Opportunities is making it easy for what it
redundantly calls "California families from around California" to
thank some "real heroes"--not Sept. 11 rescue crews, but California
legislators opposing new taxes in the forthcoming budget, like
raising the state's yearly vehicle registration fee, which Gov. Pete
Wilson cut by 25% in the days of lusher budgets.</TE>
<TE>   The "Send Flowers to Assembly Republicans" Web site promises to
have posies delivered for $10.78, including sales tax. Jon Coupal of
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. says a variety of "pro-taxpayer"
groups have a hand in this; one day alone, he said, 100 people doled
out their online dough.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the blooms are destined to wilt soon in the hot air of a
Sacramento summer--100-plus outside the Capitol, and
who-knows-how-high inside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Rep. Gary Condit's wife can go ahead with her $10-million suit
against the National Enquirer after a federal judge turned down the
tabloid's request to have the suit dismissed. The suit says the
tabloid's August 2001 story headlined "Cops: Condit's Wife Attacked
Chandra," reporting on a supposed "attack" in a telephone
conversation between the congressman's wife and intern Chandra Levy,
insinuated that Carolyn Condit had played some role in Levy's
disappearance when the two had never met or spoken.</TE>
<TE>   * A news release faxed to these premises was headlined, "Cardenas'
'Do Not Fax' Bill Set for Hearing."</TE>
<TE>   * A fund-raiser hosted by, among others, Ed Asner, Stanley
Sheinbaum and Ed Begley Jr. recently raised campaign funds for the
newly redistricted Barbara Lee, the Oakland Democrat who was the only
member of Congress to vote against the White House's use of military
force measure after Sept. 11, which the invitation referred to as
Bush's "permanent war policy."</TE>
<TE>   * Longtime peace activist Jerry Rubin's campaign for Santa Monica
City Council has the endorsement of the "Wednesday night President,"
the "West Wing" actor Martin Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   * Orange County Republicans say "aloha" and "you go, wahine" in
Newport Beach today to Linda Lingle, Republican candidate for
governor of Hawaii, at a luncheon sponsored by the county GOP; the
fund-raiser comes tonight.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Seeks Anti-Gang Grant</HD>
<DH>Application: The state funds would be used for programs at
Boys &amp; Girls Club to combat truancy and crimes by youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state crime-fighting grant at the top of Santa Paula's wish list
would pump nearly a million dollars over the next four years into
programs targeting the farm town's toughest neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Work is nearly complete on the application for the highly
competitive California Gang, Crime and Violence Prevention
Partnership grant that will be turned into the state attorney
general's office July 26, said Mike Jump, a grant writer in the
Ventura County district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the four-year grant would put $237,500 annually into
Santa Paula Boys &amp; Girls Clubs programs aimed at ending school
truancy and keeping kids away from the five street gangs that roam
the four-square-mile city. Because grant applicants must be nonprofit
groups, the Boys &amp; Girls Club would administer the grant.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to break this chain and this cycle," said Police Chief
Bob Gonzales. "I have seen people afflicted with drug and alcohol
abuse passing it down to their kids. Having been raised here and
knowing these people, I know there are people we can help, but we
have to do it when they are young."</TE>
<TE>   Getting approved for the grant is difficult in any year but will
be particularly challenging in 2002, Jump said.</TE>
<TE>   Budget negotiations in Sacramento have left unclear how much money
will be available for the grant, which has provided more than $3
million annually to cities statewide since it was established in
1997. The number of cities receiving approval could be slashed from
30 to six in the coming fiscal year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The application is the latest attempt by Gonzales and others in
Santa Paula to find a solution for the city's ongoing crime problems
at a time when City Council members have said they cannot afford to
pay for more officers on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Police Department and the Drug Enforcement
Administration combined for a four-month operation that ended with
the arrest of nearly two dozen people. The drug sweep was considered
a success by Gonzales and others in law enforcement, but it didn't
end without controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Two rival gangs threatened to shoot up the city's tiny police
station after a federal agent fatally shot a Santa Paula man during a
drug raid in April. Police called a tactical alert the night of the
threat and asked for assistance from the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the family of shooting victim Edward Barron filed a
$35-million claim against the city, the county and the federal
government. Last week, DEA officials said an internal investigation
of the shooting determined that it was justified.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Santa Paula received approval for a $1-million
federal grant to clean up a two-square-mile neighborhood on the
city's north end that had been plagued by violence and overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   The grant will fund programs and an additional police officer at
Las Piedras Community Center, among other uses.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales, who has had to make do with 18 officers on the street as
gang membership has climbed in Santa Paula to more than 200, would
hire an additional school-based officer with the new grant money.</TE>
<TE>   It also would fund a gang prevention coordinator as well as a job
placement expert based at the Boys &amp; Girls Club and pay part of the
salary of a deputy district attorney, who would work part time in
Santa Paula on truancy issues, Jump said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that prevention will begin to offset some of the
crime-rate jumps we have seen," Jump said. "And we are looking at
reduced funding. The resources are not going to be there to hire
people to throw people in jail. You're going to have to find ways to
keep people out of jail."</TE>

program ties into efforts across California to boost the availability
of free early childhood education for public school children.</TE>
<TE>   Although research has shown that preschool can lead to greater
academic achievement and fewer social problems later in life, there
remains a serious shortage of public preschool slots--in Ventura
County and statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of waiting lists--you just can't get in," said
Cynthia Sanchez, one of two teachers running the preschool program at
Hueneme Elementary. "They end up at home with their moms, watching
TV, with no academics."</TE>
<TE>   The children were recruited into the summer program as their
parents signed them up for kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   Educators hope the preschool sessions, also being offered in some
Oxnard schools, will help bridge the learning gap among children
entering school with different levels of experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're not going to be six months behind a youngster who has
already gone to preschool," said Deloris Carn, who coordinates
Hueneme's Neighborhoods for Learning program, one of 11 in the
county. "It will also give them the edge on the distractions that
come from not wanting to separate from parents, or because they have
never been in a classroom before."</TE>
<TE>   Progress was already evident in Kathy Riley's classroom last week.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Huerta, 5, cried nonstop through the first three days of
class, Riley said. By Thursday, though, she was smiling, giggling and
bouncing from workstation to workstation.</TE>
<TE>   Four-year-old Kwian Landers had his teary face buried in his
T-shirt for the first 30 minutes of Thursday's class.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, he started to peek out from under his floppy brown curls.
By the end of the two-hour day, he was happily making pig and cow
noises as he and his classmates sang "Old MacDonald."</TE>
<TE>   "The gift here is that this is happening now," Riley said.
"Normally it takes away from academic instruction in kindergarten."</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when kindergarten consisted mostly of playtime,
she said. Children now must master much tougher tasks, including
counting to 100 and learning early reading skills.</TE>
<TE>   The summer curriculum aims to teach children basic socialization,
self-help, academic and fine-motor skills.</TE>
<TE>   In one exercise, students created a construction-paper portrait of
themselves with a tissue pasted over the nose. The lesson: Cover your
nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough so you don't spread germs.</TE>
<TE>   Parent involvement is crucial. The program requires parents to
attend a four-hour training workshop, where they learn the importance
of reading to their children at home and are given materials for
at-home academic activities.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and guardians are then asked to help as much as they can
in the classroom--leading workstation activities and helping the
teacher supervise the children.</TE>
<TE>   Frances Woolston, whose 4-year-old granddaughter, Erin, is in the
program, helped in Riley's room Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Woolston called the summer preschool opportunity a blessing. Erin
has a learning disability that makes transitions to new things more
difficult, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so thankful to have this," she said. "She needs anything
that will get her more comfortable in the classroom setting."</TE>

<HD>One Man's Urgent Struggle to Keep L.A. From Demolishing Its
Past</HD>
<DH>Preservation: A self-taught urban planner fears that
redevelopment will wipe away the history of the city he loves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was just a carefree kid having fun, back when he scampered along
the streets of downtown Los Angeles, sneaking rides on the Bradbury
Building's ornate iron elevators and exploring the fading clapboard
neighborhood of Bunker Hill.</LD>
<LD>   There is a sense of urgency when Brady Westwater prowls the city's
streets these days, though. The 53-year-old feels he has plenty to
say about the evolution of the city he loves--and not a lot of time
in which to say it.</LD>
<LD>   Bulldozers, in fact, were closing in on one of the city's oldest
commercial buildings when Westwater stopped the other day at 1st and
Main streets to watch.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1885, the cast-iron-accented structure bearing the sign
Glasser Bros. Pioneer Bail Bondsmen was being torn down to make way
for a $171-million regional headquarters for the state Department of
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "This building was constructed during the last year that L.A. was
still a village. The second railroad came to L.A. right after this
building was built, sparking a fare war--tickets dropped as low as $1
a head. After that, L.A. had its first great real estate boom and
began turning into a real city," Westwater shouted over the roar of
demolition equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "So this is our last link with our pre-city era. They are going to
have a plaza here anyway. Why not keep this old building and turn it
into something that would draw people, instead of having a dead,
empty plaza that at nights and weekends is going to be vacant?"</TE>
<TE>   Westwater is a self-taught historian and urban planner. And over
the last decade he has turned into a self-styled conscience of Los
Angeles, struggling to protect it from what he views as bad
redevelopment and bum raps.</TE>
<TE>   His real name is Ross Shockley. He was born in Silver Lake and
spent his boyhood hanging out around his father's law office at 3rd
and Spring streets. He took to using the Westwater name when he was
at UCLA studying to be a screenwriter. For years, he made a living
writing for Hollywood. More recently, he worked as a Malibu real
estate agent until health problems forced him to quit.</TE>
<TE>   He now works out of borrowed Pasadena office space, writing
treatises on such Los Angeles planning issues as redevelopment of the
Ambassador Hotel site, development of a Little Tokyo gymnasium,
redesign of the county art museum and use of the Los Angeles River's
banks.</TE>
<TE>   Dismissed at first by some as a gadfly, he has changed minds with
his proposal for a Los Angeles think tank that would unite planners
from various governmental agencies with private-sector architects,
sociologists, historians, artists and intellectuals. Together, they
could take a much-needed big-picture look at what the next L.A.
should be like, Westwater said.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem with Los Angeles, and downtown in particular, is
no one talks to each other," he said. "People work on projects where
things a half block away are totally off their radar."</TE>
<TE>   Westwater's views on specific projects are well known to those
involved in downtown planning. But he is best known as the person who
blew the whistle on author Mike Davis' 1998 book, "Ecology of Fear."
The bestseller was a catalog of natural disasters that seemed to
suggest Los Angeles is the world's most dangerous place to live.</TE>
<TE>   When no one else pointed out that many of the examples of L.A.
apocalypse cited by the book were false, Westwater peppered the media
with a 23-page retort that prompted a blizzard of newspaper, magazine
and Internet stories.</TE>
<TE>   "No one had noticed it was a work of fiction," riddled not only
with errors but "out and out lies," Westwater said. In subsequent
interviews with The Times, Davis admitted mistakes but stood behind
the book's theme.</TE>
<TE>   Westwater's historical perspectives are shaped in part by a
personal library that he estimates once totaled 25,000 books and
magazines. Since quitting work, he said, he has begun selling pieces
from the storied collection to live on.</TE>
<TE>   There seems to be wide individual support for Westwater's
think-tank proposal among planning experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of circulating ideas in a setting that breaks down the
walls that separate agencies and institutions always have is a good
one," said John Peterson, a specialist on downtown issues for the
city Community Redevelopment Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Brady grinds out a report or a memo on one issue or another
almost weekly. He kind of comes out of nowhere and presents some
dynamic proposal, and everyone blinks and tries to decide what to do
with it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, who represents much of the downtown area
and is one of those who is regularly peppered by Westwater's e-mails,
characterized the think tank as "a great idea."</TE>
<TE>   But she disputed the contention that downtown planning excludes
outside ideas. "I don't think people are marching in different
directions," she said. "There are a lot of places to go to
participate in a public process for design and input."</TE>
<TE>   Westwater, meanwhile, presses on, walking downtown's sidewalks by
day and cranking out his engagingly written manifestoes at night.</TE>
<TE>   Absent the influence of a think tank, he hopes the papers will
influence agencies that are embarking on such projects as the
redesign of Grand Avenue to make it more pedestrian-friendly for
Disney Hall and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   He must hurry, Westwater concedes, and not just because of the
bulldozers that soon will be on the way to rip up pavement. There's
the matter of his declining health--neurological and respiratory
problems are slowing him. "How long I have, I don't know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Turning onto Spring Street near his father's old law office, he
spies the Caltrans building that will be replaced with open space
when the new transportation headquarters is built.</TE>
<TE>   "This was built in 1939 and is an interesting transitional
building," Westwater said. "The rear is pure Bauhaus, stripped-down
modernism. The front side has Art Deco detailing. It adds to the
downtown area, but they want to tear it down for a park nobody will
use. Why not keep it and make it an L.A. historical museum, and then
you'll have a reason for people to come here nights and weekends?"</TE>
<TE>   Westwater is re-energized now. His voice rises as much with
excitement as to be heard over the street noise.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a great historic, classically designed building right in
the heart of the Civic Center. L.A.'s the only city without a
historic museum. It's an easy walk from here to the historic pueblo.
It's perfect. Why hasn't somebody connected the dots?"</TE>

<HD>Rental Inspection Law Faces Repeal</HD>
<DH>Glendale: Council is expected to scrap the program that
landlords and tenants protested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a month after approving a rental property inspection
program, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday will likely bow to
pressure from disgruntled landlords and tenants and repeal it.</LD>
<LD>   The council approved mandatory inspections of the city's
approximately 40,000 multiunit rentals June 18. The ordinance, due to
take effect Thursday, required property owners to pay $24 per unit
per year for inspections that would be done every three years.</LD>
<LD>   Landlords immediately began to complain, calling it unfair to
require inspections on properties that have had no reported problems.</LD>
<TE>   Many tenants didn't like the program either, saying the mandatory
nature of the inspections would violate their right to privacy. The
Glendale Chamber of Commerce also joined the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing three hours of often angry comments at their last
meeting, a majority of council members agreed that the program should
focus only on "problem properties."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Rafi Manoukian introduced a motion to repeal the program.
"At this point, I'm not ready to support it," he said</TE>
<TE>   Councilmen Gus Gomez and Dave Weaver have said they would support
the repeal.</TE>
<TE>   Manoukian also asked the city staff to devise an alternative that
would focus on properties with reported housing violations.</TE>
<TE>   Rentals need to be inspected, but the current proposal doesn't
provide the best route, Weaver said. "You could do a random building
here or there, but not every building needs to be inspected."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Bob Yousefian, a staunch supporter of inspections, said
not only dilapidated apartments need attention, but also those that
are beginning to decline.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get to the several thousand out there and fix them up,"
he said. "My goal here is to eliminate that blight."</TE>
<TE>   But some residents continue to question the scope of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we really need to inspect every property in Glendale?" asked
Georgia Wall, a property owner for more than 10 years. "It doesn't
take a rocket scientist driving down the street to say, 'That one,
that one, that one ... those need help.' "</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood Services Administrator Sam Engel, whose staff has
worked for more than three years on planning the program, said
inspections are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Council members agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "[The city staff just] needs to work out the wrinkles," Weaver
said.</TE>

<HD>A Family Reconnects on the Web</HD>
<DH>Reunion: Separated for 50 years, the Aguayos use a
genealogy site to find missing relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marie Padilla has always loved her niece "Bertie," remembering how
she once read the child stories, bought her dresses and pushed her on
park swings. She remembers, too, the day she said goodbye, 50 years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It was awful," the 92-year-old Whittier woman said. "She thought
I didn't want her anymore. I missed her a lot.... I was her 'Mama
Rie.' "</LD>
<LD>   Padilla cared for her niece in the early 1950s, when Bertie's
mother struggled with epileptic seizures and her father battled
alcoholism. After more than a year with Padilla, Bertie moved to
Louisville, Ky., with her parents and other siblings to start a new
life.</LD>
<TE>   But Sunday afternoon, after a nearly 18-month Internet genealogy
quest, the extended family was reunited at the Padilla home,
beginning a weeklong family reunion that will bring together about 50
relatives, eager to meet the missing branch of the family.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Bertha "Bertie" Castillo, returned to the small, white
Whittier house where she used to crawl on the shag carpet and play
with Mama Rie.</TE>
<TE>   She handed Padilla a dozen yellow roses and said simply, "I'm
Bert."</TE>
<TE>   "You came," said Padilla, wrapping her arms around her 52-year-old
niece. Castillo's four other siblings also embraced Padilla, some of
whom she met for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   These siblings, the sons and daughters of Agnes Aguayo-Hayes and
James Hayes, have long been the missing branch of the 400-strong
Aguayo family.</TE>
<TE>   The clan, which unites every two years, had wondered for years
what happened to the Hayeses after their move to Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the seven Hayes siblings--Bertha Castillo, Priscilla
Adams, 60; Cindy Boling, 56; Marty Lucero, 46; and Trudy Moore,
44--hugged Padilla and her brother, Bill Aguayo, and met several
cousins for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that Grandma and Grandpa?" Lucero asked his cousins, gazing at
a faded, black and white picture. "Golly," he whispered, as his
cousins answered yes.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayes siblings were taken away from their sickly mother and
alcoholic father by the state of Kentucky. Some stayed in foster
homes, while others were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   They had managed to find each other by 1978 and have since kept in
touch, with the exception of Edna Hardy, 51, whom they can't find.
Another brother, Frank Kleier, 49, couldn't make it to Los Angeles
for the reunion.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the siblings, who are dispersed throughout the Midwest
and South, know nothing of their family's rich Latino history in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But there will be time for David Aguayo, 56, of Hollywood Hills,
the self-described "family historian" to tell them about Jose Maria
Aguayo, who immigrated to what is now the city of San Gabriel from
northern Mexico in 1865.</TE>
<TE>   There will be time for them to learn about their grandmother's
effort to regain land granted to the family by the Spanish government
in the 1840s but snatched away by oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to overwhelm them," said Aguayo. "They're getting
to know each other. It's going to take a long time for them to
process who we are."</TE>
<TE>   For now, they are starting with childhood memories, as the eldest
Hayes sister, Priscilla Adams, reminisces with cousin Roxanne
DeFabry, 66, of Hollywood Hills, about playing paper dolls and
imitating Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth.</TE>
<TE>   For now, uncle Bill Aguayo is remembering how Priscilla Adams
crawled around her crib "like a monkey."</TE>
<TE>   For now, it's about Mama Rie and Bertie by the backyard picnic
tables, hugging each other and not letting go for a long, long time.</TE>

<HD>Name Is Added to Judge Race Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: First the No. 2, now also the No. 3 primary
vote-getter will appear after incumbent Ronald Kline withdrew over
child sex charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County election officials have been ordered to add to the
November ballot the name of a Costa Mesa lawyer seeking to replace
disgraced Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline, who faces felony
child pornography and molestation charges.</LD>
<LD>   Before last week's ruling by Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley,
the election to succeed Kline looked a foregone conclusion. Only the
name of Dana Point attorney John Adams was to appear on the ballot,
after Kline's successful bid to withdraw from the race.</LD>
<LD>   But Woolley ordered the county's registrar to also include
attorney Gay Sandoval, the third-highest vote-getter in the March 5
primary, behind Adams and Kline. In the early 1980s, Sandoval worked
in the district attorney's office, where she prosecuted child
molestation cases and worked in the consumer protection and child
support enforcement units.</LD>
<TE>   Kline, who remains under house arrest pending the outcome of his
criminal cases, successfully argued that remaining on the ballot
could undermine his chances of receiving a fair trail. The
61-year-old jurist faces federal charges of possessing pornographic
images of children on his home and courthouse computers and state
charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy a quarter-century ago. He has
pleaded not guilty to all charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attempt to remove his name from the ballot had been given
little chance by most legal experts. Election law makes it difficult
for candidates to drop out, and judges have rarely ruled on the
issue.</TE>

<HD>State Is Found to Lead Nation in Use of Seat Belts</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHELE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If the rest of the nation attained California's seat-belt usage rate,
the lives of 600 teenagers 16 to 19 would be saved nationwide each
year, a top official with a national safety organization said.</LD>
<LD>   In a study released today, the Air Bag &amp; Seat Belt Safety
Campaign, which supports tougher restraint legislation, says that a
1993 California law has made a crucial difference in saving the lives
of teen drivers in the state. That law requires drivers to wear seat
belts and allows police officers to ticket them if they don't.</LD>
<LD>   Teenagers in California and the 17 other states with these
"primary" seat-belt laws--where police may stop drivers solely for
not buckling up--were more likely to be wearing belts during severe
crashes and thus were more likely to survive, the study indicates.</LD>
<TE>   The study estimated that, nationwide, 4,305 drivers between 16 and
19 years old survived crashes from 1995 to 2000 because they were
wearing seat belts. If 80% of the drivers in that age group had been
using seat belts during those same five years, 6,812 would have
survived.</TE>
<TE>   "As a nation, we pay an extremely high price for weak belt laws
that can best be measured in terms of teen fatalities," said Chuck
Hurley, executive director of the Air Bag &amp; Seat Belt Safety
Campaign, which is part of the National Safety Council.</TE>
<TE>   California boasts the nation's highest rate for seat belt use: In
2000, 89% of all drivers buckled up, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That compares with a
nationwide average of 71%.</TE>
<TE>   "If other states had California's rates, then 600 more lives of
16- to 19-year-olds would be saved each year," Hurley said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, just 26% of Californians regularly used seat belts,
prompting legislators to pass a "secondary" law, allowing police to
cite drivers for failing to wear belts if they were pulled over for
another offense. By 1992, officers were writing more than 550,000
seat-belt tickets a year. But after the more stringent "primary" law
took effect in January 1993, the number of seat-belt citations began
decreasing, dropping to 193,000 in 2000 as drivers buckled up to
avoid the $20 fine for a first offense and the $50 fine for a second.</TE>
<TE>   But, as with any rule or regulation, there are detractors.</TE>
<TE>   The National Motorists Assn. encourages seat belt use, but
condemns the mandatory buckle-up law.</TE>
<TE>   "We like seat belts; we'd like to see more sophisticated, more
comfortable belts," said Michael Nichols, executive director of the
group. "But primary enforcement is far too often used as a means to
an end, for pulling people over for nothing to do with safety."</TE>

<HD>Valley City Drawing Few Office-Seekers</HD>
<DH>Politics: Secession backers predicted that a flood of
candidates would appear on the ballot with cityhood. Interest also is
light thus far in Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three months after candidates for mayor and City Council of a
proposed San Fernando Valley city began filing papers to raise
campaign funds, the flood of contenders forecast by secessionists has
not materialized.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of Valley cityhood had predicted that as many as 150
candidates might be on the Nov. 5 ballot for 14 City Council seats
and a mayor's post, but so far only 24 have taken the first official
steps to launch campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Just one, Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), has filed
fund-raising papers to run for mayor. In the council races, only
seven districts have attracted more than one candidate. In two
districts, no one has filed.</LD>
<TE>   And while the filing deadline, Aug. 9, is nearly four weeks off,
the early dearth of candidates might underscore a peculiar problem
with the Valley offices: They will not exist if secession loses on
the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for the five council offices attached to the
Hollywood secession measure. As of Friday, only four candidates had
filed papers for them.</TE>
<TE>   A healthy crop of candidates is considered crucial to the
prospects of secession itself. The cityhood efforts are depending on
the individual campaigns for offices to generate excitement
about--and support for--breaking the Valley and Hollywood off from
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some local politicians, including Los Angeles school board member
Julie Korenstein, said they would have considered running if the
cityhood elections were held before those for the proposed Valley
city's mayor and council.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had separated the election, people in prominent positions
might be in a better position to make a decision to run," said
Korenstein. "As it is, it's an impossible situation."</TE>
<TE>   Pay might be another unattractive feature of the offices,
particularly in the Valley. For governing a city of 1.3 million
people, the mayor and council members would get a starting salary of
$12,000 a year. Valley cityhood backers say they would try to lift
the pay to $100,000 and $75,000, respectively, with a future ballot
measure if secession wins.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood council members would receive $9,600. They would be
part-time office-holders, however, in a city of 160,000.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leader Richard Close supports boosting the
salaries, but says the small paychecks could have the positive effect
of drawing candidates who are not career politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a higher caliber of individuals serving in office," said
Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Close said there is still plenty of time for a strong field of
candidates to emerge. Valley VOTE has drafted a list of 83 people who
are weighing a run, including some who have held an elective office,
he added, although he refused to disclose their names.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon the list I've seen, it will be a large group of highly
qualified people," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   To give candidates enough time to raise money, the city Ethics
Commission opened its filing period in April, about a month before
the secession measure was placed on the ballot. The county
registrar-recorder began allowing Valley candidates to fill out their
registration forms last week. Hollywood candidates are on a different
schedule for some filings, but they face the same Aug. 9 deadline for
getting on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The decision last week of state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) to
not run for Valley mayor was widely seen as a setback for the
secession movement. The separatists had hoped that Alarcon would draw
large numbers of Democratic and Latino voters to the cityhood cause.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from Richman, the only elected official who has expressed
tentative interest in the mayor's job is Los Angeles City Councilman
Dennis Zine, even though he has not taken a stand on secession.</TE>
<TE>   "He is still undecided," an aide said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley council races, the contenders with the highest
profiles are former Assemblywoman Paula Boland, former United
Chambers of Commerce Chairman Richard Leyner, and Scott Svonkin, the
chief of staff to Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   Others said some would-be candidates, especially Democrats, might
be leery of running because of threats by organized labor that it
would cut off all support for them. City unions fear secession would
cost their members jobs and pay raises.</TE>
<TE>   "We've said if they run for election in a city that doesn't exist
... we will not support them, not now and not ever," said Julie
Butcher, general manager of the Service Employees International
Union's Local 347, which represents Los Angeles municipal workers.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said labor leaders conveyed such a threat to Alarcon
before he decided not to run, but the legislator denied that the
pressure influenced him.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Larry Levine, chairman of the anti-secession group One
Los Angeles, said poll results showing secession winning in the
Valley but losing in Hollywood and citywide have scared off the
better prospects. For either to win, each breakup measure must carry
a majority of votes in the secession region and in the city as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have thought that there would be more candidates of
substance running for office if they thought this thing will pass,"
Levine said. "It may be a reflection that they think it's a waste of
time."</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood secession leader Gene LaPietra said his group is
getting many inquiries from people contemplating a candidacy.</TE>

<HD>Tobacco Lawsuit Fee: $1.25 Billion</HD>
<DH>Settlement: Four law firms in state are among dozens that
will share the California award. Dissenter says decision 'shocks the
conscience.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 60 law firms that helped California garner $25.4 billion as
part of a national cigarette litigation settlement will split $1.25
billion in fees, according to a national arbitration panel decision
obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The award, expected to be released today, was characterized as "a
full, reasonable fee" by the arbitration panel majority.</LD>
<LD>   Arbitrators John Calhoun Wells and Harry Huge, who formed the
majority, said that in reaching their decision, they had considered
the risks the lawyers assumed, the complexity of the case, the amount
of work performed and the attorneys' achievements.</LD>
<TE>   In sum, the majority said, the lawyers' efforts on a major lawsuit
were "an important contributor to a resolution of the tobacco war in
the most populous state in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   The suit was known as the "Davis/Ellis" case because the
plaintiffs were then Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and James Ellis, an Orange
County resident who contracted cancer after years of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the lawyers involved started working on tobacco litigation
in 1994, two years before the Davis/Ellis case was filed.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the panel said that if not for the efforts of these
lawyers, the $206-billion national tobacco settlement in November
1998 would never have been reached. The majority quoted a
tobacco-industry lawyer who likened industry worries about the
Davis/Ellis case and others set to go to trial in 1999 as a looming
"D-Day" and a key factor in the cigarette companies' decision to
settle.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Renfrew, a former federal judge whom the tobacco industry
nominated for the panel, issued a harsh dissent, saying the fee
"truly shocks the conscience." Renfrew also has issued dissents in
several other fee cases heard by the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Renfrew said that the lawyers were improperly awarded for work
they had done before the Davis/Ellis case. But the majority said that
the bulk of the work the attorneys had done was, in reality, "in
connection with" the Davis/Ellis case and that the award was
certainly reasonable "under the totality of the circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   The $1.25 billion amounts to about 10% of the state's $12.7
billion share from the national settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Cities and counties representing about 85% of California residents
received the other half of the $25.4 billion stemming from suits they
filed against the cigarette companies.</TE>
<TE>   Those suits, the Davis/Ellis case, and one filed later by
then-California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren were jointly settled in
December 1998 in San Diego, where the cases had been consolidated for
trial.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making the huge monetary award, the settlement
restricted tobacco marketing through a ban on billboards. The
cigarette companies also agreed to give up the use of cartoon
characters, such as Joe Camel, in advertising campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The latest fee award, though large, is considerably smaller on a
percentage basis than the fees awarded to lawyers who represented
Mississippi, Florida and Texas, three of the first states to sue the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Those attorneys garnered fees ranging from 19% to 34% of the
settlements won by those states.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it is twice as large as the $637 million
awarded by the same panel to nine law firms that represented the
cities and counties in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The award is well-deserved," said San Diego attorney Don Hildre,
who said he had done nothing but tobacco work from 1994 to 2001. He
said that the attorneys had collectively put in 400,000 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was the 19th ruling by the arbitration panel, which
was created as part of the national cigarette settlement. The fees
are to be paid out by the tobacco companies over the next 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   The panel has now awarded more than $13 billion in fees. Last
year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lambasted the size of the fee
awards, and the latest settlement appears likely to spur further
controversy over how much money some lawyers have made from tobacco
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an abomination," declared Mark Smith, a spokesman for
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the nation's third-largest
cigarette company. "These lawyers should be embarrassed," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said the award,
though huge, was "a whole lot less" than the 33% that plaintiffs'
lawyers generally obtain in contingency-fee lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis/Ellis award comes nearly a year after a lengthy New York
arbitration hearing in which the plaintiffs' lawyers mounted a
sophisticated campaign with broad, bipartisan support on why they
were entitled to a lot of money.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who weighed in on behalf of the plaintiffs' lawyers
were Gov. Davis; his onetime gubernatorial rival Lungren; Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah); former President Clinton; former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop; UC San Diego tobacco expert David Burns; Mississippi
Atty. Gen. Mike Moore, who filed the first case by a state against
the cigarette industry; and Harvard law professor Arthur Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Four California law firms will share the award--Casey, Gerry, Reed
&amp; Schenk of San Diego; Daughert, Hildre, Dudek &amp; Haklard of San
Diego; Howarth &amp; Smith of Los Angeles; and Robinson, Calcagnie &amp;
Robinson of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's firm contributed $143,000 to help Davis' successful
gubernatorial campaign in 1998 and has donated $260,000 to the
governor's reelection coffers since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Casey firm has contributed $30,000 to Davis since 1999 and the
Hildre firm $12,000 in the same period, according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   The other lawyers sharing in the award are from firms throughout
the country--including Arizona, Alabama, Louisiana, New York, New
Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Among the attorneys who will share in the award are high-powered
trial lawyers Russ Herman of New Orleans, former president of the
Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, and Scott Baldwin of Marshall,
Texas, along with Hugh Rodham of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the brother
of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Rodham has little trial experience but was considered a useful
political ally by the attorneys who formed the litigation team.</TE>
<TE>   Full details on how the fees will be divided were not available,
but John P. Coale, a spokesman for the attorneys, said that no firm
would get more than 10% of the total--meaning $125 million would be
the top share.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis/Ellis case grew out of a coordinated assault against the
tobacco industry launched by a group of plaintiffs' lawyers when they
filed the largest class-action suit in U.S. history in New Orleans in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that the major cigarette companies fraudulently
failed to inform consumers that nicotine is addictive and that they
manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to sustain their
addictive nature.</TE>
<TE>   The litigation team came to be known as the Castano group because
the lung cancer death of lawyer Peter Castano precipitated the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The group agreed to pay $100,000 apiece to set up a central office
with support staff, something that had never been done against the
tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the industry had never paid a dime in damages in 40
years of defending lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The national class-action suit was dismissed by a federal appeals
court in New Orleans in 1996. Then, the Castano group started filing
state cases throughout the country, including the Davis/Ellis case.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis sued just months after the Castano suit was thrown out in
1996. Davis joined the suit the following year.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration panel majority said the plaintiffs' lawyers
obtained millions of documents, conducted more than 100 depositions
and found key whistle-blowers. In his dissent, Renfrew suggested that
a court should review the arbitration award. But the majority
countered that it had acted well within the bounds of its authority.</TE>
<TE>   The leading California Supreme Court case on the issue, however,
is deferential to arbitration panels.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling, cited by the majority, said that before a court could
overturn a decision, it would have to find the panel's ruling to be
irregular or irrational.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Gillers, an expert on attorney fee issues, said he
doubted that a court would overturn the award if it were challenged.
"Both sides chose this route, and this presumptively is the right
result. There is no reason to suspect a sweetheart deal."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors to Consider Santa Rosa Road Project</HD>
<DH>Safety: Improvements would aim to slow traffic in an area
where a teen jogger was hit by a car and killed last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rural Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo would see a number of
improvements, including installation of a traffic light, in a
$324,000 project that goes before the Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A proposed new traffic signal at the intersection with Yucca Drive
is intended to slow traffic along the two-lane road heavily used by
motorists as an east-west alternative to the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Other safety improvements include cutting deep grooves along the
road's center and shoulders to warn drivers when they are drifting
from their lane. The so-called rumble strips create a noisy vibration
that alerts inattentive motorists.</LD>
<TE>   Additional signs warning motorists about speed, no-passing zones
and the presence of school bus stops would also be installed along a
three-mile portion of the highway if supervisors approve the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations by the county's Public Works Agency are an
outgrowth of community demands for change following the death last
year of a 14-year-old Camarillo girl who was jogging alongside the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Bonds was struck by a car as she turned to cross the
road. Law enforcement officials said the driver was not speeding and
did not cite him for any violations.</TE>
<TE>   But outrage over Jennifer's death prompted supervisors to look
into long-standing concerns about the road's safety. The board
convened a citizen's committee to work with county staff and make
recommendations on improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The changes that will be considered Tuesday are among the advisory
panel's priorities, said Ruth Means, who headed the committee.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a start and with Supervisor Frank Schillo's support,
we will continue to make improvements," Means said. "It's going to be
a long process."</TE>
<TE>   Schillo, whose Thousand Oaks district includes Santa Rosa Road,
said the proposed solutions make more sense than widening the
thoroughfare. Residents of the upscale horse community have made it
clear that they want it to remain a rural, two-lane road.</TE>
<TE>   "The county staff is so used to widening roads to make it easier
for people to speed through," Schillo said. "In this case, we did the
reverse."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition could arise to the staff's recommendation that Yucca
Drive homeowners pick up a portion of the traffic signal's cost
because the street is a private road. Public works staff is
recommending that each property owner be assessed $670 initially, and
$15 per year thereafter, to help pay for the light's installation and
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   County traffic funds would pick up the balance of the light's
$200,000 cost.</TE>
<TE>   Means, who does not live on Yucca Drive, said the county should
find a way to pay the entire cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Studies show that lights slow the traffic down," she said.
"Anyone who drives the road will be benefiting because it will be a
safer road."</TE>

<HD>They're Beating the Drum for Female Empowerment</HD>
<DH>Music: As they challenge gender stereotypes, Japanese taiko
ensembles are catching on with women, especially Asian Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When LizAnn Shimamoto was 12, her mother forced her to take an
etiquette class, where Shimamoto learned all the things a "good girl"
should be, how to be "ladylike" and "mild-mannered" and above all,
quiet.</LD>
<LD>   Now, at 39, Shimamoto yells.</LD>
<LD>   She yells while playing the odaiko, a drum roughly the size of a
refrigerator. She yells as if she's sending a message across the
Grand Canyon. She yells because it gives her a sense of power,
because it's fun and because it encourages her fellow
drummers--including daughters Amy, 14, and Grace, 11--to keep the
beat.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 18 performers in Shimamoto's group, Satori Daiko, 13 are
women. It's a breakdown reflected in Japanese drumming, or taiko,
groups across North America: About two-thirds of the roughly 150
taiko groups are composed of women, especially Asian American women.
Many of these women have snatched up bachi, or wooden drumming
sticks, to rediscover their roots--and to redefine their roles as
women.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing is contradictory to what a Japanese female has
traditionally been taught to do," said Shimamoto of Monterey Park.
"It's a mirror of what's happening culturally."</TE>
<TE>   Once "extremely meek and shy," Shimamoto plays taiko with a grin
on her face as wide as Julia Roberts'. She moves her feet wide apart.
She raises the bachi as if they were nunchuks and pounds the
cowhide-covered barrel. She pants. She sweats. And of course, she
belts out an occasional kake-goe, or yell, to support her daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Taiko-playing women like Shimamoto are reshaping anachronistic
images of the Asian woman as a "femme fatale" or "subservient
housewife," said fellow Satori Daiko member Deborah Wong. "In both
cases, Asian women's bodies are over-eroticized," said Wong, 42, an
ethnomusicologist at UC Riverside and author of an article titled
"Taiko and the Asian/American Body: Drums, 'Rising Sun' and the
Question of Gender."</TE>
<TE>   "Through performance, we're able to redefine the status quo ...
not by denying the body but by redefining the body in terms of
strength and discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Women taiko players are becoming more visible as Japanese drumming
edges into the mainstream, with about 150 performing groups
nationwide, said the Rev. Tom Kurai, director of the Montebello-based
Taiko Center of Los Angeles, home to Satori Daiko.</TE>
<TE>   Kurai's group has a jammed schedule that has taken it across
America and even to Japan. On Friday, members of Satori Daiko pounded
their taikos at home plate in Dodger Stadium, and they will perform
again during next weekend's Summer Japanese Festival in Torrance. The
flurry of practices and performances bonds the players. "They're like
family," Grace said.</TE>
<TE>   But taiko has become a cooperative effort only in the last few
decades. Historians believe the taiko, meaning "fat drum," was first
beaten thousands of years ago in Japanese villages to give the time
or signal imminent storms. Later, Buddhists also incorporated taiko
playing in temples.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, Daihachi Oguchi, a jazz drummer in Japan, dreamed up a
kumi-daiko, or taiko ensemble, but it wasn't until after Seiichi
Tanaka brought the concept to America in 1968 that more women started
banging on taikos, Kurai said.</TE>
<TE>   In kumi-daiko, the drums constitute an orchestra of percussion.
The rhythm wouldn't work without the small, high-pitched sumo-daiko
acting as a metronome, or the troop of midsized chu-daiko functioning
as a tenor instrument. But for crowd appeal, nothing beats the deep
boom of the big odaiko.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly appealing to many women who want to have the
social aesthetic of working together as a group," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   And seeing women empower themselves through cooperation nudges
others to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in a band, females didn't do percussion," said Harriet
Mizuno-Moyer, 50, who plays in Satori Daiko with her 13-year-old
daughter, Taylor Moyer. "I saw a taiko group and saw women, and I was
like, 'Wow, these women are playing the drums,' " Mizuno-Moyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Men recognize that, by wielding taiko sticks, women are recasting
outdated images. "It's an opportunity to break the rules," said
Antoine Gautier, 26, also in Satori Daiko. "There's a stigma against
women playing loud. Usually it's men on the drums."</TE>
<TE>   Younger women also seize on taiko's significance for gender
equity. For Michelle Fujii, 28, of Los Angeles-based On Taiko, it
means making sure that men participate in movement-oriented taiko,
which incorporates dance steps, and that women do such "male things"
as drum solos.</TE>
<TE>   At a practice in Sozenji Buddhist Temple in Montebello, Satori
Daiko's players dish out a flurry of shouts--a vocal improvisation
meant to unleash energy and signal camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   "Ho!" yells Shimamoto over the rumble. "Sa!" respond daughters Amy
and Grace.</TE>
<TE>   The music crescendos. It sounds like a stereo about to burst.</TE>
<TE>   And then, as if someone has flipped a switch, the thumping stops.
Smiles flash. Chests heave. Bodies bow. And there is silence.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Is Arrested in Slayings of 4</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man is described as acquaintance of Whittier
family. Investigators release grisly details of attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH and RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-year-old neighbor was arrested late Sunday in the slayings of a
South Whittier family of four, and investigators said they expect to
make additional arrests.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Ignacio Morales, whom investigators described as an
acquaintance of the Ruiz family, was arrested after detectives
received information from neighbors and collected unspecified
evidence from the home in the 10200 block of Gunn Avenue, according
to a sheriff's spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   "It's too early to talk about a motive," said Deputy Rick Varela,
a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "We are
narrowing the field of additional suspects and hopefully in that
process they will be able to detail a motive."</LD>
<TE>   Morales was being held at the Norwalk sheriff's station without
bail.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest came about six hours after Lt. Ray Peavy released
additional details about the nature of the attack, hoping that anyone
with information would come forward. Peavy said the four family
members underwent extreme suffering before they were stabbed to
death.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that 8-year-old Jasmin Ruiz, a bright child who
neighbors said had many playmates, was "brutally, sexually assaulted"
before her death. Her body, along with those of her mother, father
and great-grandmother, had been dragged from room to room, smearing
blood on the floor and across walls.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of the family said late Sunday that he had seen Morales
several times at the home and that Morales had sold the family a dog.
Morales lives in the immediate neighborhood and his family raises
dogs, according to the friend.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, victim Miguel Ruiz's sister, Olga, was seen taking
away a large boxer named Moisha and a small brown mutt named Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, 38, worked out of his home part-time doing computer repairs.
Investigators found a computer in a neighbor's backyard Saturday, and
family members told authorities that computer equipment was missing
from the home.</TE>
<TE>   Peavy said the crime appeared too cruel to have been part of a
robbery, but suggested that the house might have been ransacked to
conceal a different motive. "A mass murder did occur and a robbery
may have occurred," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The other victims were identified as Maritza Trejo, 41, and Miguel
Ruiz's grandmother, Ana Luisa Martinez, in her 70s. The Los Angeles
County coroner's office will perform autopsies, Lt. Fred Corral said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they believed that more than one person had
killed the victims because of the amount of damage inside the home
and the nature of the slayings. Sheriff's officials also said they
now believe the killings occurred between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The home was a hub for neighborhood kids, said Gail Baxter,
principal at Howard J. McKibben Elementary School, where Jasmin had
been named student of the month at least three times.</TE>
<TE>   "Jasmin was a very sweet, beautiful little girl," Baxter said.
"She was very smart--had a lot of friends at school. She was a top
student. The whole community--neighborhood--is in shock and in
mourning over this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Involved' Parents</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said Jasmin's parents had been "super involved" with her
education.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom dropped her off every morning. Dad was waiting for her to get
out of school at 2 p.m. every afternoon," Baxter said. "They were
really a model family, as far as the school was concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Ruiz, known as Mike in the neighborhood, was from Puerto
Rico and was remembered by neighbors as generous and helpful. He had
often bought hamburgers for local children and picked them up after
school. He also worked as a car stereo technician for his wife's
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he fixed his neighbors' computers without charge, and he
was known to dish out advice to younger people.</TE>
<TE>   "He would always give me guidance," said Hector Alvarez, a
next-door neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Maritza Trejo was a good cook who liked to make pupusas from her
native El Salvador. Each morning, without fail, said neighbor Jose
Jesus Hernandez, she set her husband's coffee down next to him at his
work station.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a beautiful woman," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Trejo worked hard, Hernandez said, sometimes six days a week,
selling electronic equipment from her brother's store at a local swap
meet.</TE>
<TE>   The family had rented the modest four-bedroom house for about five
years, according to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the home, leafy citrus trees cast a shadow on the
overgrown front lawn where Martinez, who was described as a pious
woman, often sat for hours watching neighborhood children at play.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said he and his family had heard no unusual noises on
Friday. The bodies were found Saturday morning by Trejo's 21-year-old
daughter, whom authorities declined to identify.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said he had last seen family members Thursday evening,
when they were sitting on their front porch and talking. Jasmin was
absorbed in reading a children's story, he remembered.</TE>
<TE>   "She came out with her book," Alvarez said. "She was so eager to
finish it."</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, Arlene Hernandez, 8, said she and Jasmin had
played together nearly every day. One of Jasmin's favorite pastimes
was handball, which the children played against their garage doors.
Arlene said she had often gone to the Ruiz home to play computer
games.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the crime was asked to call homicide
detectives at (323) 890-5572.</TE>

<HD>Long School Commutes Anger S.F. Asians</HD>
<DH>Education: Many students travel across town to promote
integration. A legislator has seized on the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Les Ho is 13 now, old enough to know that he had plenty of reasons to
fail. Instead, the boy who grew up speaking Chinese, the son of a
single, immigrant father, mastered the routine of public education,
often slogging through three hours of homework a night. He will begin
high school this fall with a tidy transcript of A's and Bs and
aspirations of becoming a doctor.</LD>
<LD>   Then he will begin a new routine.</LD>
<LD>   Denied admission to one of the city's best schools, just blocks
from his home on the west side of San Francisco, Les will rise early.
He'll dash off, catch the N Bus, then the 28, then the 30--an hour's
commute to an inferior school across town where he's been enrolled by
a computer.</LD>
<TE>   He is the future, many Asian Americans fear, of public education
in San Francisco. Often by design, but this spring because of a
computer glitch too, the city school district is sending scores of
students away from their schools of choice and across town to
campuses that they deem inferior.</TE>
<TE>   The shift has rekindled charges that Asian Americans, the majority
group at many top schools, are forced to shoulder the weight of
integrating and strengthening the city's troubled public schools.
Asian Americans have renewed charges that they are victims of their
own academic success.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Proposal Raises Fears</TE>
<TE>   And now a self-styled firebrand on the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors has supercharged the debate by raising the possibility of
splitting the city school district in half. The proposal has set the
city abuzz with fears that Supervisor Leland Yee and his supporters
are attempting to create two separate and unequal school
districts--in loose terms, one for Asians and whites, the other for
blacks and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Yee, a shoot-from-the-lip child psychologist who emigrated from
China at age 3, says he's merely trying to reduce red tape and make
one of the largest school districts in California more responsive to
parents and children.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, though, this Democrat and child of '60s protest is
fending off charges that his district breakup proposal may cripple
the long struggle to integrate schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This would mean disaster for just about everybody," said Michael
Harris, assistant director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil
Rights, a nonprofit law firm that has operated in the Bay Area for 30
years. "It just strikes me as being extraordinarily unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Yee insists that he's simply trying to represent the interests of
his constituents in a middle- and upper-middle-class district on the
west side of San Francisco. The region, near Golden Gate Park, is
known as the Sunset and is populated largely by Asian American
families.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco educators, he said, don't like to be
second-guessed--and have made him the target of unfair criticism
since this spring, when he first hinted at the possibility of
splitting up the school district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the institution," Yee said of the school system, sounding
more like the UC Berkeley student he once was than the vote-hungry
politician he's accused of becoming. "Whenever there is any attack on
that institution, they get their dander up, and they will distort and
do what they need to do to protect themselves."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yee has tapped into a deep bed of resentment among Asian Americans
in the fierce debate over how to properly shepherd one of the state's
most diverse school districts.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a computer program apparently botched its enrollment
program, sending hundreds of children either to the wrong school or
to no school at all. Many Asian American parents remain convinced
that their children made up the bulk of those affected by the glitch.</TE>
<TE>   To Asians and Pacific Islanders, who make up 35% of San Francisco
and 50% of the school district, it was a slap in the face. Reaction
to the glitch rapidly ballooned into full-fledged panic.</TE>
<TE>   One mother told community leader Jane Kwong that she was
considering committing suicide--thereby cashing in on a life
insurance policy that could go toward private school tuition for her
child, who didn't get into his neighborhood school.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parents Are Suspicious</TE>
<TE>   Many Asian American parents believe the school district is
shuffling their children around to boost test scores at bad schools
and make the district eligible for more grant money. School
administrators deny that.</TE>
<TE>   "This system punishes people who work hard, and they don't realize
how many real lives are being affected," Kwong said.</TE>
<TE>   Yee quickly stepped into the fray. He has asked the city
attorney's office to study the legal possibilities of not only
splitting the school district in half, but of allowing the city to
take over the school system.</TE>
<TE>   Yee says nothing less than the survival of the public education
system is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "There were days when parents would just suck it up and send their
child to whatever school they were told," he said. "Now you have
better-educated parents with a little moxie, who say: 'If you don't
give me what I want, I will take my kid, I will work seven days a
week, and by golly I will get the best education available. And
that's in a private school.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The ruckus is the latest chapter in San Francisco's long debate
over how much weight should be placed on ethnicity when determining
where children should go to school.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its liberal reputation, San Francisco was no different
from most other cities across the country 25 years ago when it came
to segregation. Its best schools were typically left for white
students.</TE>
<TE>   A 1978 lawsuit by the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People forced a court decree that instituted busing and
overhauled staffs at poorly performing schools, which had been
largely attended by black students.</TE>
<TE>   The district also put in place a racial quota system, capping any
one ethnic group at either 40% or 45% of a student body, depending on
the school. That system, initially, was praised by civil rights
organizations as promoting diversity.</TE>
<TE>   But by the mid-1990s, the glow of the court victory had faded.
Latino and African American students were still dropping out at
alarming rates.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Americans became the majority in many schools, as many
whites began moving to the suburbs or placing their children in
private schools.</TE>
<TE>   But because of the quotas, some Asian Americans were having
trouble getting into their neighborhood schools. At the prestigious
Lowell High School, Chinese Americans became a dominant majority of
the student body. To maintain the balance mandated by the NAACP
consent decree, officials required Chinese Americans to score higher
on standardized tests than other ethnic groups to gain admission to
Lowell.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Chinese American families filed a lawsuit claiming that
racial balancing violated their rights. San Francisco agreed to stop
using race to place students in classrooms. Instead of quotas, school
administrators began relying on other factors to place students,
including test scores and a broad definition of "merit"--community
service, family income and "ability to overcome hardship."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yee has not heard back from the city attorney's office about his
school district splitting proposal and says it could be months before
he does. Most analysts believe his plan is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a new school district cannot be created if it
will increase the cost of educating children or increase segregation.
School administrators believe Yee's proposal would fail on both
counts. The plan would also have to be approved by the local and
state boards of education, which is not likely.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with outrage from across the school district--some from
Asian American leaders--Yee seems to be backpedaling. Last month, he
joined the rest of the Board of Supervisors to unanimously approve a
resolution--entirely symbolic and nonbinding--calling for a single,
unified school district.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Political Motives Seen</TE>
<TE>   Many remain confounded by Yee's proposal and believe its roots lie
in the murky pool of politics.</TE>
<TE>   Yee recently won the Democratic primary for a state Assembly seat,
and will compete against Republican Howard Epstein in the November
general election. Yee's prospective district would include much of
the Sunset neighborhood--home of most of the parents upset over the
treatment of Asian Americans--and many believe he is pandering for
votes. Others feel Yee may be floating the proposal to draw attention
to his would-be successor, another Chinese American politician, Ed
Jew.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, amid all the contorted debate over race, diversity and
politics in San Francisco are the underlying realities that have made
the issue so emotional for many Asian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   To John Ho, a plant operations engineer at an Oakland hospital,
it's about the fact that his son, Les, can't get in to his
neighborhood school. Can't go to school with his friends. Won't be
home in time to help his father, who is disabled, around the house.</TE>
<TE>   It's about the fact that, right or wrong, Les believes he's being
targeted because of his ethnicity--that his hourlong commute isn't
designed to improve his education, but someone else's.</TE>
<TE>   "I work hard. I pay my taxes," John Ho said. "I want to know why
my kid can't go to school in my neighborhood. That's it."</TE>

<HD>Defense Seeking Greater Latitude</HD>
<DH>Politics: Pentagon finds some of the oversight by Congress
is a burden and inefficient. The war on terrorism might help in
efforts to change rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is pushing a series of sweeping
proposals that would weaken congressional oversight of the Pentagon
and give the military more freedom to manage itself than ever before.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon has proposed eliminating requirements for filing
hundreds of reports on its activities to Congress every year.
Pentagon officials also are drafting proposals to ban strikes by
contract workers, eliminate federal personnel rules protecting
civilian workers at the Pentagon and bypass environmentalists in
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Some proposals are more provocative. They include allowing the
Pentagon to send its initiatives directly to Capitol Hill before
other agencies could review them. Once there, the legislation would
require Congress to vote quickly, with only limited debate.</LD>
<TE>   That "defense streamlining initiative" was quickly shelved after
objections from officials within the administration itself, who
decried the seeming chutzpah of a Pentagon trying to avoid the normal
reviews. Drafted by the Office of Management and Budget at Rumsfeld's
request, senior administration officials say it is far from
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, administration officials say it is part of a grander plan
that is very much in play--to relieve the Pentagon, and later other
executive branch agencies, from oversight that Rumsfeld calls
burdensome and inefficient, but which critics say is a necessary
inconvenience of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals, said a senior Defense official who spoke on
condition of anonymity, are "the tip of the iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as an abdication of oversight, but it's time to
talk seriously about, in effect, resetting the table," the senior
official said. "We have an unprecedented challenge ahead of us in
fighting terrorism, and it's time for a longer-term discussion about
roles and visions between the branches of government."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's Pentagon is not likely to gain passage of any plan that
significantly weakens congressional oversight, political leaders say.
But the war on terrorism has given Rumsfeld a powerful platform, and
his aides believe they can grab more control than the Defense
Department has ever had.</TE>
<TE>   And the proposals are testimony to the ambitious agenda of an
administration that believes there are too many strings binding the
powers of the executive branch and preventing sensible management of
the federal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, the proposals have already raised eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these oversight devices have not sprung from the
imagination of an overzealous Congress. They have a history" in the
defense buildups of the Vietnam and Reagan eras, said Rep. John M.
Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House
Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "They came from the need for greater oversight on our part and
greater clarity on the part of the [Defense Department]. As you spend
more money and you spend more money on new systems, you want more
oversight of those systems, more baselines to measure against, not
fewer. It's of concern to me that this administration is asking for
more money but less accountability."</TE>
<TE>   The Rumsfeld Pentagon is hardly the first to complain about
Congress. In an agency so immense, with a budget so vast, the tension
between efficiency and oversight is persistent and inevitable. Every
new administration vows to do something about it.</TE>
<TE>   But the current effort stands out in several regards, according to
senior administration officials and defense analysts.</TE>
<TE>   It is driven by an administration that has been loath to share
information with Congress and the public and has openly chafed at
oversight, fueling suspicions about its motives on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Although previous Pentagon efforts have focused on cutting red
tape and changing internal management practices, this initiative is
part of a larger administration-wide effort to fundamentally alter
the relationship between executive branch agencies and Congress,
senior administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest was not restricted to DOD. The vice president was
interested. The president was interested. But Secretary Rumsfeld did
yeoman work in raising the attention level on a lot of concerns,"
said NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, who as deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget until last year was the point man on
the initiatives that circulated among agencies last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the administration's sweeping agenda for change cries
out for more oversight, not less.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that there are a lot of unnecessary reports to
Congress that are a pain in the neck and don't really mean much,"
said Cindy Williams, former director of national security studies for
the Congressional Budget Office. "On the other hand, this is an
administration that for a year and a half has been consistently
secretive about everything, and has a record of trying to preserve
their secrets even from people within the government who should know
them, so this has to be seen within that context."</TE>
<TE>   For Rumsfeld, the context is necessity. Although the war on
terrorism has allowed him to highlight the military's strengths,
aides say he hopes his most lasting legacy will be trimming
congressional oversight of the Pentagon and reforming how the Defense
Department manages itself.</TE>
<TE>   Deeply influenced by his experience as a business executive,
Rumsfeld has repeatedly objected to the bureaucracy he says hampers
action at the Pentagon. His concerns range from the mundane to the
essential. He has called for an end to the lengthy financial
disclosure statements he is required to file, for example, and
expressed dismay at the time his employees spend answering to
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   A nettlesome Congress is not Rumsfeld's only target. At his
direction, Pentagon Comptroller Dov Zakheim is spending $100 million
to try to clean up the department's famously muddled and inefficient
financial management system. Other senior Pentagon officials are
trying to reform the agency's outmoded methods for acquiring weaponry
and equipment and for managing its work force.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department has more than 1,100 accounting systems,
many of which don't communicate with each other, Zakheim said. The
Pentagon estimates that instituting a new financial management system
could save $18 billion to $30 billion a year. Just by paying its
operating bills on time, Zakheim says the Pentagon could save tens of
millions of dollars in interest a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we are mismanaging the money. After all is said and
done, ask the Taliban if we're mismanaging our money," Zakheim said.
But "in terms of the ability to get the right information to the
right level at the right time so we can make the right kinds of
decisions, we don't have it right now."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld and his aides say they can do only so much to clean up
their own house when they are under the congressional thumb.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we engage this discussion without sounding like the
Pentagon whining to the Hill about, 'Leave us alone, we just want to
do our own thing?' " asked a senior Pentagon official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "The question is, should the secretary of
Defense have flexibility given changing circumstances to consider
rearranging the executive management of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense? One would say, yeah."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, they are trying to convince Congress to eliminate
many of the more than 340 annual reports on everything from the
Pentagon's child-care center to its foreign military aid programs.
The reports tie up Pentagon staffers but often go unread on Capitol
Hill, Zakheim said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's concerns have not fallen on deaf ears. Last week,
the House voted in its 2003 defense spending bill to eliminate 20
reports it has long required the Pentagon to file.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a start," said Pete Geren, a former Republican congressman
from Texas who is now special assistant to the secretary of Defense
for legislative affairs. "The secretary sees these reports as
indicative of the lack of trust between these two bodies. We want to
reestablish that trust and get rid of the reports."</TE>
<TE>   But calling for less oversight and more money at the same time is
guaranteed to rankle watchdogs in Congress. The House and Senate are
on track to give the Pentagon close to the $400 billion it wants for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, do we need all these reports? No, but we actually need
better reports than we're getting," Spratt said. "I'm willing to work
with them on anything like this, but gee whiz, when they're asking
for $400 billion, we have the right to ask for an accounting as they
proceed to spend it."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is also battling to exempt the military from key
provisions of environmental legislation. The Pentagon wants
exemptions under the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and hazardous waste laws. The military has
long argued that environmental regulation inhibits critical training
at bases across the country and offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Pentagon has been pushing Congress to give it more
freedom to create executive positions without congressional
approvals, which have been slow in coming.</TE>
<TE>   Still on the drawing board at the Pentagon is a politically
explosive proposal to bypass federal personnel rules that protect
civil servants. Pentagon officials say 40% to 50% of the Pentagon's
civilian work force is eligible for retirement in the next seven
years, providing a perfect opportunity to revamp a personnel
management system they call outdated.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, for example, is seeking freedom to offer higher
salaries to talented applicants and pay raises to top performers as
part of a merit-based management system that would replace existing
civil service regulations.</TE>
<TE>   But they are not asking for more money for salaries overall,
meaning pay raises for some would translate into pay cuts for others.</TE>
<TE>   The existing rules aim to shield career government employees from
political influence, granting many of them collective bargaining
rights and other protections.</TE>
<TE>   "To have people, who through no fault of their own have not been
picked as a star, forgo annual pay raises in order to give big pay
raises to the flavor of the week? It's not right," said Jacque Simon,
director of public policy for the American Federation of Government
Employees, which represents much of the Pentagon's civilian work
force.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said that of all the proposals, it is the
defense streamlining initiative and others circulated last summer
that met the fiercest objections.</TE>
<TE>   Under one draft of the proposal, Pentagon legislation on
administration and personnel issues, arms exports, maintenance of
military depots and "defense environmental accountability" would be
sent directly to the armed services committees, limiting perusal by
other interested committees. The committees would have 15 days to
consider the legislation. The draft legislation called for limiting
debate and the use of procedural motions when considering the bill.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keefe said the administration pulled back on the proposal after
some administration lawyers brought up concerns that it would be
unconstitutional and after "spirited discussions" with congressional
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's deep back burner, is my sense," said one senior defense
official of the initiative. The official said consensus within the
administration is that getting such a proposal through Congress now
would be "too hard."</TE>

<HD>SEC Chief Insists He Won't Quit</HD>
<DH>Business: Also, new evidence points to questionable
WorldCom practices as early as 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amid accusations that the White House has failed to act aggressively
to clean up corporate accounting abuses, the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey L. Pitt, on Sunday
defended the administration's performance and said he would not
resign.</LD>
<LD>   For their part, Democrats called for President Bush to "restore
integrity to the White House" by releasing information on his 1990
sale of stock in a Texas oil company before it announced a
significant decline in earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The verbal jousting came on the eve of today's Senate vote on a
far-reaching accounting reform bill that seeks to address reports of
financial irregularities in some of the largest U.S. firms.</LD>
<TE>   Those revelations continued Sunday with the disclosure of evidence
that WorldCom Inc. had engaged in fraudulent accounting practices in
2000, earlier than suspected last month when nearly $4 billion in
accounting irregularities led the SEC to file fraud charges against
the communication giant.</TE>
<TE>   The documents, released by House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), also showed that employees
challenged the company's accounting and, in one case, raised those
concerns with outside auditor Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials have suggested that WorldCom Chief Financial
Officer Scott Sullivan was to blame for the financial irregularities,
and they claim important information was withheld from auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is way beyond aggressive accounting. This is Fraud 101,"
Tauzin said on ABC's "This Week." His committee is investigating the
accounting at several major companies, including WorldCom, Enron
Corp. and Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, one of American's largest corporations, Coca-Cola,
announced that it would begin treating stock option grants made to
employees as an expense, an action that many financial
observers--including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
investor Warren Buffett, Coca-Cola's largest individual
shareholder--say would offer a fairer assessment of a company's
financial picture.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the accounting scandals that have caused economic
and political jitters from Wall Street to Washington, Pitt on Sunday
took aim at his critics, denouncing their "politically crass sound
bites."</TE>
<TE>   He defended the SEC, saying the agency is investigating a
"staggering" number of corporations. He did not specify how many
cases of corporate wrongdoing are under investigation. But he said
the agency would get a better gauge of problems "lurking out there"
after an Aug. 14 deadline for the heads of the largest public
companies to certify the accuracy of their financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   "I have absolutely no intention of stepping down," the nation's
top securities regulator told CBS' "Face the Nation." "I believe I
enjoy the confidence of the president, and I'm certain if I don't,
he'll let me know."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) renewed his call for Pitt's
resignation, contending that the SEC chairman's past work as a lawyer
for the accounting industry makes him unsuitable for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We have now a crisis of confidence on the part of the American
investor," McCain told NBC's "Meet the Press." "That confidence can
only be restored by individuals whose records are completely
untainted by any charge or allegation of conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt called renewed scrutiny of Bush's 1990 sale of stock in a
company of which Bush was a director "ancient history."
Then-businessman Bush sold the Harken Energy Corp. stock shortly
before the company reported a sizable loss.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the matter had been
thoroughly investigated and is now closed. But he said he would make
the SEC file public at the president's request.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) urged Bush to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   "This president ran on the idea that he was going to restore
integrity to the White House, that he would be forthright with the
American people," Edwards told CNN's "Late Edition." "He has an
opportunity now to prove that."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) agreed. "I don't know that
anything illegal happened, but there are a lot of things you can do
that are legal but very wrong," he told ABC's "This Week." "It is
critically important that the president of the United States, in
following through on the strong language that he spoke on Wall Street
earlier in the week, open up the files and let the American people
see what was there."</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans defended Bush, dismissing
continuing talk about the stock sale as "nothing but political
garbage that the American people are sick and tired of."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to one high-profile case, Pitt vowed that the SEC would
"follow the trail wherever it leads" in its probe of accounting
practices at Halliburton Co., a Texas-based oil services business
that Vice President Dick Cheney once led.</TE>
<TE>   "No one gets a pass," he said.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), however,
suggested that Pitt remove himself from any involvement in the
Halliburton probe.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said he believes the accounting problems are the work of a
"few rotten apples." But he also pledged that the SEC "is going to go
after these people, and people who do hard crime will do hard time."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who drafted the Senate
accounting bill, said: "It's not just a few bad apples who need to be
severely punished.... The system is not working right." He called on
the president to get behind the legislation in "a very strong way."</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes' bill would establish an independent accounting oversight
board to replace the accounting industry's self-policing approach to
discipline. It would also establish new penalties for corporate fraud
and new financial disclosure requirements for public companies.</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing with many of the goals of Sarbanes' bill, the White
House has expressed concern that it could create a turf war between
the new board and the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan group of senators plans today to try to strengthen
the bill further.</TE>
<TE>   McCain and Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) have pushed to require
companies to deduct from earnings the value of stock options awarded
to executives. They hope to get a vote on an amendment that would
refer the politically hot issue to the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, which writes rules for the accounting profession.</TE>
<TE>   But they face stiff opposition from business groups, which fear
such a move could slash bottom-line earnings across the corporate
landscape as well as jeopardize one of corporate America's most
popular forms of compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem, in my opinion, is not stock options, but the way in
which a small group of greedy and unethical corporate executives used
stock options," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes' legislation also calls for increasing the SEC budget.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt praised Bush's call for the SEC to receive $100 million more,
but he was more cautious in endorsing bipartisan legislation that
would give the agency $300 million more. "I support more money, but I
also support responsibility," he said. "Somebody has to do a study
first."</TE>
<TE>   In the WorldCom case, five boxes of documents provided to Tauzin's
committee on Thursday--the deadline for receipt of records from the
Clinton, Miss.-based company--showed that on several occasions,
employees raised issues about the fraudulent accounting with senior
WorldCom executives, who dismissed their concerns. The company has
acknowledged improper accounting of nearly $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, for example, finance employee Troy Normand was so
distressed by the company's accounting practices that he considered
leaving the company. He went to chief financial officer Scott
Sullivan and comptroller David Myers with his fears, but "they all
assured him, 'Oh, everything's fine,' " Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   Normand asked for a severance package but was refused, Tauzin
said. "He knows his corporation is going downhill and he,
unfortunately, is watching as they're cooking the books in front of
him."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin noted, "There's quite an insight in these documents as to
how corporate greed took over."</TE>
<TE>   In another document described by Tauzin, WorldCom employee Stephen
Brabbs, who managed the company's European and Asian accounts, says
he told people at Arthur Andersen about an improper $33-million
reduction of expenses in the international division in the spring of
2000--made by his U.S. bosses after he had closed the books.</TE>
<TE>   When Brabbs told his WorldCom superiors that he had informed
people at Andersen, his bosses got upset and Sullivan exerted
pressure, Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   "This Week" anchor George Stephanopoulos quoted from a Brabbs'
letter: "Pressure was exerted, and we were instructed to make the
entry. This pressure, we understood, was from Scott's office
specifically."</TE>

<HD>Suspicious House Fire Kills 4 Children in Ohio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOLEDO, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A fire swept through a house on the city's east side early Sunday,
killing four children ages 3 to 17, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the fire had not been determined, but it was
suspicious, said Sgt. Tim Noble, a police investigator. He said the
deaths were being treated as homicides.</LD>
<LD>   Little of the house was left standing aside from parts of the
outside walls. Firefighters and investigators used rakes and shovels
to sift ashes on the front porch, trying to locate the fire's origin.</LD>
<TE>   "It sure seems like it went up in a hurry," Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   The home's owner had escaped after the blaze started and put a
ladder up to a second-floor window, but the flames prevented him from
getting closer to the house, said neighbor Sarah Palichuk.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could hear was screaming," said Palichuk, who lives across
the street in this working-class neighborhood. "There was no way
nobody could get out. I just wish there was more I could have done."</TE>
<TE>   Fire Chief Mike Bell said he didn't know whether the children who
died were related to each other or to the home's owner.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Debbie Koepfler said she rushed out of her home after the
noise from the fire woke her. "We just couldn't help them," she said.
"We couldn't even get in the street because it was too hot."</TE>

<HD>In Era of Mass Investment, Wall St. Would Be Wise to
Embrace Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the stock market crashed in 1929, fewer than one in 80 Americans
owned stocks. Today at least half--and probably as many as
two-thirds--of American households own stock. More Americans have
more at stake in the rise and fall of the stock markets than ever
before.</LD>
<LD>   That broad social change is providing the fuel for the political
firestorm over Enron Corp., WorldCom and the other scandals in
corporate America. It's difficult to imagine that accounting
regulation and balance sheet fraud would be attracting nearly so much
attention from the president, Congress and the media if only a
relatively narrow elite still owned equities. And this may be just
the start. It's a fair bet that the trend toward mass investment will
raise issues well beyond the arguments over securities regulation now
consuming Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The migration of Americans into the markets has already changed
the balance of power on those regulatory issues. For years, the
securities and accounting industries fought off tougher government
oversight--often enlisting legislators from both parties to beat back
federal regulators they considered too zealous. The handful of
institutional investor advocates on the other side of those
battles--like the effort by the Clinton-era Securities and Exchange
Commission to bar accountants from consulting for the companies they
audit--were overmatched.</LD>
<TE>   That was partly because average investors remained almost entirely
uninterested in reform while the markets were levitating in the
1990s. Indeed, in recent years many conservative theorists predicted
that the growing investor class would ally with corporate management
for small-government, low-tax, less-regulation policies. Instead,
against the backdrop of scandal and the drooping Dow, investors have
become a force for more government regulation of the markets.</TE>
<TE>   As a matter of broad philosophy, polls show that investors--who
are, not surprisingly, more affluent than the public overall--are
generally skeptical of big government. But polls also suggest the
wave of corporate scandals has caused investors to see themselves as
consumers who expect government protection from manipulation and
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   That's created a much broader constituency for securities and
accounting reform. Last week's resounding Senate votes for new
oversight were driven partly by the intense media focus on the
scandals, but also by legislators' fear of appearing to side with
management against small investors. "These are voters now" getting
hurt, says Ann Yerger, research director at the Council of
Institutional Investors, an alliance of big pension funds that has
long fought these fights. "It is a little more impersonal when it is
an institutional investor suffering the losses."</TE>
<TE>   In the months and years ahead, the cloud over Wall Street may also
change the dynamic on other issues that are more tangible to average
families than accounting or corporate governance reform--like Social
Security and pensions.</TE>
<TE>   The bull market of the 1990s muted debate over a profound change
in the American retirement system: the increased reliance on the
stock market to fund private pensions. Traditionally, Americans who
received work pensions were guaranteed a fixed monthly payment when
they retired. But since the early 1990s, more workers have been
guaranteed only a regular contribution from their employer to an
investment account that they manage.</TE>
<TE>   That increased dependence on 401(k) plans looked like a good deal
when stocks were soaring. But falling stock prices, and rising
allegations of scandal, may generate demands for pension security and
portability that go well beyond the limited measures (focused on
discouraging workers from relying too heavily on their employers'
stock) the Senate will debate in a bill this year.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the mess on Wall Street may recast the debate over
Social Security. Through the 1990s, rising stock prices and
broadening ownership were wind in the sails of Republican proposals
to partially privatize Social Security by diverting part of the
payroll tax into accounts that workers could invest in the stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   Workers who received quarterly statements showing their 401(k)
plans defying gravity understandably itched to also take a plunge
with their Social Security taxes. But betting on Wall Street to fund
Social Security may appear less attractive now that stock prices are
sinking and the markets are looking like a casino rigged for the
house.</TE>
<TE>   Even small investors have grown accustomed enough to market
fluctuation that most experts don't expect the Dow's downward slide,
or even the wave of scandals, to reverse the long-term trend toward
broader stock ownership. That's a good thing: The willingness of
average Americans to invest helped provide the capital that fueled
the growth of the 1990s. It wasn't long ago that experts considered
the ability of American entrepreneurs to raise capital and start a
business a critical U.S. advantage over Japan and Europe. The boom
wasn't all bubble: It also funded technological breakthroughs that
helped propel the broadest advance in living standards in years.</TE>
<TE>   But the scandals and sliding stock prices are usefully
highlighting the value of providing ordinary families with financial
assets secure from the turbulence of the markets. With average
Americans already so reliant on the markets for their
well-being--largely through the rise of 401(k) plans--the chaos on
Wall Street ought to raise a yellow flag for those who would make
them more reliant yet by partially privatizing Social Security. The
system has always worked best not as a lottery ticket, but as a storm
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the best way to guarantee that average Americans
remain willing to invest is to ensure them the markets aren't a
fool's game. Wall Street has profited enormously by attracting Main
Street into the exchanges. But the price may be to end the club-like
arrangements that allowed the securities industry to largely set its
own rules. With so many people now invested in the markets, those
cozy arrangements have become unsustainable. The new rules descending
on Wall Street may be the first reforms driven by the era of mass
investment. But they are unlikely to be the last.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM STATEN ISLAND, N.Y.</KH>
<HD>Borough's Push for Secession Smolders</HD>
<DH>Government: Although largely content, Staten Island may
think again of splitting from New York City if a mammoth landfill
reopens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley is, as secessionists believe, Los Angeles'
abused stepchild, Staten Island is more of an afterthought to New
York.</LD>
<LD>   The most remote of New York's five boroughs--a half-hour ferry
ride from Manhattan--and the smallest in population with 440,000
souls, Staten Island is politically and culturally left-footed as
well: a Republican bastion in a Democratic city, a rolling landscape
of split-level homes with driveways instead of high-rise apartment
buildings. The inhabitants aren't easily riled--Staten Island was the
site of the Revolutionary War's only peace conference--but they do
harbor grievances.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, beneath its tranquil surface, Staten Island is a
tinderbox of separatist passion, say those who understand the
island's nature. And New York City's perpetual garbage crisis--met
recently with calls to reopen Staten Island's Fresh Kills
Landfill--may just provide the spark to set it off anew.</LD>
<TE>   Since former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani closed the landfill last
year, Gotham has struggled to find a home for its 10,000 tons of
garbage produced daily. For now, the city spends a bundle to truck
its garbage out of state, and some consider the issue one of the most
important facing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   Just this weekend, the New York Times editorialized that it was
"irresponsible" of Giuliani to have closed the landfill without a
workable alternative for New York's trash. The newspaper called on
Bloomberg to reopen the landfill "on a temporary basis."</TE>
<TE>   Long Fight Over Landfill</TE>
<TE>   From Staten Island's perspective, even the suggestion threatens to
reopen a generations-old wound. Islanders had been fighting to close
Fresh Kills--reputedly the only man-made object, other than China's
Great Wall, that can be seen from space--since the mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence DeMaria, president of the Staten Island Chamber of
Commerce and a 40-year resident of the island, said that reopening
Fresh Kills wouldn't just rekindle the secession movement, it would
lead to "civil disobedience." DeMaria said he can think of several
otherwise law-abiding matrons in his neighborhood who would chain
themselves to the landfill fence in protest.</TE>
<TE>   Staten Island's secessionist movement got rolling in the early
1990s over issues similar to those that irritate Valley residents:
The city government, meeting in a distant downtown, seems
unresponsive to local concerns about schools and zoning. Staten
Islanders complain that they have little control over development,
and as a result, the island is a mishmash of commercial, industrial
and residential uses. The public schools, even down to the
appointment of principals and assistant principals, are run from
afar.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, islanders are used to being ignored by New York. The
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn, Staten Island's only physical
link to New York City, didn't open until 1964. "The lack of a bridge
allowed us to live in splendid isolation," said state Assemblyman
Robert A. Straniere, who can recall a boyhood spent roaming woods and
open fields where now there are industrial parks and housing
developments.</TE>
<TE>   The locals could tolerate New York's neglect well enough, but what
they couldn't abide was what secession activist Dan Singletary once
called being "dumped on." The Fresh Kills Landfill, the largest open
garbage dump on earth, was always the biggest rallying point for
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the secessionist movement peaked as the islanders
overwhelmingly approved an initiative to split from the Big Apple.
The proposal passed the state Senate, and then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
said he would have signed it into law. But the Assembly, backed by a
court ruling, blocked the move, arguing that all of New York City
should vote on the matter. The movement has been stalled since.</TE>
<TE>   Straniere, a 21-year veteran of the Legislature, considers himself
the keeper of the flame. In every Assembly session, he reintroduces
his Act to Incorporate the City of Staten Island, and in every
session, it dies in committee.</TE>
<TE>   The closing of Fresh Kills, which locals attribute to the
island-friendly alignment of three Republican politicians--Giuliani,
Gov. George Pataki and then-Borough President Guy Molinari--"took the
wind out of secession's sails," DeMaria said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the toughest obstacle faced by pro-secession forces may be
contentment.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani Was Benefactor</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani, aware of the island's overwhelming electoral support for
his campaigns, was careful to lavish money and attention there,
notably the renovation of the ferry terminal at St. George and the
construction of a minor-league ballpark for the Staten Island
Yankees. Bloomberg is fully aware that support from the
island--despite its representing only about 6% of New York's
population--was one of the biggest factors in his election in
November. It's too early to tell whether Bloomberg, also a
Republican, will follow Giuliani's lead in the care and feeding of
Staten Island; he has promised a proposed solution to his city's
trash problem by the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   But for now--as long as the landfill stays closed--islanders are
basking in their newfound status.</TE>
<TE>   "Secessionist sentiment is not overt at the moment," Straniere
admitted. "I guess I'm the last man standing in keeping the issue
alive."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Four volcanoes in the Andes--all previously considered dormant--are
active and are either bulging or deflating, according to a precision
satellite analysis of the volcanic range. Meanwhile, 50 volcanoes
classified as potentially dangerous are not moving at all, says an
eight-year analysis of 900 volcanoes in the remote central Andes
published in last week's issue of the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   One of the bulging volcanoes, Hualca Hualca, is in a heavily
populated region of southern Peru. Such deformation is often caused
by magma swelling within a volcano--a precursor to eruptions.</LD>
<LD>   The new study, said Caltech geophysicists Matt Pritchard and Mark
Simons, proves the worth of monitoring vast volcanic areas using
satellite surveys, which are more sensitive and easier to conduct
than conventional ground-based surveys.</LD>
<TE>   The authors suggest that the four active volcanoes they detected
be monitored for mudflows, landslides and gas emissions that can
accompany eruptions.</TE>

or "waterlock," that is used in disposable diapers to hold water.</LD>
<LD>   The polymer can trap as much as 800 times its own weight in
distilled water, or up to 300 times its own weight of tap water or

<HD>Predicting Aftershocks</HD>
<DH>Nature: A Caltech seismologist crafts a mapping system to
track where the most powerful incidents will occur within days of a
major earthquake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Within a few days of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Caltech
seismologist Egill Hauksson was able to predict with surprising
accuracy where years of aftershocks would occur.</LD>
<LD>   There were hundreds of them in that first week, mostly centered in
three areas: the northwestern San Fernando Valley near Chatsworth,
the northeastern Valley near San Fernando and the Santa Susana
Mountains between the Santa Clarita and Simi valleys.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years after Northridge, the quake has produced nearly 16,000
aftershocks, including 57 in the magnitude-4 range and 11 of
magnitude-5 or greater. Almost all of them were in the zones Hauksson
noted in those first days.</LD>
<TE>   Hauksson, working with a Swiss scientist, Stefan Wiemer, and Matt
Gerstenberger of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich,
has honed the method over the last eight years and has developed a
mapping system that can predict where the most powerful aftershocks
will occur within four days of a large quake.</TE>
<TE>   The forecasts rely on precise monitoring of the first aftershocks.
By tracking their number, size, distribution and location, Hauksson
and Wiemer say they can plot the shakes and shimmies beneath the
Earth's surface on a map showing specific areas where there is a high
probability of strong aftershocks.</TE>
<TE>   The method, outlined in an article appearing in a special issue of
the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America today,
represents a significant improvement over the current system of
aftershock prediction, which now only forecasts the strength and
frequency of aftershocks for a whole region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea to go from the statistics of aftershocks to
mapping out probable sites and the strength of ground motions," said
Andy Michael, a geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey at its
Western regional headquarters in Menlo Park. "They're doing a great
thing, but there is a question of reliability."</TE>
<TE>   Progress has definitely been made, said Tom Heaton, a professor of
earthquake engineering at Caltech. He said the authors "have brought
together existing technologies into a synthesis that gives our best
state-of-the-art estimate of aftershock likelihood. The change is
that it is specific as to location and offers a quantitative estimate
as to the strength of the impending shaking."</TE>
<TE>   The prediction of aftershocks has long been a tricky problem
because of its extreme complexity. Every earthquake is different, and
a long series of aftershocks can traverse varied terrain of different
soils, topography and fracture structures--all factors that can play
an important role.</TE>
<TE>   But such predictions are a crucial element in dealing with one of
nature's most violent and destructive forces. In the past,
aftershocks have often posed as serious a threat as the main shock of
an earthquake. For example, a magnitude-5.8 aftershock of the 1999
magnitude-7.4 quake in Izmit, Turkey, killed seven people and injured
420.</TE>
<TE>   Another example of a fatal aftershock occurred a month and a day
after the July 21, 1952, Tehachapi earthquake. This magnitude-7.7
temblor was followed on Aug. 22, 1952, with an aftershock near
Bakersfield that killed two people, injured 35 and did $10-million in
damage.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest aftershocks of big temblors are typically about one
order of magnitude lower than the initial quake, but they come when
buildings are already weakened.</TE>
<TE>   The authors said knowing where aftershocks are most likely to
occur can help emergency planners deploy building inspection and
recovery personnel to the most vulnerable areas.</TE>
<TE>   A better understanding of how stress triggers aftershocks in
certain directions from the "mainshock" has allowed the scientists,
once they know the dimensions of the aftershock zone, to calculate
where the strongest aftershocks will occur. The size of the original
quake, plus the size of the initial aftershocks, allows them to
calculate just how big they will be.</TE>
<TE>   They are then able to fashion maps of "probabilistic aftershock
hazard" that show, according to a color code, where the most
significant aftershocks are most likely to strike.</TE>
<TE>   The system has worked in the magnitude-7.3 Landers quake in 1992
and the 7.1 Hector Mine quake in 1999, but the authors readily
acknowledge that it remains to be tested in other big quake sequences
to be certain that it works consistently for all types of quakes.</TE>
<TE>   The system can be employed only in places such as California that
have extensive networks of quake monitoring stations already
installed, since it requires a very close delineation of where the
first aftershocks, even quite small ones, have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   A key element of the predictive system is the "rate of decay" of
the aftershocks, Hauksson said. The term refers to the falloff in the
number of aftershocks within that first period, day by day.</TE>
<TE>   This is an important clue to how many aftershocks may occur later
and how long the aftershock sequence will last. (In the Northridge
quake, the aftershocks are just now believed to be ending. There was
a significant swarm of aftershocks in January.)</TE>
<TE>   Some quakes have a more robust aftershock sequence than others.
Based on the monitoring data, Hauksson and his colleagues believe
they can make a reliable estimate of the 30-day hazard for further
aftershocks, and they can predict beyond then as aftershocks provide
more data.</TE>
<TE>   The direction in which a fault ruptures is also an important
indicator of where the most damaging aftershocks will occur. It is a
factor known as the "directivity" of the quake.</TE>
<TE>   Just because a ground rupture goes from south to north, as in the
Landers quake, doesn't mean that all the damaging aftershocks will be
to the north. Many of the strongest Landers aftershocks were to the
south of the epicenter. The most damaging, a magnitude-6.5 temblor in
the Big Bear area, was to the southwest of the epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in the magnitude-7.1 Hector Mine quake of 1999, the
biggest aftershocks occurred in the opposite direction from the
quake's southward rupture.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this is not altogether clear to the scientists, but
it is based on their observations of what happened after the Landers
and Hector Mine quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Both earthquakes were categorized as horizontal strike-slip
earthquakes on vertical faults--a kind of temblor in which one side
of the surface rupture slides in one direction and the other slides
in another.</TE>
<TE>   In the Northridge quake, the rupture was on what is known as a
dipping-thrust fault--a slanting rupture that rises from deep inside
the Earth like a kind of ramp.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the aftershocks were to the north of the epicenter, in the
same apparent direction as the rupture. But Hauksson said the proper
way to view the earthquake would be to look at the fault as if it
were turned on its side. From this perspective, the aftershocks
occurred in the opposite direction of the rupture.</TE>
<TE>   In the most striking illustration of this, the Weimer-Hauksson
team has provided a 30-day aftershock hazard map they developed for
the Hector Mine earthquake and superimposed on it the magnitude-4 and
5 aftershocks that occurred.</TE>
<TE>   All but one of these large aftershocks occurred within the areas
that had been identified as having the highest probability of such
aftershocks.</TE>
